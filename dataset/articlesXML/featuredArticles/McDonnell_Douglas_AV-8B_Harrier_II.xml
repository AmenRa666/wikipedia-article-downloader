The '''McDonnell Douglas''' (now '''Boeing''') '''AV-8B Harrier II''' is a single-engine [[ground-attack aircraft]] that constitutes the second generation of the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] family. Capable of [[V/STOL|vertical or short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]], the first operational V/STOL aircraft. Named after [[Harrier (bird)|a bird of prey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Searle, Adrian|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/28/tate-britain-fiona-banner1|title=Fiona Banner's toys for boys are a turn-on at Tate Britain|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 June 2010|accessdate=21 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022100907/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/28/tate-britain-fiona-banner1|archivedate=22 October 2013|quote=the Harrier is in any case named after a bird of prey.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from [[close air support]] of ground troops to armed [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. The AV-8B is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), the [[Spanish Navy]], and the [[Italian Navy]]. A variant of the AV-8B, the [[British Aerospace Harrier II]], was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].

The project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]] to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.

Following the withdrawal of the UK, [[McDonnell Douglas]] extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra [[hardpoint]] per wing, and other structural and [[aerodynamic]] refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its [[maiden flight]] in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through [[British Aerospace]], re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, [[Boeing]] and [[BAE Systems]] have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.

Typically operated from small [[aircraft carrier]]s, large [[amphibious assault ship]]s and simple [[forward operating base]]s, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and [[Humanitarian intervention|humanitarian operations]], proving themselves versatile assets. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the [[Gulf War]]. The aircraft took part in combat during the [[Iraq War]] beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II]], with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.

==Development==

===Origins===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|first-generation Harriers]] entered service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), but were handicapped in range and [[payload]]. In [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] configuration, the AV-8A (American designation for the Harrier) carried less than half the 4,000&amp;nbsp;lb (1,800&amp;nbsp;kg) payload of the smaller [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]], over a more limited radius.&lt;ref&gt;Donald and March 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; To address this issue, in 1973 Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began joint development of a more capable version of the Harrier. Early efforts concentrated on an improved [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]], designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by [[Bristol Siddeley]].&lt;ref name=Wilson_p26&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was too large by {{Convert|2.75|in|mm|sigfig=2|sp=us|abbr=on}} to fit into the Harrier easily.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p69-0&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1973, a joint American and British team completed a project document defining an Advanced Harrier powered by the Pegasus 15 engine. The Advanced Harrier was intended to replace the original RAF and USMC Harriers, as well as the USMC's A-4.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p69-0/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p41&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the Advanced Harrier was to double the AV-8's payload and range, and was therefore unofficially named AV-16. The British government pulled out of the project in March 1975 owing to decreased defense funding, rising costs, and the  RAF's insufficient 60-aircraft requirement.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eden 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;288.&lt;/ref&gt; With development costs estimated to be around [[Pound sterling|£]]180–200&amp;nbsp;million (1974 British pounds),&lt;ref&gt;''Flight International'' 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;762.&lt;/ref&gt; the United States was unwilling to fund development by itself, and ended the project later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the project's termination, the two companies continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering to the needs of the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designing and testing===
As the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–44, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|title=Is The AV-8B Advanced Harrier Aircraft Ready For Full-Scale Development?| date=30 January 1979|work=General Accounting Office| publisher=General Accounting Office |location=Washington, D.C.|page=1|oclc=4711266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;69–70, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson_p28&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer. The aircraft performed three vertical take-offs and hovered for seven minutes at [[Lambert–St. Louis International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flight International'' 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;1844.&lt;/ref&gt; The second aircraft followed on 19 February 1979, but crashed that November due to engine [[flameout]]; the pilot ejected safely.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Flight International'' 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;1743.&lt;/ref&gt; Flight testing of these modified AV-8s continued into 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The results showed greater than expected [[drag (physics)|drag]], hampering the aircraft's maximum speed. Further refinements to the aerodynamic profile yielded little improvement.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p28/&gt; Positive test results in other areas, including payload, range, and V/STOL performance, led to the award of a development contract in 1979. The contract stipulated a procurement of 12 aircraft initially, followed by a further 324.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p29&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:YAV-8B construction NAN11-78.jpg|thumb|A YAV-8B undergoes conversion from an AV-8A, and as such does not feature the raised cockpit found on AV-8Bs.|alt=Three-quarter black and white view of a jet aircraft undergoing construction]]
Between 1978 and 1980, the DoD and USN repeatedly attempted to terminate the AV-8B program. There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan. The USN declined to participate in the procurement, citing the limited range and payload compared with conventional aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1981, the program received a boost when [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p26/&gt; The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised by a large production run, and the fact that the US was shouldering the expense of development.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p26/&gt; Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and manufacturing by BAe at its [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] and [[Dunsfold]] facilities in [[Surrey]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Gaines 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]].&lt;ref name=Wilson_p26/&gt; The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.&lt;ref&gt;''Flight International'' 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;705.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four full-scale development (FSD) aircraft were constructed. The first of these ([[United States military aircraft serials#United States Navy and Marine Corps|BuNo]] 161396), used mainly for testing performance and handling qualities, made its maiden flight on 5 November 1981, piloted by Plummer.&lt;ref&gt;''Flight International'' 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;1456.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third FSD aircraft, which introduced wing [[Leading-edge extension|leading-edge root extensions]] and revised engine intakes, first flew in April the following year; the fourth followed in January 1984.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p29/&gt; The first production AV-8B was delivered to the [[Marine Attack Training Squadron 203]] (VMAT-203) at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] (MCAS Cherry Point) on 12 December 1983,&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p59&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; and officially handed over one month later.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the initial batch of 12 was delivered in January 1985 to the front-line [[Marine Attack Squadron 331]] (VMA-331).&lt;ref name=Wilson_p29/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p61&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine used for these aircraft was the F402-RR-404A, with 21,450&amp;nbsp;lb (95.4&amp;nbsp;kN) of thrust; aircraft from 1990 onwards received upgraded engines.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p29/&gt;

===Upgrades===

During the initial pilot conversion course, it became apparent that the AV-8B exhibited flight characteristics different from the AV-8A. These differences, as well as the [[Digital data|digital]] cockpit fitted instead of the analog cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p76-7&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted to the development of a two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p76-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson_p39/&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to Lon Nordeen, the first TAV-8B flew on 21 November 1986.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p60&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;}} This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p76-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p60/&gt; the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p39&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;

With export interest from Brazil, Japan, and Italy serving as a source of encouragement to continue development of the Harrier II, McDonnell Douglas commenced work on a night-attack variant in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Grove 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of an infrared sensor and cockpit interface enhancements&lt;!--HUD, FLIR, NVG--&gt;,&lt;ref name=Elliot_p56&gt;Elliot 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; the 87th production single-seat AV-8B became the first Harrier II to be modified for night attacks, leaving the McDonnell Douglas production line in June 1987. Flight tests proved successful and the night attack capability was validated. The first of 66 AV-8B(NA)s was delivered to the USMC in September 1989. An equivalent version of the AV-8B(NA) also served with the RAF under the designation GR7; earlier GR5 aircraft were subsequently upgraded to GR7 standards.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p92&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p81/&gt;

In June 1987, as a private venture, BAe, McDonnell Douglas, and [[Smiths Group|Smiths Industries]] signed an MoU for the development of what was to become the AV-8B Plus, which saw the addition of radar and increased missile compatibility. The agreement was endorsed by the USMC and, after much consideration, the Spanish and Italian navies developed a joint requirement for a fleet of air-defense Harriers.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, Spain, and Italy signed an MoU in September 1990 to define the responsibilities of the three countries and establish a Joint Program Office to manage the program. On 30 November 1990, the USN, acting as an agent for the three participating countries, awarded McDonnell Douglas the contract to develop the improved Harrier.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p99&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; The award was followed by an order from the USMC in December 1990 for 30 new aircraft, and 72 rebuilt from older aircraft.&lt;ref name=Wilson_pp30_31&gt;Wilson 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy ordered 16 Harrier II Plus and two twin-seat TAV-8B aircraft, while Spain signed a contract for eight aircraft.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p100/&gt; Production of the AV-8B Harrier II Plus was conducted, in addition to McDonnell Douglas' plant, at [[EADS CASA|CASA]]'s facility in [[Seville]], Spain, and [[Alenia Aeronautica]]'s facility in [[Turin]], Italy. The UK also participated in the program by manufacturing components for the AV-8B.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p100&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Production was authorized on 3 June 1992. The maiden flight of the prototype (BuNo 164129) took place on 22 September, marking the start of a successful flight-test program.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p100/&gt; The first production aircraft was delivered to St. Louis and made its initial flight on 17 March 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliveries of new aircraft took place from April 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the plan to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs to the Plus standard proceeded. On 11 March 1994, the Defense Acquisition Board approved the program,&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p103&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; which initially involved 70 aircraft, with four converted in [[financial year]] 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;AV-8B_remanufacture&quot;/&gt; The program planned to use new and refurbished components to rebuild aircraft at a lower cost than manufacturing new ones.&lt;ref name=AV-8B_remanufacture&gt;Lopez 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion began in April 1994, and the first aircraft was delivered to the USMC in January 1996.&lt;ref name=Remanufacture_scrapping&gt;Lopez 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of production and further improvements===
In March 1996, the US [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO) stated that it was cheaper to buy Harrier&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;Plus aircraft outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs. The USN estimated the cost for remanufacture of each aircraft to be US$23–30&amp;nbsp;million, instead of $30&amp;nbsp;million for each new-built aircraft, while the GAO estimated the cost per new aircraft at $24&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Remanufacture_scrapping/&gt; Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered.&lt;ref name=Wilson_pp30_31/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Quote from Nordeen 2006: &quot;The Marine Corps supported this concept as an economical way to upgrade their Harrier II V/STOL force and achieve operational requirement for 72-radar equipped AV-8Bs.

In the 1990s, [[Boeing]] and [[BAE Systems]] assumed management of the Harrier family following corporate mergers that saw Boeing acquire McDonnell Douglas and BAe amalgamate with other defense companies to form BAE Systems. Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all models were delivered.&lt;ref name=Airforce_Technology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/harrier/ |title=Harrier II Plus (AV-8B) VSTOL Fighter and Attack Aircraft, USA |publisher=Airforce-technology.com |accessdate=5 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707095644/http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/harrier/|archivedate=7 July 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, ''[[Flight International]]'' reported that Taiwan might meet its requirement for a [[STOVL|short take off and vertical landing]] (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]]'s [[AN/APG-66|APG-66]] radar.

Although there have been no new AV-8B variants, in 1990 McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace began discussions on an interim aircraft between the AV-8B and the next generation of advanced STOVL aircraft. The Harrier III would have presented an &quot;evolutionary approach to get the most from the existing aircraft&quot;, as many of the structures employed on the [[Sea Harrier]] and AV-8B would be used.&lt;ref name=Harrier_III&gt;''Flight International'' 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; The wing and the [[torsion box]] were to be enlarged to accommodate extra fuel and hardpoints to improve the aircraft's endurance. Due to the increase in size, the wing would have had [[folding wing]]tips. To meet the heavier weight of the aircraft, Rolls-Royce was expected to design a Pegasus engine variant that would have produced {{convert|18|kN|lbf|abbr=on|sigfig=2|disp=flip}} more thrust than the latest production variant at the time. The Harrier III would have carried weapons such as [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] and [[AIM-132 ASRAAM]] missiles.&lt;ref name=Harrier_III/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliot 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing and BAE Systems continued studying the design until the early 2000s, when the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name=Italy_Harrier&gt;Nativi 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the USMC was studying potential enhancements to keep the AV-8B Harrier IIs up to date until its planned retirement, such as a helmet-mounted cueing system. It is also predicted that additional work on the aircraft's radars and sensor systems may take place. The USMC's Harrier II fleet was planned to remain in service until 2030, owing to delays with the F-35B and the fact that the Harriers have more [[service life]] left than USMC F/A-18 Hornets.&lt;ref name=Retirement2030&gt;{{Cite web |author=Majumdar, Dave |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-marine-corps-studying-harrier-enhancements-386224/ |title=US Marine Corps studying Harrier enhancements |work=[[Flightglobal]] |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610031442/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-marine-corps-studying-harrier-enhancements-386224/ |archivedate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2014 the USMC had decided to retire the AV-8B sooner because changing the transition orders of Harrier II and Hornet fleets to the Lightning II would save $1&amp;nbsp;billion. After entering service in the mid-2010s, the F-35B will start to replace the AV-8B in 2016, with the AV-8B expected to continue service until 2025. Meanwhile, the AV-8B will receive revamped defensive measures, updated data-link capability and targeting sensors, and improved missiles and rockets, among other enhancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/11/03/u-s-marines-retire-harrier-fleet-early-planned-extend-life-hornets |title=U.S. Marines to Retire Harrier Fleet Earlier Than Planned, Extend Life of Hornets |publisher=US Naval Institute |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118130104/http://news.usni.org/2014/11/03/u-s-marines-retire-harrier-fleet-early-planned-extend-life-hornets |archivedate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Naval Air Systems Command |url=http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.NAVAIRNewsStory&amp;id=5852 |title=Harriers Go Digital: New technology allows Marine aircraft to expand mission |publisher=US Navy |date=3 March 2015|accessdate=6 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306071011/http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.NAVAIRNewsStory&amp;id=5852|archivedate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flightglobal31march16&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Drew|first=James|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/baes-apkws-rockets-go-to-war-on-av-8b-harrier-423724/|title=BAE's APKWS rockets go to war on AV-8B Harrier|date=31 March 2016|work=[[Flightglobal]]|accessdate=8 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411150707/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/baes-apkws-rockets-go-to-war-on-av-8b-harrier-423724/|archivedate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
[[File:Harrier AV-8B banking left, revealing under-fuselage section.jpg|thumb|Underside of an AV-8B Harrier II|alt=Bottom view of jet aircraft showing its many under-wing pylons for weapons carriage. Two fences run along the length of the underside of the fuselage.]]

The AV-8B Harrier II is a [[Subsonic aircraft|subsonic]] attack aircraft of metal and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with [[Tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]]s and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] (downward slope). The aircraft is powered by a single [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus]] [[turbofan]] engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller [[Reaction control system|valve-controlled nozzles]] in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrier.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harrier.org.uk/technical/How_Hovers.htm |title=How the Harrier hovers |work=Harrier.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707235558/http://www.harrier.org.uk/technical/How_Hovers.htm|archivedate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AV-8B is equipped with one centerline fuselage and six wing [[hardpoint]]s (compared to four wing hardpoints on the original Harrier),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;290–291.&lt;/ref&gt; along with two fuselage stations for a 25&amp;nbsp;mm [[GAU-12 Equalizer|GAU-12]] cannon and ammunition pack.&lt;ref name=&quot;JAWA93 p166&quot;&gt;Lambert 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Navy_Airc_Charact&gt;{{cite web | author=Naval Air Systems Command| url=http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/av-8b.pdf |format=PDF |title= Standard Aircraft Characteristics: Navy Model AV-8B Harrier II Aircraft |publisher=US Navy |date= October 1986 |page=16 |accessdate= 24 November 2011|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006090540/http%3A//www%2Ehistory%2Enavy%2Emil/planes/av%2D8b%2Epdf |archivedate= 6 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These hardpoints give it the ability to carry a total of {{Convert|9200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of weapons, including [[Air-to-air missile|air-to-air]], [[Air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface]], and [[anti-ship missile]]s, as well as [[Unguided bomb|unguided]] and [[guided bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=Airforce_Technology/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warwick_p2132&gt;Warwick 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;2132.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft's internal fuel capacity is {{Convert|7,500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, up 50 percent compared to its predecessor. Fuel capacity can be carried in hardpoint-compatible external [[drop tank]]s, which give the aircraft a maximum [[ferry range]] of 2,100&amp;nbsp;mi (3,300&amp;nbsp;km) and a [[combat radius]] of 300&amp;nbsp;mi (556&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=Airforce_Technology/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warwick_p2132/&gt; The AV-8B can also receive additional fuel via [[aerial refueling]] using the probe-and-drogue system. The [[British Aerospace Harrier II]], a variant tailored to the RAF, uses different avionics, and has one additional missile pylon on each wing.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p88-9&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrier II retains the tandem [[landing gear]] layout of the first-generation Harriers, although each [[outrigger]] landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when [[taxiing]].&lt;ref name=Wilson_p27&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine intakes are larger than those of the first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200&amp;nbsp;lb (544&amp;nbsp;kg) of extra lift.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p27/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker_p25&gt;Walker 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technological advances incorporated into the Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The [[supercritical wing]], [[HOTAS|hands-on-throttle-and-stick]] (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered [[Wiktionary:Lateral#Adjective|lateral]] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly.&lt;ref name=Walker_p24&gt;Walker 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: &quot;The AV-8B looks a lot like the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[cathode-ray tube]] multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has a wide range of functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warwick_p2132&quot;/&gt; The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B [[Ejection seat#Zero-zero ejection seat|zero-zero ejection seats]], meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p92&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spick_p402-09&gt;Spick 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;402–409.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airframe===
For the AV-8B, McDonnell Douglas redesigned the entire airframe of the Harrier, incorporating numerous structural and aerodynamic changes. To improve visibility and better accommodate the crew and avionics hardware, McDonnell Douglas elevated the cockpit by {{Convert|10.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} and redesigned the canopy. This improved the forward (17° down), side (60°), and rear visibility.&lt;ref name=Walker_p23-5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warwick_p2128&gt;Warwick 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;2128.&lt;/ref&gt; The front fuselage is composed of a molded skin with an [[epoxy]]-based core sandwiched between two carbon-fiber sheets.&lt;ref name=Warwick_p2128/&gt; To compensate for the changes in the front fuselage, the rear fuselage was extended by {{Convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}, and the taller vertical stabilizer of the Sea Harrier was used.&lt;ref name=Warwick_p2128/&gt; The tail assembly is made up of composites to reduce weight.&lt;ref name=Walker_p23-5&gt;Walker 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most thorough redesign was of the wing, the objective being to match the performance of the cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A.&lt;ref name=Warwick_p2127&gt;Warwick 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;2127.&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers designed a new, one-piece supercritical wing, which improves [[Cruise (flight)|cruise performance]] by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift-to-drag ratio.&lt;ref name=Warwick_p2127/&gt; Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], reduced [[Swept wing|sweep]] (from 40° to 37°), and an area increased from {{Convert|200|sqft|m2|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|230|sqft|m2|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The wing has a high-lift configuration, employing [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped [[aileron]]s. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700&amp;nbsp;lb (3,035&amp;nbsp;kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft (300&amp;nbsp;m) takeoff roll.&lt;ref&gt;For the wing's sweep, see {{Cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-99124052.html |title=Harrier II: a look at the McDonnell Douglas/AV-8B |work=Advanced Materials &amp; Processes |publisher=[[HighBeam Research]] {{Subscription required}}|date=1 March 2003 |accessdate=10 November 2013}}

===Differences between versions===
Most of the first &quot;day attack&quot; AV-8B Harrier IIs were upgraded to Night Attack Harrier or Harrier II Plus standards, with the remainder being withdrawn from service. The AV-8B cockpit was also used for the early trialing of [[Direct Voice Input]] (DVI), which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft, using a system developed by Smiths Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Charlotte |url=http://fcw.com/articles/1997/12/14/voicerecognition-technology-waiting-to-exhale.aspx |title=Voice-recognition technology: Waiting to exhale |accessdate=19 July 2011 |work=[[Federal Computer Week]] |publisher=1105 Media | location=Vienna, Virginia |date= 14 December 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811232816/http://fcw.com/articles/1997/12/14/voicerecognition-technology-waiting-to-exhale.aspx|archivedate=11 August 2011|issn=0893-052X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main attack [[avionics]] system in original aircraft was the nose-mounted Hughes [[AN/ASB-19]] angle-rate bombing system.&lt;ref name=Navy_Airc_Charact/&gt; The system combined a TV imager and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate targeting capability. Defensive equipment include several AN/ALE-39 [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]]-[[Flare (countermeasure)|flare]] dispensers, an [[ALR-67 Radar Warning Receiver|AN/ALR-67]] [[radar warning receiver]], and an [[AN/ALQ-126|AN/ALQ-126C]] [[Electronic warfare#Electronic warfare applications|jammer]] pod.&lt;ref name=AMP/&gt;

The trainer version of the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem.

Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was the first upgrade of the AV-8B. It differed from the original aircraft in having a [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) camera added to the top of the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries [[head-up display]] (HUD), provisions for [[night vision goggle]]s, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures&lt;!-- ; this is effective after sunset when the objects' rates of cooling are different from one another --&gt;.&lt;ref name=Elliot_p56/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt; The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an [[FADEC|electronic control system]] and was more powerful and reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).&lt;ref&gt;Donald &amp; March 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_pp29–30&quot;&gt;Wilson 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrier II Plus is very similar to the Night Attack variant, with the addition of an [[APG-65 and APG-73|APG-65]] multi-mode [[pulse-Doppler radar]] in an extended nose, allowing it to launch advanced [[beyond-visual-range missile]]s such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM.&lt;ref name=Airforce_Technology/&gt; To make additional space for the radar, the angle-rate bombing system was removed. The radars used were taken from early F/A-18 aircraft, which had been upgraded with the related APG-73. In addition to the AIM-120, the AV-8B Plus can also carry [[AGM-65 Maverick]] and [[Harpoon (missile)|AGM-84 Harpoon]] missiles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p97&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt; According to aviation author Lon Nordeen, the changes &quot;had a slight increase in drag and a bit of additional weight, but there really was not much difference in performance between the [–408-powered] Night Attack and radar Harrier II Plus aircraft&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===United States Marine Corps===
The AV-8B underwent standard evaluation to prepare for its USMC service. In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots and a group of maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both deep and [[close air support]] missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying [[Air interdiction|battlefield interdiction]] and armed reconnaissance missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] and [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]] in California, [[Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]] in Canada, and [[MCAS Yuma]] in Arizona.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p57-9&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of OPEVAL, which took place at MCAS Yuma from 25 February to 8 March, required the AV-8B to perform fighter escort, [[combat air patrol]], and deck-launched intercept missions. Although the evaluation identified shortfalls in the design (subsequently rectified), OPEVAL was deemed successful.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p58&gt;Nordeen 2006, p 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The AV-8B Harrier II reached [[initial operating capability]] (IOC) in January 1985 with USMC squadron [[VMA-331]].&lt;ref&gt;Polmar 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossnick 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;343.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to Lon Nordeen, USMC squadron VMA-331 was reassigned to the AV-8B in January 1985 and achieved IOC in August 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordeen_p61&quot;/&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;}}

The AV-8B saw extensive action in the [[Gulf War]] of 1990–91. Aircraft based on {{USS|Nassau|LHA-4|6}} and {{USS|Tarawa|LHA-1|2}}, and at on-shore bases, initially flew training and support [[sortie]]s, as well as practicing with coalition forces. The AV-8Bs were to be held in reserve during the initial phase of the preparatory air assault of Operation Desert Storm. The AV-8B was first used in the war on the morning of 17 January 1991, when a call for air support from an [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco|OV-10 Bronco]] [[forward air controller]] against Iraqi artillery that was shelling [[Khafji]] and an adjacent oil refinery, brought the AV-8B into combat.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p81&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, USMC AV-8Bs attacked Iraqi positions in southern Kuwait. Throughout the war, AV-8Bs performed armed reconnaissance and worked in concert with coalition forces to destroy targets.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p81/&gt;

During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 86 AV-8Bs amassed 3,380 flights and about 4,100 flight hours,&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p87&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boeing/&gt; with a mission availability rate of over 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AV-8B Harrier |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |url=https://fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/attack/av8b_harrier.html |accessdate=18 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804162129/https://fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/attack/av8b_harrier.html|archivedate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five AV-8Bs were lost to enemy [[surface-to-air missile]]s, and two USMC pilots were killed. The AV-8B had an attrition rate of 1.5 aircraft for every 1,000 sorties flown. [[U.S. Army]] General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.|Norman Schwarzkopf]] later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117 Nighthawk]] and [[McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apache|AH-64 Apache]]—that played a crucial role in the war.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p43&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes&quot;/&gt; In the aftermath of the war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of [[Operation Southern Watch]]. The AV-8Bs launched from [[amphibious assault ship]]s in the [[Persian Gulf]], and from forward operating bases such as [[Ali Al Salem Air Base]], Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the AV-8B participated in [[NATO]]'s bombing of [[Yugoslavia]] during [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Operation Allied Force]]. Twelve Harriers were split evenly between the [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]] and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s (MEU). AV-8Bs of the 24th MEU were introduced into combat on 14 April, and over the next 14 days flew 34 combat air support missions over Kosovo. During their six-month deployment aboard USS ''Nassau'', 24th MEU Harriers averaged a high mission-capable rate of 91.8 percent.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p111/&gt; On 28 April, the 24th MEU was relieved by the 26th MEU, based on {{USS|Kearsarge|LHD-3|6}}. The first combat sorties of the unit's AV-8Bs occurred two days later, one aircraft being lost. The 26th MEU remained in the theater of operations until 28 May, when it was relocated to [[Brindisi]], Italy.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p111&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

USMC AV-8Bs took part in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan from 2001. The USMC [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th MEU]] arrived off the coast of Pakistan in October 2001. Operating from the unit's ships, four AV-8Bs began attack missions into Afghanistan on 3 November 2001. The 26th MEU and its AV-8Bs joined 15th MEU later that month. In December 2001, AV-8Bs began moving into Afghanistan to a forward base at [[Kandahar International Airport|Kandahar]]. More AV-8Bs were deployed with other USMC units to the region in 2002. The [[VMA-513]] squadron deployed six Night Attack AV-8Bs to [[Bagram Airfield|Bagram]] in October 2002. These aircraft each carried a [[LITENING targeting pod]] to perform reconnaissance missions along with attack and other missions, primarily at night.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_p144-51&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;144–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft participated in [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in 2003, acting primarily in support of USMC ground units. During the initial action, 60 AV-8Bs were deployed on ships such as the {{USS|Bonhomme Richard|LHD-6|6}} and {{USS|Bataan|LHD-5|2}}, from which over 1,000 sorties were flown throughout the war. When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations.&lt;ref name='cordes 333'/&gt; USMC commander Lieutenant General [[Earl B. Hailston]] said that the Harriers were able to provide 24-hour support for ground forces, and noted that &quot;The airplane&amp;nbsp;... became the envy of pilots even from my background&amp;nbsp;... there's an awful lot of things on the Harrier that I've found the Hornet pilots asking me [for]&amp;nbsp;...

Amos]] later commented on the AV-8B's performance in Iraq, stating: &quot;I simply could not have been more pleased with the reliability of the airplane and its weapons systems&amp;nbsp;... and in the courage and discipline of my AV8 pilots.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/av8b-harrier-finding-success-in-iraq-0256 |title= AV-8B Harrier finding Success in Iraq |work=Defense Industry Daily |date=30 March 2005 |accessdate=20 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008213833/http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/av8b-harrier-finding-success-in-iraq-0256/|archivedate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

USMC sources documented the Harrier as holding an 85 percent aircraft [[Availability (system)|availability]] record in the Iraq War; in just under a month of combat, the aircraft flew over 2,000 sorties. When used, the [[LITENING targeting pod|LITENING II targeting pod]] achieved greater than 75 percent kill effectiveness on targets.&lt;ref name='cordes 333'/&gt; In a single sortie from USS ''Bonhomme Richard'', a wave of Harriers inflicted heavy damage on a [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] tank battalion in advance of a major ground assault on [[Al Kut]].&lt;ref name='cordes 334'&gt;Cordesman 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;334.&lt;/ref&gt; Harriers regularly operated in close support roles for friendly tanks, one of the aircraft generally carrying a LITENING pod. Despite the Harrier's high marks, the limited amount of time that each aircraft could remain on station, around 15–20 minutes, led to some calls from within the USMC for the procurement of [[AC-130]] gunships, which could loiter for six hours and had a heavier close air support capability than the AV-8B.&lt;ref&gt;Cordesman 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;334–335.&lt;/ref&gt; AV-8Bs were later used in combination with artillery to provide constant fire support for ground forces during heavy fighting in 2004 around the insurgent stronghold of [[Fallujah]]. The urban environment there required extreme precision for airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2011, USMC AV-8Bs were launched from USS ''Kearsarge'' in support of [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]], enforcing the UN [[no-fly zone]] over Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=59195 |author=Joint Force Maritime Component Commanders Odyssey Dawn Public Affairs|title=Navy, Marine Corps Aircraft Strike Libya |publisher=US Navy |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=30 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622021805/http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=59195|archivedate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carried out airstrikes on [[Sirte]] on 5 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/us-planes-launch-assault-on-libyan-cities/story-e6frfku0-1226033755494 |title=US planes launch assault on Libyan cities |agency=Associated Press |publisher=News.com.au |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830084859/http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/us-planes-launch-assault-on-libyan-cities/story-e6frfku0-1226033755494|archivedate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple AV-8Bs were involved in the defense of a downed [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E]] pilot, attacking approaching Libyans prior to the pilot's extraction by a [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey|MV-22 Osprey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lamothe |first=Dan |url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2011/07/marine-pilots-recount-daring-rescue-mission-071611/ |title=Marine pilots recount daring rescue mission |work=[[Marine Corps Times]] |publisher=Gannett Government Media |location=Springfield, Virginia|date=16 July 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506011820/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20110716/NEWS/107160318/Marine-pilots-recount-daring-rescue-mission|archivedate=6 May 2013|issn=1522-0869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to major conflicts, USMC AV-8Bs have been deployed in support of contingency and humanitarian operations, providing fixed-wing air cover and armed reconnaissance.

===Italian Navy===
In the late 1960s, following a demonstration of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier on the [[Italian Navy]] (''Marina Militare'') helicopter carrier ''[[Italian cruiser Andrea Doria (C553)|Andrea Doria]]'', the country began investigating the possibility of acquiring the Harrier.&lt;ref name=Eden_p295&gt;Eden 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;295.&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts were hindered by a 1937 Italian law that prohibited the navy from operating [[fixed-wing aircraft]] because they were the domain of the air force. In early 1989, the law was changed to allow the navy to operate any fixed-wing aircraft with a maximum weight of over 3,300&amp;nbsp;lb (1,500&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;Geisenheyner 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson_p44&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a lengthy evaluation of the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] and AV-8B, an order was placed for two TAV-8Bs in May 1989. Soon, a contract for a further 16 AV-8B Plus aircraft was signed.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p44/&gt; After the TAV-8Bs and the first three AV-8Bs, all subsequent Italian Navy Harriers were locally assembled by [[Alenia Aeronautica]] from kits delivered from the U.S.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p45&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-seaters, the first to be delivered, arrived at Grottaglie in August 1991. They were used for proving flights with the navy's helicopter carriers and on the light aircraft carrier {{Ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Giuseppe Garibaldi|551|2}}.&lt;ref name=Eden_p295/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spinelli 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1994, the initial batch of US-built aircraft arrived at MCAS Cherry Point for pilot conversion training. The first Italian-assembled Harrier was rolled out the following year.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p45/&gt; In mid-January 1995, ''Giuseppe Garibaldi'' set off from [[Taranto]] to Somalia, with three Harriers on board, to maintain stability following the withdrawal of UN forces.&lt;ref&gt;Spinelli 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harriers, flown by five Italian pilots, accumulated more than 100 flight hours and achieved 100 percent availability during the three-month deployment, performing reconnaissance and other missions. The squadron returned to port on 22 March.&lt;ref name=Eden_p295/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson_p45/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Italian AV-8Bs were used for the first time in combat missions when they were deployed aboard ''Giuseppe Garibaldi'', which was participating in Operation Allied Force in [[Kosovo]]. Italian pilots conducted more than 60 sorties alongside other NATO aircraft, attacking the Yugoslav army and paramilitary forces and bombing the country's infrastructure with conventional and [[laser-guided bomb]]s (LGB).&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Italian Navy was looking to acquire a further seven remanufactured aircraft to equip ''Giuseppe Garibaldi'' and a new carrier, {{Ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Cavour|550|2}}. Existing aircraft, meanwhile, were updated to allow them to carry AIM-120 AMRAAMs and [[JDAM]] guided bombs.&lt;ref name=Italy_Harrier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson_p45/&gt; From November 2001 to March 2002, eight AV-8Bs were embarked aboard ''Giuseppe Garibaldi'' and were deployed to the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The aircraft, equipped with LGBs, operated throughout January and February 2002, during which 131 missions were logged for a total of 647 flight hours.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Italian Harriers, operating from ''Giuseppe Garibaldi'', worked alongside Italian [[Eurofighter]]s and aircraft of other nations during [[Operation Unified Protector]], part of the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]].&lt;ref name=AV8B_OUP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/libya-italian-eurofighters-harriers-fly-first-combat-air-patrol-354948/ |last=Peruzzi |first=Luca |title=Libya: Italian Eurofighters, Harriers fly first combat air patrol missions |work=[[Flightglobal]] |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031003014/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/libya-italian-eurofighters-harriers-fly-first-combat-air-patrol-354948/|archivedate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted airstrikes as well as intelligence and reconnaissance sorties over Libya, using the [[LITENING targeting pod]]s while armed with AIM-120 AMRAAMs and [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]s.&lt;ref name=AV8B_OUP/&gt; In total, Italian military aircraft delivered 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force [[Panavia Tornado|Tornados]] and [[AMX International AMX|AMX]] fighter bombers delivered 550 bombs and missiles, while the eight Italian Navy AV-8Bs flying from ''Giuseppe Garibaldi'' dropped 160 guided bombs during 1,221 flight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kington|first=Tom|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20111214/DEFSECT01/112140301/Italy-Gives-Bombing-Stats-for-Libya-Campaign|title=Italy Gives Bombing Stats for Libya Campaign|date=14 December 2011|work=[[Defense News]]|publisher=Gannett Government Media|location=Springfield, Virginia|accessdate=27 September 2013|archiveurl=http://archive.is/qoVl|archivedate=28 July 2012|issn=0884-139X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain, already using the AV-8S Matador, became the first international operator of the AV-8B by signing an order for 12 aircraft in March 1983.&lt;ref name=Wilson_p46/&gt; Designated VA-2 Matador II by the [[Spanish Navy]] (''Armada Española''), this variant is known as EAV-8B by McDonnell Douglas.&lt;ref name=Eden_p294&gt;Eden 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;294.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot conversion took place in the US. On 6 October 1987, the first three Matador IIs were delivered to [[Naval Station Rota, Spain|Naval Station Rota]].&lt;ref name=Eden_p294/&gt; The new aircraft were painted in a two-tone matt grey finish, similar to US Navy aircraft, and deliveries were complete by 1988.&lt;ref name=Eden_p294/&gt;

BAe test pilots cleared the aircraft carrier {{Ship|Spanish aircraft carrier|Príncipe de Asturias||2}}' for Harrier operations in July 1989. The carrier, which replaced the World War II-era {{Ship|Spanish aircraft carrier|Dédalo||2}}, has a 12° [[ski-jump ramp]].&lt;ref name=Wilson_p46&gt;Wilson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eden_p294/&gt; It was originally planned that the first unit to operate the aircraft would be the ''8&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Escuadrilla''. This unit was disbanded on 24 October 1986, following the sales of AV-8S Matadors to Thailand.&lt;ref name=Eden_p294/&gt; Instead, ''9&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Escuadrilla'' was formed on 29 September 1987, to become part of the Alpha Carrier Air Group and operate the EAV-8B.&lt;ref name=Eden_p294/&gt;

Cutbacks in senior maintenance personnel and pilot mistakes had a disastrous effect on the safety of the American-operated AV-8B, which gained it a negative reputation in the US press that was not deserved.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen, Lon. &quot;Harrier II support and safety issues&quot;, ''Harrier II: Validating V/STOL'' (2014) ,''Naval Institute Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its 1996 [[Pepsi Stuff]] marketing campaign, Pepsi ran an advertisement promising a Harrier jet to anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted to take advantage of the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim a jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a [[Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.|lawsuit ensued]], in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;
