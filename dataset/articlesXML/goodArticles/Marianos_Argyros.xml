'''Marianos Argyros''' ({{lang-el|Μαριανός Ἀργυρός}}, {{floruit|944–963}}) was a [[Byzantine]] aristocrat and member of the [[Argyros (Byzantine family)|Argyros family]]. A monk, in 944 he supported the assumption of sole rule by [[Constantine VII]], and was allowed to leave the monastery and enter imperial service. He held a succession of senior military commands, fighting in [[southern Italy]] against local rebels and the [[Fatimids]], and in the [[Balkans]] against the [[Magyars]]. In 963, he tried to oppose the takeover of the imperial throne by the general [[Nikephoros Phokas]] by assuming control over [[Constantinople]] and arresting his father, [[Bardas Phokas the Elder]]. During the ensuing clashes, he was hit on the head by a platter, and died on the next day, 16 August 963.

== Life ==

=== Origin and the palace coups of 944 ===
[[File:Romanus I with Constantine VII, solidus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Obverse and reverse of a gold coin, showing Christ enthroned and two crowned rulers jointly holding a cross|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' of Romanos I with Constantine VII]]
Marianos was the eldest son of the general [[Leo Argyros (10th century)|Leo Argyros]], active in the first decades of the 10th century. He had a brother, [[Romanos Argyros (10th century)|Romanos Argyros]], who in 921 married Agathe, a daughter of Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920–944). The [[Argyroi]] therefore were counted among the firmest supporters of the Lekapenos regime.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|pp=60–61, 62–64}} Romanos Lekapenos had risen to power in 919 as regent over the young [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] (r. 913–959), whom he married to his daughter [[Helena Lekapene|Helena]]. By December 920, his position had become so unassailable that he was crowned senior emperor.{{sfn|Runciman|1988|pp=59–62}} To consolidate his hold on power, and possibly aiming to supplant the ruling [[Macedonian dynasty]] with his own family, Romanos raised his eldest son Christopher to co-emperor in 921, while the younger sons [[Stephen Lekapenos|Stephen]] and [[Constantine Lekapenos|Constantine]] were proclaimed co-emperors in 924.{{sfn|Runciman|1988|pp=64–67}} Christopher died in 931, and as Constantine VII remained sidelined, Stephen and Constantine assumed an increased prominence, although formally they still ranked after their brother-in-law in the college of emperors.{{sfn|Runciman|1988|pp=78–79}} However, in 943, the elderly Romanos drafted a [[Will (law)|will]] which would leave Constantine VII as the senior emperor following his death. This greatly upset his two sons, who started planning to seize power through a [[coup d'état]], with Stephen apparently the ringleader and Constantine a rather reluctant partner.{{sfn|Runciman|1988|pp=231–232}}

It is in this context that Marianos Argyros is first mentioned in December 944. At the time, he was a monk, and a confidant of Stephen Lekapenos.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}} According to the 11th-century historian [[John Skylitzes]], he had earlier been honoured and trusted by Romanos, but Marianos nevertheless supported the coup of the Lekapenoi brothers on 20 December, which successfully deposed their father and exiled him to a monastery on the island of [[Kınalıada|Prote]].{{sfn|Runciman|1988|p=232}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}} A few weeks later, however, with the support of the populace, Constantine VII managed to sideline the Lekapenoi, who joined their father in exile.{{sfn|Runciman|1988|pp=232–233}} It appears that Marianos had changed sides in time, for he participated in the arrest of the Lekapenoi. As a reward, Constantine VII, now sole ruler, freed him of his monastic vows and raised him to the rank of ''[[patrikios]]'' and the post of [[Count of the Stable]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=63}} His abandonment of the monastic habit earned him the nickname &quot;Apambas&quot; or &quot;Apabbas&quot; ({{lang|grc|Ἄπαμβας/Ἀπαββᾶς}}), whose etymology is unclear.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=62}}

=== Command in southern Italy ===

Marianos then disappears from the scene until he was sent at the head of troops from the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]s of [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace (theme)|Thrace]] in an expedition to [[southern Italy]], dated by modern scholars to 955. A rebellion that had broken out in the local Byzantine themes of [[Longobardia|Langobardia]] and [[Calabria]], involving also the imperial vassal city-state of [[Naples]]. The Byzantine expeditionary force encircled and besieged Naples, until the city surrendered.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}} Marianos then took over the governance of the Byzantine provinces of Italy: in 956, he is attested as ''[[strategos]]'' (governor) of Calabria and Langobardia in a charter of privilege for the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}} At about the same time, following a Fatimid raid on [[Almeria]], war had broken out between the Fatimids and the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate of Cordoba]]. Fatimid sources report that the Umayyads proposed joint action with Byzantium, but Marianos appears to have been focused on suppressing the rebellion rather than engaging in war with the Fatimids. Byzantine envoys even went to the Fatimid caliph, [[al-Mu'izz]], and offered to renew and extend the existing truce. Al-Mu'izz however, determined to expose the Umayyads' collaboration with the infidel enemy and emulate the achievements of his father, refused.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Halm|1996|p=394}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=241}} 

The Caliph dispatched new forces to Sicily under [[Ammar ibn Ali al-Kalbi]] and his brother [[al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi]]. In spring/summer 956, the Fatimid fleet clashed with and defeated the Byzantine fleet in two battles in the [[Straits of Messina]], followed by Fatimid raids on the Calabrian coast. In the aftermath of these raids, Marianos travelled to the Fatimid court in person, and sought a truce in exchange for the resumption of a payment of tribute and the annual release of prisoners of war taken in the East. Al-Mu'izz agreed to these terms, but warfare resumed soon after, when the Byzantine admiral Basil destroyed the mosque built by the Fatimids at [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegion]] and raided [[Termini Imerese|Termini]]. Marianos therefore returned to the Fatimid court in a second embassy in 957, going first through Sicily, where he apparently delivered to the local Fatimid governor, [[Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Kalbi]], the agreed tribute. During the reception by al-Mu'izz, Marianos presented a letter by Constantine VII confirming the terms agreed during the first embassy, but this time al-Mu'izz rejected the terms. As a result of the breakdown in these negotiations, Constantine VII sent a massive expedition to Italy under admirals Krambeas and Moroleon, while Marianos commanded the land troops. The Fatimids under the Kalbid brothers al-Hasan and Ammar were victorious over Marianos, but following the arrival of the Byzantine reinforcements the Fatimid fleet left Calabria, only to suffer a shipwreck on its return to Sicily.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Halm|1996|pp=394–396}} Marianos is no longer mentioned in Italy after that, although he may have led a third embassy to al-Mu'izz in September 958, which led to the conclusion of a five-year truce between the two powers.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Halm|1996|pp=403–404}}

=== Command in the Balkans and death ===
In ca. 959/961, he defeated a [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|raid]] by the [[Magyars]] into [[Thrace]], taking many of them prisoner.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}} In connection with this operation, [[Theophanes Continuatus]] refers to him as &quot;''[[monostrategos]]'' of the theme of Macedonia and ''[[katepano]]'' of the West&quot;, a position equivalent to that of the [[Domestic of the Schools]] of the West, in command of all the &quot;western&quot; (European) troops. It is unclear, however, whether this means a permanent appointment or was an ''ad hoc'' position, i.e. as ''strategos'' of Macedonia and temporary overall commander of detachments from the other European themes. The latter is more likely, as it is documented that [[Leo Phokas the Younger]] held the post of Domestic of the West, but was fighting against the Arabs in the east at the time.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=63}}

[[File:Histamenon nomisma-Nicephorus II and Basil II-sb1776.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Obverse and reverse of a gold coin, showing a bust of Christ Pantocrator and two crowned rulers jointly holding a cross|''[[Histamenon]]'' of Nikephoros Phokas and Basil II]]
On 15 March 963, Emperor [[Romanos II]] (r. 959–963) unexpectedly died, leaving his young sons [[Basil II]] and [[Constantine VIII]] as emperors. The powerful general [[Nikephoros Phokas]] (the brother of Leo) decided to seize the throne for himself, but was opposed by the ''[[parakoimomenos]]'' and guardian of the young emperors, [[Joseph Bringas]]. Seeking support, Bringas offered Marianos the high command in the east and potentially even the throne if he would aid him.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=63}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=498}} Marianos first suggested trying to win over Nikephoros Phokas' popular nephew and lieutenant, the ''strategos'' of the [[Anatolics]] [[John Tzimiskes]]. The latter not only refused, however, but took his letter straight to his uncle, who summoned his armies to [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]] and had them proclaim him emperor in early summer.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=498}} As Phokas' army advanced across [[Asia Minor]] on [[Constantinople]], Marianos then tried to stage a coup in Constantinople with men of the Macedonian regiments and armed prisoners of war. This move was opposed by the populace, however, resulting in clashes in the streets. The populace became especially enraged when Marianos tried to forcibly remove the Phokades' elderly father, [[Bardas Phokas the Elder|Bardas]], from the [[Hagia Sophia]] where he had sought sanctuary, on 15 August. Marianos was reportedly hit on the head by a platter, thrown by a woman from a nearby house roof. Mortally wounded, he died on the next day.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Marianos Argyros (#24962)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=63}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|pp=498–499}} Phokas' supporters rapidly prevailed thereafter. Bringas was forced to flee himself to the Hagia Sophia, and on 16 August Nikephoros Phokas was crowned senior emperor as guardian of Basil and Constantine.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=499}}
