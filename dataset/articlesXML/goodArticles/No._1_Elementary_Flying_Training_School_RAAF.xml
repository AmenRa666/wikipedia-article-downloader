'''No.&amp;nbsp;1 Elementary Flying Training School''' (No.&amp;nbsp;1 EFTS) was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) pilot training unit that operated during World War&amp;nbsp;II. It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. The unit was established in November 1939 as '''No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Training School''' at [[Melbourne]], Victoria. It was relocated to [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]], South Australia, in December 1939 and renamed No.&amp;nbsp;1 EFTS the following month.  Training activities relocated to [[Tamworth Airport|Tamworth]], New South Wales, in May 1944; the school was disbanded in December that year.

==History==
Flying instruction in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS).&lt;ref name=Stephens67&gt;Stephens (2006), pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.&lt;ref name=Stephens67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), pp. 106–109]&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;1 Elementary Flying Training School was formed as No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Training School in [[Melbourne]] on 6&amp;nbsp;November 1939.&lt;ref name=Units&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Its inaugural commanding officer was [[Squadron Leader]] F.J.B. Wight. On 13&amp;nbsp;December, the school moved to [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]], South Australia, after building work was completed there.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Parafield was home to the South Australian Aero Club, and it was the airfield's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in the state that led to it becoming the base for the first flying school the RAAF raised during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article95045959 |title=Goldfields Aero Club |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]] |location=Kalgoolie|date=2 June 1939 |accessdate=4 January 2016 |page=3 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison72&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; The same principle was followed in establishing No.&amp;nbsp;3 Flying Training School (later renamed [[No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Elementary Flying Training School]]) at [[RAAF Station Archerfield|Archerfield]], Queensland, [[No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Elementary Flying Training School]] at [[Essendon Airport|Essendon]], Victoria, and [[No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Elementary Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Station Mascot|Mascot]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=Gillison72/&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Training School's first thirteen [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de Havilland Gipsy Moth]] training aircraft were delivered to Parafield on 16–17 December 1939.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was renamed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Elementary Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;1 EFTS) on 2&amp;nbsp;January 1940.&lt;ref name=Gillison72/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; The first eight-week flying training course began on 8&amp;nbsp;January with twenty-three students; another joined a week later.&lt;ref name=RAAF3&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131549786 |title=48 cadets by June |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=12 January 1940 |accessdate=4 January 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the unit operations book, limited flying was possible owing to the number of available parachutes but, on 19&amp;nbsp;January, &quot;permission was granted to continue training without them until supplies were forthcoming&quot;.&lt;ref name=RAAF3/&gt; The second flying course began on 5&amp;nbsp;February.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; An instructor and his cadet were killed in a crash on 19&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 EFTS's complement of aircraft was augmented on 20&amp;nbsp;April with the arrival of six [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
