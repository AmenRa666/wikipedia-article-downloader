The '''Great Storm of 1703''' was a destructive extratropical cyclone that struck central and southern England on 26 November (7 December in today’s calendar), 1703. High winds caused 2,000 chimney stacks to collapse in London, and winds damaged the [[New Forest]], which lost 4,000 oaks. Ships were blown hundreds of miles off-course, and over 1,000 seamen died on the [[Goodwin Sands]] alone. News bulletins of casualties and damage were sold all over England – a novelty at that time. The [[Church of England]] declared that the storm was God’s vengeance for the sins of the nation. [[Daniel Defoe]] thought it was a divine punishment for poor performance against Catholic armies in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

==Severity==
Contemporary observers recorded [[barometric]] readings as low as 973 [[millibars]] (measured by [[William Derham]] in south [[Essex]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Derham |first=William |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1704–1705 |month= |title=A Letter for the Reverend Mr William Derham, F. R. S. Containing His Observations concerning the Late Storm |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |volume=24 |issue=289 |pages=1530–1534 |doi= 10.1098/rstl.1704.0005|jstor= 102921 |bibcode=1704RSPT...24.1530D|quote= |publisher=The Royal Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been suggested that the storm may have deepened to 950&amp;nbsp;millibars over the [[English Midlands|Midlands]].

==Damage==
In London, approximately 2,000 massive chimney stacks were blown down. The lead roofing was blown off [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] had to shelter in a cellar at [[St James's Palace]] to avoid collapsing chimneys and part of the roof. On the [[River Thames|Thames]], some 700 ships were heaped together in the [[Pool of London]], the section downstream from [[London Bridge]]. [[HMS Vanguard (1678)|HMS ''Vanguard'']] was wrecked at [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]]. Admiral Sir [[Cloudesley Shovell]]'s [[HMS Association|HMS ''Association'']] was blown from [[Harwich]] to [[Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]] before way could be made back to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/10/weather|title=A history of great British storms|date=10 March 2008|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinnacle]]s were blown from the top of [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King’s College Chapel, in Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=rennell/&gt;

There was extensive and prolonged flooding in the [[West Country]], particularly around [[Bristol]]. Hundreds of people drowned in flooding on the [[Somerset Levels]], along with thousands of sheep and cattle, and one ship was found {{convert|15|mi}} inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moss |first=Stephen |title=Wild Hares and Hummingbirds |publisher=Square Peg |page=32 |isbn=978-0224086721}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], Bishop [[Richard Kidder]] and his wife were killed when two chimneystacks in the palace fell on them, asleep in bed.&lt;ref name=rennell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2082939/UK-weather-This-weeks-gales-compared-storm-drowned-Britain.html|last=Rennell|first=Tony|title=Think this week's gales are bad? They're nothing compared to the storm that drowned Britain|date=6 January 2012|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same storm blew in part of the great west window in [[Wells Cathedral]]. Major damage occurred to the southwest tower of [[Llandaff Cathedral]] at [[Cardiff]] in [[Wales]].

At sea, many ships were wrecked, some of which were returning from helping [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], the claimed King of Spain, fight the French in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. These ships included [[HMS Stirling Castle (1679)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Northumberland (1679)|HMS ''Northumberland'']], [[HMS Mary (1650)|HMS ''Mary'']] and [[HMS Restoration (1678)|HMS ''Restoration'']], with about 1,500 seamen killed particularly on the [[Goodwin Sands#Great Storm of 1703|Goodwin Sands]]. Between 8,000 and 15,000 lives were lost overall.[[File:Eddystone 1703 Chambers.PNG|thumb|Destruction of the first Eddystone lighthouse in Great Storm 1703]] The first [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] off [[Plymouth]] was destroyed&lt;ref name=rennell/&gt; on 27 November 1703 (Old Style), killing six occupants, including its builder [[Henry Winstanley]]. ([[John Rudyard]] was later contracted to build the second lighthouse on the site.) A ship torn from its moorings in the [[Helford]] River in [[Cornwall]] was blown for {{convert|200|mi}} before grounding eight hours later on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=rennell/&gt; The number of [[oak]] trees lost in the [[New Forest]] alone was 4,000.

The storm of 1703 caught a convoy of 130 merchant ships sheltering at [[Milford Haven]], along with their man of war escorts the ''Dolphin'', the ''Cumberland'', the ''Coventry'', the ''Looe'', the ''Hastings'' and the ''Hector''. By 3:00pm the next afternoon, losses included 30 vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/506442/details/UNNAMED+WRECK%3B+SHIPPING+LOSSES+DURING+GREAT+STORM+OF+1703/|title=&quot;Shipping Losses During Great Storm of 1703&quot;, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The storm was unprecedented in ferocity and duration and was generally reckoned by witnesses to represent the anger of [[God]], in recognition of the &quot;crying sins of this nation&quot;. The government declared 19 January 1704 a day of [[fasting]], saying that it &quot;loudly calls for the deepest and most solemn humiliation of our people&quot;. It remained a frequent topic of moralising in sermons well into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;In Plumptre, E. H. (1888) ''The Life of Bishop Ken'' – quoted by Martin Brayne, ''The Greatest Storm'', 2002 – it is stated that a 'Storm' sermon endowed by a Mr Taylor was still being preached at Little Wild Street Congregational Church, London well into the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary===
The Great Storm also coincided with the increase in English [[journalism]], and was the first weather event to be a news story on a national scale. Special issue broadsheets were produced detailing damage to property and stories of people who had been killed.

[[Daniel Defoe]] produced his full-length book [[The Storm (Daniel Defoe)|''The Storm'']] (July 1704) in response to the calamity, calling it &quot;the tempest that destroyed woods and forests all over England&quot;. He wrote: &quot;No pen could describe it, nor tongue express it, nor thought conceive it unless by one in the extremity of it.&quot; Coastal towns such as [[Portsmouth]] &quot;looked as if the enemy had sackt them and were most miserably torn to pieces.&quot; Winds of up to {{convert|80|mph}} destroyed more than 400 windmills.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/east/series4/great_storm.shtml|title=&quot;The Great Storm&quot;, ''Inside Out''|date=13 October 2003|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe reported that the sails in some turned so fast that the friction caused the wooden wheels to overheat and catch fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2010/nov/22/weatherwatch-great-storm-1703-daniel-defoe|title=The Great Storm of 26 November 1703|date=21 November 2010|author=Paul Brown|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the destruction of the sovereign fleet was a punishment for their poor performance against the [[Catholic]] armies of France and Spain during the first year of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-41724-4 |pages=15–28 |last=McKay |first=J. |editor1-last=Keeble |editor1-first=Richard |editor2-last=Sharon |editor2-first=Wheeler |title=The Journalistic Imagination: Literary Journalists from Defoe to Capote and Carter |chapter=Defoe's ''The Storm'' as a Model for Contemporary Reporting |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval losses==
In the [[English Channel]], fierce winds and high seas swamped some vessels outright and drove others onto the [[Goodwin Sands]], an extensive sand bank situated along the southeast coast of England and the traditional anchorage for ships waiting either for passage up the [[Thames Estuary]] to London or for favourable winds to take them out into the Channel and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=mahs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahsnet.org/projects/Great_Storm/Great_Storm_1.html|title=&quot;The Great Strom Project&quot;, Maritime Archaeological and Historical Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Royal Navy]] was badly affected, losing thirteen ships including the entire Channel Squadron,&lt;ref name=mahs/&gt; and upwards of 1,500 seamen drowned.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1256/wea.83.03 |volume=58 |issue=11 |pages=419–427 |last=Wheeler |first=Dennis |title=The Great Storm of November 1703: A new look at the seamen's records |journal=Weather |year=2003 |bibcode=2003Wthr...58..419W }}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 September 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[third-rate]] {{HMS|Restoration|1678|6}} was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands; of the ship's company of 387 not one was saved.
*The third-rate {{HMS|Northumberland|1679|6}} was lost on the Goodwin Sands; all 220 men, including 24 marines were killed.
*The third-rate (battleship)&lt;ref name=mahs/&gt; {{HMS|Stirling Castle|1679|6}} was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands. Seventy men, including four marine officers, were saved, but 206 men were drowned.
*The [[fourth-rate]] {{HMS|Mary|1650|6}} was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands. The captain and the purser were ashore, but Rear Admiral Beaumont and 268 other men were drowned. Only one man, Thomas Atkins, was saved. His escape was remarkable – having first seen the rear admiral get onto a piece of her quarter-deck when the ship was breaking up, and then get washed off again, Atkins was tossed by a wave into the ''Stirling Castle'', which sank soon after. From the ''Stirling Castle'' he was swept into a boat by a wave, and was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laker |first=J. |title=History of Deal |year=1921 |pages=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[fifth-rate]] ''Mortar-bomb'' was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands and her entire company of 65 lost.
*The [[sixth-rate]] advice boat ''Eagle'' was lost on the coast of [[Sussex]], but her ship's company of 45 were all saved.
*The third-rate {{HMS|Resolution|1667|2}} was lost at [[Pevensey]] on the coast of Sussex; all her ship's company of 221 were saved.
*The fifth-rate ''Litchfield Prize'' was wrecked on the coast of Sussex; all 108 on board were saved.
*The fourth-rate {{HMS|Newcastle|1653|2}} was lost at [[Spithead]]. The carpenter and 39 men were saved, and the other 193 were drowned.
*The fifth-rate fire-ship ''Vesuvius'' was lost at Spithead; all 48 of her ship's company were saved.
*The fourth-rate [[HMS Reserve (1701)|''Reserve'']] was lost by foundering off [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]]. The captain, the surgeon, the clerk and 44 men were saved; the other 175 members of the crew were drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavery, SoLv1 p167&quot;&gt;Lavery, Ships of the Line vol.1, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[second-rate]] {{HMS|Vanguard|1678|2}} was sunk in [[Chatham harbour]]. She was not manned and had no armament fitted; the following year she was raised for rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{colledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The fourth-rate {{HMS|York|1654|2}} was lost at [[Harwich]]; all but four of her men were saved.

Lamb (1991) claimed 10,000 seamen were lost in one night, a far higher figure, about one third of the seamen in the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-37522-3 |last=Lamb |first=Hubert |title=Historic Storms of the North Sea, British Isles and Northwest Europe |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{HMS|Shrewsbury|1695|2}} narrowly escaped a similar fate. More than 40 merchant ships were also lost.&lt;ref name=Jerrold&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Jerrold |year=1907 |title=Highways and Byways in Kent |pages=142–143 |publisher=Macmillan |url=https://archive.org/stream/highwaysandbywa02jerrgoog#page/n165/mode/1up }}&lt;/ref&gt;
