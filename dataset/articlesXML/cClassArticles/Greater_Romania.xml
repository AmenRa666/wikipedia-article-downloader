The union of [[Michael the Brave]], who ruled over the three principalities with Romanian population ([[Wallachia]], [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvania]] and [[Moldavia]]) for a short period of time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Juliana Geran Pilon&quot;/&gt; was viewed in later periods as the precursor of a modern [[Romania]], a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by [[Nicolae Bălcescu]]. This theory became a point of reference for [[Romantic nationalism|nationalists]], as well as a catalyst for various Romanian forces to achieve a single Romanian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Giurescu | first = Constantin C. | authorlink = Constantin C.

The [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Romanian revolution]] in 1848 already carried the seeds of the national dream of a unified and united Romania,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivan T.

However, before the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], the elite of the Transylvanian Romanians did not support the concept of &quot;Greater Romania&quot;, instead they wanted only equality with the other nations in Transylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivan T.

===World War I===
The [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)]] was signed between [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] on 4 ([[Old Style]])/17 ([[New Style]]) August 1916 in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=Kiritescu&gt;[[Constantin Kirițescu]], &quot;''Istoria războiului pentru întregirea României: 1916-1919''&quot;, 1922, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in [[Austria-Hungary]]. The signatories bound themselves to keep secret the contents of the treaty until a general peace was concluded.

{{Quote| 
''Romanians!''

''The war which for the last two years has been encircling our frontiers more and more closely has shaken the ancient foundations of Europe to their depths.

''It has brought the day which has been awaited for centuries by the national conscience, by the founders of the Romanian State, by those who united the principalities in the war of independence, by those responsible for the national renaissance.''

''It is the day of the union of all branches of our nation.  Today we are able to complete the task of our forefathers and to establish forever that which Michael the Great was only able to establish for a moment, namely, a Romanian union on both slopes of the Carpathians.''

''For us the mountains and plains of Bukowina, where Stephen the Great has slept for centuries.  In our moral energy and our valour lie the means of giving him back his birthright of a great and free Rumania from the Tisza to the Black Sea, and to prosper in peace in accordance with our customs and our hopes and dreams.''

===Interwar Romania===
[[File:GreaterRomaniaHistoricRegions.png|thumb|right|250px|Regions of the Kingdom of Romania (1918–1940)]]
The concept of ''&quot;Greater Romania&quot;'' materialized as a geopolitical reality after the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berteanu&quot;/&gt; Romania gained control over [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]] and [[Transylvania]]. The borders established by the treaties concluding the war did not change until 1940. The resulting state, often referred to as &quot;România Mare&quot; or, alternatively, as {{lang-ro|România Întregită}} (roughly translated in English as &quot;Romania Made Whole,&quot; or &quot;Entire Romania&quot;), was seen as the 'true', ''whole'' Romanian state, or, as Tom Gallagher states, the &quot;[[Holy Grail]] of [[National awakening of Romania|Romanian nationalism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher&quot; &gt;{{cite book |author=Gallagher, Tom | title= Modern Romania: the end of communism, the failure of democratic reform, and the theft of a nation | publisher= [[New York University Press]] | location=New York |year= 2005 | page= 28 | isbn= 0-8147-3172-4 | oclc= | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its constitution, proclaimed in 1923, &quot;largely ignored the new ethnic and cultural realities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchins&quot;&gt;Keith Hitchins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ytAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Concise+History+of+Romania++By+Keith+Hitchins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bJZqU7vUCOWuyQHRwYDoBA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Concise%20History%20of%20Romania%20%20By%20Keith%20Hitchins&amp;f=false A Concise History of Romania], Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. 183, ISBN 9781107782709&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian ideology changed due to the demographic, cultural and social alterations, however the nationalist desire for a homogeneous Romanian state conflicted with the multiethnic, multicultural truth of Greater Romania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livezeanu&quot;/&gt; The ideological rewriting of the role of ''&quot;spiritual victimization&quot;'', turning it into ''&quot;spiritual police''&quot;, was a radical and challenging task for the Romanian intellectuals because they had to entirely revise the national identity and the destiny of the Romanian nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;icr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ro/bucharest/identity-and-destiny-ideas-and-ideology-in-interwar-romania-29-2007/ideas-and-ideology-in-interwar-romania.html |title=Ideas And Ideology In Interwar Romania|publisher=www.icr.ro |year=2007 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this view, Livezeanu states that the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Great Union]] created a ''&quot;deeply fragmented&quot;'' interwar Romania where the determination of national identity met with great difficulties mainly because of the effects of the hundred years of political separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conflicted Memories&quot;&gt;Konrad Hugo Jarausch, Thomas Lindenberger, Annelie Ramsbrock, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k6rwRi-5UqQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Conflicted+Memories:+Europeanizing+Contemporary+Histories&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kbZ5U5eDHceyPPzSgLAH&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Conflicted%20Memories%3A%20Europeanizing%20Contemporary%20Histories&amp;f=false Conflicted Memories: Europeanizing Contemporary Histories], Berghahn Books, 2007, pp. 39-42&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inability of the government to solve the problems of the Transylvanian Romanians' integration and the effects of the [[Great Depression|worldwide economic depression]] ''&quot;the population gradually lost its faith in the democratic conception of Greater Romania&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kührer-Wielach, Florian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://othes.univie.ac.at/28458/ |title=Siebenbürgen ohne Siebenbürger? |publisher=University of Vienna |year=2013 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Territorial changes====

=====Bessarabia=====
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1920)|Union of Bessarabia with Romania}}
{{See also|Tatarbunary Uprising}}
Bessarabia declared its sovereignty as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] in 1917 by the newly formed &quot;Council of the Country&quot; (&quot;[[Sfatul Țării]]&quot;) The state was faced with the disorderly retreat through its territory of [[Russia]]n troops from disbanded units. In January 1918, the &quot;Sfatul Ţării&quot; called on Romanian troops to protect the province from the [[Bolshevik]]s who were spreading the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Nistor]], ''Istoria Basarabiei'', Cernăuți, 1923, reprinted Chișinău, Cartea Moldovenească, 1991 and [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1991.

Of the 138 deputies in the council, 86 voted for union, 3 against, 36 abstained (mostly the deputies representing minorities, 52% of the population at the time)&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=31 Results of the 1897 Russian Census at demoscope.ru: Молдавский и румынский:  469,852; 451067; total population--&quot;Moldavian and Romanian: 920,919 people&quot;,]&lt;/ref&gt; and 13 were not present. The [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]] recognized the incorporation of Bessarabia through the [[Treaty of Paris (1920)|Treaty of Paris]]. The [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] however refused to do so, the latter maintaining a claim to the territory for the whole interwar period. Furthermore, Japan failed to ratify the treaty, which therefore never entered into force.

Transylvania (the last of the three regions to join) joined Romania by the &quot;Proclamation of Union&quot; of [[Alba Iulia]] adopted by the Deputies of the Romanians of Transylvania, and supported one month later by the vote of the Deputies of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons of Transylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hupchick1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis P.

===World War II losses===

{{Main|Romania during World War II}}
In 1940, the Romanian state agreed to cede Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]], as provided for by the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] between the Soviet Union and [[Germany]]. It also lost Northern Bukovina and the [[Herța region]], which were not mentioned in the pact, to the Soviet Union. It lost [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary, through the [[Second Vienna Award]], and the [[Southern Dobruja]] to Bulgaria by the [[Treaty of Craiova]]. In the course of World War II, Romania, which was allied with the [[Axis Powers]], not only re-annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, but also took under administrative control lands to the east of Dniester (parts of recently formed [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]], and of [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa]] and [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia]] oblasts of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]), creating [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria Governorate]]. [[File:RECENSAMANT 1941 JUDETE.png|thumb|250px|Population structure in Romania (Transnistria Governorate included) according to the 1941 census.]]Despite clear Ukrainian majority in the governorate's ethnic composition, demonstrated by census conducted in December 1941, Romanian government hoped to annex it eventually as a &quot;compensation&quot; for [[Northern Transylvania]] lost to [[Hungary]].

These territories were lost again when the tide of the war turned. After the war, Romania regained the Transylvanian territories lost to Hungary, but not territory lost to Bulgaria or the Soviet Union. In 1948 a treaty between the Soviet Union and Soviet-occupied [[Communist Romania]] also provided for the transfer of four uninhabited islands to the Soviet Union, three in the [[Danube Delta]] and [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] in the [[Black Sea]].

===After World War II===
{{See also|National Communism in Romania}}
After the war, the concept was interpreted as &quot;obsolete&quot; because of the Romanian defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard A. Cook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hafLHZgZtt4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Europe+Since+1945:+An+Encyclopedia,+Volume+2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Br5vU_v_I4LOOOnugIAP&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Europe%20Since%201945%3A%20An%20Encyclopedia%2C%20Volume%202&amp;f=false Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Volume 2], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, p. 1074&lt;/ref&gt; However, even the Communist politicians between 1944 and 1947 plainly supported the re-establishment of Greater Romania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roe&quot;/&gt; [[Gheorghe Apostol]]'s reminiscence strengthens the view for the nationalist argument of the Communists at the negotiations with Stalin about the future of Northern Transylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conflicted Memories&quot;/&gt; In contrast with this view, Romsics quotes [[Valter Roman]], one of the heads of the Romanian Communist Party, as writing in his memo of April 1944: ''&quot;the two parts of Transylvania should be reunited as an independent state.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Ignác Romsics, The Paris Peace Treaty of 1947, In: [http://www.bv.ipzs.it/bv-pdf/0061/MOD-VP-13-01-017_1924_1.pdf Storia &amp; Diplomazia Rassegna dell’Archivio Storico del Ministero degli Affari Esteri], 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian Communist politicians' behavior were depicted{{By whom|date=August 2015}} as nationalist, and this circumstance brought about the concept of [[National Communism in Romania|National Communism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Roe&quot;/&gt; which amalgamated elements of [[Stalinism]] and [[Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Costica Bradatan, Serguei Oushakine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cK9H35gDSz4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=In+Marx%27s+Shadow:+Knowledge,+Power,+and+Intellectuals+in+Eastern+Europe+and+Russia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UDhxU8XjDsm57AbF7oHoCw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20Marx's%20Shadow%3A%20Knowledge%2C%20Power%2C%20and%20Intellectuals%20in%20Eastern%20Europe%20and%20Russia&amp;f=false In Marx's Shadow: Knowledge, Power, and Intellectuals in Eastern Europe and Russia], Lexington Books, 2010, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; According to Trond Gilberg the regime needed the strongly nationalist attitude because of the social, economic and political challenges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roe&quot;&gt;Paul Roe, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rxGAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=Ethnic+Violence+and+the+Societal+Security+Dilemma&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtFsU-mQK4uT0AWbhIEw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnic%20Violence%20and%20the%20Societal%20Security%20Dilemma&amp;f=false Ethnic Violence and the Societal Security Dilemma], Routledge, 2004, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; After the retreat of the [[Soviet]] troops from Romania in 1958, the national ideology was reborn, however it raises questions about its reconcilability with [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] Stalinism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conflicted Memories&quot;/&gt; [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] fancied the idea that the creation of Greater Romania was the fruit of the end of the nation-formation process.{{Quote|''The setting up of the (Romanian) unitary national state six and a half decades ago was a brilliant historic victory of the long heroic struggle of the masses for creating the Romanian nation and the coming true of the age old dream of all Romanians to live in unity within the borders of the same country, in one free and independent state.''|Ceaușescu, 1983&lt;ref name=&quot;Conflicted Memories&quot;/&gt; }}

The fall of the socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the economic downturn accompanying it led to a resurgence of nationalism in the region. Romania and Moldova, state comprising the bulk of Bessarabia which had become independent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, confronted with their eastern neighbor, [[Ukraine]]. Bucharest and [[Chișinău]] announced territorial claims on Ukrainian lands (on parts of [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]] and [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa]] regions).&lt;ref&gt;Bohdan Nahaylo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iPCPxwubpYUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Ukrainian+Resurgence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xvN5U4jhMtSM7AbIroDoBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ukrainian%20Resurgence&amp;f=false The Ukrainian Resurgence], C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 1999, pp. 408-409&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulgaria]] surmised that the concept of Greater Romania stood behind Romanian foreign policy toward Moldova therefore expressed concerns about possible developments on [[Dobruja]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbatov&quot;/&gt;

In 1992, the issue on unification of [[Moldova]] and Romania was negotiated between Romanian and Moldovan governments and they wanted to achieve it until the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moldova - Narrative&quot;/&gt; However, the &quot;unionists&quot; lost their dominance in Moldova in the middle of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moldova - Narrative&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/ir/cews/database/Moldova/moldova.pdf |title=Ideas And Ideology In Interwar Romania|publisher=University of Southern California|date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bucharest]] admitted the existence of the two Romanian states (Romania and Moldova) and defined priorities in reference to this matter: ''&quot;the creation of a common cultural space; the creation of an economically integrated zone; and gradual political integration&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbatov&quot;&gt;Alekseĭ Georgievich Arbatov, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ArKtx7XsMHAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Managing+Conflict+in+the+Former+Soviet+Union:+Russian+and+American+Perspectives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tfh5U8iTHYe4O8fFgegJ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Managing%20Conflict%20in%20the%20Former%20Soviet%20Union%3A%20Russian%20and%20American%20Perspectives&amp;f=false Managing Conflict in the Former Soviet Union: Russian and American Perspectives], MIT Press, 1997, pp. 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; The Moldovan [[Mircea Snegur|Snegur]] government became more pragmatic and realized that the nationalist propaganda from Bucharest did not help their aims especially on the problem of &quot;Soviet annexed Bessarabia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbatov&quot;/&gt; The Romanian organizations ignored the result of the [[Moldovan referendum, 1994|Moldovan referendum on independence]] because the referendum did not ask Romanians in Romania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbatov&quot;/&gt; Romanian politicians blamed [[Russia]] and the Moldovan regime that unification became unreal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbatov&quot;/&gt; According to Edward Ozhiganov (Head of the Division for Ethnopolitical Research at the Analytical Center of the Federation Council in Russia), the armed conflict in Moldova was due to the Romanian ethnic nationalism, in other words, ''&quot;the attempt to create a unitary, ethnic state with power concentrated in the hands of ethnic nationalists in what was actually a multiethnic society.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbatov&quot;/&gt;

Bucharest's behavior toward Ukraine did not change until 1997 when Romanian politicians realized that resolving border disputes were a precondition for [[NATO]] membership.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Dyczok, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iTX_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22ukraine%27s+only+western+neighbour%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=opt7U4LwD8Sy7Abr14G4Ag&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ukraine's%20only%20western%20neighbour%22&amp;f=false Ukraine: Movement Without Change, Change Without Movement], Routledge, 2013, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Present-day Romanian extremists (such as members of [[Greater Romania Party|PRM]]) aim to take possession of territories of northern [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Mares&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Radu Cinpoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id-moe/09408.pdf |title=THE EXTREME RIGHT IN CONTEMPORARY ROMANIA|publisher=http://library.fes.de/ |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regions currently belong to Ukraine and Moldova.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Mares&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepsr.com/clanek.php?ID=367 |title=The Extreme Right in Eastern Europe and Territorial Issues|publisher=www.cepsr.com |year=2009 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian presence and the tense political situation in Moldova also inflame the demands of extremist Romanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Mares&quot;/&gt;  Nevertheless, radicals make territorial demands on Hungary too.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Mares&quot;/&gt; The [[Greater Romania Party]] (Partidul România Mare – PRM) is an emblematic representative of the aforesaid concept, though the conception is fostered also by other right-wing groups (e.g. the organisation of the New Right –[[Noua Dreaptă]] with paramilitary inclinations{{Dubious |reason=I never heard that they would have guns, many are just football ultras|date=May 2014}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Mares&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Backes, Patrick Moreau, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uMkEZnJQHksC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=%22Noua+Dreapt%C4%83%22+%22paramilitary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4tyU_e2BIeO0AXxn4DwCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Noua%20Dreapt%C4%83%22%20%22paramilitary%22&amp;f=false The Extreme Right in Europe: Current Trends and Perspectives], Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2011, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;
