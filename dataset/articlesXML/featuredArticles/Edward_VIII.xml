'''Edward VIII''' (Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David; 23 June 1894 – 28 May 1972) was [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]], and [[Emperor of India]], from 20 January 1936 until his [[abdication]] on 11 December the same year.

Edward was the eldest son of [[George V|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He was named [[Prince of Wales]] on his sixteenth birthday, nine weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, he served in the [[British Army]] during the [[World War I|First World War]] and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father.

Edward became king on his father's death in early 1936. However, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|constitutional crisis]] by proposing marriage to [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective [[queen consort]]. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the [[Church of England]], which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew that the British government, led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]], would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]]. When it became apparent that he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, [[George VI]]. With a reign of 326 days, Edward was one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.

After his abdication, he was made [[Duke of Windsor]]. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple toured Germany. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was at first stationed with the [[British Military Mission to France]] but, after private accusations that he held [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathies, he was appointed [[List of Governors of the Bahamas|Governor]] of [[the Bahamas]]. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France.

==Early life==
[[File:George, Duke of York, and his children.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Edward (second from left) with his father [[George V|George, Duke of York (later George V)]], and his younger brother and sister ([[George VI|Prince Albert (later George VI)]] and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]]), photograph by George's mother [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], 1899]]
Edward was born on 23 June 1894 at [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]], on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son of the [[Duke of York|Duke and Duchess of York]] (later [[George V|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]). His father was the son of the [[Prince of Wales|Prince and Princess of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]). His mother was the eldest daughter of the [[Duke of Teck|Duke and Duchess of Teck]] ([[Francis, Duke of Teck|Francis]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Mary Adelaide]]). At the time of his birth, he was third in the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession to the throne]], behind his grandfather and father.

He was baptised Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David in the Green Drawing Room of White Lodge on 16 July 1894 by [[Edward White Benson]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref group=&quot;N&quot;&gt;His twelve godparents were:
[[Queen Victoria]] (his paternal great-grandmother); the [[Christian IX of Denmark|King]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (his paternal great-grandparents, for whom his maternal uncle [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] and his paternal aunt the [[Louise, Princess Royal|Duchess of Fife]] stood proxy); the [[William II of Württemberg|King of Württemberg]] (his mother's distant cousin, for whom his granduncle the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] stood proxy); the [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Queen of Greece]] (his grandaunt, for whom his paternal aunt [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (his granduncle, for whom [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] stood proxy); the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] (his paternal grandparents); the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsarevich]] (his father's cousin); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (his maternal granduncle and Queen Victoria's cousin); and the [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]] (his maternal grandparents).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page – Royal Christenings|author=Demoskoff, Yvonne|date=27 December 2005|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names were chosen in honour of [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Edward's late uncle]], who was known to his family as &quot;Eddy&quot; or Edward, and his great-grandfather King [[Christian IX of Denmark]]. The name Albert was included at the behest of Queen Victoria for her late husband [[Albert, Prince Consort]], and the last four names – [[Saint George|George]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] and [[Saint David|David]] – came from the [[Patron Saint]]s of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He was always known to his family and close friends by his last given name, David.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

As was common practice with upper-class children of the time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 7; Ziegler, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.

Edward's father, though a harsh disciplinarian,&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, pp. 25–28&lt;/ref&gt; was demonstrably affectionate,&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother displayed a frolicsome side with her children that belied her austere public image. She was amused by the children making tadpoles on toast for their French [[schoolmaster|master]],&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged them to confide in her.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Prince of Wales 9.2 inch gun HMS Hindustan Flickr 4454627308 cd3c9739e8 o.jpg|thumb|upright|Edward as a midshipman on board [[HMS Hindustan (1903)|HMS ''Hindustan'']], 1910]]
Initially Edward was tutored at home by Helen Bricka. When his parents travelled the British Empire for almost nine months following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his brothers and sister for their remaining nursery years.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was kept under the strict tutorship of Hansell until nearly 13. He was taught German and French by private tutors.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;/&gt; Edward took the examination to enter [[Osborne Naval College]], and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but his father disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Following two years at Osborne College, which he did not enjoy, Edward moved on to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College]] at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. A course of two years followed by entry into the [[Royal Navy]] was planned. A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/historical-notes-the-lamentable-legacy-of-royal-parenting-1071020.html|title=Historical Notes: The lamentable legacy of royal parenting|work=Independent|date=15 February 1999|author=Kirsty McLeod|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When his father ascended the throne on 6 May 1910, following the death of Edward VII, Edward automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]], and he was created [[Prince of Wales]] a month later on 23 June 1910, his 16th birthday. Preparations began in earnest for his future duties as king. He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as [[midshipman]] for three months aboard the battleship ''[[HMS Hindustan (1903)|Hindustan]]'', then immediately entered [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], for which, in the opinion of his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually. A keen horseman, he learned how to play polo with the [[Oxford University Polo Club|university club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Polo Monthly|date=June 1914|page=300|url=http://www.hpamembers.co.uk/document_archive/yearbooks/1914%20Mar%20-%201914%20Aug.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Oxford after eight terms without any academic qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prince of Wales==
Edward was officially [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales|invested as Prince of Wales]] in a special ceremony at [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarvon Castle]] on 13 July 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Weir|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy Revised edition|year=1996|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|page=327|isbn=0-7126-7448-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician [[David Lloyd George]], Constable of the Castle and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government.&lt;ref name=&quot;duke&quot;&gt;Windsor, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Prince of Wales at the Front (Photo 24-283).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Edward during the First World War]]
When the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in 1914, Edward had reached the minimum age for active service and was keen to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, pp. 106–107 and Ziegler, pp. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt; He had joined the [[Grenadier Guards]] in June 1914, and although Edward was willing to serve on the front lines, [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured by the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 41 and Windsor, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare first-hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 111 and Windsor, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.royal.uk/edward-viii-jan-dec-1936|title=Edward VIII (Jan–Dec 1936)|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Edward (1920 portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Reginald Grenville Eves]], c. 1920]]
Throughout the 1920s, Edward, as Prince of Wales, represented his father, King George V, at home and abroad on many occasions. His rank, travels, good looks, and unmarried status gained him much public attention, and at the height of his popularity, he was the most photographed celebrity of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Broad |first=Lewis |year=1961 |title=The Abdication: Twenty-five Years After. A Re-appraisal |location=London |publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a particular interest in science and in 1926 was  president of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] when his alma mater, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], hosted the society's annual general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|location=University of Oxford 1926–27|title=Report of British Association  for the Advancement of Science|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofbritisha26repo/reportofbritisha26repo_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|publisher=British Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also visited the poverty-stricken areas of the country,&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and undertook 16 tours to various parts of the [[British Empire|Empire]] between 1919 and 1935. On a tour of Canada in 1919, he acquired the Bedingfield ranch, near [[Pekisko, Alberta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Voisey |first=Paul |title=High River and the Times: an Alberta community and its weekly newspaper, 1905–1966 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Alberta |location=Edmonton, Alberta |isbn=0-88864-411-6 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1924, he donated the [[Prince of Wales Trophy]] to the [[National Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=24967 |title=Prince of Wales Trophy |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January to April 1931, he and his brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Prince George]], travelled 18,000 miles on a tour of [[South America]], voyaging out on the [[ocean liner]] {{SS|Oropesa||2}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ecsodus.com/PSNC/fleet/O-1920.html |last=Erskine |first=Barry |title=Oropesa (II) |work=Pacific Steam Navigation Company |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returning via Paris and an [[Imperial Airways]] flight from [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport]] that landed specially in Windsor Great Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19310430-1.2.53.aspx |title=Arrival at Windsor by Air |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |publisher=[[National Library, Singapore]] |date=30 April 1931 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/45763837 |title=Princes Home |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser and Register]] |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]] |date=1 May 1931 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though widely travelled, Edward was racially prejudiced against foreigners and many of the Empire's subjects, believing that whites were inherently superior.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 158, 448&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, on a visit to Australia, he wrote of [[Indigenous Australians]]: &quot;they are the most revolting form of living creatures I've ever seen!! They are the lowest known form of human beings &amp; are the nearest thing to monkeys.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Godfrey |editor-first=Rupert |year=1998 |title=Letters From a Prince: Edward to Mrs. Freda Dudley Ward 1918–1921 |chapter=11 July 1920 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co |isbn=0-7515-2590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 the Prince agreed to be President of the organising committee for the proposed [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley Park]], north-west [[London]]. The Prince wished the Exhibition to include &quot;a great national sports ground&quot;, and so played a part in the creation of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.brent.gov.uk/media/387533/The%20British%20Empire%20Exhibition.pdf|title=The British Empire Exhibition, 1924/25|last=Grant|first=Philip|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, during the First World War, he began a love affair with Parisian [[courtesan]] Marguerite Alibert, who kept a collection of his indiscreet letters after he broke off the affair in 1918 to begin one with an English married woman, [[Freda Dudley Ward]], a textile heiress. In 1923, Alibert was acquitted in a spectacular murder trial after she shot her husband in the [[Savoy Hotel|London Savoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Andrew|last=Rose|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2310957/New-documentary-suggests-Edward-VIIIs-lover-got-away-murder.html|title=A new documentary suggests Edward VIII's former lover got away with murder thanks to a royal cover-up|date=19 April 2013|work=The Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward's womanising and reckless behaviour during the 1920s and 1930s worried Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], King George V, and those close to the prince. [[Alan Lascelles]], Edward's private secretary for eight years during this period, believed that &quot;for some hereditary or physiological reason his normal mental development stopped dead when he reached adolescence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Alan Lascelles|author=Lascelles, Sir Alan 'Tommy'|title=Prince Charmless: A damning portrait of Edward VIII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-417388/Prince-Charmless-A-damning-portrait-Edward-VIII.html| journal=Daily Mail|date=20 November 2006|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; George V was disappointed by Edward's failure to settle down in life, disgusted by his affairs with married women, and was reluctant to see him inherit the Crown. &quot;After I am dead,&quot; George said, &quot;the boy will ruin himself in 12 months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Middlemas|first=Keith|authorlink=Keith Middlemas|last2=Barnes|first2=John|title=Baldwin: A Biography|year=1969|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0-297-17859-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-in-line to the throne was Edward's younger brother [[George VI|Albert]] (&quot;Bertie&quot;). Albert and his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]] (later the [[Queen Mother]]), had two children, including [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] (&quot;Lilibet&quot;), the future Queen Elizabeth II. George V favoured Albert and granddaughter Elizabeth, and told a courtier, &quot;I pray to God that my eldest son [Edward] will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Airlie|first=Mabell|authorlink=Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie|title=Thatched with Gold|year=1962|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that Edward teased his sister-in-law, by calling her &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. The magazine asked if &quot;she did not sometimes wonder how much truth there is in the story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V – which would make her nickname come true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769224,00.html|title=Foreign News: P'incess Is Three|work=Time|date=29 April 1929|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1930, George V gave Edward the lease of [[Fort Belvedere, Surrey|Fort Belvedere]], in [[Windsor Great Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; There, Edward continued his relationships with a series of married women, including Freda Dudley Ward and [[Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness|Lady Furness]], the American wife of a British peer, who introduced the prince to her friend and fellow American [[Wallis Simpson]]. Simpson had divorced her first husband, U.S. naval officer [[Earl Winfield Spencer, Jr.|Win Spencer]], in 1927.  Her second husband, [[Ernest Simpson]], was a British-American businessman. Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales, it is generally accepted, became lovers while Lady Furness travelled abroad, though Edward adamantly insisted to his father that he was not intimate with her, and that it was not appropriate to describe her as his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's relationship with Simpson, however, further weakened his poor relationship with his father.

Edward's affair with an American divorcee led to such grave concern that the couple were followed by members of the Metropolitan Police [[Special Branch]], who examined in secret the nature of their relationship. An undated report detailed a visit by the couple to an antique shop, where the proprietor later noted &quot;that the lady seemed to have POW [Prince of Wales] completely under her thumb.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|last2=Bates|first2=Stephen|title=Car dealer was Wallis Simpson's secret lover|periodical=The Guardian|date=30 January 2003|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/30/freedomofinformation.monarchy3|accessdate=1 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prospect of having an American divorcee with a questionable past having such sway over the [[heir apparent]] led to anxiety among government and establishment figures.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 231–234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==

King George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, accompanied by Simpson, he broke with custom by watching the proclamation of his own accession from a window of [[St James's Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 265; Ziegler, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] when he flew from [[Sandringham, Norfolk|Sandringham]] to London for his [[Accession Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;&gt;[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H. C. G.]] (September 2004; online edition January 2008) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31061 &quot;Edward VIII, later Prince Edward, duke of Windsor (1894–1972)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/31061}}, retrieved 1 May 2010 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward caused unease in government circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. His comment during a tour of depressed villages in [[South Wales]] that &quot;something must be done&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot; /&gt; for the unemployed coal miners was seen as an attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy he had in mind. Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently disclosing information that could be detrimental to the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward's unorthodox approach to his role also extended to the coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the opposite direction to his or her predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done),&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; to show the parting in his hair.&lt;ref&gt;A.

On 16 July 1936, an Irish fraudster called Jerome Bannigan, alias [[George McMahon (assassin)|George Andrew McMahon]], produced a loaded revolver as Edward rode on horseback at [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]], near [[Buckingham Palace]]. Police spotted the gun and pounced on him; he was quickly arrested. At Bannigan's trial, he alleged that &quot;a foreign power&quot; had approached him to kill Edward, that he had informed [[MI5]] of the plan, and that he was merely seeing the plan through to help MI5 catch the real culprits. The court rejected the claims and sent him to jail for a year for &quot;intent to alarm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january2/attempt.htm|title=George Andrew McMahon: attempt on the life of H.M.

In August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on the steam yacht ''[[Nahlin (yacht)|Nahlin]]''. By October it was becoming clear that the new king planned to marry Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between the Simpsons were brought at [[Ipswich]] [[Assizes]].&lt;ref&gt;Broad, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations for all contingencies were made, including the prospect of the coronation of King Edward and Queen Wallis. Because of the religious implications of any marriage, plans were made to hold a secular coronation ceremony, not in the traditional religious location of [[Westminster Abbey]], but in the [[Banqueting House]] in Whitehall.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', BBC One, 14 October 2007. Banqueting House staff discovered plans for the coronation, including a hand-drawn scheme for the decoration of the hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gossip about his affair was widespread in the United States, the British media kept voluntarily silent, and the public knew nothing until early December.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, pp. 44–47; Windsor, pp. 314–315, 351–353; Ziegler, pp. 294–296, 307–308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdication==
{{Main article|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}
[[File:King Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson on holiday in Yugoslavia, 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson on their Mediterranean holiday, 1936]]
On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] to [[Buckingham Palace]] and expressed his desire to marry [[Wallis Simpson]] when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the [[Church of England]], and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; As king, Edward was the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|head of the Church of England]], and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings.

Edward proposed an alternative solution of a [[morganatic marriage]], in which he would remain king but Simpson would not become queen. She would enjoy some lesser title instead, and any children they might have would not inherit the throne. This too was rejected by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]]&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other [[Dominion]] governments,&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; whose views were sought pursuant to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which provided in part that &quot;any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Statute of Westminster 1931 c.4|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/contents|publisher=UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Ministers of Australia ([[Joseph Lyons]]), Canada ([[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]) and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] ([[J. B. M. Hertzog]]) made clear their opposition to the king marrying a divorcee;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 305–307&lt;/ref&gt; their [[Irish Free State|Irish]] counterpart ([[Éamon de Valera]]) expressed indifference and detachment, while the Prime Minister of New Zealand ([[Michael Joseph Savage]]), having never heard of Simpson before, vacillated in disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with this opposition, Edward at first responded that there were &quot;not many people in Australia&quot; and their opinion did not matter.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward informed Baldwin that he would abdicate if he could not marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, Baron Beaverbook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|editor-last=Taylor|editor-first=A.

Edward duly signed the instruments&lt;ref group=&quot;N&quot;&gt;There were fifteen separate copies – one for each Dominion, the Irish Free State, India, the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Prime Minister, among others.&lt;/ref&gt; of abdication at [[Fort Belvedere, Surrey|Fort Belvedere]] on 10 December 1936 in the presence of his younger brothers: [[George VI|Prince Albert, Duke of York]], next in line for the throne; [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]]; and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the last act of his reign was the [[royal assent]] to [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]].

On the night of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, explained his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, &quot;I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edward VIII|title=Broadcast after his abdication, 11&amp;nbsp;December 1936|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/pdf/edwardviii.pdf |accessdate=1 May 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]], became first in the line of succession, as [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]].

==Duke of Windsor==
On 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]], George VI announced he was to make his brother the &quot;Duke of Windsor&quot; with the style of ''Royal Highness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34349|startpage=8111|date=12 December 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March the following year. During the interim, Edward was universally known as the Duke of Windsor. George VI's decision to create Edward a [[Dukes in the United Kingdom|royal duke]] ensured that he could neither stand for election to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] nor speak on political subjects in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram|Clive Wigram]]'s conversation with Sir [[Claud Schuster]], Clerk to the Crown and Permanent Secretary to the [[Lord Chancellor]] quoted in Bradford, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Letters Patent]] dated 27 May 1937 re-conferred the &quot;title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness&quot; upon the Duke of Windsor, but specifically stated that &quot;his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute&quot;. Some British ministers advised that the reconfirmation was unnecessary since Edward had retained the style automatically, and further that Simpson would automatically obtain the rank of wife of a prince with the style ''Her Royal Highness''; others maintained that he had lost all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated king, and be referred to simply as &quot;Mr Edward Windsor&quot;. On 14 April 1937, [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[Donald Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow|Donald Somervell]] submitted to [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] a memorandum summarising the views of [[Lord Advocate]] [[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|T. M. Cooper]], Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself:
# We incline to the view that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be described as a Royal Highness. In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.
# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.
# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General to Home Secretary (14 April 1937) National Archives file HO 144/22945 quoted in Velde, François (6 February 2006) [http://heraldica.org/topics/britain/drafting_lp1937.htm#documents_ The drafting of the letters patent of 1937]. Heraldica, retrieved 7 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ChateauCandé-B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Château de Candé]], the Windsors' wedding venue]]
The Duke of Windsor married Simpson, who had changed her name by [[deed poll]] to Wallis Warfield, in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at [[Château de Candé]], near [[Tours]], France. When the [[Church of England]] refused to sanction the union, a [[County Durham]] clergyman, the Reverend [[Robert Anderson Jardine]] (Vicar of St Paul's, [[Darlington]]), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade members of the Royal Family to attend&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Williams|first=Susan|title=The historical significance of the Abdication files|work=Public Records Office – New Document Releases – Abdication Papers, London|publisher=Public Records Office of the United Kingdom|year=2003|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/significance.htm|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of [[Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]] and [[George, Duke of Kent|Kent]] and his second cousin [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] to attend the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt;

The denial of the style ''Royal Highness'' to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the financial settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the [[Civil List]], and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing the extent of his financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] paid to him as [[Prince of Wales]] and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for [[Sandringham House]] and [[Balmoral Castle]], which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession.&lt;ref name=&quot;settlement&quot;&gt;Ziegler, pp. 376–378&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the Duke of Windsor and the rest of the Royal Family were strained for decades. The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France. King George VI (with the support of Queen Mary and his wife [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;settlement&quot; /&gt; Edward became embittered against his mother, Queen Mary, writing to her in 1939: &quot;[your last letter]&lt;ref group=&quot;N&quot;&gt;She had asked [[Alexander Hardinge, 2nd Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Alec Hardinge]] to write to the Duke explaining that he could not be invited to his father's memorial.&lt;/ref&gt; destroy[ed] the last vestige of feeling I had left for you&amp;nbsp;... [and has] made further normal correspondence between us impossible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
[[File:Duke and Duchess of Windsor meet Adolf Hitler 1937.jpg|right|thumb|The Duke and Duchess with [[Adolf Hitler]], 1937]]

In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met [[Adolf Hitler]] at his [[Obersalzberg]] retreat. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full [[Nazi salute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; The former Austrian ambassador, [[Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein]], who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, believed that Edward favoured German [[fascism]] as a bulwark against [[communism]], and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Papers of [[Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein]] (1861–1945) in the State Archives, Vienna, quoted in {{citation|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|year=1983|title=King George V|location=London|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|page=391|isbn=0-297-78245-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Duke of Windsor himself, the experience of &quot;the unending scenes of horror&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; during the First World War led him to support [[appeasement]]. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Nazi Germany and thought that [[Germany–United Kingdom relations|Anglo-German relations]] could have been improved through Edward if it were not for the abdication. [[Albert Speer]] quoted Hitler directly: &quot;I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different. His abdication was a severe loss for us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Speer|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Speer|title=Inside the Third Reich|year=1970|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke and Duchess settled in France. In May 1939, the Duke was commissioned by [[NBC]] to give a radio broadcast&lt;ref name=commission/&gt; (his first since abdicating) during a visit to the battlefields of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. In it he appealed for peace, saying &quot;I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war.&quot; The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Reynolds (British historian)|David Reynolds]], &quot;Verdun – The Sacred Wound&quot;, episode 2. BBC Radio 4, first broadcast 24 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Charman, &quot;The Day We Went to War&quot;, 2009, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely seen as supporting appeasement,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BBC]] refused to broadcast it.&lt;ref name=commission&gt;Bradford, p. 285; Ziegler, pp. 398–399&lt;/ref&gt; It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 May 1939, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''The Times'', 9 May 1939, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, they were brought back to Britain by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] on board [[HMS Kelly|HMS ''Kelly'']], and the Duke, although an honorary [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]], was made a [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]] attached to the British Military Mission in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;/&gt; In February 1940, the German ambassador in [[The Hague]], [[Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda]], claimed that the Duke had leaked the Allied war plans for the defence of Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/documentsongerma014726mbp#page/n871/mode/2up No. 621]: Minister Zech to State Secretary [[Ernst von Weizsäcker|Weizsäcker]], 19 February 1940, in ''Documents on German Foreign Policy 1918–1945'' (1954), Series D, Volume VIII, p. 785, quoted in Bradford, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; which the Duke later denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=McCormick, Donald|year=1963|title=The Mask of Merlin: A Critical Biography of David Lloyd George|page=290|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|lccn=64-20102|url=https://archive.org/stream/maskofmerlinacri000286mbp#page/n307/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Germany [[Battle of France|invaded]] the north of France in May 1940, the Windsors fled south, first to [[Biarritz]], then in June to Spain. In July the pair moved to [[Lisbon]], where they lived at first in the home of [[Banco Espírito Santo|Ricardo de Espírito Santo]], a Portuguese banker with both British and German contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Under the code name [[Operation Willi]], Nazi agents, principally [[Walter Schellenberg]], plotted unsuccessfully to persuade the Duke to leave Portugal and return to Spain, kidnapping him if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, pp. 86, 102; Ziegler, pp. 430–432&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote|Lord Caldecote]] wrote a warning to [[Winston Churchill]]: &quot;[the Duke] is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill threatened the Duke with a [[court-martial]] if he did not return to British soil.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Cascais.jpg|thumb|left|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor in [[Cascais]], Portugal. 1940]]

In July 1940, Edward was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. The Duke and Duchess left Lisbon on 1 August aboard the [[American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines|American Export Lines]] steamship ''Excalibur'', which was specially diverted from its usual direct course to [[New York City]] so that they could be dropped off at [[Bermuda]] on the 9th.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, pp. 93–94, 98–103, 119&lt;/ref&gt; They left Bermuda for [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the Canadian steamship [[Canadian National Railway#East Coast|''Lady Somers'']] on 15 August, arriving two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, p. 119; Ziegler, pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke did not enjoy being governor and referred to the islands as &quot;a third-class British colony&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when the Duke and Duchess planned to cruise aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, [[Axel Wenner-Gren]], whom British and American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of [[Luftwaffe]] commander [[Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, pp. 154–159, 230–233; {{citation|last=Luciak|first=Ilja|chapter=The Life of Axel Wenner-Gren–An Introduction|title=Reality and Myth: A Symposium on Axel Wenner-Gren|editor1-first=Ilja|editor1-last=Luciak|editor2-first=Bertil|editor2-last=Daneholt|location=Stockholm|publisher=Wenner-Gren Stiftelsirna|year=2012|url=http://blog.wennergren.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AW-G-Conference-Book-2012.pdf|pages=12–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire. He said of [[Étienne Dupuch]], the editor of the ''Nassau Daily Tribune'': &quot;It must be remembered that Dupuch is more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; He was praised, even by Dupuch, for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in 1942, even though he blamed the trouble on &quot;mischief makers – communists&quot; and &quot;men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 471–472&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned the post on 16 March 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;/&gt;

Many historians have suggested that Hitler was prepared to reinstate Edward as king in the hope of establishing a fascist Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathised with fascism before and during the Second World War, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings. In 1940 he said: &quot;In the past 10 years Germany has totally reorganised the order of its society&amp;nbsp;... Countries which were unwilling to accept such a reorganisation of society and its concomitant sacrifices should direct their policies accordingly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; During the occupation of France, the Duke asked the German forces to place guards at his Paris and Riviera homes; they did so.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1940, the Duke gave [[Fulton Oursler]] of ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'' magazine an interview at [[Government House, The Bahamas|Government House]] in Nassau. The interview was published on 22 March 1941 and in it the Duke was reported to have said that &quot;Hitler was the right and logical leader of the German people&quot; and that the time was coming for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to mediate a peace settlement. Oursler conveyed the content of the interview to the President in a private meeting at the [[White House]] on 23 December 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=95ARBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160|title=17 Carnations: The Windsors, The Nazis and The Cover-Up|first=Andrew|last=Morton|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|year=2015|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke protested that he had been misquoted and misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies became sufficiently disturbed by German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited [[Palm Beach, Florida]], in April 1941. [[Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg]] (then a monk in an American monastery) had told the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] that the Duchess had slept with the German ambassador in London, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], in 1936, had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Evans|first=Rob|last2=Hencke|first2=David|title=Wallis Simpson, the Nazi minister, the telltale monk and an FBI plot|periodical=The Guardian|date=29 June 2002|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/29/research.monarchy|accessdate=2 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] claimed that [[Anthony Blunt]], an [[MI5]] agent, acting on orders from the [[British Royal Family]], made a successful secret trip to [[Schlosshotel Kronberg|Schloss Friedrichshof]] in Germany towards the end of the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Higham (biographer)|Higham, Charles]] (1988), ''The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life'', New York: McGraw-Hill Publishers, pp. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt; What is certain is that George VI sent the [[Royal Librarian]], [[Owen Morshead]], accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|German Empress Victoria]], the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the [[Royal Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Duke admitted in his memoirs that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: &quot;[the] Führer struck me as a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, journalist [[Frank Giles]] heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] for helping to &quot;precipitate the war through his treatment of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]&amp;nbsp;... that's what [Eden] did, he helped to bring on the war&amp;nbsp;... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/wallis-simpson-that-woman-after-the-abdication/|title=Wallis Simpson, 'That Woman' After the Abdication|date=1 November 2011|work=New York Times|author=Sebba, Anne|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:The Duke of Windsor (1945).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Duke in 1945]]

At the end of the war, the couple returned to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never occupied another official role after his wartime governorship of the Bahamas. The Duke's allowance was supplemented by government favours and illegal currency trading.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Paris provided the Duke with [[Villa Windsor|a house at 4 Route du Champ d'Entraînement]], on the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] side of the [[Bois de Boulogne]], for a nominal rent.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 534–535&lt;/ref&gt; The French government exempted him from paying income tax,&lt;ref name=&quot;p53&quot;&gt;Roberts, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tax&gt;Bradford, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple were able to buy goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary.&lt;ref name=tax/&gt; In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, ''A King's Story'', in which he expresses disagreement with liberal politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;duke&quot;/&gt; The royalties from the book added to their income.&lt;ref name=&quot;p53&quot;/&gt; Nine years later, he penned a relatively unknown book, ''A Family Album'', chiefly about the fashion and habits of the Royal Family throughout his life, from the time of [[Queen Victoria]] to that of his grandfather and father, and his own tastes.

The Duke and Duchess effectively took on the role of celebrities and were regarded as part of [[café society]] in the 1950s and 1960s. They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; [[Gore Vidal]], who met the Windsors socially, reported on the vacuity of the Duke's conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Vidal|first=Gore|authorlink=Gore Vidal|title=Palimpsest: a memoir|year=1995|isbn=0-679-44038-0|page=206|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple doted on the [[pug]] dogs they kept.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001), ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', New York: Penguin Books, p. 48, ISBN 0-7394-2025-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1953, instead of attending the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in London, the Duke and Duchess watched the ceremony on television in Paris. The Duke said that it was contrary to precedent for a Sovereign or former Sovereign to attend any coronation of another. The Duke was paid to write articles on the ceremony for the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' and ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'', as well as a short book, ''The Crown and the People, 1902–1953''.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 539–540&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nixon and the Windsors.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1970]]

In 1955, they visited President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at the White House. The couple appeared on [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s television interview show ''[[Person to Person]]'' in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |periodical=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824447,00.html|date=8 October 1956|title=Peep Show|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 50-minute BBC television interview in 1970. That year, they were invited as guests of honour to a dinner at the White House by President [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press International|UPI]]. &quot;Duke, Duchess Have Dinner With Nixons&quot; ''[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]'' (Hendersonville, North Carolina) 6 April 1970; p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Family never fully accepted the Duchess. Queen Mary refused to receive her formally. However, the Duke sometimes met his mother and brother George VI, and attended George's 1952 funeral. Queen Mary remained angry with Edward and indignant over his marriage to Wallis: &quot;To give up all this for that&quot;, she said.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the Duke and Duchess returned to London. They were visited by Elizabeth II, [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark|Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood]]. A week later, the Princess Royal died, and they attended her memorial service. In 1967, they joined the Royal Family for the centenary of Queen Mary's birth. The last royal ceremony the Duke attended was the funeral of Princess Marina in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 554–556&lt;/ref&gt; He declined an invitation from Elizabeth II to attend the [[investiture of the Prince of Wales]] in 1969, replying that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] would not want his &quot;aged great-uncle&quot; there.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 555&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was operated on by [[Michael E. DeBakey]] in [[Houston]] for an [[aneurysm]] of the [[abdominal aorta]], and in February 1965 a [[Retinal detachment|detached retina]] in his left eye was treated by Sir [[Stewart Duke-Elder]]. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] and underwent [[cobalt therapy]]. Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors in 1972 while on a state visit to France; however, only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall.

===Death and legacy===
On 28&amp;nbsp;May 1972, the Duke died at his home in Paris, less than a month before his 78th&amp;nbsp;birthday. His body was returned to Britain, [[lying in state]] at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]]. The funeral service was held in the chapel on 5&amp;nbsp;June in the presence of the Queen, the Royal Family, and the Duchess of Windsor, who stayed at Buckingham Palace during her visit. He was buried in the [[Royal Burial Ground]] behind the Royal Mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at [[Frogmore]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 556–557&lt;/ref&gt; Until a 1965 agreement with Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II, the Duke and Duchess had planned for a burial in a cemetery plot they had purchased at [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore]], where the Duchess's father was interred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Windsors had a plot at Green Mount|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick|journal=The Baltimore Sun|location=Baltimore|date=29 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frail, and suffering increasingly from [[senile dementia|dementia]], the Duchess died 14&amp;nbsp;years later, and was buried alongside her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/29/newsid_2500000/2500427.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Simple funeral rites for Duchess|date=29 April 1986|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of historians such as Philip Williamson, the popular perception today that the abdication was driven by politics rather than religious morality is false, and arises because divorce has become much more common and socially acceptable. To modern sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while married to Simpson &quot;seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation&quot; for his abdication.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Williamson, Philip|year=2007|chapter=The monarchy and public values 1910–1953|title=The monarchy and the British nation, 1780 to the present|editor=Olechnowicz, Andrzej|page=225|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84461-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms===
As [[Prince of Wales]], Edward's arms were the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]], differenced with a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[argent]], with an [[inescutcheon]] [[Royal Badge of Wales|representing Wales]] surmounted by a coronet (identical to those of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles, the current Prince of Wales]]). As Sovereign, he bore the royal arms undifferenced. After his abdication, he used the arms again differenced by a label of three points argent, but this time with the centre point bearing an imperial crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Prothero|first=David|title=Flags of the Royal Family, United Kingdom|date=24 September 2002|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-rooth.html|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
