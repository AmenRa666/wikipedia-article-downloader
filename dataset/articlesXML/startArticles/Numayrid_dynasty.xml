The '''Numayrids''' were an [[Arab]] dynasty based in [[Diyar Mudar]] (western [[Upper Mesopotamia]]). They were [[emir]]s (princes) of their namesake tribe, the Banu Numayr. The senior branch of the dynasty, founded by [[Waththab ibn Sabiq]] in 990, more or less continuously ruled the [[Euphrates]] cities of [[Harran]], [[Saruj]] and [[al-Raqqah]] until the late 11th century. In the early part of Waththab's reign (990–1019), the Numayrids also seized [[Edessa]], until the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] conquered it in the early 1030s. In 1062, the Numayrids lost al-Raqqah to their distant kinsmen and erstwhile allies, the [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasids]], while by 1081, their capital Harran and nearby Saruj were conquered by the Turkish [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] and their Arab [[Uqaylids|Uqaylid]] allies. Numayrid emirs continued to hold isolated fortresses in Upper Mesopotamia, such as [[Qal'at Najm|Qal'at an-Najm]] and Sinn Ibn Utayr near [[Samosata]] until the early 12th century, but nothing is heard of them after 1120.

As [[Bedouin]] (nomadic Arabs), most Numayrid emirs avoided settled life in the cities they controlled; rather, they ruled their [[emirate]]s (principalities) from their tribal encampments in the countryside, while entrusting administration of the cities to their [[Ghilman|''ghulams'']] (military slaves). An exception to this situation was the emir [[Mani' ibn Shabib]] (r. ca. 1044–1063), under whose reign the Numayrids reached their territorial peak. Mani' resided in Harran itself, transforming its [[Sabians|Sabian]] temple into an ornate, fortified palace. The Numayrids were [[Shia Muslim]]s and initially recognized the religious sovereignty of the [[Sunni Muslim]] [[Abbasid Caliphate]], at least nominally, but later switched allegiance to the Shia [[Fatimid Caliphate]] after the latter extended its rule into northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] in 1037. By 1060, they likely reverted to the Abbasids.

==Territory==
The Numayrids ruled the [[Diyar Mudar]] region (western Upper Mesopotamia), controlling the lands between [[Harran]], [[Saruj]] and [[al-Raqqah]] more or less continuously between 990 and 1081.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice74&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; For much of this time, they were bordered to the south and west by the [[Aleppo]]-based [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasid Emirate]], to the east by the [[Mosul]]-based [[Uqaylid dynasty|Uqaylid Emirate]], to the north by the [[Mayyafariqin]]-based [[Marwanids|Marwanid Emirate]] and to the northwest by the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice74&quot;/&gt; The Numayrids, Mirdasids and Uqaylids were [[Arabs|Arab]] dynasties and the Marwanids were [[Kurds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice74&quot;/&gt; All were independent, petty dynasties that emerged in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia in the late 10th–early 11th centuries due to the inability of the great regional powers i.e. the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the [[Cairo]]-based [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and the Byzantines, to control or annex these regions.&lt;ref&gt;Rice 1952, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; At different times, the Numayrids paid allegiance and formed loose alliances with all three powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The Numayrid [[emir]]s (princes) belonged to the Banu Numayr tribe, the dynasty's namesake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth93&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosworth|first1=Clifford Edmond|title=The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual|date=1996|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-10714-5|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2O_BQs6Sro0C&amp;pg=PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banu Numayr were a branch of the [[Banu 'Amir|Banu 'Amir ibn Sa'sa']] tribe and therefore of [[Qays]]i, or north Arabian, lineage;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth93&quot;/&gt; the Arab tribes were roughly divided into northern and southern Arabian lineages. The name &quot;Numayr&quot; is likely associated with ''nimr'', the [[Arabic]] word for &quot;[[Arabian leopard|leopard]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Della Vida&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Della Vida|first1=G. Levy|editor1-last=Bosworth|editor1-first=C.E.|editor2-last=et al.|title=The Encyclopedia of Islam, Volume 13|date=1995|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=120|edition=2nd|chapter=Numayr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of the children of 'Amir ibn Sa'sa' who became [[progenitor]]s of large branches of the tribe, Numayr was thought to have had a different maternal lineage and did not enter into any tribal alliances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Della Vida&quot;/&gt; For much of their history, the Banu Numayr were an impoverished, nomadic group that mostly engaged in [[brigand]]age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Della Vida&quot;/&gt; They did not enter the historical record until the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad era]] (668–750 CE) when they dominated the western hills of [[al-Yamamah]] in central [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Della Vida&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of their brigandage, the Banu Numayr were dispersed in an expedition by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] general [[Bugha al-Kabir]] in 846, but recuperated in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Della Vida&quot;/&gt;

Medieval chronicler [[Ibn al-Adim]] holds that the Banu Numayr migrated to Upper Mesopotamia from al-Yamamah in 921,&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; while historian [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]] puts their arrival as sometime between 940 and 955.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth93&quot;/&gt; This corresponded with the second major, post-Islamic migration of Arab tribes to Syria and Mesopotamia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann104&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; this time in association with the [[Qarmatian]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;&gt;Bianquis 2002, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Banu Numayr, many of these tribes were also branches of the Banu 'Amir from Arabia, including the [[Banu Kilab]], [[Khafaja|Banu Khafaja]], [[Banu Uqayl]] and Banu Qushayr.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Bedouin]] (nomadic Arab) groups largely uprooted the pre-established, sedentary Arab tribesmen of Upper Mesopotamia, rendered the roads unsafe for travel and severely damaged crop cultivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann104&quot;/&gt; According to 10th-century chronicler [[Ibn Hawqal]], &lt;blockquote&gt; ... the Banu Numayr ... expelled them [peasants and settled Bedouin] from some of their lands, indeed most of them, while appropriating some places and regions ... They decide over their protection and protection money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann93&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 942, Banu Numayr tribesmen served as [[auxiliaries|auxiliary]] troops for an Abbasid governor in Upper Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;/&gt; Six years later, they were employed in the same fashion by [[Sayf ad-Dawla]] (r. 945–967), the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] emir of Aleppo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;&gt;Sinclair 1990, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; against incursions by the [[Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid|Ikhshidid]] leader [[Abu al-Misk Kafur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt; Not long after, Sayf attempted to check the Bedouin tribes, whose growing strength came at the expense of the settled population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;/&gt; Thus, the Banu Numayr were driven out of Diyar Mudar and took refuge in [[Jabal Sinjar]] in [[Diyar Rabi'a]] to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt; Along with other Qaysi tribes, the Banu Numayr revolted against Sayf and the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, [[Nasir al-Dawla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; The latter expelled them to the [[Syrian Desert]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; while in 955/56,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt; Sayf gained their submission, after which he confined them to an area near the [[Khabur River]] in Diyar Mudar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt; By 957, Sayf launched another expedition against the Banu Numayr, who proved to be unruly subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;/&gt;

===Establishment in Harran===
When Sayf died in 967, his Aleppo-based [[emirate]] (principality) entered a period of administrative decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt; This hampered the Hamdanids' ability to effectively control the southeastern areas of Diyar Mudar, near the hostile Byzantine frontier, necessitating further reliance on the Banu Numayr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt; To that end, Sayf's successor, [[Sa'd al-Dawla|Sa'd ad-Dawla]], assigned members of the tribe to governorships in cities such as Harran,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt; to which he appointed an emir of the Banu Numayr, [[Wathhab ibn Sabiq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth93&quot;/&gt; In 990, the latter rebelled against the Hamdanids and declared an independent emirate in Harran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;&gt;Sinclair 1990, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; This event marked the establishment of the Numayrid dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;/&gt;

Later in 990, Waththab took over the fortified town of [[Suruç|Saruj]] to the west of Harran,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice77&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1007, he conquered [[al-Raqqah]] from its Hamdanid governor, [[Mansur ibn Lu'lu']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt; During his early reign, Waththab also annexed [[Edessa]], north of Saruj, from the Hamdanids, and granted it to his cousin Utayr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice75&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt; The capture of Edessa put the Numayrids in a strategic position vis-a-vis the Byzantines, whose territory bordered Edessa from the north and west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt; Wathhab died in 1019/20 and was succeeded by his son Shabib.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt;

===Reign of Shabib===
The Numayrids may have lost control of Harran sometime after Waththab's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann99-100&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, during Shabib's early reign, Edessa's inhabitants grew increasingly antagonistic toward Utayr, likely because he killed the city's popular deputy ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair203&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice77&quot;/&gt; In 1030, [[Marwanids#Nasr al-Dawla Ahmad ibn Marwan|Nasr ad-Dawla]], the Marwanid emir of [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Mayyafariqin]], intervened on behalf of Edessa's inhabitants, killed Utayr and captured the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt; Accounts vary as to whether Nasr ad-Dawla or the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, [[Salih ibn Mirdas]], arbitrated the division of Edessa following Utayr's fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt; In any case, a son of Utayr, known in sources only as &quot;Ibn Utayr&quot;, was appointed governor of Edessa's main citadel, while Shibl ad-Dawla, a minor Numayrid emir, was given the city's lesser citadel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt; Thus, while Edessa remained in Numayrid hands, it was effectively outside of Shabib's control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt;

In 1030/31, negotiations were initiated between the Byzantines and Ibn Utayr or the latter's Marwanid patrons over transferring Edessa's main citadel to Byzantine control; at the time, Ibn Utayr was being challenged by Shibl ad-Dawla of the lesser citadel, prompting either Ibn Utayr or the Marwanids to sell the main citadel to the Byzantine emperor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204&quot;/&gt; [[Romanus III]], for 20,000 gold [[dinar]]s and several villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; After the purchase, Shibl's forces fled, the Muslim inhabitants were massacred and the city's mosques were burned down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; Ibn Utayr, meanwhile, apparently relocated to a fortress named after him near [[Samosata]] called &quot;Sinn Ibn Utayr&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice77&quot;/&gt;

Terms between Shabib and the Byzantines were reached in 1032 and during delineation of borders, Edessa was left in Byzantine territory, while the rest of Diyar Mudar remained under Numayrid rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; For an undetermined period afterward, Shabib paid tribute to the Byzantines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice77&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice44&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Because he was unable to effectively challenge the Byzantines, Shabib focused on expanding his domain eastward and northward into Marwanid and Uqaylid territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice77&quot;/&gt; In 1033, he assaulted Uqaylid-held [[Nisibin]], but was repelled. The following year he gained Byzantine military backing and advanced against [[Amid]], the Marwanid capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice77&quot;/&gt; He retreated after a show of strength by a Marwanid–Uqaylid coalition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice77&quot;/&gt; Also in 1033/34, the city of Harran was restored to Shabib, one year after an uprising involving local peasants and ''ahdath'' (urban militiamen) which apparently targeted the [[Sabians|Sabian]] community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann99-100&quot;/&gt; The uprising came at the heel of a severe famine and plague affecting the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann99-100&quot;/&gt; By 1036, Shabib and Ibn Utayr defected from the Byzantines and joined the Marwanid–Uqaylid effort to expel the Byzantines from Edessa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Green97&quot;&gt;Green 1992, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Numayrids captured and looted the city, took several men captive and killed many of the inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt; However, they did not seize the citadel and Shabib hastily withdrew to confront a [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq]] threat to Harran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; Shabib and the Byzantines made peace in 1037 and Edessa was confirmed as a Byzantine possession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt;

The peace between Shabib and his neighbors freed him up to back his brother-in-law [[Shibl al-Dawla Nasr|Nasr ibn Salih]], the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, against the offensive of [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]], the [[Damascus]]-based, Fatimid governor of Syria in 1037;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt; The Fatimids were attempting to extend direct control over Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt; The Mirdasids, nominal vassals of the Fatimids, were members of the Banu Kilab and as such, distant kinsmen of the Banu Numayr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;&gt;Bianquis 2002, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the two tribes generally maintained friendly relations,&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and historian Thierry Bianquis holds that the &quot;Numayr–Kilab alliance ... controlled all northern Syria and much of western Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; Shabib's sister, al-Sayyida Alawiyya, who was noted for her intelligence and beauty, was married to Nasr ibn Salih and later played an important role in Aleppan politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; Al-Dizbari killed Nasr ibn Salih in May 1038 and advanced against Aleppo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt; prompting Shabib, al-Sayyida and Nasr's brother and successor [[Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal|Thimal]] to retreat to Upper Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt; Afterward, al-Sayyida married Thimal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; By 1038 Shabib paid allegiance to the Fatimids and ordered Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]] to be recognized as the Islamic sovereign in [[Friday prayer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice44&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt; This marked a formal break with the Abbasid Caliphate, whose religious legitimacy the Numayrids had previously acknowledged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice78&quot;/&gt;

===Struggle for al-Raqqah===
Shabib died without an adult heir in 1039/40, and as a result, Numayrid territory was split between his brothers Muta'in and Qawam, who jointly held Harran and al-Raqqah,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204-05&quot;&gt;Sinclair 1990, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann96&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and a certain Hasan, apparently a son of Shabib,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice79&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; who ruled Saruj.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair204-05&quot;/&gt; Shabib's death saw the start of a long feud between the Banu Numayr and Banu Kilab over al-Raqqah and the fertile pastures surrounding that city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann96&quot;/&gt; At the time of Shabib's death, al-Sayyida lived in al-Rafiqah, immediately adjacent to al-Raqqah, having moved there with Thimal after the Fatimid occupation of Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann96&quot;/&gt; She sought to seize al-Raqqah from her brothers' deputy governor, and married Thimal &quot;to uphold her authority and safeguard her
interests&quot;, according to Ibn al-Adim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice79&quot;/&gt; Thimal took over al-Raqqah,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann96&quot;/&gt; thereby expanding the Banu Kilab's tribal territory over the entire area between the [[Balikh River|Balikh]] and Euphrates rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann96&quot;/&gt; Around the same time, al-Dizbari, wary of Thimal's growing power base in Upper Mesopotamia, purchased the [[Qal'at Ja'bar]] fortress, north of the city, from Shabib's son Mani'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice79&quot;/&gt; When al-Dizbari died in 1041, Mani' immediately repossessed Qal'at Ja'bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice80&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Thimal reconciled with the Fatimids and was restored to Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice79&quot;/&gt;

Tensions over al-Raqqah increased when Mani' came of age and took charge of the Banu Numayr between 1044 and 1056.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann96&quot;/&gt; Mani' viewed himself as the rightful heir to Shabib's possessions and sought to retrieve them by force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann97&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He switched the Numayrids' formal allegiance from the Fatimids to the Seljuq sultan [[Tughril Beg]] of [[Baghdad]], who sent Mani' robes of honor and issued a decree granting him al-Raqqah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann97&quot;/&gt; In April 1056, after Mani's demand to Thimal to withdraw from al-Raqqah was refused, hostilities broke out between the two sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann97&quot;/&gt; By then, Mani' had also seized Harran from his uncles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair205&quot;&gt;Sinclair 1990, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fatimids attempted to stabilize the situation in Upper Mesopotamia and assist the anti-Seljuq general [[Al-Basasiri|Arslan al-Basasiri]], whom they sought to use to invade [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann97-98&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|[[Al-Basasiri|Arslan al-Basasiri]] was a [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid]] general who resisted the Seljuq invasion of Baghdad in 1055. He was forced out of the city and then based himself in [[al-Rahba]], where he organized his plan to retake Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann97&quot;/&gt;|group=note}} The Fatimid envoy, [[Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi|al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi]], took a highly negative view of Mani' and leaned towards supporting Thimal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann97-98&quot;/&gt; but he was later convinced by the chieftain of the [[Al-Mazeedi|Banu Mazyad]] in al-Basasiri's camp that Mani' was essential to the anti-Seljuq cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann98&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, al-Mu'ayyad conferred with Mani' and persuaded him to defect to the Fatimids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann98&quot;/&gt; In reward, al-Basasiri captured al-Raqqah from Thimal and transferred it to Mani' in October 1057.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann98&quot;/&gt; According to chronicler [[Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad|Ibn Shaddad]], al-Basasiri did not capture al-Raqqah;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann98&quot;/&gt; rather, Thimal handed over both al-Raqqah and al-Rafiqah to Mani' due to military pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zenith===
Thimal's surrender of al-Raqqah was part of a greater power shift in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia as Thimal was also compelled by the Fatimids to evacuate Aleppo in January 1058.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann99&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Mani' was given large amounts of money by the Fatimids to secure his support for al-Basasiri's campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann99&quot;/&gt; These sums enabled Mani' to firmly establish himself in Harran by constructing a palace-citadel there at the site of the former Sabian temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann99&quot;/&gt; In January 1059, al-Basasiri managed to drive out the Seljuqs from Baghdad, overthrow the Abbasid caliph [[Al-Qa'im (caliph)|al-Qa'im]] (r. 1031–1059, 1060–1075) and proclaim Fatimid suzerainty over Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann102&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Mani' was wealthier and more powerful than ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Numayrids did not assist al-Basasiri in this campaign despite their formal alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, Mani' sought to buttress the Numayrid realm in case of an Abbasid–Seljuq resurgence in Iraq;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; the lack of support to both Mani' and al-Basasiri from Cairo, which had just experienced significant political changes, may have persuaded Mani' to return to the Abbasid–Seljuq fold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann102&quot;/&gt; That year, Mani' extended Numayrid territory to its southernmost extent by capturing the Khabur/Euphrates-area fortress towns of [[al-Rahba]] and [[Circesium|al-Qarqisiyah]] (Circesium).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; Moreover, he gave refuge in Harran to al-Qa'im's four-year old grandson and heir apparent, [[al-Muqtadi|Uddat ad-Din]], who had been smuggled out of Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt;

In 1060, after al-Basisiri's forty-week reign came to an end with his defeat and execution by the Seljuqs, Mani' married one of his daughters to Uddat ad-Din to establish ties with the caliph's family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; Uddat ad-Din was then returned to Baghdad with many gifts and would later succeed al-Qa'im, who had since regained his throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; Though not explicitly mentioned in contemporary chronicles, Mani' likely reverted his allegiance to the Abbasids in the aftermath of al-Basasiri's defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; According to historian D. S. Rice, the Numayrids greatly benefited from the &quot;Basasiri incident&quot;, having taken  al-Raqqah from the Mirdasids and given large sums by the Fatimids &quot;without committing themselves&quot; to the &quot;hazardous enterprise&quot; of actually participating in al-Basasiri's coup attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; The period between 1058 and 1060 represented the peak of Numayrid power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt;

===Decline and fall===
In 1060, Mani' backed his nephew and Mirdasid ruler, [[Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud|Mahmud ibn Nasr]] (son of Nasr ibn Salih and al-Sayyida Alawiyya), against Thimal's attempt to take back Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; Mahmud was ultimately defeated and given refuge by Mani'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice81&quot;/&gt; Al-Sayyida Alawiyya then intervened and mediated a truce between Thimal and Mani'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, the latter saw another serious setback at the hands of the Mirdasids when Thimal's brother, [[Atiyya ibn Salih]], took over al-Raqqah in 1062.&lt;ref&gt;Rice 1952, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, in either July 1062 or April 1063, Mani' died of an epileptic seizure,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann103&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving no capable successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann103&quot;/&gt; Heidemann asserts that with Mani's death, &quot;the Banu Numayr lost much of their importance and soon fell into oblivion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann103&quot;/&gt;

The expansion of Seljuq power into Syria and Upper Mesopotamia, particularly following their decisive victory over the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, threatened the Numayrid emirate;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt; the defeat of the Byzantines deprived both the Numayrids and the Mirdasids of a powerful protector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; In 1081, the Uqaylid emir [[Muslim ibn Quraysh]], backed by the Seljuqs, conquered Harran from Mani's successor(s),&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt; whose names were not recorded in the sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth93&quot;/&gt; According to medieval historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], Ibn Quraysh appointed Yahya ibn ash-Shatir, a Numayrid slave and administrator who assisted Ibn Quraysh, as governor of Harran,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt; while another medieval chronicler, [[Sibt ibn al-Jawzi]], claims a certain Ja'far al-Uqayli was made governor and promoted Shia Islam there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; That same year, the Uqaylids wrested control of Saruj from Hasan, who had held it continuously since 1039.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt; Hasan was given Nisibin in exchange and ruled that city as an Uqaylid vassal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt;

In 1083, Abu Jalaba, the [[Hanbali]] ''[[qadi]]'' (chief Islamic judge) of Harran, and a Numayrid emir (either Ibn Utayr&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt; or a certain Ibn Atiyya an-Numayri&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt;) led a revolt against the Uqaylids in 1083;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt; The rebels fought in the name of a Numayrid child prince, Ali ibn Waththab,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; possibly a young son of Mani',&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice82&quot;/&gt; and took over the town for a short period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; By the end of the year, the uprising was suppressed by Ibn Quraysh, who executed Abu Jalaba, the latter's sons and about one hundred other participants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; Ibn ash-Shatir continued to administer Harran including after Ibn Quraysh's death in 1085 and was re-confirmed in his post by the Seljuq sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] in 1086.&lt;ref&gt;Rice 1952, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the Seljuqs and affiliated Turkmen tribal forces at this time effectively put an end to the reign of Arab tribal powers, including the Banu Numayr, in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt;

Despite the loss of their capital and much of their power, the Numayrids maintained a presence in the region into the 12th century, holding onto a few fortresses that were isolated from each other, including [[Qal'at Najm|Qal'at an-Najm]] on the northern Euphrates and Sinn Ibn Utayr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rice, the Banu Numayr &quot;were still spasmodically active&quot; during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt; In 1101, they killed the Uqaylid emir and Ibn Quraysh's son Muhammad ibn Muslim at [[Hīt|Hit]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and four years later suffered a heavy defeat in an attempted raid against the Seljuq general Afshin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The Numayrids, led by a certain Jawshan an-Numayri, seized al-Raqqah from its Turkmen governor Ali ibn Salim, who they killed, in 1110,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, ed. Richards, pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; but were dislodged a short time later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt; The [[Crusaders]], who had entered the region at the beginning of the century, captured Sinn Ibn Utayr from the Numayrid emir Mani' ibn Utayr an-Numayri in 1118.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt; The medieval chronicler al-Azimi recorded that the Numayrids still held Qal'at an-Najm in 1120, but nothing else is heard of the Numayrids in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt; Writing in 1952, Rice asserts that descendants of the Banu Numayr continued to live in and around Harran and were known as ''Nmēr'', a colloquial form of &quot;Numayr&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice83&quot;/&gt;

==Culture==

===Government===
[[File:Numayrid Family Tree.png|thumb|right|300px|Numayrid family tree]]

Once in power, the Numayrids resolved to protect, govern and tax the communities inhabiting the agricultural territories and towns they controlled, rather than plunder them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; This made them similar to the Bedouin tribes of Banu Kilab in northern Syria and the Uqaylids in Diyar Rabi'a.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; In contrast, other Bedouin contemporaries of the Numayrids, particularly the [[Jarrahids]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], pillaged their territory and consistently attacked the populace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, the Numayrids retained aspects of their nomadic lifestyle, including an apprehension to living in urban environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann93&quot;/&gt; As such, Numayrid emirs and chieftains refrained from residing within the cities they controlled; instead, they formed mini-principalities in the countryside surrounding their respective strongholds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt; Administration over the cities, including taxation, was entrusted to a deputy who ruled in the emir's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis180&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann93&quot;/&gt; The deputy was typically a ''[[ghilman|ghulam]]'' (military slave).&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann93&quot;/&gt; An exception to this system was Mani', who resided in Harran itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann93&quot;/&gt; According to Heidemann, &lt;blockquote&gt;The building activities in Harran and probably those in ar-Raqqa are proof that Mani' did not regard cities only as places for fiscal exploitation. He also wanted to present himself within the city as an urban ruler, while maintaining his powerbase, the Banu Numayr, in the pasture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann101&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Numayrids, like their Marwanid neighbors, used the title of ''amir'' (prince).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice57&quot;&gt;Rice 1952, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Numayrid emirs Shabib and Mani' also used the Fatimid-influenced titles ''sani'at ad-dawla'' and ''najib ad-dawla'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice57&quot;/&gt; They likely adopted these titles during periods of formal allegiance with the Fatimids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice57&quot;/&gt; The Numayrids established mints at Harran, and under Mani', at al-Raqqah as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann101&quot;&gt;Heidemann 2005, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the ruling Numayrid emirs were named on the coins, which in the medieval Islamic era symbolized sovereign rulership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann101&quot;/&gt;

===Architectural legacy===
In 1059, during his zenith, Mani' transformed the [[Sabians|Sabian]] temple of Harran into a ornate, fortified residence.&lt;ref&gt;Heidemann 2006, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations of Harran's modern citadel revealed that Mani's construction partly consisted of two small, square [[basalt]] towers connected to each other by a decorated arch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice44&quot;/&gt; Fragments of a [[Kufic]] inscription found at a basaltic block at the citadel indicates the palace's construction in 1059.&lt;ref&gt;Rice 1952, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1952, Rice states that the inscription represents the &quot;oldest Islamic text so far found at Harran and the only surviving epigraphic document of the Numairid dynasty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice57&quot;/&gt;

Heidemann holds that there was likely building activity during Mani's reign in al-Raqqah and the adjacent town of al-Rafiqah, including the possible restoration of a [[congregational mosque]] in the latter town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann101&quot;/&gt; However, there are no specifically identifiable traces of Numayrid construction in al-Raqqah/al-Rafiqah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidemann101&quot;/&gt;

===Religion===
Like the Hamdanids, Fatimids, and Banu Kilab/Mirdasids, much of the Banu Numayr followed [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis181&quot;/&gt; Initially, they paid formal allegiance to the [[Sunni Muslim]] Abbasid Caliphate, but during Shabib's last years, they switched to the Fatimid Caliphate. Under Mani', the Numayrids reverted to the Abbasids, then recognized the Fatimids in 1056–1059 before once again nominally returning to the Abbasid fold.
