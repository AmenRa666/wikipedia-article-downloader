'''USS ''Chickasaw''''' was an [[ironclad]] {{sclass-|Milwaukee|monitor|0}} [[river monitor]] built for the [[United States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The ship participated in the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] in August 1864, during which she was lightly damaged, and the bombardments of [[Fort Gaines (Alabama)|Forts Gaines]] and [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Morgan]] as Union troops besieged the fortifications defending the bay. In March–April 1865, ''Chickasaw'' again supported Union forces during the [[Mobile Campaign]] as they attacked Confederate fortifications defending the city of [[Mobile, Alabama]].

She was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] after the end of the war and sold in 1874. Her new owners converted ''Chickasaw'' into a [[train ferry]] in 1881 and renamed her ''Gouldsboro''. The ship was later converted into a [[barge]] and remained in use until she sank sometime during the 1950s. Her wreck was discovered in the [[Mississippi River]] in [[New Orleans]] in 2003, although there are no plans to raise her.

==Description==
''Chickasaw'' was {{convert|229|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|56|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=s9/&gt; The ship had a [[Glossary of nautical terms#D|depth of hold]] of {{convert|8|ft|6|in|m|1}}&lt;ref name=c4&gt;Canney, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; and a draft of {{convert|6|ft|m|1}}. She was 970 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]]&lt;ref name=s9/&gt; and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|1300|LT|t}}.&lt;ref name=ck2&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew numbered 138 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=s9&gt;Silverstone, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was powered by two 2-cylinder horizontal [[Marine steam engine|non-condensing steam engines]], each driving two propellers, using steam generated by seven tubular [[boiler (steam generator)|boilers]]. The engines were designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|9|kn|lk=in}}. ''Chickasaw'' carried {{convert|156|LT|t}} of coal.&lt;ref name=ck2/&gt;

The ship's main armament consisted of four [[smoothbore]], [[muzzle-loading]] 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s.&lt;ref name=s9/&gt; Unlike her [[sister ship|sisters]], both of her turrets were designed by [[John Ericsson]].&lt;ref name=c4/&gt; Each gun weighed approximately {{convert|16000|lb}} and could fire a {{convert|136|lb|1|adj=on}} shell up to a range of {{convert|3650|yd}} at an elevation of +15°.&lt;ref&gt;Olmstead, et al, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The cylindrical turrets were protected by eight layers of [[wrought iron]] {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} plates. The sides of the hull consisted of three layers of one-inch plates, backed by {{convert|15|in}} of pine. The [[deck (ship)|deck]] was heavily [[Camber (ship)|cambered]] to allow headroom for the crew on such a shallow draft and it consisted of iron plates {{convert|.75|in}} thick. The [[pilothouse]], positioned behind and above the fore turret, was protected by {{convert|3|in}} of armor.&lt;ref&gt;Canney, pp. 114–16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction and service==
[[James Buchanan Eads|James Eads]] was awarded the contracts for all four of the ''Milwaukee''-class ships. He subcontracted ''Chickasaw'' to Gaylord, Son and Co. of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;Piston &amp; Sweeney, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; who [[Keel|laid down]] the ship in 1862.&lt;ref name=s9/&gt; She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the [[Chickasaw Nation|Indian tribe]],&lt;ref name=chi&gt;''Chickasaw''&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 February 1864. ''Chickasaw'' was brought to [[Mound City, Illinois]], on the [[Ohio River]], on 8 May for [[fitting out]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 14 May 1864.&lt;ref name=chi/&gt;

After commissioning, ''Chickasaw'' patrolled the [[Mississippi River]] against [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] raids and ambushes for several months. She was transferred to [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[David Farragut]]'s [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]] on 9 July,&lt;ref name=chi/&gt; together with her sister {{USS|Winnebago|1863|2}}. The ship required some time to refit at New Orleans and prepare for the voyage to Mobile across the [[Gulf of Mexico]], so the two sisters did not depart New Orleans until 29 July. On the voyage down the Mississippi to the [[Head of Passes|Pass A Loutre]], ''Chickasaw'' was forced to anchor overnight because of steering problems and the two ships did not cross the [[sandbar]] at the mouth of the pass until the evening of the following day. Once in the Gulf, ''Chickasaw'' was taken under tow by the [[Paddlewheel|sidewheel]] [[gunboat]] [[SS Republic (1853)|''Tennessee'']] for the voyage across the Gulf. The two ships were forced to stop at [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|Ship Island]] so ''Chickasaw''{{'}}s engines could be repaired. That required only a day and the sidewheel gunboat {{USS|Metacomet|1863|2}} towed the monitor the rest of the way.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, pp. 108, 110, 114–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Farragut briefed [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[George H. Perkins]], ''Chickasaw''{{'}}s commander, on his ship's intended role in the battle. The larger, more heavily armed monitors {{USS|Tecumseh|1863|2}} and {{USS|Manhattan|1863|2}} were to keep the ironclad ram {{Ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}} away from the vulnerable wooden ships while they were passing Fort Morgan and then sink her. ''Chickasaw'' and ''Winnebago'' were to engage the fort until all of the wooden ships had passed. The four monitors would form the starboard column of ships, closest to Fort Morgan, with ''Chickasaw'' in the rear, while the wooden ships formed a separate column to port. The eastern side of the channel closest to Fort Morgan was free of obstacles, but &quot;torpedoes&quot;, as [[naval mine|mines]] were called at the time, were known to be present west of a prominent black [[buoy]] in the channel.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, pp. 158, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ''Milwaukee''-class ships bombarded Fort Morgan for about an hour and a half while the wooden ships passed through the mouth of [[Mobile Bay]]. ''Chickasaw'' fired 75 rounds at the fort beginning at 07:10; the return fire badly damaged her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] so that the crew was forced to use [[tallow]] and [[coal tar]] to generate enough steam to keep the ship in the fight. She engaged the ''Tennessee'' two hours later until the ironclad surrendered at 10:40.&lt;ref name=o6&gt;ORN, v. 21, p. 786&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate ironclad was shooting at the wooden ships at this time at point-blank range in a chaotic [[melee]] with both sides making multiple attempts to [[naval ram|ram]] each other. ''Chickasaw'' remained off the ''Tennessee''{{'}}s stern through their engagement and fired on her at ranges between {{convert|10|to|50|yd}}. None of her 52 shells penetrated their target's armor, but they did jam shut several of the armored shutters that protected the aft [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]], including the stern gun port at 09:40.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins claimed that his ship shot away the ''Tennessee''{{'}}s [[Flagpole|flagstaff]], smokestack and the exposed steering chains that controlled her [[rudder]]. ''Chickasaw'' was struck 11 times during the action, with one shot penetrating her deck that set some of the crew's hammocks on fire.&lt;ref name=o6/&gt; Two of ''Chickasaw''{{'}}s sailors, Chief Boatswain's Mate [[Andrew Jones (Medal of Honor)|Andrew Jones]] and Master-at-Arms [[James Seanor]], were later awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for their actions during the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;moh1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;moh2&quot;/&gt;

Later that day, the ship captured a barge out from under the guns of [[Fort Powell]], a fortification guarding another entrance to Mobile Bay further north. ''Chickasaw'' fired 25 shots at the fort and was struck once, another hit on her smokestack. On 6 August, the ship bombarded Fort Gaines for two hours in support of troops besieging the fort. Beginning on 13 August, she intermittently bombarded Fort Morgan until the fort surrendered on 23 August. Between 15–17 August, ''Chickasaw'' was operating further north in Mobile Bay and engaged several of the ships defending Mobile without result.&lt;ref&gt;ORN, v. 21, pp. 786–88&lt;/ref&gt;

In March–April 1865, ''Chickasaw'' bombarded fortifications during the [[Battle of Spanish Fort|Battles of Spanish Fort]] and [[Battle of Fort Blakely|Fort Blakley]].&lt;ref name=hmdb&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eighth Iowa Line: &quot;The Very Air Was Hot&quot;|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=50602|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the ironclad {{USS|Cincinnati|1861|2}} and the steamboat {{USS|Nyanza|1863|2}}, under the overall command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Edward Simpson (naval officer)|Edward Simpson]], ''Chickasaw'' sailed up the [[Tombigbee River]] on 9 May 1865 to [[Nanna Hubba Bluff]] where Simpson accepted the surrender of the casemate ironclad [[CSS Nashville (1864)|''Nashville'']], the [[gunboat]]s [[CSS Baltic|''Baltic'']] and [[CSS Morgan|''Morgan'']], and the river boat [[CSS Black Diamond|''Black Diamond'']] from Commodore Ebenezer Ferrand.&lt;ref&gt;ORN, v. 22, pp. 72, 180&lt;/ref&gt; The monitor remained in the vicinity of Mobile Bay until 3 July when she sailed for New Orleans.[[File:Ft. Gaines Shell Hit From USS Chickasaw.jpg|thumb|Ft. Gaines Shell Hit From USS Chickasaw]]&lt;ref name=chi/&gt;

== Post-war career and heritage ==
[[File:GouldsboroFerry.jpg|thumb|right|The train ferry ''Gouldsboro'', ca. 1938]]
Upon her arrival at New Orleans on 6 July, ''Chickasaw'' was decommissioned. She temporarily bore the name ''Samson'' between 15 June and 10 August 1869 before resuming her original name. She was sold on 12 September 1874&lt;ref name=chi/&gt; to the [[New Orleans Pacific Railway Company]] who modified the ship into a coal barge with the name of ''Samson''. The railroad converted the ship into a train ferry in 1880 and changed her to side-wheel propulsion under the name ''Gouldsboro''. She was sold in the 1940s to the New Orleans Coal &amp; Bisso Towboat Co. and converted into a work barge. It sank off the Greenville Bend of the Mississippi River in New Orleans sometime during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;Schleifstein&lt;/ref&gt;

The wreck of the ''Gouldsboro'' was discovered when a section of riverbank collapsed in 2003&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] surveyed the area in 2004 to determine how best to stabilize the riverbank. There are no plans to raise the wreck, but the Corps of Engineers will preserve it in place.&lt;ref&gt;Burdeau&lt;/ref&gt;
