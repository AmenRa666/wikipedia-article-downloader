'''Dany Chamoun''' ({{lang-ar|داني شمعون}}) (26 August 1934&amp;nbsp;– 21 October 1990) was a prominent [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] politician.  A [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] Christian, the younger son of former [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President]] [[Camille Chamoun]] and brother of [[Dory Chamoun]], Chamoun was also a politician in his own right, and was known for his opposition to the occupation of Lebanese territory by foreign forces, whether [[Military of Syria|Syrian]] or [[Military of Israel|Israeli]].

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Chamoun was born in [[Deir el-Qamar]] on 26 August 1934.&lt;ref name=wofl&gt;{{cite web|title=Dany Chamoun |url=http://wars.meskawi.nl/people.html#6|publisher=Wars of Lebanon|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger son of the former President [[Camille Chamoun]]. He studied civil engineering in [[the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=tatro&gt;{{cite news|last=Tatro|first=Earleen F.|title=Lebanon: Dynasties dominate life...|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ohGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_IMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1402,1319470&amp;dq=dany+chamoun&amp;hl=en|accessdate=31 December 2012|newspaper=The Lewiston Journal|date=10 February 1983|agency=AP|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===
Chamoun reported that he had not had any interest in politics before the Lebanon civil war.&lt;ref name=tatro/&gt; He became the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] Secretary of Defense in January 1976, after the death of its predecessor Naim Berdkan. As Supreme Commander of the NLP's military wing, the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers]], he also played a major role in the early years of the [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaber&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaber|first1=Ali|title=Leader of a Major Christian Clan in Beirut Is Assassinated with His Family|work=The New York Times|page=3|date=22 October 1990|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/22/world/leader-of-a-major-christian-clan-in-beirut-is-assassinated-with-his-family.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the NLP Tigers under Dany's command along with the [[Kataeb|Phalangist]] [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]], [[Al-Tanzim]], and [[Guardians of the Cedars]] formed a joined militia command under the name [[Lebanese Forces]].

By 1980, the [[Kataeb|Phalangist]]-dominated [[Lebanese Forces]] were under the command of [[Bachir Gemayel]]. Rivalry began to arise between Bashir and Dany. Dany's Tigers were eliminated as a military force in a [[Safra massacre|massacre]] perpetrated on 7 July 1980 by the rival Phalangists. Chamoun's life was spared and he fled to the [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]]-dominated West [[Beirut]]. He then went into self-imposed exile.&lt;ref name=mg&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon's Christians|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pn8xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C6UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1470,378444&amp;dq=ehden+massacre&amp;hl=en|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=22 September 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamoun was a supporter of the nationalist Christian cause at heart, however, and he soon returned to the cause to which he, like his father, had dedicated his life. He served as General Secretary of the National Liberal Party from 1983 to 1985, when he replaced his father as the party leader.&lt;ref name=gherald&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria has Waite, says Christian leader|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RxA1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sKULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3423,524318&amp;dq=dany+chamoun&amp;hl=en|accessdate=31 December 2012|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=3 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he became President of the revived [[Lebanese Front]]—a coalition of nationalist and mainly Christian parties and politicians that his father had helped to found. The same year, he announced his candidacy for the Presidency of Lebanon to succeed [[Amine Gemayel]] (Bashir's brother), but [[Syria]] (which by this time occupied some 70 percent of Lebanese territory) vetoed his candidacy.

Gemayel's term expired on 23 September 1988 without the election of a successor. Chamoun declared his strong support for [[Michel Aoun]], who had been appointed by the outgoing president to lead an interim administration and went on to lead one of two rival governments that contended for power over the next two years. He strongly opposed the [[Taif Agreement]], which not only gave a greater share of power to the Muslim community than they had enjoyed previously, but more seriously, in Chamoun's opinion, formalized what he saw as the master-servant relationship between Syria and Lebanon, and refused to recognize the new government of the President [[Elias Hrawi]], who was elected under the Taif Agreement.

===Assassination===
On 21 October 1990, Chamoun, along with his German-born second wife Ingrid (forty-five), and his two sons, Tarek (seven) and Julian (five), were murdered.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times&quot;&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-25/news/mn-17158_1_civil-war-crimes &quot;Lebanese Ex-Warlord Sentenced in Rival's Slaying : Mideast: Christian is the first militia chief convicted of civil war crimes. Many received amnesty. Eleven associates are also sentenced.&quot;], ''Los Angeles Times'', 25 June 1995. Retrieved on 22 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 1995, the Lebanese Tribunal found [[Samir Geagea]] guilty of the assassination of Dany Chamoun and his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times&quot;/&gt; Overwhelming evidence derived from investigations led to Geagea receiving a life sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times&quot;/&gt; The heavy sentence allegedly having been issued due to Syrian occupation influence on the tribunal, Geagea was released after the Syrian departure.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Robert.
