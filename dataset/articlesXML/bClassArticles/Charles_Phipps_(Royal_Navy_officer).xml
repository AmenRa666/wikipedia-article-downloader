'''Hon. Charles Phipps''' (10 December 1753&amp;nbsp;– 20 October 1786) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]]. He served during the [[American War of Independence]], seeing action in a number of battles and engagements. He also went on to have a career in [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]].

Born into a family with naval and parliamentary connections, Phipps integrated them both into a short career. He promoted to his first commands during the American War of Independence, commanding a range of small ships off the North American coast and being active against American shipping. He spent the later part of the wars in European waters, commanding frigates, and supporting the fleets. He took part in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|first relief of Gibraltar]] in 1781, and the second in 1782. By then he was captain of a 74-gun [[ship of the line]]. He retired ashore after the war, and having embarked on a political career, represented both [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]] and [[Minehead (UK Parliament constituency)|Minehead]] before his death at a relatively young age, in 1786.

==Family and early life==
Charles Phipps was born on 10 December 1753, the second son of [[Constantine Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave]] and his wife Lepell. His elder brother, [[Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave|Constantine]], and his younger brother, [[Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave|Henry]], both went on to be politicians, with Constantine also serving as a naval officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=|title=The House of Commons: 1660–1690 ; 3, Members M–Y|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Phipps also entered the navy, and after seeing some service, was promoted to lieutenant on 19 January 1771. He is first recorded as having commissioned the [[fireship]] [[HMS Grampus (1746)|HMS ''Strombolo'']] in February 1776, and having sailed for North America in May that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield306&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|A|a|none}} The [[American War of Independence]] was being fought at this time, and after brief service on the station, Phipps was promoted to [[post-captain]] on 1 August 1776.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot;/&gt;  His first command at this level was to temporarily take over the 20-gun {{HMS|Perseus|1776|6}}, succeeding her regular captain, [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]], from August that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield262&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phipps moved to take command of the 20-gun {{HMS|Camilla|1776|6}} on 21 May 1777, remaining her captain into 1778.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield261&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Camilla'' remained off the North American coast during this time, and Phipps's next command, the 20-gun {{HMS|Ariel|1777|6}} was also based on the North American station. Phipps commissioned her in September 1778 and was active against American shipping, capturing the [[privateer]] ''New Broom'' on 22 October 1778.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield262&quot;/&gt; Phipps was replaced as captain in February 1779 by [[Thomas Mackenzie (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Mackenzie]], and in April that year commissioned the 32-gun {{HMS|Ambuscade|1773|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield195&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ambuscade'' was active in European waters, and Phipps enjoyed successes against French privateers, capturing the ''Prince de Montbarry'' on 28 June, and the 16-gun ''Hélène'' on 23 July 1779. Phipps took part in the relief of [[Guernsey]] in September 1779, and then served in [[John Reynolds (Royal Navy officer)|John Reynold's]] squadron in October. From there he moved to the [[Channel Fleet]] in 1780, which was then commanded by [[Sir Francis Geary, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Geary]], and on 4 July that year captured the privateer ''Eleonore''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield195&quot;/&gt;

==Later commands==
Phipps was then given command of the newly captured 36-gun {{HMS|Monsieur|1780|6}} in July 1780.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield212&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monsieur'' completed fitting out at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] in October 1780, and Phipps soon scored his first success with her, capturing the 20-gun ''Chevreuil'' on 15 December. He next commanded her at the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|relief of Gibraltar]] in 1781 with [[George Darby]]'s fleet, and on 10 October that year assisted {{HMS|Minerva|1780|6}} in capturing the French 22-gun ship ''Jason'' off [[Cape Clear Island|Cape Clear]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield212&quot;/&gt; His final command was the 74-gun {{HMS|Berwick|1775|6}}, which he took over in March 1782.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield67&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Berwick'' served as part of [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] fleet for the third and final relief of Gibraltar in late 1782, and was in action at the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]] on 20 October 1782. She then sailed to the [[West Indies]] with [[Sir Richard Hughes, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Hughes]]'s fleet, and arrived there in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield67&quot;/&gt; ''Berwick'' was paid off in June 1783, after the end of the American War of Independence, and Phipps went ashore, apparently having no further seagoing commands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield67&quot;/&gt;

==Political career==
Phipps had embarked on a political career during the American War of Independence, and had been elected MP for [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]] on 27 February 1779, succeeding another naval officer, [[Hugh Palliser|Sir Hugh Palliser]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot;/&gt; Phipps owed his election to the [[Admiralty]] interest in the constituency, and Palliser's support. Like his brother, Constantine, Charles was initially a supporter of the [[North Ministry]], but his naval duties often kept him away from parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot;/&gt; Constantine and Charles both abandoned the North Ministry after 1784, supporting [[William Pitt the Younger]], but though Charles contested Scarborough again in 1784, he was defeated. Another seat was found for him in June 1784, and he was elected to [[Minehead (UK Parliament constituency)|Minehead]], which he represented until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot;/&gt; Phipps died unmarried at the family seat, [[Mulgrave Castle]], [[Yorkshire]], on 20 October 1786.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Nichols|title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|page=999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
