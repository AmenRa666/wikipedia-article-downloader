'''Trinitite''', also known as '''atomsite''' or '''Alamogordo glass''', is the [[glass]]y residue left on the desert floor after the [[plutonium]]-based [[Trinity test|Trinity]] [[nuclear testing|nuclear bomb test]] on July 16, 1945, near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]]. The glass is primarily composed of [[arkosic]] sand composed of [[quartz]] grains and [[feldspar]] (both [[microcline]] and smaller amount of [[plagioclase]] with small amount of [[calcite]], [[hornblende]] and [[augite]] in a matrix of sandy [[clay]])&lt;ref name=&quot;optprop&quot;&gt;[http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM33/AM33_360.pdf Optical properties of glass from Alamogordo, New Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt; that was melted by the atomic blast. It is usually a light green, although color can vary. It is mildly radioactive but safe to handle.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, W.M., and Carlock, P.G. Trinitite, 1999, ''The Atomic Age Mineral.'' This does not link to the book. http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hiroshimatrinity/trinitite.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear weapons question'', Bad Astronomy and Universe Today Forum. May not be entirely accurate. http://www.bautforum.com/general-science/9499-nuclear-weapons-question.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Analyzing Trinitite'', Hunter Scott. http://www.hscott.net/analyzing-trinitite-a-radioactive-piece-of-nuclear-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, samples were gathered and sold to [[mineral collector]]s as a [[novelty]]. Traces of the material may be found at the Trinity Site today, although most of it was bulldozed and buried by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll L. Tyler, AEC letter to the Governor of New Mexico, July 16, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now illegal to take the remaining material from the site; however, material that was taken prior to this prohibition is still in the hands of collectors.

==Formation==
In 2005 it was theorized by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] scientist Robert Hermes and independent investigator William Strickfaden that much of the mineral was formed by sand which was drawn up inside the fireball itself and then rained down in a liquid form.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hermes and William Strickfaden, 2005, ''New Theory on the Formation of Trinitite'', Nuclear Weapons Journal http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/TrinitySite/NewTrinititeTheory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 article in ''Geology Today'', Nelson Eby of University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Robert Hermes described Trinitite: {{quote|text=Contained within the glass are melted bits of the first atomic bomb and the support structures and various radionuclides formed during the detonation. The glass itself is marvelously complex at the tens to hundreds of micrometre scale, and besides glasses of varying composition also contains unmelted quartz grains. Air transport of the melted material led to the formation of spheres and dumbbell shaped glass particles. Similar glasses are formed during all ground level nuclear detonations and contain forensic information that can be used to identify the atomic device.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinitite the atomic rock&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2451.2010.00767.x/abstract | title=Trinitite—the atomic rock | publisher=Geology Today | work=Journal Article | date=24 September 2010 | accessdate=2 September 2014 | author=Eby, N,  Hermes, R, Charnley N, Smoliga J}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The glass has been described as &quot;a layer 1 to 2 centimeters thick, with the upper surface marked by a very thin sprinkling of dust which fell upon it while it was still molten. At the bottom is a thicker film of partially fused material, which grades into the soil from which it was derived. The color of the glass is a pale bottle green, and the material is extremely vesicular with the size of the bubbles ranging to nearly the full thickness of the specimen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;optprop&quot; /&gt;

An estimated 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]s or 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[joules]] of [[heat]] energy went into forming the glass and as the temperature required to melt the sand into the glass form observed was about 1470 Celsius, this was the estimated minimum temperature the sand was exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |title=INTERIM REPORT OF CDC’S LAHDRA PROJECT – Appendix N. pg 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more unusual isotopes found in trinitite, although by no means unique as it may also have formed during the [[Joe-1]] test, which was a partial to complete [[Soviet]] replica of the Trinity/[[Fat Man]] design, is a barium [[neutron activation]] product, the [[barium]] in the Trinity device coming from the [[velocity of detonation|slow explosive]] lens employed in the device, known as [[Baratol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X05002316?np=y |title= Radioactivity in trinitite six decades later| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.01.017 | pmid=16102878 |volume=85 |year=2006 |journal=J Environ Radioact |pages=103–20 | last1 = Parekh | first1 = PP | last2 = Semkow | first2 = TM | last3 = Torres | first3 = MA | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake trinitite==
There are many known fakes in circulation among collectors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  These fakes use a variety of means to achieve the glassy green silica look as well as mild radioactivity, however, only trinitite from a nuclear explosion will contain certain neutron activation products that are not found in naturally radioactive ores and minerals. [[Gamma spectroscopy]] can narrow down the potential nuclear explosions from which the material formed.

==Trinitite-type minerals==
Occasionally, the name ''trinitite'' is broadly applied to all glassy residues of nuclear bomb testing, not just the Trinity test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Lost Oasis: In Search Of Paradise |author= Robert Twigger |date= 2010 |publisher= Hachette |isbn= 9780297863878 |chapter= Eight |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJkGSF8SW_kC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=trinitite+asteroid |accessdate= 2014-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black vitreous fragments of fused sand that had been solidified by the heat of the explosion were described from French test site in [[Algeria]] ([[Reggane]] site).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1215_web_new.pdf Radiological Conditions at the Former French Nuclear Test Sites in Algeria: Preliminary Assessment and Recommendations] International Atomic Energy Agency, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kharitonchik===
Kharitonchiki (singular: kharitonchik [харитончик]) is an analog of trinitite found in [[Semipalatinsk Test Site]] in [[Kazakhstan]] at ground zeroes of Soviet atmospheric nuclear tests. Also generically called Kharitonchik. They are pieces of molten rock left at ground zeroes after Soviet atmospheric nuclear tests. This porous black material is named after one of the leading Russian nuclear weapons scientists, [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2144264/entry/2144273/ &quot;A Nuclear Family Vacation in Russia.&quot;] ''Slate.'' July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trinitite-like minerals==
Trinitite has several similar naturally occurring minerals as it is itself a [[melt glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Evidence for deposition of 10 million tonnes of impact spherules across four continents 12,800 y ago. |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1301760110 |pmid= 23690611 |vauthors=Wittke JH, Weaver JC, Bunch TE, Kennett JP, Kennett DJ, Moore AM, Hillman GC, Tankersley KB, Goodyear AC, Moore CR, Daniel IR Jr, Ray JH, Lopinot NH, Ferraro D, Israde-Alcántara I, Bischoff JL, DeCarli PS, Hermes RE, Kloosterman JB, Revay Z, Howard GA, Kimbel DR, Kletetschka G, Nabelek L, Lipo CP, Sakai S, West A, Firestone RB |date= 2013 |pmc=3677428 |volume=110 |issue=23 |pages=E2088–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulgurites===
{{main|Fulgurite}}
While trinitite and similar materials are anthropogenic, [[fulgurites]], found in many [[desert]] or other sandy regions, are naturally formed, hollow [[glass]] tubes composed of [[quartz]]ose [[sand]], [[silica]], or soil generated by [[lightning]] strikes.

===Impact glasses===
{{further|Impactite}}
A material similar to trinitite can be formed by meteor impacts, these are [[impact glass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musilica.com/fused-silica/wine-bottle-art-ingenious-methods-to-recycle-wine-bottles/ |title= Wine Bottle Art – Ingenious Methods to Recycle Wine Bottles |publisher= Colloidal silicon dioxide |date= 16 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry and radiation hazard==
For a time it was believed that the desert sand had simply melted from the direct radiant thermal energy of the fireball and was not particularly dangerous.  Thus it was marketed as suitable for use in [[jewelry]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiochemistry.org/documents/pdf/trinitite_nuclearon_061608.pdf Steven L. Kay - Nuclearon - Trinitite varieties]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |title=INTERIM REPORT OF CDC’S LAHDRA PROJECT – Appendix N. pg 39, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
