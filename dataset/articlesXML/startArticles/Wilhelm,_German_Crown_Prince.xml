'''German Crown Prince Wilhelm''' ({{lang-de|Kronprinz Wilhelm von Preußen}}; {{nowrap|6 May 1882 –}} {{nowrap|20 July 1951)}}, full name '''Friedrich Wilhelm Victor August Ernst''', was the last [[Crown Prince]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[German Empire]]. He was born on 6 May 1882 in the [[Marmorpalais]] in [[Potsdam]], the eldest child of the future German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] and his wife Empress [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Augusta Victoria]]. After the death of his grandfather Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]], Wilhelm became Crown Prince of Germany at the age of six, retaining that title for more than 30 years until the fall of the empire on 5 November 1918. During [[World War I]], he commanded the [[5th Army (German Empire)|5th Army]] from 1914 to 1916 and was commander of [[Army Group German Crown Prince]] for the remainder of the war. Crown Prince Wilhelm became [[House of Hohenzollern#Hohenzollerns since 1918 abdication|Head of the House of Hohenzollern]] on 4 June 1941 following the death of his father and held the position until his own death on 20 July 1951.

==Early life==
[[File:Germany Before the First World War 1890 - 1914 HU68364.jpg|thumbnail|left|Crown Prince Wilhelm, aged 19, wearing civilian clothing]]

Wilhelm was born on 6 May 1882 in the [[Marmorpalais]] of [[Potsdam]] in the [[Province of Brandenburg]]. He was the eldest son of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], the last German Emperor (1859–1941) and his first wife, Princess [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein]] (1858–1921). When he was born, his great-grandfather, [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], was the reigning emperor and his grandfather, [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince Frederick]], [[Frederick III, German Emperor| ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;was heir to the throne, making Wilhelm third in line to the throne. He was the eldest of the Kaiser's seven children, and his birth sparked an argument between his parents and [[Victoria, Princess Royal|grandmother]]. Before Wilhelm was born, his grandmother had expected to be asked to help find a nurse, but since her son did everything he could to snub her, the future Wilhelm II asked his aunt [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Helena]] to help. His mother was hurt and his [[Queen Victoria|grandmother]] furious.&lt;ref&gt;Queen Victoria's Family, A Century of Photographs, [[Charlotte Zeepvat]]&lt;/ref&gt; When his great-grandfather and grandfather both died in 1888, six-year-old Wilhelm became the heir-apparent to the German and Prussian thrones. 
 
Wilhelm was a supporter of [[association football]], then a relatively new sport in the country, donating a cup to the [[German Football Association]] in 1908 and thereby initiating the ''[[Länderpokal|Kronprinzenpokal (now Länderpokal)]]'', the oldest cup competition in German football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/4242/kick_it_like_kronprinz.html &quot;Kick it like Kronprinz&quot;] {{de icon}} [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]] Online. Retrieved 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The German club [[BFC Preussen]] was also originally named BFC Friedrich Wilhelm in his honour.

==Relations with family==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

Kaiser Wilhelm II regarded his eldest son with contempt, mainly because of his many affairs with women. In 1901, during a visit to [[Blenheim Palace]] in England, the Crown Prince took a strong liking to [[Gladys Deacon]] and gave her a ring that she had to return, at his father's insistence. Crown Prince Wilhelm, on the other hand, became noted for his public criticism of the politics of his father. In response, his father found Wilhelm a wife, [[Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], and ordered him to stay in [[Danzig]], away from the Imperial court. After initial interest in his wife, the Prince returned to his previous interest in other women.{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}}

During his stay in [[Danzig]] he used to regularly play tennis in [[Sopot]]. That afforded him a chance to meet many beautiful women, many of them coming from [[Warsaw]] to stay at the [[spa]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2012}}

In 1914, the Kaiser ordered the construction of Schloss [[Cecilienhof]] in Potsdam for Prince Wilhelm and his family. Completed in 1917, it became the main residence for the Crown Prince for a time.

==World War I==
Wilhelm had been active in pushing German expansion, and sought a leading role on the outbreak of war. Despite being only thirty-two and having never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, the German Crown Prince was named commander of the [[5th Army (German Empire)|5th Army]] in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. However, under the well-established Prussian/[[German General Staff]] model then in use, inexperienced nobles who were afforded commands of large army formations were always provided with (and expected to defer to the advice of) experienced Chiefs of Staff to assist them in their duties. As Emperor, Wilhelm's father instructed the Crown Prince to defer to the advice of his experienced Chief of Staff [[Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf]].&lt;ref&gt;Chief of Staff: Napoleonic wars to World War I, David Zabecki&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1914 Wilhelm gave his first interview to a foreign correspondent and the first statement to the press made by a German noble since the outbreak of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE74&quot;&gt;[[#AE|Elter page 74]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KW&quot;&gt;[[#KW|Wiegand page 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; He blandly denied promoting military solutions to diplomatic problems, and said this in English:
{{quote|&quot;Undoubtedly this is the most stupid, senseless and unnecessary war of modern times.
It is a war not wanted by Germany, I can assure you, but it was forced on us, and the fact that we were so effectually prepared to defend ourselves is now being used as an argument to convince the world that we desired conflict.&quot;|Crown Prince Wilhelm|''Wiegand''&lt;ref name=&quot;AE74&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KW&quot;/&gt;}}

From August 1915 onwards, Wilhelm was given the additional role as commander of [[Army Group German Crown Prince]]. In 1916 his troops began the [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun Offensive]], a year long effort to destroy the French armies that would end in failure. Wilhelm relinquished command of the 5th Army in November of that year, but remained commander of Army Group German Crown Prince for the rest of the war.

==1918–34==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14437, Tag von Potsdam, Adolf Hitler, Kronprinz Wilhelm.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting Adolf Hitler in 1933]]
After the outbreak of the [[German Revolution]] in 1918, both Emperor Wilhelm II and the Crown Prince signed the document of abdication. On 13 November, the former Crown Prince went into exile and was interned on the island of [[Wieringen]] (now part of the mainland), near [[Den Helder]] in the [[Netherlands]]. In the fall of 1921, [[Gustav Stresemann]] visited Wilhelm and the Crown Prince voiced his interest in returning to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], even as a private citizen. After Stresemann became chancellor in August 1923, Wilhelm was allowed to return after giving assurances that he would no longer engage in politics. He chose 9 November 1923 for this, which infuriated his father, who had not been informed about the plans of his son and who felt [[November 9 in German history|the historic date]] to be inappropriate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broschure&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Heike|last2=Berndt|first2=Harald|title=Schloss Cecilienhof und die Konferenz von Potsdam 1945 (German)|publisher=Stiftung Preussische Schlösser und Gärten|year=2006|isbn=3-910068-16-2| page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

In June 1926, a [[German referendum, 1926|referendum on expropriating the former ruling Princes of Germany without compensation]] failed and as a consequence, the financial situation of the Hohenzollern family improved considerably. A settlement between the state and the family made Cecilienhof property of the state but granted a right of residence to Wilhelm and Cecilie. This was limited in duration to three generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broschure&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9–12}} The family also kept the ownership of [[Monbijou Palace]] in Berlin, [[Oleśnica|Oels]] Castle in Silesia and [[Rheinsberg Palace]] until 1945.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Wilhelm broke the promise he had made to Stresemann to stay out of politics. [[Adolf Hitler]] visited Wilhelm at Cecilienhof three times, in 1926, in 1933 (on the &quot;Day of Potsdam&quot;) and in 1935. Wilhelm joined the ''[[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]]'' which merged in 1931 into the [[Harzburg Front]], a right-wing organisation of those opposed to the democratic republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broschure&quot;/&gt;{{rp|13}}

The former Crown Prince was reportedly interested in the idea of running for ''[[Reichspräsident]]'' as the right-wing candidate against [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in 1932, until his father forbade him from acting on the idea. After his plans to become president had been blocked by his father, Wilhelm supported the rise to power of Hitler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broschure&quot;/&gt;{{rp|13}}

==1934–51==

After the murder of his friend [[Kurt von Schleicher]], the former Chancellor, in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] (1934), he withdrew from all political activities.

When Wilhelm realized that Hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy, their relationship cooled. Upon his father's death in 1941, Wilhelm succeeded him as head of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], the former German imperial dynasty. He was approached by those in the military and the diplomatic service who wanted to replace Hitler, but Wilhelm turned them down. After the [[20 July Plot|assassination attempt on 20 July 1944]], Hitler nevertheless had Wilhelm placed under supervision by the [[Gestapo]] and had his home at Cecilienhof watched.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broschure&quot;/&gt;{{rp|11–15}}

In January 1945, Wilhelm left Potsdam for [[Oberstdorf]] for a treatment of his gall and liver problems. His wife Cecilie fled in early February 1945 as the [[Red Army]] drew closer to Berlin, but they had been estranged for a long time. At the end of the war, Wilhelm's home, Cecilienhof, was seized by the Soviets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broschure&quot;/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} The palace was subsequently used by the Allied Powers as the venue for the [[Potsdam Conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Broschure&quot;/&gt;{{rp|16}}

At the end of the war, Wilhelm was captured by French Moroccan troops in Baad, Austria and was interned as a (World War I) war criminal. Transferred to [[Hechingen]], Germany, he lived for a short time in [[Hohenzollern Castle]] under house arrest before moving to a small five-room house at Fürstenstraße 16 in Hechingen where he died on 20 July 1951, of a heart attack. Three days later, his opponent in the [[Battle of Verdun]], Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], died in prison in France.&lt;ref&gt;The Life Of Crown Prince William by Klaus Jonas, 1961 pp. 214-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm and his wife are buried at Hohenzollern Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussen.de/de/geschichte/kronprinz_wilhelm.html|title=Preussen.de - Kronprinz Wilhelm|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussen.de/de/heute/aktuell/archiv/50._todestag_der_kronprinzessin_cecilie.html|title=Preussen.de - 50.

Wilhelm married [[Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] (20 September 1886 – 6 May 1954) in [[Berlin]] on 6 June 1905. After their marriage, the couple lived at the [[Kronprinzenpalais|Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin]] in the winter and at the Marmorpalais in Potsdam.

Their eldest son, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, was killed fighting for the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[Battle of France|France in 1940]]. However, during the early stages of his marriage the crown prince had a brief affair with the American opera singer [[Geraldine Farrar]], and he later had a relationship with the dancer [[Mata Hari]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
