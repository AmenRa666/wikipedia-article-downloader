[[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]] '''William Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|MC|DFC}} (23 December 1893 – 29 October 1969) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Air Force]]. After serving as a pilot, then a flight commander and finally as a squadron commander during the [[First World War]], he served a flying instructor during the inter-war years before becoming Director of Staff Duties and then [[Assistant Chief of the Air Staff]] at the [[Air Ministry]].

During the [[Second World War]] Douglas clashed with other senior commanders over strategy in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Douglas argued for a more aggressive engagement with a '[[Big Wing]]' strategy i.e. using massed fighters to defend the United Kingdom against enemy bombers. He then became  [[Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] of [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]] in which role he was responsible for rebuilding the command's strength after the attrition of the [[Battle of Britain]], but also for bringing it on the offensive to wrest the initiative in the air from the German [[Luftwaffe]].

Douglas went on to be Air Officer Commanding in Chief of [[RAF Middle East Command]] in which role he was an advocate of [[Operation Accolade]], a planned British amphibious assault on [[Rhodes]] and the [[Dodecanese Islands]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], and was disappointed when it was abandoned. He became commander of the [[British Zone of Occupation]] in [[Germany]] after the war.

==Early life==
Born the son of Professor [[Robert Langton Douglas]] and his wife Margaret Jane Douglas (née Cannon), Douglas was educated at [[Emanuel School]], [[Tonbridge School]] and [[Lincoln College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32876?docPos=2|title=Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military career==
Douglas was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Field Artillery]] on 15 August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28876 |date=21 August 1914 |startpage=6597|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1915, following a disagreement with his commanding officer, he transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] joining [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 Squadron]] as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas 1963, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He soon trained as a pilot and earned [[Royal Aero Club]] certificate No 1301.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas 1963, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 9 June 1915, he became a pilot with  [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|No. 14 Squadron]] at [[Shoreham Airport|Shoreham]] in July 1915 and then transferred to [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|No. 8 Squadron]], flying [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2c aircraft]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], in August 1915.&lt;ref name=air&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Douglas.htm |publisher=Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation |title= Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Douglas of Kirtleside|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a flight commander with the rank of temporary [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in December 1915, he joined [[No. 18 Squadron RAF|No. 18 Squadron]] at [[RAF Montrose|Montrose]] in January 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas 1963, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] on 14 January 1916.&lt;ref name=mc&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29438|date=11 January 1916 |startpage=582|endpage= |supp= yes|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas went on to be officer commanding [[No. 43 Squadron RAF|No. 43 Squadron]], flying [[Sopwith 1½ Strutter]]s on the Western Front, in April 1916 and, having been promoted to temporary [[major]] on 1 July 1916, he became then officer commanding [[No. 84 Squadron RAF|No. 84 Squadron]], flying [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5]]s on the Western Front, in August 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas 1963, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] on 8 February 1919.&lt;ref name=dfc&gt;{{London Gazette|city=e|issue=13400|date=11 February 1919 |startpage=796|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Douglas worked briefly for [[Handley Page]] and as a commercial pilot before rejoining the Royal Air Force in 1920 after a chance meeting with [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; After being granted a permanent commission as a [[squadron leader]] on 25 March 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32193 |date=14 January 1921|startpage=376|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas attended the [[RAF Staff College, Andover|RAF Staff College]] and then served as a flight instructor four years.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; Promoted to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1 January 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33007 |date=30 December 1924 |startpage=8|endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he continued his work as an instructor before attending the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in 1927.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He became station commander at [[RAF North Weald]] in January 1928 and then joined the Air Staff at Headquarters Middle East Command in [[Khartoum]] in August 1929.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; Promoted to [[group captain]] on 1 January 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33785 |date=29 December 1931 |startpage=16|endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became an instructor at the Imperial Defence College in June 1932 and then, having been promoted to [[air commodore]] on 1 January 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34176 |date=2 July 1935|startpage=4262|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became Director of Staff Duties at the [[Air Ministry]] on 1 January 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34242 |date=14 January 1936|startpage=311|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[air vice marshal]] on 1 January 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34468 |date=31 December 1937 |startpage=8194|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he went on to be [[Assistant Chief of the Air Staff]] on 17 February 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34488 |date=1 March 1938 |startpage=1351|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

On 22 April 1940, with the [[World War II|Second World War]] well under way, he was made [[Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34840 |date=30 April 1940 |startpage=2556|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 11 July 1940.&lt;ref name=cb&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34893 |date=9 July 1940 |startpage=4245|endpage= |supp= yes|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1940, Douglas and [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] clashed with the head of [[No. 11 Group RAF|No. 11 Group]], [[Keith Park]], and the head of [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]], [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Hugh Dowding]], over strategy in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Douglas argued for a more aggressive engagement with a '[[Big Wing]]' strategy i.e. using massed fighters to defend the United Kingdom against enemy bombers.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; When [[Charles Portal]] was made [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] in October 1940 he supported Douglas, moving Park and Dowding and appointing Douglas to replace Dowding as [[Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] of Fighter Command, with the temporary rank of [[air marshal]] on 25 November 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35010|date=10 December 1940|startpage=6982|supp=| accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] on 1 July 1941&lt;ref name=kcb&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35204|date=27 June 1941 |startpage=3736|supp=yes| accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to the substantive rank of air marshal on 14 April 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35525|date=14 April 1942|startpage=1648|supp=| accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around this time Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] recommended Douglas to command the [[China Burma India Theater]] but General [[George Marshall]] refused to accept the appointment due to Douglas's well known dislike of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

As commander-in-chief of Fighter Command, Douglas was responsible for rebuilding the command's strength after the attrition of the [[Battle of Britain]], but also for bringing it on the offensive to wrest the initiative in the air from the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. He was therefore one of the main orchestrators of the only partially successful [[Circus offensive]] whereby large wings of fighters accompanied by bombers would take advantage of good weather to sweep over Northern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spitfiresite.com/2010/04/1941-royal-air-force-offensive.html/3|title=1941: The Difficult Year|last=Douglas|first=Sir Sholto|publisher=Spitfire site|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas was promoted to temporary [[air chief marshal]] on 1 July 1942.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; In January 1943 Douglas was replaced at Fighter Command by [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] and was transferred to [[Egypt]], becoming Air Officer Commanding in Chief of [[RAF Middle East Command]] in January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas 1966, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity Douglas was an advocate of [[Operation Accolade]], a planned British amphibious assault on [[Rhodes]] and the [[Dodecanese Islands]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], and was disappointed when it was abandoned.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Douglas returned to England in January 1944 to head [[Coastal Command]] during the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of Normandy]] and then, having been confirmed in the rank of air chief marshal on 6 June 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37124|date=8 June 1945 |startpage=3073|supp=yes| accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became Commander in Chief, British Air Forces of Occupation in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas 1966, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] on 1 January 1946.&lt;ref name=gcb&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37407|date=28 December 1945 |startpage=5|supp=| accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to [[marshal of the Royal Air Force]] on 1 January 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37414 |date=28 December 1945 |startpage=187|endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas became the second commander of the [[British Zone of Occupation]] in Germany in May 1946.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He was raised to the peerage as Baron Douglas of Kirtleside, of Dornock in the County of Dumfries on 17 February 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38210 |date=17 February 1948 |startpage=1127| accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p23343.htm#i233430|title=Person Page 23343| publisher=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes, Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A., 2003, volume 1, page 842. Genealogical Books Ltd, 2003,|accessdate=2014-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas retired in 1947 and became chairman of [[British European Airways|BEA]] in 1949, a post he retained until 1964. He published two volumes of autobiography, ''Years of Combat'', covering the First World War, and ''Years of Command'' covering the Second World War.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Douglas died in hospital in [[Northampton]] on 29 October 1969 and was buried at [[St Clement Danes]] in [[Strand, London|The Strand]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
