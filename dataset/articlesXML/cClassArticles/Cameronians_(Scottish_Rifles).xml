The '''Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)''' was a [[Rifle regiment|rifle]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]], the only regiment of rifles amongst the [[Scottish regiment|Scottish]] regiments of infantry. It was formed in 1881 under the [[Childers Reforms]] by the amalgamation of the [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|26th Cameronian Regiment]] and the [[90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers)|90th Perthshire Light Infantry]]. In 1968, when reductions were required, the regiment was the only regiment that decided to disband rather than amalgamate with another regiment.  It can trace its roots to that of the Cameronians, later the 26th of Foot, who were raised in 1689.  The 1881 amalgamation coincided with the Cameronian's selection to become the new Scottish Rifles.

The 2nd Battalion saw action at the [[Battle of Spion Kop]] in January 1900 during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angloboerwar.com/unit-information/imperial-units/660-cameronians-scottish-rifles|title=Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)|publisher=Anglo-Boer War|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 600 men embarked for [[South Africa]] in April 1901, and returned in June 1902, following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - The return of the Troops |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=2 July 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was deployed to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] in 1950 during the [[Malayan Emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cameronians.siteiscentral.com/1901/campaigns/malaya|title=Malayan Emergency 1948-1960|publisher=Cameronians|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the reforms of the army in the [[1967 Defence White Paper]], which saw several regiments amalgamated, the Cameronians chose to disband rather than amalgamate with another in the [[Lowland Brigade (United Kingdom)|Lowland Brigade]]. The 1st Battalion, The Cameronians was disbanded on 14 May 1968 at [[Douglas Castle]], near [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]], [[South Lanarkshire]] in the presence of the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]], the Earl of Angus.
