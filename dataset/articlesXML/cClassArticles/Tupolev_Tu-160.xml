The '''Tupolev Tu-160 ''Beliy Lebed''''' (or [[Swan|White Swan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruaviation.com/news/2014/11/27/2767/|title=The upgraded Tu-160 performed its first flight|work=Russian Aviation|date=27 November 2014|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Туполев Ту-160}}, [[NATO reporting name]]: '''Blackjack''') is a [[supersonic]], [[variable-sweep wing]] [[Heavy bomber|heavy]] [[strategic bomber]] designed by the [[Tupolev|Tupolev Design Bureau]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. It is the largest and heaviest combat aircraft with the highest engine thrust built; it is also the fastest bomber with the largest military payload, and the largest variable-sweep wing airplane.

Entering service in 1987, the Tu-160 was the last [[strategic bomber]] designed for the Soviet Union.  As of 2016, the [[Russian Air Force]], [[Long Range Aviation]] branch has 16 aircraft remaining, with fewer being airworthy and in service.  The Tu-160 active fleet has been undergoing upgrades to electronics systems since the early 2000s.  The Tu-160M modernisation programme has begun with the first updated aircraft delivered in December 2014.

==Development==

===Origins===
The first competition for a [[supersonic]] strategic heavy bomber was launched in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1967. In 1972, the Soviet Union launched a new multi-mission bomber competition to create a new supersonic, [[swing-wing|variable-geometry]] (&quot;swing-wing&quot;) heavy bomber with a maximum speed of Mach 2.3, in response to the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1]] bomber project. The Tupolev design, named ''Aircraft 160M'', with a lengthened [[blended wing]] layout and incorporating some elements of the [[Tupolev Tu-144|Tu-144]], competed against the [[Myasishchev M-18]] and the [[Sukhoi T-4]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sergeyev|first=Pavel|url=http://pda.lenta.ru/articles/2008/04/30/tu/|title=Белый лебедь|language=Russian|trans-title=White Swan|work=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=5 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717041514/http://pda.lenta.ru/articles/2008/04/30/tu/|archivedate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kremlin Tupolev Tu-160.jpg|thumb|left|Tu-160 in flight]]
Work on the new Soviet bomber continued despite an end to the B-1A and in the same year, the design was accepted by the government committee. The prototype was photographed by an airline passenger at a [[Zhukovsky Airfield]] in November 1981, about a month before the aircraft's first flight on 18 December 1981. Production was authorized in 1984, beginning at [[Kazan Aircraft Production Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goebel |first1=Greg |title=The Sukhoi T-4 &amp; Tupolev Tu-160 |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avtu160.html |website=AirVectors.net |publisher=v1.0.4 - 01 mar 15 - greg goebel - public domain |accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization===
The modernised aircraft were accepted into Russian service after testing in late 2005.&lt;ref name=Flight20121015&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-russians-next-generation-bomber-takes-shape-377251/ |title=IN FOCUS: Russian's next-generation bomber takes shape |first=Vladimir |last=Karnozov |date=15 Oct 2012 |work=Flight International |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fomin&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.take-off.ru/asp/tu160_v13 |first=Andrey |last=Fomin |title=Ту-160 принят на вооружение |language=Russian|trans-title=Tu-160 adopted |work=Take-Off |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315132753/http://www.take-off.ru/asp/tu160_v13 |archivedate=15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upgrade also integrated the ability to launch two new conventional versions of the long-range [[Kh-55]] nuclear cruise missile—the Kh-101 and Kh-555.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jennings |first1=Gareth |title=Russia flies first radar- and avionics-upgraded Tu-160 bomber |url=http://www.janes.com/article/46087/russia-flies-first-radar-and-avionics-upgraded-tu-160-bomber |work=IHS Jane's Defence Weekly |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burger |first1=Marcel |title=Russian TU-160 Bombers will fly new cruise missile |url=http://airheadsfly.com/2014/01/25/russian-tu-160-bombers-will-fly-new-cruise-missile/ |date=25 January 2014|publisher=AIRheadsFly.com |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tu-160 BLACKJACK (TUPOLEV) |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/tu-160.htm |author=John Pike |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the delivery of a new-built aircraft but the &quot;first modernised Tu-160&quot; in July 2006 did not receive new avionics, although they were planned for the new airframe.&lt;ref name=Fomin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060705/50944049.html |title=Russia can hope for new Blackjack bomber in 2006 – Ivanov|agency=RIA Novosti|date=5 July 2006 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://russianforces.org/blog/2006/07/tu160_returns_from_overhaul.shtml |title=Tu-160 returns from overhaul |publisher=Russian strategic nuclear forces |date=5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modernisation appears to be split into two phases, concentrating on life extension with some initial communication–navigation updates, followed by 10 aircraft receiving new engines and capability upgrades after 2016.&lt;ref name=Flight20121015 /&gt; The first refitted aircraft was delivered to the [[Russian Air Force|VVS]] in May 2008; a follow-up contract to overhaul three aircraft in 2013 cost RUR3.4 billion (US$103M).&lt;ref name=JDW20130728&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.janes.com/article/25136/russia-continues-tu-160-blackjack-bomber-modernisation-work |title=Russia continues Tu-160 'Blackjack' bomber modernisation work |first=Gareth |last=Jennings |work=IHS Jane's Defence Weekly |date=28 July 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first updated M-model Tu-160 was delivered in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Dominic|title=Russian air force takes first modernised Tupolev bombers|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-air-force-takes-first-modernised-tupolev-bombers-407325/|work=Flightglobal|publisher=Reed Business Information, RELX Group|accessdate=2 May 2015|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The upgraded Tu-160 performed its first flight|url=http://www.ruaviation.com/news/2014/11/27/2767/|website=RUaviation.com|publisher=Russian Aviation|accessdate=3 May 2015|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogulin|first1=Dmitry|title=Russian long range aviation to get 6 more modernized Tupolev Tu-160 bombers in 2015|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/768781|accessdate=3 May 2015|agency=[[Russian News Agency TASS|TASS]]|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phase I update was due to be completed by 2016, but industrial limitations may delay it to 2019 or beyond.&lt;ref name=JDW20131111 /&gt; Although Kuznetsov designed an NK-32M engine with improved reliability over the troublesome NK-32 engines, its successor company has struggled to deliver working units.

The Tu-160 is a variable-geometry wing aircraft. The aircraft employs a [[fly-by-wire]] control system with a [[blended wing]] profile, and full-span [[Leading edge slats|slats]] are used on the leading edges, with double-slotted [[Flap (aircraft)|flap]]s on the trailing edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bergmans |first1=Werner |title=Tupolev Tu-160 Blackjack |url=http://www.fighter-planes.com/info/tu160.htm |website=Fighter-Planes.com |publisher=1996-2011 Werner Bergmans, Eindhoven, the Netherlands |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tu-160 has a crew of four (pilot, co-pilot, [[bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier]], and defensive systems operator) in [[NPP Zvezda K-36|K-36LM]] [[ejection seat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duffy |first1=Paul |last2=Kandalov |first2=Andrei I. |title=Tupolev: The Man and His Aircraft |date=1996 |publisher=SAE International, 1996 |location=Warrendale, PA |isbn=1560918993 |page=170 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOC7Ii5SgZUC&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tu-160 is powered by four [[Kuznetsov NK-32]] [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[turbofan]] engines, the most powerful ever fitted to a combat aircraft. Unlike the American [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]], which reduced the original Mach 2+ requirement for the B-1A to achieve a smaller [[radar cross-section]], the Tu-160 retains variable [[intake ramp]]s, and is capable of reaching Mach 2.05 speed at altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ria.ru/infographics/20100615/159430934.html |title=Russian Tu-160 Blackjack strategic bomber |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tu-160 is equipped with a [[Probe and drogue|probe-and-drogue]] [[in-flight refueling]] system for extended-range missions, although it is rarely used. The Tu-160's internal fuel capacity of 130 tons gives the aircraft a roughly 15-hour flight endurance at a cruise speed of around 850&amp;nbsp;km/h (Mach 0.77, 530&amp;nbsp;mph) at 9,145 m (30,003&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/bomber/tu160/ &quot;Aircraft Museum – Tu-160 'Blackjack'.&quot;] Aerospaceweb.org, 16 August 2008. Retrieved 19 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, Tu-160 bombers and [[Ilyushin Il-78|Il-78]] refueling tankers practiced air refueling during air combat exercise, as well as [[Mikoyan MiG-31|MiG-31]], [[Beriev A-50|A-50]] and other Russian combat aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforceworld.com/bomber/eng/tu160-blackjack-bomber-russia-1.htm &quot;Tu-160 bombers practice air refueling in Feb 2008 exercises&quot;] AirForceWorld.com.

Weapons are carried in two internal bays, each capable of holding 20,000&amp;nbsp;kg (44,400&amp;nbsp;lb) of free-fall weapons or a [[bomb bay#Rotary Launcher|rotary launcher]] for [[thermonuclear weapon|nuclear]] missiles; additional missiles may also be carried externally. The aircraft's total weapons load capacity is 40,000&amp;nbsp;kg (88,185&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=&quot;JAWA03 p425-6&quot;/&gt; No defensive weapons are provided; the Tu-160 is the first post-[[World War II]] Soviet bomber to lack such defenses.

A demilitarized, commercial version of the Tu-160, named ''Tu-160SK'', was displayed at [[Asian Aerospace]] in [[Singapore]] in 1994 with a model of a small space vehicle named Burlak&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceguide.net/burlak.html Burlak]&lt;/ref&gt; attached underneath the fuselage.

While similar in appearance to the American B-1 Lancer, the Tu-160 is a different class of combat aircraft; its primary role being a [[standoff missile]] platform (strategic missile carrier). The Tu-160 is also larger and faster than the B-1B and has a slightly greater combat range, though the B-1B has a larger combined payload.&lt;ref&gt;''The Directory of the World's Weapons'' 1996, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant difference is that the colour scheme on the B-1B Lancer is usually subdued dark gray to reduce visibility; the Tu-160 is painted with [[anti-flash white]], giving it the nickname among Russian airmen &quot;White Swan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&amp;id=903|title='White swan’ – Russian supersonic aircraft|work=Moscow Top News|year=2009|accessdate=19 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602035032/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&amp;id=903|archivedate=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:DD-ST-89-11765.JPEG|thumb|A Tupolev Tu-160 with Soviet officers in front, September 1989]]

In April 1987, the Tu-160 entered operational service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=The Cold War: A Military History |date=1998 |publisher=John Murray 1998, Random House |location=London |isbn=1448137934 |page=162 |edition=Pimlico 2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6L_moj5Fo74C&amp;pg=PT162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[184th Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment]] (GvTBAP) in [[Pryluky (air base)|Pryluky]] in the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] were the first to receive the new bomber, replacing their [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tu-16]] and [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Tu-22M3]] aircraft. Squadron deployments to Long Range Aviation began that month, prior to the Tu-160 being first publicly presented in a parade in 1989. In 1989 and 1990, a total of 44 world speed flight records in its weight class were set. In 1992, Russia unilaterally suspended its flights of strategic aviation in remote regions.

A total of 19 Tu-160s were stationed inside the newly-independent [[Ukraine]] during the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. On 25 August 1991, the Ukrainian parliament decreed that the new nation would take control of all military units on its territory; a Defence Ministry was created that same day. By the mid-1990s, the Pryluky Regiment had lost its value as a combat unit; 19 Tu-160s were effectively grounded due to a lack of technical support and spare parts. Ukraine considered the Tu-160s to be a bargaining chip in economic negotiations with Russia and of limited value from a military standpoint. Discussions over the Tu-160s were lengthy due to price disagreements. While Russian experts, who examined the aircraft at the Pryluky Air Base in 1993 and 1996, assessed their technical condition as good, the $3 billion price proposed by Ukraine was unacceptable. Due to the stalled negotiations; in April 1998, Ukraine decided to commence scrapping the aircraft under the [[Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction]] Agreement. In November, the first Tu-160 was chopped up at [[Pryluky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia's_Strategic_Bomber_Force&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butowski |first=Piotr |title=Russia's Strategic Bomber Force |journal=Combat Aircraft |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=552–565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1999, immediately after [[NATO]] began its air attacks against [[Serbia]], [[Russia]] resumed talks with [[Ukraine]] about the strategic bombers, proposing to purchase eight Tu-160s and three [[Tu-95]]MS models manufactured in 1991 (those in the best technical condition), as well as 575 [[Kh-55]]MS missiles. An agreement was reached and a $285 million contract was signed, the value of which was deducted from Ukraine's debt for natural gas. A group of Russian military experts went to Ukraine on 20 October 1999 to prepare the aircraft for the flight to [[Engels-2]] air base. The first two aircraft (a Tu-160 and a Tu-95MS) departed Pryluky on 5 November. During the months that followed, the seven other &quot;Blackjacks&quot; flew to Engels, with the last two arriving on 21 February 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia's_Strategic_Bomber_Force&quot; /&gt;

Along with the re-purchase of Ukrainian aircraft, Russia's Defence Ministry sought other ways of rebuilding the fleet at Engels. In June 1999, the Ministry placed a contract with the [[Kazan Aircraft Production Association]] for a delivery of a single, almost complete, bomber. The aircraft was the second aircraft in the eighth production batch and it arrived at Engels on 10 September. It was commissioned into service as &quot;07&quot; on 5 May 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia's_Strategic_Bomber_Force&quot; /&gt; The unit that was operating the fleet from Engels was the 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment. It formed up in early 1992 and by 1994 it had received 6 aircraft. By the end of February 2001, the fleet stood at 15 with the addition of the eight aircraft from Ukraine and the new-build.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia's_Strategic_Bomber_Force&quot; /&gt; As of 2001, six additional Tu-160 have served as experimental aircraft at Zhukovski, four remaining airworthy.

The Air Force fleet was reduced to 14 by the crash of the ''Mikhail Gromov'' during flight trials of a replacement engine on 18 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_820476.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030920062314/http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_820476.html |archivedate=2003-09-20 |date=18 September 2003 |title=Russian supersonic bomber crashes |author=Associated Press |publisher=Ananova}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be brought up to 16 aircraft by the completion of a part-built aircraft in June 2006 and the delivery of the ''Vitaly Kopylov'' on 29 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jane's All the World's Aircraft |publisher= McGraw-Hill |date=2009 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following acceptance of the testing of the prototype of the long-awaited avionics upgrades the Tu-160 formally entered service with the Russian Air Force by a presidential decree of 30 December 2005.&lt;ref name=Fomin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jane's All the World's Aircraft |publisher= McGraw-Hill |date=2009 |page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt;
