The statement went on to say, ''&quot;At this time it appears that the two governments are intent on changing the basis of the peace process. They claim that 'the obstacle now to a lasting and durable settlement… is the continuing terrorist and criminal activity of the IRA'. We reject this. It also belies the fact that a possible agreement last December was squandered by both governments pandering to rejectionist unionism instead of upholding their own commitments and honouring their own obligations.&quot;'' The statement concluded with two points: ''&quot;We are taking all our proposals off the table&quot;'' and ''&quot;It is our intention to closely monitor ongoing developments and to protect to the best of our ability the rights of republicans and our support base&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IRA statement: 2 February 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4074652.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*3 February 2005: Following statements from the British and Irish governments, claiming that the new IRA statement was no cause for alarm, the IRA issues a second two-sentence statement: ''&quot;The two governments are trying to play down the importance of our statement because they are making a mess of the peace process.

The statement said that the man had been an IRA member and was ''&quot;court-martialled for breaches of IRA standing orders&quot;'' and ''&quot;was subsequently executed and buried in an unmarked grave.&quot;'' The statement went on to say that Lynskey had an affair with the wife of a Belfast republican and had ordered another IRA member to shoot the man.
