'''''Etna''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) built in the 1880s. She was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Etna|protected cruiser|4}}, which included three [[sister ship]]s. Named for [[Mount Etna]] on the island of Sicily, the ship was laid down in January 1883, was launched in September 1885, and was completed in December 1887. She was armed with a main battery of two {{convert|10|in|adj=on|0}} and six {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} guns, and could steam at a speed of around {{convert|17|kn|lk=in}}.

''Etna'' frequently cruised abroad throughout her career, including visits to the United States for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in 1893 and 1909, respectively. She served as a [[training ship]] for naval cadets from 1907. She saw action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911&amp;ndash;12, primarily providing gunfire support to Italian troops ashore in [[Libya]]. By the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, ''Etna'' had been withdrawn from service and was employed as a headquarters ship for the commander of the Italian fleet at [[Taranto]] and later for the light forces based at [[Brindisi]]. The old cruiser was finally sold for scrap in May 1921.

==Description==
{{main|Etna-class protected cruiser}}

''Etna'' was {{convert|283|ft|6|in|m|1}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|42|ft|6|in|1}}. She had a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|19|ft|m|1}} and displaced between {{convert|3474|LT|MT}}. Her crew numbered 12&amp;nbsp;officers and 296&amp;nbsp;men. The ship had two [[Marine steam engine#Compound|horizontal compound steam engines]], each driving a single [[propeller]], with steam provided by four double-ended cylindrical [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s. ''Etna'' was credited with a top speed of {{convert|17.8|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|7480|ihp|lk=in}}. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|5000|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=B97/&gt;

The main armament of the ships consisted of two Armstrong {{convert|10|in|adj=on|0}}, 30-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] guns mounted in [[barbette]]s fore and aft. She was also equipped with six {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}}, 32-caliber, breech-loading guns that were carried in [[sponson]]s along the sides of the ship. For anti-[[torpedo boat]] defense, ''Etna'' was fitted with five {{convert|57|mm|adj=on|sp=us|1}} [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder Hotchkiss]] guns and five {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|1-pounder Hotchkiss guns]]. ''Etna'' was also armed with four {{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s. One was mounted in the bow underwater and the other three were above water.&lt;ref name=B97&gt;Brook, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; She was protected with an armored deck below the waterline with a maximum thickness of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}}. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|.5|in|abbr=on}} worth of armor plating.&lt;ref name=G348/&gt;

From 1905 to 1907 the ship was rebuilt with [[forecastle]] and [[poop deck]]s added and her armament was revised. The heavy 10-inch guns were replaced with two [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] {{convert|4.7|in|adj=on}} guns and the six breech-loading 6-inch guns were replaced by four QF 6-inch guns, two on each side [[amidships]].&lt;ref name=B97/&gt;

==Service history==

''Etna'' was built by the [[Castellammare di Stabia|Castellammare]] shipyard; her keel was laid down on 19 January 1883 and her completed hull was launched on 26 September 1885. After [[fitting-out]] work was finished, she was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 3 December 1887.&lt;ref name=G348&gt;Gardiner, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; ''Etna'' served in the ''Squadra Permamente'' (Permanent Squadron) from her commissioning to 1893 and then served in North and South American waters until the end of 1895.&lt;ref name=B97/&gt; During this period, ''Etna'' and the protected cruisers {{ship|Italian cruiser|Dogali||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Giovanni Bausan||2}} represented Italy at the international naval review in New York, held at the start of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893. The Exposition marked the 400th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in North America. Contingents from France, Germany, Britain, Spain, and several other nations also participated in the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100&lt;/ref&gt; During the visit, she flew the flag of Rear Admiral G. B. Magnaghi,&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Italian cruiser Etna Hudson 1909 LOC 4a16124v.jpg|thumb|left|''Etna'' during the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in New York City in September 1909]]
During the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] of 1895–6 she was stationed in the Red Sea. She thereafter supported Italian interests during the Cretan Revolt of 1898.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Eastern Crisis&quot;, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, ''Etna'' was assigned to the cruiser squadron along with {{ship|Italian cruiser|Lombardia||2}} and ''Dogali''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval Notes&quot; February 1897, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was then transferred to the Far East, during which time she made a visit to [[Sydney]], Australia. She returned home in 1902 and was disarmed; she was then commissioned as the [[flagship]] of the Superior Torpedo-Boat Command in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Cresciani, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Organisation of the Fleets&quot;, p. 1430&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, ''Etna'' was converted into a training cruiser for [[naval cadet]]s.&lt;ref name=G348/&gt; ''Etna'' visited the United States in September 1909 for the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in New York City, which also included ships from the German, British, and French fleets, among others, in addition to the hosting [[US Navy]]. On this occasion, she was joined by the cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Etruria||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kunz, pp. 317&amp;ndash;318&lt;/ref&gt;

''Etna'' saw limited action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911&amp;ndash;12. At the outbreak of the war in September 1911, she was stationed in eastern Africa, where Italy had colonies in [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland|Somaliland]]. She was joined there by the cruisers {{ship|Italian cruiser|Elba||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Liguria||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Piemonte||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Puglia||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1911, she was stationed at [[Tobruk]], where she, the [[battleship]] {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Emanuele||2}}, the cruiser ''Etruria'', and twelve torpedo boats provided gunfire support to the Italians defending the city.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; She remained there through January 1912 while the bulk of the Italian fleet returned to Italy for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In April, ''Etna'' bombarded Ottoman positions outside [[Benghazi]],&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; and in August, she sent men ashore at [[Zuwarah]] to relieve the garrison there.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September she shelled Ottoman troops near the ruins of ancient [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the Ottomans agreed to surrender, ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1914, ''Etna'' was withdrawn from service as a training ship and used instead as a floating headquarters. Italy entered [[World War I]] in May 1915 and the ship was thereafter used as a harbor defense ship before returning to her previous role as a headquarters ship for the commander in chief of the Italian fleet at [[Taranto]].&lt;ref name=G348/&gt; By May 1917, she had been transferred to [[Brindisi]], where she served as the headquarters ship for Rear Admiral [[Alfredo Acton]] during the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The old cruiser was sold for scrapping on 15 May 1921, and was the last surviving ship of her class.&lt;ref name=G348/&gt;
