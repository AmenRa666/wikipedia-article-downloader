==Banner of the nuns==

Where is the story of the Moravian nuns of Bethlehem, PA presenting Pulaski with a silken battle flag? Longfellow thought enough of the incident to write a poem about it.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.25.46.188|2.25.46.188]] ([[User talk:2.25.46.188|talk]]) 20:14, 4 November 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Name==
Why is this page under the name Casimir Pulaski while his name was Kazimierz Pułaski? His name was simplified by the Americans (like many names are), but he himself never used it AFAIK. For me it's like moving the [[Margaret Thatcher]] to [[Iron Lady]]... I'm moving this page to where it belongs. [[User:Halibutt|Halibutt]] 06:44, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:Why? Because this is the English Wikipedia, and you'll find that his name has been written in English as Casimir Pulaski since the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]. Perhaps you'll really move it back to where it belongs. Btw, the letter [[Ł]] does not exist in the English language either. [[User:Dr. Dan|Dr. Dan]] 14:39, 11 September 2007 (UTC) p.s. Margaret Thatcher to &quot;Iron Lady&quot; is not much of an analogy.
::I'd say Casimir Pulaski makes more sense. English language Google results for ''&quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; -day'' are manifold more numerous than English language results for ''&quot;Kazimierz Pu&amp;#322;aski&quot; -day'' [[User:LaFoiblesse]] 2008-12-07 16:37 (GMT)
:::Amen.  It's total bullshit that Poles who don't speak English as their first, second, or even third language are allowed to make decisions (ie, stuff the ballot box) as to what is the proper ENGLISH name for CASIMIR Pulaski on WP.  Once again nationalism triumphs over accuracy and usability on WP.  One of the many reason WP is hopelessly, fatally flawed. [[Special:Contributions/68.73.93.130|68.73.93.130]] ([[User talk:68.73.93.130|talk]]) 11:29, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
:::The hypocrisy around this issue is made manifest when you look up the POLISH WP entry for George Washington and discover that Polish WPians insist on spelling his name &quot;Jerzy Waszyngton&quot;.  Of course you'd never find an English speaker so arrogant as to tell Polish speakers how they should spell the name of the FATHER of OUR country.  We understand that different languages use different spellings.  Too bad certain Polish WPians here on English WP aren't as understanding and considerate.  Moreover, it's too bad that WP allows them to ballot-stuff. [[Special:Contributions/68.73.93.130|68.73.93.130]] ([[User talk:68.73.93.130|talk]]) 18:28, 10 March 2009 (UTC)
::::Hmm, you do realise that by demanding that English Wikipedia use English spellings in all cases, you validate the use of Polish spelling in all cases on Polish Wikipedia. If you demand that this article about a Pole be called Casimir Pulaski, then there is no reason that the Poles should not have a Jerzy Waszyngton article for the American president. That is, if we are to go by your reasoning. Now remind me, who is the hypocrite? ~~ [[User:Lothar von Richthofen|Lothar von Richthofen]] ([[User talk:Lothar von Richthofen|talk]]) 18:07, 15 November 2010 (UTC)
:::::First, the rule on the English Wikipedia is that the most commonly used spelling in English is the one employed for the article title. Sometimes that means using a non-English version because a foreign version is more common among English speakers. Second, I don't think anyone here would give a rat's backside how any other language's George Washington article rendered his name. Third, the IP editor ''did not'' have a problem with rendering Washington's name in Polish for the Polish WP and didn't think you'd find an English speaker so arrogant as to try to force English spelling on the Polish WP, so your attempt to turn his charge of hypocrisy back on him was pretty silly. Third and finally, the IP editor does realise that insisting on English usage on this WP validates Polish usage on the Polish WP. That was his bloody point. Next time you decide to take umbrage at someone else's contribution, you may want to take the time to make sure you didn't wildly misinterpret what it says. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 18:36, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

==Fort Pulaski==

I'm under the belief that [[Fort Pulaski]] was named after Kazimierz but I'm yet to find some information on that... I'm looking but if someone can find some solid info, please add it to this article (I've heard this while in Savannah - which is cited in the article). Also, we need a [[Fort Pulaski]] page. I've got royalty free images of the Fort so I can help there. [[User:JoeHenzi|JoeHenzi]] 03:45, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)

==A movie reference==

As I recollect, there was a ship with his name in a movie &quot;A year of the dragon&quot;, but I can't confirm it just now. I'm still putting the info on the page, since the movie is a cult and the name of the ship was crucial to the plot.

==Birth and death dates==

I reverted the changes to Pulaski's birth and death dates made by user [[User:64.107.1.95]] even though they are sourced (in the edit summary), because:
#This user is a notorious vandal and puppeeter with a ''modus operandi'' of making subtle (and, so far, always incorrect) date changes to articles (among many other things -- see [[User:Dijxtra/Sock]] for details). It appears that he surfs the web for any source that contradicts commonly-accepted data -- dates in particular -- and adopts a mindless holy crusade to force Wikipedia to accept this data. Not conducive to my being comfortable about this, to being with.
#I have some questions about the [http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/buried/buried.html source]. Some of the language seems slightly less than scholarly (''&quot;Never before were so many errors made against one man as in the case of Pulaski,&quot; Pinkowski said. &quot;He was a victim of corruption, lies, forgeries, trumped up charges, revisions of history and defamation of character.&quot;''). And the Polish-American Journal is of a reputation unknown to me. Pinkowski may be correct, but for now I don't think we have enough verification to change the commonly-accepted dates. [[User:Herostratus|Herostratus]] 19:07, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

*Users like Herostratus keep on changing everything that's correct, vandals like that should not be allowed.

::So what ''is'' his birth date? OK, I understand that the day of the month is questionable, but two different years (1745 and 1746) are given in the article. The Cath. Encyc. and one of the other refs here say 1748. I have 2 dead-tree dictionaries here, one says 1748 with a &quot;?&quot;, the other 1747. Oj kochany!--[[User:BillFlis|BillFlis]] 17:39, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

:::1745 and 1746: 4 March 1746 is stated up top in the Intro, then that is forgotten in the Bio section where instead two dates in March of 1745 are given. Then if one looks at [[:File:Pomnik_Kazimierz_Pulaski.jpg|the photo of the statue]] in Freedom Plaza, it reads: 1747. — [[User:RVJ|RVJ]] ([[User talk:RVJ|talk]]) 06:58, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

::An argument in favor his birthday being March 4 instead of March 6 is that March 4 is the feast day of St. Casimir, the patron saint of Poland.

==Monument in Baltimore==

I just visited Baltimore and noticed a small park in passing where the Pulaski Highway intersects E. Fayette Street.  There is a statue and a cannon there - and I think it is probably a monument to General Pulaski.  Can someone in Baltimore check?  Then we could add it to the list of Pulaski monuments/memorials. [You can readily see the statue and cannon on Google Earth at  39°17'40.61&quot;N  76°34'45.87&quot;W.] 
[[User:Dmbstudio|Dmbstudio]] 19:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

That is a memorial to soliders of the Spanish-American War, actually.  There is a monument to Pulaski not to far away in [[Patterson Park]].

==Oh how underrated!==

I've been meaning to revise the introduction but have not figured out a way to make it concise. For one it needs to be mentioned that Pulaski spent his own money to fund and organize many of his units. Secondly, the fact that he saved George Washington's life at the Battle of Brandywine fails to be mentioned here. Washington thought it notable and promoted Pulaski to Brigadier General of the American Cavalry. Third, his quote `I came here, where freedom is being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.' should be incorporated into the article. Lastly, I think (if passed by the House and President Bush) his honorary citizenship should be mentioned in the opening summary seeing as there have only been seven people to be ever recognized in this way. 

I would like to see all these things included but would like some feedback and discussion regarding the inclusion of this information. Should the opening summary be extended, should new sections be added? Thanks in advance. [[User:JRWalko|JRWalko]] 23:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

==&quot;Full Holiday&quot;==

I'm in Illinois right now, the first Monday in March, in school. There is no full holiday! [[User:KC109|THE KC]] ([[User talk:KC109|talk]]) 15:29, 3 March 2008 (UTC).

==The &quot;Father of American [[Cavalry]]&quot;==

Is designating Pulaski, &quot;the father of American cavalry&quot; replete with the [[WP:Weasel]] &quot;sometimes called&quot; appropriate, even with a citation by [[Leszek Szymański]]? It should at least be formulated grammatically, if included. [[User:Dr. Dan|Dr. Dan]] ([[User talk:Dr. Dan|talk]]) 02:12, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

==Marching Backwards?==

I suspect that the following paragraph is Wikiality and I believe it should be stricken from this article:

&quot;On his day there is a Pulaski Day parade on Fifth Avenue in New York City ([2]). The parade is known for its nontraditional approach. Participants in the parade walk backwards to commemorate Pulaski's brave march backwards into the city of Savannah.

==Please Move This Back to Casimir Pulaski==

Honestly, why is the English wikipedia overrun by foreigners telling native English-speakers how to spell things in English?  Why does the English wikipedia have an entry with that L with a line through it, a letter that doesn't exist in English?

This is nuts.  Somebody has to put a stop to these people.  The argument was very clearly laid out above on the talk page.  Seriously. Let's get this done.

::It is ridiculous to say this is beating a dead horse. The move discussion occurred in 2006. What's more, the &quot;leans opposed&quot; used on closing it was silly once you look at the arguments. The people in favour of moving it say that this is the English language Wiki, so the most common version in English should be used. Since Casimir is the most common in English, it follows that the title should use it. Most people opposing it did so on the basis that Casimir is also used in the lead so it doesn't matter. A few other resorted to the argument that changing this spelling could result in removing the diacritical marks from other pages. Now, Piotr refers us to [[WP:Diacritics]]. This issue has little to do with diacritical marks as only the middle &quot;l&quot; is offers choice between diacritical and non-diacritrical versions; the main point of contention is &quot;Casimir&quot; versus &quot;Kazimierz&quot;. At any rate, the guideline begins begins, &quot;Wikipedia does not decide what characters are to be used in the name of an article's subject; English usage does.&quot; It further states in that paragraph, &quot;Follow the general usage in English [[WP:SOURCES|reliable sources]] in each case, whatever characters may or may not be used in them.&quot; What we should be trying to so here is figure out which one is more common in English.

[[:Kazimierz Pułaski]] → [[Casimir Pulaski]] — Pulaski is far better known in English by the first name &quot;Casimir&quot;, and English usage uniformly provides for an &quot;l&quot; rather than &quot;ł&quot; in his last name. This issue was debated in 2006, when one editor said the presence of the name &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; somehow means the page shouldn't be moved to it. That is nonsensical, yet it was relied on by most editors opposing the move. Another editor said because he was a Pole, we should use a Polish spelling. That is not how Wikipedia works. Article titles are based on the most common usage ''in English''. One editor takes this an issue about diacritical marks for all Polish-name articles. That is also a nonsense. Under the guidelines for both article titles and for use of diacritics, common English usage is the guide. For the subject of this article, the regular &quot;l&quot; is clearly more common. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 00:28, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

You want to completely ignore Wikipedia's rules on naming articles in favour of your own view that the Polish version is the &quot;correct&quot; version.

Also, your continued insistence that I should give a flying fuck what a United Nations organization says the word means is absurd. The United Nations is not in charge of setting the definitions of words for speakers of English. The important thing here is that Pulaski's significance to the English-speaking world primarily centers on the United States, where &quot;racism&quot; does apply more or less exclusively to actual race and where accusations of being racist or acting racist are incredibly damaging. Europeans may throw the word around without much thought, though that has not been my experience, buy you have to be sensitive to other English speakers&amp;mdash;especially where those sensitivities have been pointed out to you repreatedly.

Even assuming your expansive definition of &quot;race&quot; whereby it includes ethnicity, nothing the editor said suggested his race or ethnicity is better. What you have failed to understand, over and over again, Loosmark, is that the editor was suggesting native speakers would have a better handle on what is common English usage than non-native speakers. That has nothing to with ethnicity. Rather, it is merely a logical argument based on premise that people with the best command of and exposure to the language are best equipped to determine what the common usage in the language is. I disagree with him not because I think that incorrect, but because I still think the non-native speakers are good enough at determining what is common usage that there is no reason for recusal.

*****It is a stupid question. You keep saying that a person's name is a person's name. That shows a stunning level of, to put it nicely, misinformation. The subject of this article very clearly was known by at least two different spellings of his name (a Polish one and an English one). Also, regardless of what he called himself, he is known in English as &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot;. You keep saying we're &quot;translating&quot; his name. We're not. We are using the most common version of his name in the English language. When you suggest that we should use native versions of names, you are suggesting we not follow the standard naming conventions of Wikipedia, yet you provide no reason why this article should be different.

* Most of the arguments above are completely irrelevant and incorrect - it doesn't matter what other language wikis do (different languages have different behaviours regarding adapting proper names, and there's certainly no &quot;reciprocal arrangements&quot;). The signature doesn't matter (we don't put William Shakespeare under any spelling used in his signatures, to borrow an example above).  The mistaken interpretation of WP:UE regarding diacritics has been dealt with above, and the request for non-first language English speakers to refrain from commenting deserves all the disdain that can be afforded to it.
:The idea that people have ''a'' (unique) Foo-ian name and ''a'' (unique) Goo-ian is also more often than not an over-simplification; usually in Foo-ian literature ''both'' names are used, and it is the relative frequency of the two that is important.  [[Ratisbon]], [[Vilvoorde|Filford]] and [[Mechlin]] are inventions of the English language that English writers now use far, far less frequently than the indigenous names - and what is currently commonly used in English language texts by English language authors is what counts, per [[WP:UE]].  The mere ''existence'' of an exonym does not automatically preclude the use of an endonym - only ''prevailing use'' of the exonym does.
:In this particular case, Kazimierz is used by some English language sources (e.g. [http://poland.usembassy.gov/embassy-events-2009/president-obama-signs-resolution-granting-u.s.-citizenship-posthumously-to-kazimierz-puaski-10-november-2009],[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/483059/Kazimierz-Pulaski]) so claiming it is ''only'' a Polish usage is obvious incorrect exaggeration.

==General McIntosh==

Just before the Siege of Savannah, Pulaski was ordered to link up with General McIntosh's force at Augusta and proceed in advance of General Lincoln to Savannah.  Two references on Pulaski, [[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography]] and [[American National Biography]], refer to McIntosh as John McIntosh.  However, I could find no Revolutionary War general by that name and concluded it was actually [[Lachlan McIntosh]].  And I did find a source to support this version. So I leave this note here to indicate why I am ignoring Appletons' on this point and going with a more obscure source. [[User:Bob Burkhardt|Bob Burkhardt]] ([[User talk:Bob Burkhardt|talk]]) 02:59, 23 March 2010 (UTC)

==Appletons==

A lot of the biography has been lifted verbatim from Appletons.  Although not a copyright violation (since it's out of copyright) it should nevertheless by quoted, and more importantly care should be taken to verify since Appletons is notoriously unreliable. [[Special:Contributions/99.149.197.216|99.149.197.216]] ([[User talk:99.149.197.216|talk]]) 02:33, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
: After a year or so experience working with Appletons', I agree with Schindler's rule that &quot;articles on Latin American subjects should be used cautiously until verified against other sources.&quot; Please note the period.  The knowledge of the editors was rather stronger on European and American history and affairs than on Latin American history and affairs, though even for the latter domain they made a very creditable, and in most cases valuable, attempt to include it in their compilation.

==Naming Conventions==

I'd just like point out that the German, French, Spanish, and Swedish (and Polish, of course) versions of this page all use '''Kazimierz Pułaski'''. I'm not going to request a move back to the more native spelling of Pu'''ł'''aski's name (though I certainly would like to) since I feel like the proponents of the Anglicised name would laugh me out of here for it. I just find it interesting that even the French, who are usually quite the defenders of their language's purity, have the proper spelling of his name, not local variants. [[User:Lothar von Richthofen|Lothar von Richthofen]] ([[User talk:Lothar von Richthofen|talk]]) 09:11, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
:Since you say you don't intend to start a move discussion, it is not clear what your purpose is in writing, but I will assume you have some purpose and will respond: An English-speaking country has a significant connection with Pulaski. As a result, a common English spelling exists. Pulaski had nothing like his relationship with the United States with the other countries you named (aside from Poland), so it makes sense that (assuming they have an equivalent to [[WP:COMMONNAME]]) no native-language version is used with sufficient frequency to displace the Polish version in those languages. You titled this section &quot;Naming Conventions&quot;, yet interestingly made no effort to discuss naming conventions at all. I will. At the English version of Wikipedia, with few exceptions (none of which are relevant here), we use the most common version of the most common name of the subject ''in English''. As has been established in previous discussions, &quot;Casimir Pulaski&quot; is the most common English version, which is why the article is at this title. I hope that addresses whatever reasons you had for beginning this discussion. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 09:35, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
::Yes, I understand this. This was more a comment than an attempt at creating an in-depth discussion, since I regrettably missed the move debate.

:::You say using &quot;native&quot; spellings is somehow respectful, suggesting that using the English version of his name is not. I would suggest to you that using the Polish version on the English Wikipedia disrespects Pulaski's contribution to the founding the United States by treating with more distance that is actually done normally by English speakers. Moreover, if you don't care about naming conventions, you should avoid naming discussions, completed or not. It is precisely that sort of disregard that was so troublesome in moving this page to a title that actually conformed to the projects guidelines rather than one that merely reflected the emotional and nationalistic preferences of certain editors. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 18:54, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

==Casimir Pulaski vs Kazimierz Pułaski==

I realize that the man is seen as an American hero of some sorts, but the man only spent '''two''' years of his life in America until his death and never identified himself as an American. Further, outside of the United States, he is known much more for his achievements in Poland and Europe than in America, so much so that Benjamin Franklin wanted to hire him in the first place. The man was brought over to America as a mercenary and died as a mercenary. I see no reason at all why his name should be Anglicized, the article should be renamed to the Polish version and have Casimir Pulaski redirect here.

== [[Siege of Charleston]] ==

I think that the link to this may be correct. While the infobox there is for the battle in March 29 – May 12, 1780, the article also describes events from 1778 in the background, events in which Pulaski participated (and died). As such, I think that the link is valid as it is. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 17:14, 20 November 2012 (UTC)
:There are any number of battle articles that describe events well before those of the actual battle.  But we don't say that someone who marched to New York around the time of the [[Battle of Long Island]], was therefore in the [[Battle of Trenton]] (and those events are only separated by a few months in 1776).  To say Pulaski was in a siege whose major dates are in 1780 (when he had been dead for months), and which had an intervening major event in which he actually died, borders on the absurd.
:Pulaski was in Charleston in May 1779, at a time when British forces from Savannah made an advance toward the city.  The details of this are best describe in the background to [[Battle of Stono Ferry]], which was the only major engagement of that thrust.  All I've been able to read of Pulaski's involvement at Charleston is that he arrived about the time the British were approaching, and skirmished with them on the same day that British General Prevost learned that Continental forces were marching toward the city.  This latter intelligence (combined with the fact that Prevost was not really prepared for a siege, having knowingly overextended his force) is typically credited with prompting the British retreat at this time.  Pulaski apparently followed and harassed them, which gained him further popularity.  None of his contributions at this time seem to have been of particular military value.  (This view is at odds with his 19th century biographers, who it seems sought to glorify every little thing he did in North America.) See [http://books.google.com/books?id=3rUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95#v=onepage&amp;f=false Griffin (1911)] for some historiography and excerpts of primary accounts.
:Works that describe this episode against Charleston in 1779 in detail are not particularly numerous; the one in [http://books.google.com/books?id=5DFy0eWaPxIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;f=false Russell] is pretty good, and summarizes Pulaski's skirmish.

==New sections==
*I just added a new section 'Personal life'. The only thing contained in it (at this time) is content about Pulaski's membership in the [[Masonic Order]]. Looking over the page, there doesn't seem to be much else about Pulaski's personal life other than mention of his mother, brother, etc. Did Pulaski have a wife, children? I placed this new section under 'United States' as his Masonic involvements occurred in this country, however we may want to move it and have it follow after the lede section if we can add other content about his childhood, family, any wife and children, etc.  As section names go, do we need a section named 'Biography'? It seems redundant, as the entire page is the Pulaski biography. IMO it should simply be omitted as it has no text in it of itself. The other sections seem to suffice without it. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|Gwillhickers]] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers|talk]]) 08:58, 21 April 2013 (UTC)

The article names the ''Wasp'' as the ship on which Pulaski died in 1779, however the [[USS Wasp (1775)|USS ''Wasp'']] was destroyed in 1777.

The source for the existing statement clearly refers to a [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ94/html/PLAW-111publ94.htm ''USS Wasp''] but makes no mention of this ''naval'' ship being a [[Privateer|''privateer'']], i.e.not a naval ship. -- [[USS Wasp|All (?) the other ''Wasps'']] were built years after Pulaski died so there is an apparent discrepancy as to the exact vessel in question. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|Gwillhickers]] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers|talk]]) 03:51, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

But despite the Act of Congress, I would think that if the majority of sources that mention ''Wasp'' describe her as a US vessel, without claiming she was a naval vessel, that should be given due weight.

So far [http://www.poles.org/birth.html] and [http://www.poles.org/B_day_12/PulaskiBooklet3.pdf] seem most reliable w/ regards to discussing his place and date of birth. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 07:09, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

==Pulaski a &quot;mercenary&quot;?==
In the lede it says that Pulaski was ''&quot;a [[soldier of fortune]], following the endorsement of Benjamin Franklin&quot;'', yet the link redirects and takes you to a page entitled ''[[Mercenary]]'', someone who becomes a soldier for profit and personal gain. Is this really an accurate statement as concerns Pulaski? We know that he came to the United States as a foreigner, but does this automatically make him a mercenary? Wouldn't it be more accurate to refer to this man as a ''[[Freedom fighter]]'' -- esp when you consider his involvements in Poland, the saving of Washington's life, his cavalry charge at Savannah, costing him his life? Mercenaries have a reputation for not taking such risks since they're only in it for the money and want to live to collect their 'pound of salt'. I realize that some of the sources refer to him as a ''soldier of fortune'' but they distinguish this phrase in terms that his fate and exile form Poland was his ''fortune''. In any case, Pulaski wasn't a war profiteer and engaged in the Polish uprising and American revolution for ideological reasons. It seems we won't find a source that refers to Pulaski as a ''Freedom fighter'', but do we have to refer to him as a ''soldier of fortune'', esp since this links to a page entitled ''Mercenary''? This is (very) misleading. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|Gwillhickers]] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers|talk]]) 03:28, 23 April 2013 (UTC)
:I agree; this is an unreferenced relic of one of our public domain 19th century sources. Freedom fighter is better. He was fighting for ideals more so then for money. It could be a tad problematic, too, requiring a citation, just remove &quot;as a soldier of fortune&quot; and good riddance. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 06:35, 23 April 2013 (UTC)

These are general and basic facts about his personal life and belong in the ''Persoanl life'' section. Can we please un-hide that sourced statement?  Another good reason to include this basic context is 'depth of knowledge', which is expected for a FA, so we should aim high on that note alone. Is the plan now to sit ideal with a GA and do nothing else with it besides tweak it? As it is, this biography has very little to say about Pulaski's personal life.

Regarding religion, I see no problem mentioning it in text, but I simply don't see this is relevant in the lead.

Needs a photo and GPS coordinates! --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 15:39, 3 May 2013 (UTC)

==Flags in info box==
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.svg|right|100px]]

There seems to be some confusion as to which flag or coat of arms should be used in the [[Casimir Pulaski]] and [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] info boxes. If Pulaski and Kościuszko were from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] which was established in 1595 and disappeared in 1795, shouldn't we use one of the images? -- [[User:Gwillhickers|Gwillhickers]] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers|talk]]) 07:50, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
:Probably better. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 07:53, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
::The flag, I should think as it will match the use of a flag for the US. And yes, we should use the one that actually pertains to the country as it existed in his lifetime. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 08:45, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
::::One of the contributing editors here had included the (above left) flag but it was removed for a reason that seems questionable in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Casimir_Pulaski&amp;diff=554187162&amp;oldid=554161834 corresponding edit history]. This is the flag used in the info box on the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] page and was used here (and prior to) when this article became a GA. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|Gwillhickers]] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers|talk]]) 15:54, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
:The &quot;flag&quot; found in the infobox at [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is correctly labeled there as a royal banner from c. 1605. So firstly, it was a royal banner, not a flag (these are two different things). Secondly, what was valid in 1605 was not valid in 1746. This illustration is a modern rendering of a royal banner pictured on the [[Stockholm Roll]] (no article in English Wikipeida yet, but if you read Polish, see [[:pl:Rulon polski]]). It bears the coat of arms of not only Poland and Lithuania, but also Sweden, because the Polish king at that time had a personal claim to the Swedish throne. Polish kings in the 18th century had no claims to Sweden whatsoever. Using the 1605 royal banner as if it was some official design of a national flag throughout the history of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is simply wrong. The Commonwealth did not have a flag in the modern sense. Each individual king had his royal banner, that's all. 
:On a more general note, please read [[WP:INFOBOXFLAG]], the first sentence of which says, &quot;Flag icons should only be inserted in infoboxes in those cases where they convey information in addition to the text. Flag icons are visually distracting in infoboxes and lead to unnecessary disputes when over-used.&quot; This case is a great example of why trying too hard to have &quot;flags&quot; in an infobox is a bad idea. — [[User:Kpalion|Kpalion]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Kpalion|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:07, 12 May 2013 (UTC)
::I take the silence as concession to my arguments, so I will remove the icons from infoboxes in both articles. In any case, please do not revert without responding here first. — [[User:Kpalion|Kpalion]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Kpalion|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:01, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
