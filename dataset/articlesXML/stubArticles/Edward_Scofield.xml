'''Edward Scofield''' (March 28, 1842{{spaced ndash}}February 3, 1925) was an [[United States|American]] politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|19th]] [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] of [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=1686&amp;search_term=scofield]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Scofield was born in [[Clearfield County, Pennsylvania]] on March 28, 1842.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallant&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=A Gallant Comrade |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1461124/edward_scofield_18421925/|newspaper=The National Tribune|date=September 24, 1896|page=8|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = December 24, 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a printer's apprentice at a newspaper in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], and worked in the newspaper business for a number of years.

==Career==
Scofield fought in the [[American Civil War]] as a member of the [[11th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallant&quot;/&gt; Commissioned a lieutenant, after the [[Battle of South Mountain]] he was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]. He participated in all the battles and marches of his [[regiment]] up to the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] on May 5, 1864, where he was taken prisoner and incorrectly reported as dead. He was a prisoner for ten months, during which time he was held in southern prisons before being released at [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] on March 1, 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisconsin Blue Book page 748&quot;&gt;Wisconsin Blue Book, 1899 edition, page 748&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to major after his release.

After his recuperation from illness, Scofield worked in the &quot;engineer corps&quot; of the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]]. In 1868, he moved to [[Oconto, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallant&quot;/&gt; where he entered the lumber business and became a principal in the Marinette Mill Co. He entered politics when he was elected to the [[Wisconsin State Senate]] in 1886 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], beating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Amos Holgate. He was appointed to the [[standing committee]]s on [[engrossed bill]]s (which he chaired) and on [[railroads]].&lt;ref&gt;Timme, Ernst G., ed. ''The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1887'' Madison, 1887; pp. 465, 472, 484&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 Scofield was elected as the 19th [[Governor of Wisconsin]]. He entered the gubernatorial race as a conservative against progressive Republican [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]]. Winning the Republican nomination on the sixth ballot, he defeated his Democratic opponent [[Willis C. Silverthorn]] in a five-way [[general election]]: 264,981 for Scofield; 169,257 for Silverthorn; 8,140 for [[Prohibition Party|Prohibitionist]] Joshua Berkey; 1,306 for Christ Tuttrop of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]]; and 407 for Robert Henderson of the [[Nationalist Clubs|Nationalist Party]]. During his tenure, he introduced the first governor's budget in Wisconsin,  established a central accounting system, and oversaw revision of the state's banking laws. He increased public school funding and helped raise troops to serve in the Spanish-American War. After completing a second term in office, he returned to his business interests in Oconto.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisconsin Blue Book page 748&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
The last of several Civil War veterans to serve as Governor of Wisconsin, Scofield died in his home in Oconto on February 3, 1925 (age 82 years, 312 days). He is [[burial|interred]] at Evergreen Cemetery in Oconto.

==Family life==
Scofield married Agnes Potter (1850â€“1919)&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Edward Scofield Expires in Hospital |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1461139/agnes_potter_scofield_18501919/|newspaper=Oshkosh Daily Northwestern|date=December 8, 1919|page=15|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = December 24, 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had three children, Julia, Paul, and George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scofield|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wioconto/scofield.htm|publisher=Oconto County WIGenWeb Project|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
