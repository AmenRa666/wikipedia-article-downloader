==K-21==
On July 5th, 1942 the Russian submarine K-21 located the German escort of Operation Rösselsprung and claimed to have hit Tirpitz with two torpedoes.  However, the ship's war logs report no such incident, and she reportedly wasn't damaged.  One Russian theory dictates that the Tirpitz was indeed damaged, but was quietly brought in to berth and repaired to avoid the Führer's wrath.  This seems somewhat far-fetched, however.&lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:206.213.157.4 |206.213.157.4 ]] ([[User talk:206.213.157.4 |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/206.213.157.4 |contribs]])  17:57, 29 March 2005 (UTC) &lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

Western historians tryed to prove that K-21 missed. How they did it ? Look in the book of David Irving &quot;The Destruction of Convoy PQ-17&quot; http://www.fpp.co.uk/books/PQ17/2009edition.pdf at this map http://zhurnal.lib.ru/img/t/tonina_o_i/tirpitz-lunin-01shtml/002.jpg Mr.Irving so aspired to pull a CONDOM on an ELEFANT that HAS crossed out ALL GEOGRAPHICS! At this map the point 23°40′E is to the west from the point 23°10′E. That is mr.Irving, in struggle against Russians, has decided to change ALL GRID of GEOGRAPHICAL COORDINATES ON MOTHER EARTH![[Special:Contributions/195.26.84.250|195.26.84.250]] ([[User talk:195.26.84.250|talk]]) 20:52, 9 April 2011 (UTC)Arthur

:There's simply no evidence that the torpedoes hit - the Germans would have recorded the maintenance done to repair the alleged damage, as they did in every other instance. I don't know what you're trying to prove with the link to Irving's book. Can you be more specific? [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 03:00, 10 April 2011 (UTC)

The Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismarck_class_battleship wrote the Tirpitz after the operation &quot;Knight's Move&quot; about :
&quot;a large caisson was built to allow the rudders to be replaced.[52] Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin stated that &quot;the repairs to this ship were one of the most difficult naval engineering feats of World War II.&quot;
The replace of the rudders was finished in jan.1943. And at what here K-21? The rudders were cracked itself.:)

:You may not be aware, but ships require periodic maintenance to keep them operational. As for the refit for Tirpitz, it happened in October, the K-21 attack occurred in June. How do you explain the 4 month gap? And do you mean to tell me the two alleged hits forced the replacement of the water tubes in the boilers as well? [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 03:00, 10 April 2011 (UTC)

==General Characteristics==
There seems to be some confusion over the units and notation.  For example &quot;Length: 253,6 m overall&quot;.  Shouldn't this read &quot;2,536 m&quot; (two kilometers long) or should it read &quot;253.6 m&quot;?  There are similar problems else where, for example speed is given as &quot;30,8 knots&quot; rather than &quot;30.8&quot;.  Curioulsy the crews complement is listed as &quot;2.608,&quot;, in other words just over two and a half men!  But others areas appear correct such as &quot;3 three-blade propellers, 4.70 m &quot;.  This needs sortign out as the article looses credibility.  --[[User:ManInStone|ManInStone]] 10:22, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

==german navy flag==
the picture needs to be decreased in size, it's quality is WAY to low for it to be displayed at that size.

==British attempts to sink Tirpitz==
I have added descriptions (some minor) of various attacks on the ''Tirpitz''. It arguable that these should be described individually in separate articles. Could do this, but some are very minor and being together they show the progression and linkage between the attempts. Or should I expand the major ones into articles? [[User:Folks at 137|Folks at 137]] 17:30, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

==Dimensions?==
Stated dimensions are: 251m x 36m x 8.7m

251m is length, 36m is probably height, and 8.7 - width?

Judgin by this picture, the width should be at least 4 times that.

http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/germany/battleships/tirpitz/22_kaafjord_mar_1943.jpg

Please verify.
:36 m is width, 8.7m is [[Draft (nautical)|draft]]. But draft should be 10m or more, see Bismarch article for data. --[[User:Denniss|Denniss]] 18:08, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

::This site [http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/battleships/tirpitz/tech.html] has these dimensions:
::Length (Total): 251,0 m
::Length (Waterline):241,6 m
::Beam: 36,0 m
::Draft: 10,6 m
::This site [http://www.bismarck-class.dk/technicallayout/generaldetails.html] gives 9.9m for &quot;designed draft&quot; and 10.61m as &quot;maximum draft&quot;, and compares Bismarck &amp; Tirpitz.

==Suggestions==
The following suggestions were generated by a semi-automatic [[User:AndyZ/peerreviewer.js|javascript program]], and &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;may or may not be accurate&lt;/font&gt; for the article in question.
*The lead of this article may be too long, or may contain too many paragraphs. {{#if:{{{1|}}}|For an article of this length, the lead should contain {{{1}}}-{{{2}}} paragraphs.|}} Please follow guidelines at [[WP:LEAD]]; be aware that the lead should adequately summarize the article.
*Per [[WP:CONTEXT]] and [[WP:MOSDATE]], months and days of the week generally should not be linked. Years, decades, and centuries can be linked if they provide [[WP:CONTEXT|context]] for the article.

==Largest?==
This:-&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;She is also the biggest warship ever built in Europe&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Has been changed and reverted a couple of times; whats the thinking, here?&lt;br /&gt;
She was one of a pair, so there can't be much in it; and I thought the ''Hood'' and the ''Littorio's'' were about the same size, and that ''Vanguard'' was bigger (though that page says 48,000 tons, which seems too big). Any thoughts? [[User:Xyl 54|Xyl 54]] 17:23, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

:48,000 t is probably the full load displacement of ''Vanguard'' she is described as marginally heavier than ''Hood'' but ''Hood'' was longer. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] 20:58, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

::I've checked Conway for this; unhelpfully, they don't give a standard displacement for ''Hood'', but full load was 48,360t in 1940; ''Littorio'' was 40,724t standard, 45,236t full load. So they're a bit smaller. ''Vanguard'' was 44,500t standard, 51,429t full load; so, make of that what you will. A bit bigger when empty, a bit smaller when full. (Conway gives the same displacements as this page for Tirpitz). [[User:Xyl 54|Xyl 54]] ([[User talk:Xyl 54|talk]]) 16:10, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

==Rosselsprung==
I've re-written this section;&lt;br /&gt;
This : “On 4 July 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and her escorts left port to sail to a new base.�? Is misleading;&lt;br /&gt;
And this : “but due to the efficiency of the U-boats and aircraft in dealing with the convoy the sortie was aborted�? is plain wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
So I’ve corrected it.&lt;br /&gt;
(There is a discussion [[Talk:Arctic convoys of World War II#PQ-17| here]] if anyone is interested).&lt;br /&gt;

==Tirpitz as scrap - needs verification==
I added &quot;Verification needed&quot; to two comments in this section.  First, regarding the sentence, &quot;However, a large portion of the bow remains where it sank in 1944.&quot;  At least one photo exists that shows the tip of the bow being removed, and can be found (among other photos) at http://www.bismarck-class.dk/tirpitz/gallery/themes/gallthemetirscrapping.html.  Also, regarding the comment, &quot;the ship's electrical generators were used for a temporary power station&quot;, I question whether any of the ship's equipment would have been usable after the attack.  I think these two sentences are rather important, and as such should be verified.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Elsquared|Elsquared]] ([[User talk:Elsquared|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Elsquared|contribs]]) 00:06, 4 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Fleet in being==
While I realise that the fanbois need a way to justify this ship's career, I'd be interested to know how many additional RN units were deployed to the NE of the UK because of Tirpitz's existence. Somehow I suspect the answer is rather small. Any ideas for a reference? [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:55, 2 June 2009 (UTC)
: For example: [[Operation Tungsten]]. Your recent edits regarding removal of the fleet-in-being information (stated by numerous authors btw) is not supported, either in this article or in the Bismarck class article. Would you kindly restore the previous consensus view? Yours truely, a 'fanboi' (please refrain from incivility in the future). [[User:Kurfürst|Kurfürst]] ([[User talk:Kurfürst|talk]]) 20:35, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

::Nope, that is a task force that was raised for a specific mission. A fleet in being succeeds if it locks up units on a continuous basis, otherwise it is merely an intermittent nuisance that you attempt to eliminate when you have spare capacity. So, I repeat, how any additional units were stationed off the NE of the UK specifically to suppress Tirpitz over the long term? A reference would be nice.  [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:14, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

:I have to say what your (or my opinion) on the matter is rather irrevelant, as it would be OR, but you seem to wielding a hatchet against the so-called 'fanbois' rather than constructively editing. In any case, I have added the reference to Tirpitz role's as 'fleet-in-being', and hopefully, this is where it ends. [[User:Kurfürst|Kurfürst]] ([[User talk:Kurfürst|talk]]) 00:56, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

==correction re: coordinates of wreck==
I'm going to change the sentence, &quot;The main part of the hull (less the decking) is clearly visible&quot;.  First, I just looked on Google Earth and a ship's hull is not visible anywhere in the area.  Not only that, but the given coordinates are incorrect; Tirpitz was actually much closer to shore.  At coords 60 38'49.80&quot;N 18 48'26.21&quot;E is a large rectangular shape, which may have been mistaken for the hull.  But it's actually a work platform from the scrapping.  [[User:Elsquared|Elsquared]] ([[User talk:Elsquared|talk]]) 06:35, 27 September 2009 (UTC)
:APOLOGIES.  Google Earth was apparently experiencing some difficulty tonight.  Inputting the original coords did not send me to the correct spot.

==Faked image==
I've removed the link (for the second time!) to a [http://www.panoramio.com/photo/24981552  photoshopped image] of ''Tirpitz'', as its hardly encyclopaedic. &lt;br&gt;
OTOH the website has some useful views, so I've replaced it with another image from the same source.&lt;br&gt;
If anyone wants to replace the original image, perhaps they should say first what on earth the point of it would be. [[User:Xyl 54|Xyl 54]] ([[User talk:Xyl 54|talk]]) 22:58, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

== &quot;Sunk&quot;? ==

Is it accurate to describe the Tirpitz as having been &quot;sunk&quot; in Operation Catechism? As I understand the sources, Tirpitz was moored on a sand bar and had only a few feet of water under her keel so as to make her incapable of sinking in the traditional use of the word. I assumed that she capsized belly up and THEN sunk a few feet, leaving it resting on the sea bed with her crew trapped inside and most of her hull above the water line. Can someone enlighten me?

:Generally a ship is regarded as 'sunk' if water is over her [[main deck]], when she ceases to be of any usefulness as a ship. If settled in the water on a shallow bottom then provided water is not present in the gun areas the ship may still be able to be used as a gun platform, albeit an immobile one.

:The lack of water over the main decks is why [[HMS Valiant (1914)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] were not regarded as having been sunk when they were mined in [[Alexandria Port|Alexandria Harbour]].  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.7.147.13|80.7.147.13]] ([[User talk:80.7.147.13|talk]]) 21:48, 14 February 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== K-21 2/4 torpedoes ==

&quot;Shortly after Tirpitz left Norway, the Soviet submarine K-21 fired a pair of torpedoes at the ship, both of which missed.&quot;
K-21 fired 4 torpedoes at the Tirpitz. And 2 explosions were fixed.

:If there were torpedo hits on Tirpitz, wouldn't you think it would have been recorded somewhere in german archives?

::::1. &quot;According to Garzke &amp; Dulin, the sub fired only two torpedoes&quot; - I'm very interesting about the source of their opinion! The Germans &quot;had not heard&quot; about K-21 and torpedoes attack, but the authors are absolutely sure about torpedoes count! The single (original) source of the attack's info is the K-21 war log. And there are 4 torpedoes in the salvo according to it (one by one with 4 sec delay). A primitive lie?

::::::'''1)''' Polmar's &amp; Noot (thanks for the links!): &quot;''Lunin fired a spread of '''four''' torpedoes''&quot;. (Regards to Garzke &amp; Dulin with their two trps!) &quot;''The sub. hydrophone op. reported the explosion of two torpedoes after run of 2 min and 15 sec''&quot;. The same question about the explosions: why not 4 min (after exhausting their fuel after 3 min + time of sinking to the seabed)? Not just hydrophone operator, but all crew aboard have heard the explosions through the hull according to memories. There is no answer in the book what object(s) took the torpedoes at 2:15. And a little remarks about authors: &quot;''Lunin was made a Hero... for his feat of attacking and supposedly damaging of Tirpitz''&quot; Nonsense! Feb. 28, 1942 is the date of Linin's award, before the attack. Yes, it is a trustworthy source!
::::::'''2)''' The next one (Zetterling &amp; Tamelander) just said that nobody on the ships observed the attack. Nice, but there is &quot;''Lunin... fired '''four''' torpedos''&quot;. So, the authors have seen the K-21 war log, but have said nothing about the moment of explosion: &quot;''Probably, he had fired the torpedoes at too great of a range''&quot;. Is 2.15 &quot;too great&quot; in comparison with full range time (4 min)!?
::::::'''3)''' Blair also just said, that the Germans have not noticed the attack and nothing else.
::::::So there are no other sources except K-21 warlog and Tirpitz' one (because no one of the authors had '''not''' investigated this event really). Therefore Lunin or Tirpitz' command hasn't wrote truth fully. I have a typewritten Tirpitz' log (for high command? Has anybody seen on-line an original handwritten version?): [http://i080.radikal.ru/1004/47/e6f6e2168223.jpg page 1], [http://s001.radikal.ru/i196/1004/53/1547a4766ce8.jpg page 2] and [http://i070.radikal.ru/1004/88/7241d43b237f.jpg page 3]. At 15:06 the speed was 24 knots (as Lunin said), at 18:58 it was 24 knots too, but at 18.16 as Murmansk radio said the speed was 10 knots and there is a remark in the log that it is true! Why!? And there are no any other initial records about 10 knots speed by the Tirpitz' officers! This means that the Germans had cut several records off the log (or just hadn't entered). So why all the authors stubbornly wrote that K-21 has missed, while her log is fully complete in contrast to the Tirpitz' one? The Tirpitz' belt was able to withstand hit of torpedoes, so the ship with non-critical damage could continue the operation. (about the overhaul I will write in the first K-21 section of the page) --[[User:Zh.Mike|Zh.Mike]] ([[User talk:Zh.Mike|talk]]) 07:04, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
:::::::Why do you think the germans would have removed something from their logs? If they were hit by something they would have to repair this in a floating dock (torpedo usually causes extensive hull damage) and you wouldn't be able to hide this from others.

::::::::You do realize what Blair and Zetterling &amp; Tamelander mean when they say no one observed the attack? That means the torpedoes did not hit the ship. Do you understand what the sailors aboard would have felt if the torpedoes hit?

:::::::::Let's come to to agreement: &quot;''respected naval historians''&quot; have noticed the explosions, but &quot;''the soviets faked documents''&quot;!
:::::::::1. ''Why do you think the germans would have removed something from their logs?'' Just read the Germans log I placed above: at 15.06 the speed was 24 knots, at 18:58 it was 24 too, but at 18.16 the speed was 10 (by the log's record at 20.10!) knots '''without''' any entered records before 18.16! So, who had faked up the Germans docs taken by the British? Soviets? And there are no remarks about incompleteness the log in the article. Do You know smth about another version of the log? If no, that means this only version is incomplete or cut. 
:::::::::2. The &quot;''respected naval historians''&quot; did not claim that the K-21 log is faked up to now. And there are no contradictions in it.
:::::::::3. ''They would have to repair this in a floating dock'' Sure! And they did it: Parsecboy said that it was &quot;''periodic maintenance''&quot;. ''Gneisenau'' during trials (14 Nov - 19 Dec, 1940) had a unsatisfactory work of acoustics. Had Tirpitz better one? She could not spot K-21 and HMS Unshaken. &quot;''Raise national morale''&quot;?
:::::::::4. This &quot;''periodic maintenance''&quot; requires the rudders replacement. After the ''Rösselsprung'' op there weren't any incidents causing the rudders' damage. So what was the reason to full replace the rudders of the ship commissioned at 25 Feb 1941?
:::::::::5. ''it happened in October, the K-21 attack occurred in June. How do you explain the 4 month gap?''. The same question: how do you explain the 4 month gap before &quot;''periodic maintenance''&quot; start? There weren't operations, trials etc. I thinks the spare, Huascaran, caisson, technical stuff, '''new rudders''' etc have been required. 
:::::::::6. The overhaul time after midgets attack was 4 month. It consisted not only the rudders' replacement, but many many other tasks including largest turret's mechanism repairing. The ''periodic maintenance''&quot; time was 3 month. Just for rudders?
:::::::::7. ''Regardless, these authors are respected naval historians, unless you can provide equally respected sources, nothing will be changed''. I can provide facts of discrepancy in the books and lack of their own analysis. (Garzke &amp; Dulin with their two torpedoes get the Grand Prix) Only Zetterling &amp; Tamelander tried to discover the cause of this discrepancy (explosions &amp; no damage), but had a timing problem with hits' moments and torpedoes range. So all of them are not the independent sources with independent investigations, but just repeat the Germans' version.
:::::::::8. ''Do you understand what the sailors aboard would have felt if the torpedoes hit?''  Of course! But where can I read about sailors' feeling while the log is incomplete?!
:::::::::9. ''equally respected sources...'' a) Edgar Philip Young, Royal Navy, historian; b) Edward Russell, ''The Scourge of the Swastika'', with a story about ''SS Athenia'' and U-30 under ObLt Lemp, and the Germans cut pages off the war log (maybe, they were soviets?); с) Samuel Eliot Morison said that the logs of most Kriegsmarine ships filled after the return to bases, therefore the navy command did not trust sailors' testimony and checked it according to the neutral press and BBC radio, because the officers were under the influence of the current political situation.
:::::::::10. On the basis of above I propose: a) to fix Garzke &amp; Dulin's &quot;''two torpedoes''&quot; as a rubbish; b) to replace &quot;''both of which missed''&quot; to smth like &quot;''and two explosions took place''&quot; (Zetterling &amp; Tamelander). The facts noticed by your respected historians, not by mine. --[[User:Zh.Mike|Zh.Mike]] ([[User talk:Zh.Mike|talk]]) 21:44, 1 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::::::1 is irrelevant, there are many reasons speed could have been reduced at 18:16. Did you happen to notice the weather report in the entry mentions fog? I don't know about you, but I wouldn't hurdle through fog in a 52,000-ton battleship.
::::::::::2 is also irrelevant; the historians don't ''have'' to claim the Soviet logbook is falsified, because it probably isn't. Wartime reports, especially those made under combat conditions, are [[fog of war|notoriously unreliable]]. Beatty was more than a little embarrassed when several of the German battlecruisers he claimed to have sunk at Jutland steamed into Scapa Flow at the end of the war.
::::::::::3. Where were the floating docks in Norway at this time? Oh right, there weren't any. Read the section on the repair done via repair ships following the British attacks in 1943. 
::::::::::4. Rudders are frequently replaced for mechanical problems. Nevertheless, without a source, all you have is speculation, which is irrelevant.
::::::::::5. Irrelevant speculation
::::::::::6. No, it was a standard overhaul, which included replacing the rudders. 
::::::::::7. Zetterling &amp; Tamelander do not mention any explosions, where are you getting this? The rest is irrelevant - you don't get to determine whether respected naval historians are right or not based on your own amateur analysis.
::::::::::8. Irrelevant
::::::::::9. Irrelevant
::::::::::10. No, there is no mention of explosions in Zetterling &amp; Tamelander, nor in any other source. Allow me to reproduce the passage in question: &quot;The Soviet Submarine K-21 was patrolling off Altafjord, and soon after the ''Tirpitz'' left the estuary, she was seen through the periscope. The commander of the submarine, Ranga Lunin, decided to attack and fired four torpedoes. Nobody on the German warships observed either the submarine or the torpedoes. Schniewind's vessels sailed at 24 knots and soon left Lunin's range, but at least the Germans had been revealed.&quot; Explain to me where the two explosions are.

:::::::::::1. I do not talk about reasons of speed reducing at all, but about presence/absence of entered records about it! There are no records, this means any other event may have not be entered too. (And the weather report has been entered '''after''' the speed had been reduced.)
:::::::::::2. ''The historians don't have to claim the Soviet logbook is falsified, because it probably isn't.'' I fully agreed! But no historians from your list above is hurry to explain the apparent contradiction (2 hits according K-21 log vs. nothing happened at all according T. log)! Are they really historians or am I too amateur with my opinion that contradictions like this must be explained (or mentioned at least)?
:::::::::::3. It was for Denniss - I was talking about repair, not about docks. (I know what ''Huascaran'' means)

And this source is ''yours''.
:::::::::::10-2. ''The commander of the submarine, '''Ranga''' Lunin, decided to attack'' (Zetterling &amp; Tamelander). These historians are respected even more than Garzke &amp; Dulin are! Lunin's name is Nikolai. He was ''commander'', russian equivalent is ''captain of the second rank'' (rus. ''kapitan 2 ranga''). ''Ranga'' is a part of his rank, not the first name.

::::::::::::1. Again, irrelevant speculation. Drop the log book.
::::::::::::2. Not going to dignify that with a response.
::::::::::::4. Rudders can be damaged by all manner of things, without documentation of why the rudder was replaced, you only have irrelevant speculation. Drop it.
::::::::::::7. Polmar and Noot are only repeating the Soviet claim, which is no different from what is already in the article, that they claimed two hits. Polmar and Noot go on to say that the attack failed. To use them to support the claim that the Soviets ''did'' hit the ship is the definition of falsification of evidence.
::::::::::::10. Re: Evans, the word is &quot;psyche&quot;, not &quot;psycho&quot;, there's a difference.
::::::::::::11 How can you misconstrue seven references that claim that the attack failed as not confirming the results of the attack? Do you understand that this is a binary relationship? The torpedoes could have: A: hit the ship, or B:, missed the ship. Option A is a success, option B is a failure. Seven different books have said the attack resulted in option B, which means that the torpedoes did not hit the ship. To change the sentence to read &quot;K-21 fired four torpedoes and two explosions took place&quot; gives the impression that most historians believe she hit ''Tirpitz'' with two torpedoes, which is patently false. Again, see point #7. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 14:09, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::::::4. &quot;''without documentation of why the rudder was replaced...''&quot; What about &quot;''the Germans would have recorded the maintenance done to repair the alleged damage, as they did in '''every other''' instance''&quot;? ''Lützow'' and 2 destroyers have been damaged at that moment '''with''' the proper documentation. So, that is speculation and it was not ordinary collision.
:::::::::::::7. Speculation: Polmar and Noot have said that the attack failed according to the ''Germans''' claim, but in accordance to the ''Soviets'' there were two explosions (read: not &quot;''attack succeeded''&quot;).

:::::::::::::&quot;''The torpedoes could have: A: hit the ship, or B:, missed the ship''&quot; It's incomplete: the torpedoes could have: A: hit the ship and '''exploded''', or B:, missed the ship  and '''did not explode''' (within the range time). It's impossible to miss all the ships and explode. But your &quot;references&quot; (not seven, except of Polmar and Noot) &quot;''have said the attack resulted in option B''&quot; with the torpedoes' behaviour as in options A! Read: it's nonsense! And just Polmar and Noot (not other historians) have tried to coordinate the facts: a) explosions; b) blank docs. Polmar and Noot do not claim that Tirpitz took hits (and I have '''not''' ''changed the sentence''), but they have [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view n''eutral point of view''] in contrary to You and your ''respected'' historians: the facts are there were explosions and the ship's rudders have been replaced without any other collisions and proper documenting of the reason - it must be placed to the article. --[[User:Zh.Mike|Zh.Mike]] ([[User talk:Zh.Mike|talk]]) 08:26, 9 April 2012 (UTC)

For what it's worth, I am currently looking at the SKL war diary copy in the US National Archives, and the report dated 6 July notes that ''Luetzow'' and three destroyers were damaged during the operation, and nothing on ''Tirpitz''. The 9 July entry noted that ''Tirpitz'' was on 12-hour alert, hardly a status for a ship damaged by two torpedoes.

:::The Altafjord image is fine copyright-wise (I used it lower in the article, FWIW) - [[:File:Gallthemetirkaafjord04.jpg|this image]] is the one that does not demonstrate that it is either PD in the US or otherwise suitably licensed. The reason I didn't use the Altafjord photo is because it's low resolution and very grainy - it's not at all a good lead image. I also considered [[:File:Tirpitz early.jpg|this image]], but this is even worse, in my opinion, as it also suffers from low resolution and graininess, but it is also badly warped on either side. I actually gave it a great deal of thought when I started the rewrite, and I wasn't initially thrilled with using the recognition drawing.

I see this guy instead to talk to us about all the changes that he did wrong, he go reports  every person who wants to correct,probably his problem is mental.
First of all ,does this guy understeand that we (readers)dont want to see a machete made by american in ww2 ,exactly in info box?
Why?Because this machete dont ilustrate tirpitz and bismarck class.Is very poor image ,and there are mistakes that dont ilustrate bismarck class.in front behind the second turret,housing has a shape that is not listed in the design of bismarck class ,have a unusualy form ,not like tirpitz which is more like a triangle..... and there a some other issue.
Even so,why on all warship from british and american side there are real photo on infobox ,and here is some toy illustrate picture?

On General characteristic ,i cant find a better source than the book made by Kjetil Åkra and John Asmussen &quot;Tirpitz&quot; which had over 386 page ,about the story of Tirpitz and the many attacks against her,contains camouflage schemes and 3-D images, information about life on board, based on many interviews, technical details, casualty list and many other things.
It is the biggest book ever made of Tirpitz ,and it's highly accurated ,especialy on technical details,because Kjetil Åkra and  John Asmussen  had acces on Kriegsmarine documents ,and they did research for years ----It is not something they have made for them.
In this are follows:

Displacement:-standard 43.900 tonnes
             -maximum 53.500 tonnes (1944) 

Length Overall:253,6 m
       waterline:241,72 m

Maximum draught:10,61 m (1944)

Speed:official recorded 30,8 knots

:I don't know why we're still having this discussion - I won't waste the time to respond to your [[WP:NPA|personal attacks]]. Erich Gröner, '''a German who had wartime access to the Kriegsmarine archives''' states 42,900t displacement as designed and 52,600t at full load. ''Conway's All the World's Battleships'' (the chapter on Germany was written by John Campbell, a ''highly'' regarded naval historian) reports the same figures. Siegfried Breyer gives the same figures in ''Battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The same holds for the length figure (though ''Conway's'' gives a slightly different length: 241.1m lwl and 248m loa).
:As for the speed and radars, the infobox should give the design of the ship as built. For instance, ''Tirpitz'' had the FuMO 30 for less than a year of her operational life, and did not carry it on a single operation. And trial speed rarely matches operational speed, especially when the former is conducted in the calm waters of the Baltic and the latter is the stormy North Sea and even more inclement Arctic. The ship would be hard-pressed to reach even design speeds in those conditions. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 14:49, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

you really have problem boy,you seem that you dont want to discuss with nobody.ch iYou dont understeand that the speed design is just theoretical,which do not apply on seas,the official speed of tirpitz was 30.8 knots,was achieved in autumn of 1941 ,when autumn and winter of 1941 were brutal of the century in point of view of tempertature.You dont interest subject,you only want to edit a subject that you didnt read a book about it.
What to trust more:  the biggest book about Tirpitz  or a citations in a chapter of a book?You must understeand that there are designed displesment which are wrong,is 43,900 mt not 42,900 and full load was 53,500 mt

John Campbell's work is highly regarded as well; for example, his ''Jutland: An Analysis of the Fighting'' is essentially the gold standard on accounts of the battle.

:Again, I would urge that contradictory figures from competing sources be placed in a footnote and I am certain that both sets of displacement figures are correct, as Tirpitz was certainly heavier in 1944 than in 1941. G&amp;D also gives displacement and dimension figures similar to Koop. Regarding speed, again this is not a static value and Tirpitz at full load will certainly be slower than on trials, and 29 knots seems a reasonable figure for full load, full power, while 30.8 knots seems quite unlikely except at an unrealistically low displacement and Koop does comment on this and states a speed on 29kn for Bismarck @ 138k MSHP at 43000 tonnes (note the unrealistically low displacement) and also gives a speed for Tirpitz as 29 knots at 138K MSHP but with no displacement noted. OTOH, he does give a speed of 30.1 knots for Bismarck at 150170 mshp and 30.8 knots for Tirpitz at 163000 mshp (all data from Koop, p.28-29.) but with no displacement given. It was common practise for the Continental European navies (Germany, France, Italy) to run trials at very low displacements with the engines producing overload powers, which could not be sustained for very long, to produce very unrealistic speeds that were not at all related to potential speeds during combat. For example [[HMAS_Sydney_(D48)|HMAS Sydney]] was able to run down a [[Regia_Marina|RM]] cruiser [[Italian_cruiser_Bartolomeo_Colleoni|Bartolomeo Colleoni]] which on paper was at least 5 knots faster.[[User:Damwiki1|Damwiki1]] ([[User talk:Damwiki1|talk]]) 18:35, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

::G&amp;D (p.301-302)state Vanguard's standard displacement as 46,842 mt in 1946. Raven and Roberts (p335) give standard displacement as 44614lt or 45330mt and full load is given as 51537lt or 52364mt, but the table of weights suggests that 46102lt and thus 46842mt is the actual standard displacement (according to the [[Washington_Naval_Treaty|WNT]] definition) since liquid weights subtracted from deep should equal standard. Regarding Tirpitz and Bismarck speeds, the only official speed trial data known to exist states: 
&quot;Speed 28.374 knots.
Footnote 2.
Data from the protocol of the speed trials on 2 November 1940. The speed data are based on an average output of 39170 shaft HP (WPS =Wellenpferdestärke)) per screw and 249.5 RPM per screw at a load addition of 75% and a draft of approx. 8.50 m. Other documents are not available. (Authors note. The document does not say if this concerns &quot;AK Fahrt&quot; (Äußerste Kraft), i.e. extreme full-power speed. The source of the speeds of 30.4 kn, 30.6 kn or 30.8 kn given in the current literature, is puzzling. Blohm &amp; Voss states 30.1 kn.&quot; (From: Schlachtschiff Bismarck: Das Original im Detail, Simon Frey Verlag, 2004, p.8.)&quot; Photos of Bismarck prove that she was not yet completed (no main armament directors) when the Nov 2 1940 trials were run, and a very low displacement is likely. Groner's data regarding speeds seems to me to be reasonable based upon the available sources, but again the debate can be summarized in a footnote and the competing sources given there, so I would suggest that we use Groner's data for the article and summarize the other data in a footnote.[[User:Damwiki1|Damwiki1]] ([[User talk:Damwiki1|talk]]) 21:12, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

::Tirpitz had 3 shafts, so 3 x 39170 = 117.5K mshp but a draft of 8.5m indicates a very light ship, probably about 43K mt. So we have 117.5K mshp = 28.374 kn at ~43K tons, 138k mshp = 29 knots at 43k mt, and this shows a very steeply rising power curve. The power required to drive a ship rises roughly in proportion to the loading, so if Tirpitz required 117.5K mshp to do 28.374 knots at 43k tons, then she would need about 144.8k mshp to do the same speed at 53k mt, and if Tirpitz required 138k mshp to do 29 knots at 43k mt then she would need about 170k mshp to do 29 knots at 53k mt! This data indicates that the claims for 30.1 or 30.8 knots for Bismarck and Tirpitz can only be achieved at very light displacements, and that at typical combat displacements a maximum speed of 29knots or less in very likely just as Groner states.[[User:Damwiki1|Damwiki1]] ([[User talk:Damwiki1|talk]]) 17:44, 23 April 2011 (UTC)
