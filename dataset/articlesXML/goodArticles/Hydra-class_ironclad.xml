The '''''Hydra'' class''' of [[ironclad warship|ironclads]] composed three ships, {{ship|Greek ironclad|Hydra||2}}, {{ship|Greek ironclad|Spetsai||2}}, and {{ship|Greek ironclad|Psara||2}}. The ships were ordered from France in 1885 during the premiership of [[Charilaos Trikoupis]], as part of a wider reorganization and modernization of the Greek armed forces, which had proved themselves inadequate during the [[Cretan uprising]] of 1866. Launched in 1889 and 1890, the ships were ready for service with the [[Greek Navy]] by 1892. They were armed with a main battery of three {{convert|10.8|in|adj=on|0}} guns and five {{convert|5.9|in|adj=on|0}} guns, and had a top speed of {{convert|17|kn}}.

The ships frequently served together throughout their careers. Their participation in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco&amp;ndash;Turkish War]] in 1897 was limited due to intervention by the [[Concert of Europe|Great Powers]]. Modernizations in the 1890s and 1900s upgraded the ships' armament, but by the [[First Balkan War]], they were too slow to keep up with newer vessels in the Greek fleet, particularly the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Greek cruiser|Georgios Averof||2}}. They saw action at the [[Naval Battle of Elli|Battle of Elli]] but were left behind due to their slow speed at the [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Battle of Lemnos]]. Thoroughly obsolete, the ships were reduced to secondary duties after the war and did not see active duty during [[World War I]]. The ships were intended to be sold in 1919, but were retained out of active service until 1929.

==Design==
[[File:Hydra Brasseis1902.png|thumb|left|Armour and armament sketch of ''Hydra'' class]]
The Balkan crisis that started with the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]], coupled with Ottoman naval expansion in the 1860s and 1870s, prompted the Greek Navy to begin a rearmament program. In addition, the Greek fleet had proved to be too weak to effectively challenge Ottoman naval power during the 1866 [[Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)|Cretan Revolt]]. In 1885, Greece ordered three new ironclads of the ''Hydra'' class.&lt;ref name=GG382&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were ordered from the Graville and St. Nazaire shipyards in France during the premiership of [[Charilaos Trikoupis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brassey, p. 25&quot;&gt;Brassey, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G387&gt;Gardiner, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships were {{convert|334|ft|8|in}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|51|ft|10|in|abbr=on}} and a mean [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|18|ft|abbr=on}}. They displaced {{convert|4808|MT|sp=us}} as built. By 1910, their displacement had increased slightly, to {{convert|4885|MT|abbr=on}}. Approximately 400 officers and men crewed each ship. The ships were powered by a pair of triple expansion steam engines with four double-ended cylindrical boilers; they were rated at {{convert|6700|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|17|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|500|MT|abbr=on}} The boilers were trunked into two funnels.&lt;ref name=G387/&gt;&lt;ref name=GG383&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'', p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; The hull was divided into 118 [[watertight compartment]]s.&lt;ref name=L348/&gt;

The ''Hydra'' class was armed with a main battery of three {{convert|10.8|in|adj=on|0}} [[Canet guns]].&lt;ref name=L348/&gt; Two guns were mounted forward in [[barbette]]s on either side of the forward [[superstructure]]; these were L/34 guns.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;L/34 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. An L/34 gun is 34 times long as it is in diameter.&lt;/ref&gt; The third gun, a L/28 gun, was placed in a [[gun turret|turret]] aft. The secondary battery consisted of four {{convert|5.9|in|adj=on|0}} L/36 guns in [[casemate]]s were mounted below the forward main battery, and a fifth 5.9-inch gun was placed on the [[centerline (ship marking)|centerline]] on the same deck as the main battery. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included four {{convert|3.4|in|adj=on|0}} L/22 guns, four 3-pounder guns, four 1-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder revolver cannons. The ships were also armed with three {{convert|14|in|abbr=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=G387/&gt; Two tubes were placed on the [[broadside]] and one was mounted in the bow.&lt;ref name=L348/&gt;

The ships were armored with a mix of [[Schneider Electric|Creusot]] and [[Compound armour|compound steel]]. The [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|12|in|abbr=on}} thick [[amidships]] and reduced to {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}} on either end of the hull. At a normal displacement, the main belt extended for {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} above the [[waterline]]. Under a full load, however, the belt was completely submerged below the waterline. Above the belt, a [[strake]] of 3&amp;nbsp;in of armor covered the side of the vessels amidships. The main battery was protected by {{convert|12|to|14|in|abbr=on}} of armor with 12-inch thick [[barbette]]s.&lt;ref name=G387/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hydra'' had an armored deck {{convert|1.9|in|abbr=on}} thick; the decks of ''Spetsai'' and ''Psara'' were increased to {{convert|2.3|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=L348/&gt;

==Construction and modernization==
[[File:Canet naval guns for the Greek ironclads.jpg|thumb|200px|The 10 cm and 6.5 cm [[Canet guns]] installed on the ''Hydra''-class vessels in their first modernization]]
''Hydra'' was built by the ''[[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]]'' dockyard in St. Nazaire, while ''Spetsai'' and ''Psara'' were built at the ''[[Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée]]'' shipyard in Graville.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chinese Times'', p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hydra'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 May 1889.&lt;ref name=L348&gt;Laughton, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spetsai'' was launched on 26 October 1889 and ''Psara'' followed on 20 February 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; All three ships were transferred to [[Piraeus]] and in service by 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brassey, p. 25&quot;/&gt; In 1897&amp;ndash;1900, the three ships were partially rearmed. Their small-caliber guns were replaced with one {{convert|3.9|in|abbr=on}} gun forward, eight 9-pounder guns, four 3-pounders, and ten 1-pounder revolver cannon. One of the 14-inch torpedo tubes was replaced with a {{convert|15|in|abbr=on}} weapon.&lt;ref name=G387/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908&amp;ndash;1910, the ships' armament was again revised. The old 5.9&amp;nbsp;in guns were replaced with new, longer L/45 models.&lt;ref name=GG383&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
Throughout their careers, the three ''Hydra''-class ships generally operated together. The ships saw limited action in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco&amp;ndash;Turkish War]] in 1897, as the Royal Hellenic Navy was unable to make use of its superiority over the Ottoman Navy. The [[Ottoman Navy]] had remained in port during the conflict, but a major naval intervention of the [[Concert of Europe|Great Powers]] prevented the Greeks from capitalizing on their superiority.&lt;ref name=GG382/&gt; The three ships saw action during the [[First Balkan War]] at the [[Naval Battle of Elli|Battle of Elli]], alongside the powerful [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Greek cruiser|Georgios Averof||2}}. At the subsequent [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Battle of Lemnos]], the ships were left behind due to their slow speed and did not engage the Ottoman flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;Fotakis, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, ''Hydra'' and ''Psara'' had been reduced to secondary duties: ''Hydra'' became a gunnery [[training ship]] while ''Psara'' was used to train engine-room personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Fotakis, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] and the ''Hydra''-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and accommodation space for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Paizis-Paradellis, pp. 78, 153, 166&lt;/ref&gt; All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.&lt;ref name=GG383/&gt;
