The '''''Majestic'' class''' of nine [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s were built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1890s under the Spencer Programme, named after the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[John Poyntz Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer|John Poyntz Spencer]]. With nine units commissioned, they were the largest [[ship class|class]] of battleships in history in terms of the number of member ships. The nine ships, {{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}}, {{HMS|Caesar|1896|2}}, {{HMS|Hannibal|1896|2}}, {{HMS|Illustrious|1896|2}}, {{HMS|Jupiter|1895|2}}, {{HMS|Magnificent|1894|2}}, {{HMS|Mars|1896|2}}, {{HMS|Prince George|1895|2}}, and {{HMS|Victorious|1895|2}}, were built between 1894 and 1898 as part of a programme to strengthen the Royal Navy versus its two traditional rivals, France and Russia. This continued the naval re-armament initiatives begun by the [[Naval Defence Act 1889]].

The ''Majestic''s introduced a number of significant improvements to British battleship design, including [[Gun turret#Layout|armoured gun shields]] for the [[barbette]]-mounted main battery guns. The ships were armed with a main battery of four [[BL 12 inch naval gun Mk VIII|BL 12-inch Mark VIII guns]], the first large-calibre weapon in the Royal Navy to use [[smokeless propellant]], which made it superior in almost all respects to earlier, larger guns. They were also the first British ships to incorporate [[Harvey armour]], which allowed them to carry a much more comprehensive level of protection. The ships proved to be among the most successful designs of their day, and they were widely copied in foreign navies, including the Japanese {{sclass-|Shikishima|battleship|4}} and the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, which were both modified versions of the ''Majestic'' design.

The nine ships served in a variety of roles throughout their careers. They primarily served in the [[Channel Fleet]], though several took rotations in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], and ''Victorious'' served on the [[China Station]] in 1900&amp;ndash;02. No longer frontline ships by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in July 1914, the vessels were used to protect the crossing of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] and various points on the British coast. In 1915, several of the ships were disarmed, their guns going to equip the {{sclass-|Lord Clive|monitor||warship}}s. The disarmed battleships were used as [[troop ship]]s during the [[Dardanelles Campaign]], and ''Prince George'' and ''Majestic'' were used to bombard enemy positions before ''Majestic'' was torpedoed by a German [[U-boat]]. The surviving ships were employed in secondary roles from 1915 onwards, and after the war, all were sold for scrapping in 1920&amp;ndash;22. Only one, ''Prince George'', avoided the [[ship breaking|breakers']] yards by wrecking off [[Camperduin]].

== Design ==
[[File:HMSRoyalSovereign1897.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1891|6}}, upon which the design for the ''Majestic'' class was based]]
In 1891, [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], then the [[Third Sea Lord|Controller]] of the Royal Navy, issued a request for a new [[battleship]] design based on the {{sclass-|Royal Sovereign|battleship|4}}, but that incorporated a recently designed {{convert|12|in|abbr=on|0}} gun and [[Harvey armour]], which was significantly stronger than [[compound armour]]. The [[Director of Naval Construction]], [[William Henry White]], prepared a preliminary design for a {{convert|12500|t|LT|adj=on}} ship armed with four of the 12&amp;nbsp;in guns and protected with an armour belt that was {{convert|9|in|0}} thick. White submitted the design on 27 January 1892 to the [[Admiralty#The Board of Admiralty|Board]]. Due to the greater resilience that Harvey armour provided, less of it could be used for the same level of protection, allowing for significant weight reduction. As a result, the protection scheme was made stronger and more comprehensive than in the ''Royal Sovereign''s, while minimising increased displacement. This included the fitting of fully enclosed armoured gun shields for the main battery guns.{{sfn|Burt|pp=111&amp;ndash;112}}

The Board approved the design and intended to lay down three ships under the 1892 programme, but work on the 12&amp;nbsp;in gun was taking longer than predicted, and so construction was delayed to the 1893 programme. By that time, the third ship of what was to be the ''Majestic'' class was redesigned as a second-class battleship, {{HMS|Renown|1895|2}}, leaving only two ships to be laid down under the 1893 estimates. By August 1893, however, the public perceived the strength of the [[Royal Navy]] to have fallen relative to its traditional rivals, the French and Russian navies. [[John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer|John Spencer]], the [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]], proposed a large naval expansion plan referred to as the Spencer Programme that included seven more ''Majestic''-class battleships to soothe public opinion.{{sfn|Burt|pp=111&amp;ndash;112}}

The ''Majestic''s were to be a benchmark for all successor [[pre-dreadnought]]s. While the preceding ''Royal Sovereign''-class battleships had revolutionised and stabilised British battleship design by introducing the high-[[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] battleship with four main-battery guns in twin mountings in [[barbette]]s fore and aft, it was the ''Majestic''s that settled on the 12&amp;nbsp;in main battery and began the practice of mounting armoured gunhouses over the barbettes; these gunhouses, although very different from the old-style, heavy, circular gun turrets that preceded them, would themselves become known as &quot;turrets&quot; and became the standard on warships worldwide.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}}{{sfn|Hodges|p=33}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=168}} The ''Majestic'' class, the largest class of battleships ever built, were some of the most successful battleships of their time, and they were widely copied.{{sfn|Burt|pp=111&amp;ndash;112}} Indeed, the Japanese {{sclass-|Shikishima|battleship|4}} and the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}} were based directly on the ''Majestic''s.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=221}}

===General characteristics and machinery===
[[File:Majestic class diagrams Brasseys 1902.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation, deck plan, and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902; the shaded areas represent the ship's armour protection.]]

The ''Majestic''s were {{convert|390|ft}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|421|ft}} [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|75|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|27|ft|abbr=on}}. They displaced up to {{convert|16060|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. The ships had a freeboard of {{convert|25|ft|abbr=on}} forward, {{convert|17|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} [[amidships]], and {{convert|18|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} aft. Their hulls were divided into numerous [[watertight compartment]]s, with 72 compartments inside the armoured [[Citadel#Naval term|citadel]] and 78 outside it. A [[double bottom]] extended for much of the length of the hull. They were fitted with two pole masts, each with two [[fighting top]]s. Except for [[HMS Caesar (1896)|''Caesar'']], [[HMS Hannibal (1896)|''Hannibal'']], and [[HMS Illustrious (1896)|''Illustrious'']], they had a new design in which the bridge was mounted around the base of the foremast behind the [[conning tower]] to prevent a battle-damaged bridge from collapsing around the tower.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}}{{sfn|Burt|pp=111, 114, 120}}

The ''Majestic''s were considered good seaboats, in large part due to their high freeboard, with an easy [[ship motions|roll]] and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. They were nevertheless very manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}} They had a transverse [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|3.7|ft|abbr=on}} at full load.{{sfn|Burt|p=118}} The ships had a crew of 672&amp;ndash;794&amp;nbsp;officers and enlisted men, and this number varied between ships and over the course of their careers. Each ship carried a variety of smaller boats, usually including three steam [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]], one {{convert|42|ft|adj=on}} steam [[Launch (boat)|launch]], two {{convert|34|ft|abbr=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], two {{convert|27|ft|abbr=on}} [[Whaleboat|whalers]], three [[Captain's gig|gigs]] of between {{convert|24|to|32|ft|abbr=on}}, one {{convert|16|ft|abbr=on}} skiff [[dinghy]], and one {{convert|13|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} [[raft]]. The ships were equipped with six {{convert|24|in|adj=on}} searchlights, with four on the bridge and one on each mast. All nine ships received Type I [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless transmitters]] in 1909&amp;ndash;10.{{sfn|Burt|p=114}}

During the [[sea trials]] for the preceding battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1891|2}}, the ship's engineers learned that the engines might fail at high levels of [[forced draught]]; as a result, the ''Majestic''s were designed to reach the same maximum speed with a more powerful engine. This allowed the engineers a wider margin of safety at maximum speed.{{sfn|Burt|p=120}} Their propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder [[triple expansion engine]]s, each driving a single four-bladed screw. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired, single-ended [[Scotch marine boiler]]s, which were trunked into a pair of [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] placed side by side. Their engines were rated at {{convert|10000|ihp|lk=in}} at normal draught, and they provided a top speed of {{convert|16|kn|lk=in}}. At forced draught, they could reach {{convert|12000|ihp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|17|kn}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}}{{sfn|Burt|p=114}} By 1908, the ships had been re-boilered with mixed coal- and oil-fired models.{{sfn|Gibbons|p=137}} The ships carried {{convert|1100|t}} of coal normally, and additional spaces allowed for up to {{convert|1900|t}} to be stored. With the installation of the new boilers, oil storage amounting to {{convert|400|to|500|t}} was added. At a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}, the ships could steam for {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}}. At {{convert|14.6|kn}}, their cruising radius fell to {{convert|4420|nmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Burt|p=120}}

===Armament===
[[File:HMS Majestic forecastle view IWM Q 39495.jpg|thumb|''Majestic''{{'}}s forward 12&amp;nbsp;in gun turret; note the 12-pounder mounted atop the turret]]
''Majestic'' and her sisters were armed with four [[BL 12 inch naval gun Mk VIII|BL 12-inch Mk VIII]] 35-[[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns in twin turrets, one forward and one aft. This calibre would become the standard for all future British battleship classes. They were the first new British battleships to mount a 12-inch main battery since the 1880s. The new gun was a significant improvement on the 13.5-inch (343&amp;nbsp;mm) gun which had been fitted on the [[Admiral-class battleship|Admiral]] and ''Royal Sovereign'' classes that preceded the ''Majestic''s, in terms of ballistics and strength of the gun itself, and it was significantly lighter.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}}{{sfn|Burt|p=114}}{{sfn|Gibbons|p=137}} The 12&amp;nbsp;in gun had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2500|ft/s}}&amp;mdash;a significant increase over the 13.5&amp;nbsp;in gun owing to the use of [[smokeless propellant]]&amp;mdash;and it could fire a {{convert|850|lb|adj=on}} shell with a range of {{convert|13900|yd}}.{{sfn|Friedman|pp=52&amp;ndash;55}}

The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; the first six ships had this arrangement, but the last two, ''Caesar'' and ''Illustrious'', had circular barbettes.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}} The BII mountings in the first six ships allowed all-around loading from the supply of ready ammunition kept in the turret, but the guns had to return to the centerline to bring ammunition up from the magazines, as the ammunition hoists did not rotate with the turret. ''Caesar'' and ''Illustrious'', with their circular barbettes, had BIII mountings with rotating hoists, and these allowed all-around loading from the magazines. Both the BII and BIII mounts had a range of elevation from &amp;minus;5&amp;nbsp;degrees to 13.5&amp;nbsp;degrees, with the loading angle at maximum elevation. During [[World War I]], four of the ''Majestic''s were disarmed, and these guns were used to arm eight {{sclass-|Lord Clive|monitor||warship}}s. A further two turrets from ''Illustrious'' were later emplaced as coastal guns on the [[River Tyne|Tyne]].{{sfn|Friedman|pp=52&amp;ndash;55}}

The saving in weight from the main battery allowed the ''Majestic'' class to carry a secondary battery of twelve QF ([[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]]) [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun|6-inch 40-calibre]] guns, a larger secondary armament than in previous classes. These were mounted in [[casemate]]s in two gun decks amidships,{{sfn|Gibbons|p=137}}{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}} and they fired a {{convert|100|lb|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2205|ft/s|abbr=on}}. Elevated at 15&amp;nbsp;degrees, they could hit targets out to {{convert|10000|yd}}.{{sfn|Friedman|pp=87&amp;ndash;89}} The ships also carried sixteen [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder Mk I]] guns and twelve [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk I]] guns. These were placed in a variety of mounts, including in casemates, on the main battery turret roofs, and in the fighting tops. The ships were also equipped with five 18&amp;nbsp;in (450&amp;nbsp;mm) [[torpedo tube]]s, four of which were submerged in the ship's hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher in the stern.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}} The [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] manufactured the torpedoes, which were the Mark IV model; these carried a {{convert|200|lb|adj=on}} [[warhead]] and had a range of {{convert|750|yd}} at a speed of {{convert|27.5|kn}}.{{sfn|Friedman|p=329}}

===Armour===
The [[belt armour|armoured belt]] on the ''Majestic'' class consisted of 9&amp;nbsp;inches (229&amp;nbsp;mm) of Harvey steel, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed the ships to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection.{{sfn|Gibbons|p=137}} The belt armour extended for {{convert|220|ft}} along the hull; it covered {{convert|5|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} above the [[waterline]] and {{convert|9|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} below. The belt was connected, via the barbettes, by a {{convert|14|in|abbr=on|0}} thick transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] forward and a 12&amp;nbsp;in thick bulkhead aft. The ship's armoured deck was {{convert|3|in|abbr=on|0}} thick on the central portion, with {{convert|4|in|abbr=on|0}} thick sloped sides that connected to the bottom edge of the belt armour. This arrangement required any shell that penetrated the belt to also pass through the deck before it could reach the ship's vitals. The deck was reduced to {{convert|2.5|in|abbr=on|0}} toward the bow and stern.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}}{{sfn|Burt|p=120}}

The barbettes for the main battery were protected with 14&amp;nbsp;in of armour on their exposed sides above the armoured deck, while the portion that was masked below the deck was reduced to {{convert|7|in|abbr=on|0}}. The [[gunhouse]]s for the main battery had {{convert|10|in|abbr=on|0}} thick faces, {{convert|5.5|in|abbr=on}} thick sides, {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}} rears, and 2&amp;nbsp;in thick roofs. The secondary guns' casemates were 6&amp;nbsp;in thick, with 2&amp;nbsp;in thick sides and rears to protect the gun crews from splinters. A [[mantlet]] that was 6&amp;nbsp;in thick covered the stern torpedo tube. The forward conning tower had 14&amp;nbsp;in of steel on the sides, except for the rear-facing side, which was reduced to 12&amp;nbsp;in. The aft conning tower had much thinner armour protection, with 3&amp;nbsp;in on all sides. {{sfn|Gardiner|p=34}}{{sfn|Burt|pp=114, 120}}

[[File:HMS Magnificent 1899 IWM Q 039473.jpg|thumb|''Magnificent'' in 1899]]
''Majestic'', ''Magnificent'', ''Jupiter'', ''Mars'', ''Prince George'', and ''Hannibal'' served in the [[Channel Fleet]] from their commissioning, with ''Magnificent'' as the [[flagship]] from 1895. They were present at the [[Diamond Jubilee]] for [[Queen Victoria]] in June 1897 and took part in the [[Coronation Review]] for King [[Edward VII]] in August 1902, along with ''Hannibal''. ''Caesar'' and ''Illustrious'' instead went to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], remaining there until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they returned to Britain to join their sisters in the Channel Fleet. ''Victorious'' served briefly in the Mediterranean Fleet in 1897 before being transferred to the [[China Station]] in 1898, remaining there until 1900. The ship then returned for another stint in the Mediterranean Fleet from 1900 to 1903, and in 1904 she joined her sisters in the Channel Fleet. In 1906, ''Majestic'' was [[:wikt:paid off|paid off]]; the following year she and ''Magnificent'' were recommissioned into the [[Nore Division]]. At the same time, ''Caesar'', ''Victorious'', and ''Mars'' went to the [[Devonport Division]], while ''Hannibal'', ''Prince George'', ''Jupiter'', and ''Illustrious'' went to the [[Portsmouth Division]].{{sfn|Burt|pp=130&amp;ndash;136}}

In March 1912, ''Caesar'' was reduced to reserve in the 4th Squadron, [[Home Fleet]]. Later that year, ''Majestic'', ''Prince George'', and ''Illustrious'' were assigned to the [[7th Battle Squadron]] (BS). Following Britain's entry into World War I in August 1914, ''Caesar'' and ''Jupiter'' were assigned to the 7th BS, which was in turn assigned to the Channel Fleet and tasked with protecting the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] as it crossed the [[English Channel]] to France. At the same time, ''Hannibal'', ''Mars'', ''Magnificent'', and ''Victorious'' were assigned to the [[9th Battle Squadron]] and stationed in the [[Humber]] to protect the British coast. ''Illustrious'' was instead used as a [[guard ship]] for the [[Grand Fleet]], and was initially based at [[Loch Ewe]].{{sfn|Burt|pp=130&amp;ndash;136}}

In early 1915, ''Majestic'' and ''Prince George'' took part in the [[Dardanelles Campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]; they bombarded Ottoman positions around the [[Dardanelles]] until May, when ''Majestic'' was torpedoed and sunk by the German [[U-boat]] {{SMU|U-21|Germany|2}} off [[Cape Helles]]. At around the same time, ''Prince George'' was hit by a shell from an Ottoman coastal battery, requiring repairs at Malta. ''Hannibal'', ''Magnificent'', ''Victorious'', and ''Mars'' were laid up in early 1915 and had their 12&amp;nbsp;in guns removed to arm the ''Lord Clive''-class monitors. ''Illustrious'' was similarly disarmed, with two of her guns going to the [[Tyne Turrets]]. ''Hannibal'', ''Magnificent'', and ''Mars'' were then used as [[troop ship]]s during the operations off the Dardanelles. In late 1915 after the conclusion of the Dardanelles Campaign, ''Hannibal'' was stationed in Egypt as a [[depot ship]], while ''Magnificent'' and ''Mars'' returned to Britain to be used as an [[ammunition ship]] and a depot ship, respectively.{{sfn|Burt|pp=130&amp;ndash;136}}

''Victorious'' was converted into a [[repair ship]] in 1915&amp;ndash;16 and based in [[Scapa Flow]], the main base of the Grand Fleet. ''Jupiter'' was transferred to the [[Suez Canal Patrol]] in mid-1915, before returning to Devonport in late 1916 to be paid off. By 1916, ''Illustrious'' had been converted into a storeship and based in Chatham; she was joined there by ''Prince George'', by then converted into a [[barracks ship]]. From December 1914 to September 1918, ''Caesar'' was employed as a guard ship, first at [[Gibraltar]] and then in the [[North America and West Indies Station]]. She served in the [[Adriatic Squadron]] in September 1918, and then in the [[Aegean Squadron]] in October. After the war, she supported the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] in the [[Black Sea]] as a depot ship; she was the last British pre-dreadnought to serve overseas in any capacity.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|p=7}}{{sfn|Burt|pp=130&amp;ndash;136}}

''Hannibal'' and ''Jupiter'' were sold in January 1920 and thereafter [[ship breaking|broken up]] in Italy and Britain, respectively. ''Illustrious'' followed her sisters to the breakers in June 1920, being scrapped at [[Barrow-in-Furness]]. ''Caesar'' was paid off in April 1920 and eventually sold for scrapping in Germany in July 1922. ''Magnificent'' and ''Mars'' were sold for scrap in May 1921 and broken up at [[Inverkeithing]] and [[Briton Ferry]], respectively. ''Prince George'' was sold for scrapping in Germany in September, but while en route she ran aground off [[Camperduin]]. ''Victorious'' was renamed ''Indus II'' in 1920 and eventually sold for scrap in December 1922.{{sfn|Burt|pp=130&amp;ndash;136}}
