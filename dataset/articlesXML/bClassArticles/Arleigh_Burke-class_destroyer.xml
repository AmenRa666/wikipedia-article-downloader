The '''''Arleigh Burke'' class''' of [[guided missile destroyer]]s (DDGs) is the [[United States Navy]]'s first [[List of destroyer classes of the United States Navy|class of destroyer]] built around the [[Aegis Combat System]] and the [[AN/SPY-1|SPY-1D]] multifunction [[passive electronically scanned array]] [[radar]]. The class is named for [[Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], the most famous American destroyer officer of [[World War II]], and later [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. The [[class leader]], {{USS|Arleigh Burke}}, was commissioned during Admiral Burke's lifetime.

These [[warship]]s were designed as multimission destroyers&lt;ref name=&quot;US Navy Ship - Destroyer&quot;/&gt; to fit the [[antiaircraft warfare]] (AAW) role with their powerful [[Aegis Combat System|Aegis radar]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s; [[antisubmarine warfare]] (ASW), with their [[towed sonar array]], [[RUM-139 VL-ASROC|antisubmarine rockets]], and ASW helicopter; [[Antisurface warfare]] (ASUW) with their [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon missile]] launcher; and strategic land strike role with their [[Tomahawk missile]]s. With upgrades to their to AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]], the ships of this class have also begun to demonstrate some promise as mobile [[antiballistic missile]] and [[antisatellite weapon|antisatellite]] weaponry platforms. Some versions of the class no longer have the towed sonar, or Harpoon missile launcher. Their hull and superstructure were designed to have a reduced radar cross section.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ddg-51.htm |title=DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class |website=fas.org |accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ship of the class was commissioned on 4 July 1991. With the decommissioning of the last {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|2}}, {{USS|Cushing|DD-985|6}}, on 21 September 2005, the ''Arleigh Burke''-class ships became the U.S. Navy's only active destroyers; the class has the longest production run for any [[post-World War II]] U.S. Navy [[surface combatant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9CUFPFO0.htm After 2-plus decades, Navy destroyer breaks record]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the 62 vessels of this class (comprising 21 of Flight I, 7 of Flight II and 34 of Flight IIA) in service by 2013, up to a further 42 (of Flight III) have been envisaged.

With an overall length of {{convert|505|to|509|ft|m}}, displacement ranging from 8,315 to 9,200 tons, and weaponry including over 90 missiles, the ''Arleigh Burke'' class are larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as [[guided missile cruiser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=188999 &quot;Northrop Grumman-Built William P. Lawrence Christened; Legacy of Former POW Honored&quot;]. Northrop Grumman, 17 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships of the ''Arleigh Burke'' class are among the largest destroyers built in the United States. Only the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|5}}, {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer|5}} ({{convert|563|ft|m}}) and {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|5}} classes ({{convert|600|ft|m}}) were longer. The larger {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|0}} ships were constructed on ''Spruance''-class hull forms, but are designated as [[cruiser]]s due to their radically different mission and weapons systems than the ''Spruance'' and ''Kidd''-class destroyers. The ''Arleigh Burke'' class on the other hand were designed with a new, large, water-plane area-hull form characterized by a wide flaring bow which significantly improves sea-keeping ability. The hull form is designed to permit high speed in high sea states.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot; /&gt;

The designers of ''Arleigh Burke'' incorporated lessons learned from the ''Ticonderoga''-class guided-missile cruisers, the latter which was deemed too expensive to continue building and too difficult to further upgrade. With the ''Arleigh Burke'' class, the U.S. Navy also returned to all-steel construction. An earlier generation had combined a steel hull with an innovative superstructure made of lighter [[aluminum]] to reduce top weight, but the lighter metal proved vulnerable to cracking. Aluminum is also less fire-resistant than steel;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/11/us/navy-reverting-to-steel-in-shipbuilding-after-cracks-in-aluminum.html |title=Navy Reverting To Steel In Shipbuilding After Cracks In Aluminum |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |agency=Associated Press |date=11 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1975 fire aboard {{USS|Belknap|CG-26|6}} gutted her aluminum superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hazegray.org/faq/smn6.htm#F7 |title=Section F.7: Aluminum in warship construction |website=hazegray.org |date=30 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battle damage to [[Royal Navy]] ships exacerbated by their aluminum superstructures during the 1982 [[Falklands War]] supported the decision to use steel. Another lesson from the Falklands War&lt;ref name=&quot;linchpin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/docs/ArleighB.htm|title=The Arleigh Burke: Linchpin of the Navy|website=fas.org|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the navy to protect the ship's vital spaces with double-spaced steel armor (creating a buffer for modern [[Exocet|rockets]]), and kevlar [[spall|spall liners]].

The ''Arleigh Burke'' design incorporates [[Stealth technology|stealth techniques]], such as the angled rather than traditional vertical surfaces and the tripod mainmast,&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways p592&quot;&gt;Gardiner and Chumbley 1995, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Combat Fleets 98 p1020&quot;&gt;Baker 1998, p. 1020&lt;/ref&gt; which make the ship more difficult to detect, in particular by antiship missiles. A Collective Protection System makes the ''Arleigh Burke'' class the first U.S. warships designed with an air-filtration system against nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1&quot;/&gt; Other NBC defenses include a &quot;countermeasure wash down system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvidshub.net/image/1024607/countermeasure-washdown-system-test|title=DVIDS - Images - Countermeasure washdown system test|work=DVIDS|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[Aegis Combat System]] differs from a traditional rotating radar that mechanically rotates 360 degrees for each sweep scan of the airspace. Instead, Aegis uses a [[passive electronically scanned array]], which allow continual tracking of targets simultaneous with area scans. The system's computer control also allows centralization of the previously separate tracking and targeting functions. The system is also resistant to [[electronic counter-measures]]. Their stand-alone [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon]] antiship missile launchers give them an antiship capability with a range in excess of {{convert|64|nmi|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot; /&gt; With the retirement of the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk antiship missile]] variant, only the ''Arleigh Burke''-class ships before Flight IIA versions are well-equipped for antisurface warfare with Harpoon launchers. Others are not, but are loaded with [[RIM-66 Standard|SM-2 missiles]] in their vertical launch cells capable of an antiship mode, though they have limited range and damage potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2013/06/06/u-s-navys-next-bid-for-ship-to-ship-combat |title=U.S. Navy’s Next Bid for Ship to Ship Combat |website=usni.org |last=Majumdar |first=Dave |date=6 June 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The [[5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 45 gun|5-inch/54 caliber Mark 45 gun]], in conjunction with the Mark 34 Gun Weapon System, is an antiship weapon which can also be used for close-in air contacts or to support forces ashore with Naval Gun-Fire Support (NGF), with a range of up to {{convert|20|mi|km}} and capable of firing 20 rounds per minute.&quot; The class's [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow]]/[[RIM-162 ESSM]] missiles provide point defense against missiles and aircraft while the Standard Missile SM-2 and SM-6 provide area antiaircraft defense; the SM-6 provides over-the-horizon missile defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.usni.org/2016/03/07/navy-sinks-former-frigate-uss-reuben-james-in-test-of-new-supersonic-anti-surface-missile |title=Navy Sinks Former Frigate USS Reuben James in Test of New Supersonic Anti-Surface Missile |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |website=usni.org |date=7 March 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bd815&gt;{{cite web |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2015/08/sm-6-can-now-kill-both-cruise-and-ballistic-missiles/ |title=SM-6 Can Now Kill Both Cruise and Ballistic Missiles |last=Freedburg |first=Sydney J. |website=breakingdefense.com |date=4 August 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Missile 3 and 6 also provide Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD).&lt;ref name=bd815/&gt;

The ship has an electronics warfare suite that provides passive detection and decoy countermeasures.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot; /&gt;  The class's [[Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System]] (LAMPS) helicopter system improves the ship's capabilities against submarines and surface ships, a helicopter able to serve as a platform to monitor submarines and surface ships, and launch torpedoes and missiles against them, as well as being able to support ground assaults with machine guns and Hellfire antiarmor guided missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/rotary/sh60seahawk.html#lamps|title=Federation Of American Scientists -|work=Federation Of American Scientists|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The helicopters also serve in a utility role, able to perform ship replenishment, search and rescue, medical evacuation, communications relay, and naval gunfire spotting and controlling.

The ''Arleigh Burke'' class is a set of multimission ships with numerous combat systems, including a &quot;combination of... an advanced antisubmarine warfare system (ASW), land attack cruise missiles, ship-to-ship missiles, and advanced antiaircraft missiles,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;linchpin&quot;/&gt; ''Burke''s have the Navy's latest antisubmarine combat system with active sonar, a towed sonar array, and antisubmarine rockets. They support strategic land strikes with their VLS launched Tomahawks.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot; /&gt;  They are able to detect antiship mines at a range of about 1400 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/logistics_material_readiness/acq_bud_fin/SARs/DEC%202011%20SAR/DDG%2051%20-%20SAR%20-%2031%20DEC%202011.pdf &quot;Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) DDG 51&quot;] {{Dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So vital has the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]] (BMD) role of the class become that all ships of the class are being updated with BMD capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opencrs.com/document/RL33745/ |title=Navy Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program: Background and Issues for Congress}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811152641/http://opencrs.com/document/RL33745/ |date=11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Burke'' production is being restarted in place of additional {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|2}}s.&lt;ref name=restart/&gt;

==Development==
In 1980, the U.S. Navy initiated design studies with seven contractors. By 1983 the number of competitors had been reduced to three: [[Bath Iron Works]], [[Todd Shipyards]] and [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Wayne |last=Biddle |title=The dust has settled on the Air Force's Great Engine |work=The New York Times  |date=28 February 1984 |accessdate=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 1985 Bath Iron Works received a US$321.9 million contract to build the first of class, {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTIMES2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Maine shipbuilder gets Navy contract for a new destroyer |work=The New York Times |date=3 April 1985 |accessdate=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gibbs &amp; Cox]] was awarded the contract to be the lead ship design agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;GibbsCox1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibbscox.com/historyofgibbscox.htm |title=History of Gibbs &amp; Cox |date=January 2011 |publisher=[[Gibbs &amp; Cox]] |accessdate=6 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109012157/http://www.gibbscox.com:80/historyofgibbscox.htm |archivedate=9 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of the first ship was put at US$1.1 billion, the other US$778 million being for the ship's weapons systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTIMES2&quot;/&gt; She was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at [[Bath, Maine]], on 6 December 1988, and launched on 16 September 1989 by Mrs. Arleigh Burke. The Admiral himself was present at her commissioning ceremony on 4 July 1991, held on the waterfront in downtown [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

[[File:Burke class destroyer profile;wpe47485.png|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Profile of Flight IIA ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer]]
The &quot;Flight IIA ''Arleigh Burke''&quot; ships have several new features, beginning with the {{USS|Oscar Austin|DDG-79}}. Among the changes are the addition of two hangars for [[antisubmarine warfare]] (ASW) [[helicopter]]s, and a new, longer Mark 45 Mod 4 5-inch/62-caliber naval gun (installed onto {{USS|Winston S.

Later Flight IIA ships starting with {{USS|Mustin|DDG-89}} have a modified funnel design that buries the funnels within the superstructure as a signature-reduction measure. TACTAS towed array sonar was omitted from Flight IIA ships and they also lack Harpoon missile launchers. Ships from DDG-68 to DDG-84 have [[AN/SLQ-32]] antennas that resemble V3 configuration similar to those deployed on {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser}}s, while the remainder have V2 variants externally resembling those deployed on some {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate}}s.

===Modernization===
The U.S. Navy began a modernization program for the ''Arleigh Burke'' class aimed at improving the gun systems on the ships in an effort to address [[United States Congress|congressional]] concerns over the retirement of the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s. This modernization was to include an extension of the range of the {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns on the flight I ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyers ({{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} to {{USS|Ross|DDG-71|6}}) with [[Extended Range Guided Munition|extended range guided munition]]s (ERGMs) that would have given the guns a range of {{convert|40|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf Taken from the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007, pages 67–68] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102142340/http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf |date=2 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf Taken from the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007, p. 193] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025175652/http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf |date=25 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-45.htm |title=MK 45 5-inch / 54-caliber (lightweight) gun; MK 45 5-inch / 62-caliber (MOD 4 ERGM) gun |website=fas.org |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the ERGM was cancelled in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/03/defense_ergm_032408/ Navy ends ERGM funding] Navy Times {{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modernization program is designed to provide a comprehensive mid-life upgrade to ensure that the class remains effective. Reduced manning, increased mission effectiveness, and a reduced total cost including construction, maintenance, and operation are the goals of the modernization program. Modernization technologies will be integrated during new construction of DDG-111 and 112, then retrofitted into DDG flight I and II ships during in-service overhaul periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4200&amp;tid=900&amp;ct=4|title=United States Navy Fact File: Destroyers - DDG|first=Dan |last=Petty|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase will update the hull, mechanical, and electrical systems while the second phase will introduce an [[open architecture computing environment]] (OACE).

The Navy is also upgrading the ships' ability to process data. Beginning with USS ''Spruance'', the Navy is installing an [[internet protocol]] (IP) based data backbone, which enhances the ship's ability to handle video. ''Spruance'' is the first destroyer to be fitted with the [[Boeing Company]]'s gigabit [[Ethernet]] data multiplex system (GEDMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1983 |title=Boeing: Boeing Deploys Gigabit Ethernet Data Multiplex System on USS Spruance |publisher=Boeing.mediaroom.com |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 [[BAE Systems]] announced that it had been awarded a contract to modernize 11 ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/BAE-to-Modernize-Up-to-11-Norfolk-based-Destroyers-06498/ |accessdate=3 August 2010 |title=BAE to Modernize Up to 11 Norfolk-based Destroyers |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100807230224/http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/BAE-to-Modernize-Up-to-11-Norfolk-based-Destroyers-06498/ |archivedate= 7 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014 Sam LaGrone reported that 21 of the 28 Flight I/II Arleigh Burke-class ships would not receive a mid-life upgrade that included electronics and Aegis Baseline 9 software for SM-6 compatibility, instead they would retain the basic BMD 3.6.1 software in a $170 million upgrade concentrating on mechanical systems and on some ships, their antisubmarine suite.&lt;ref name=USNI20140527&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/05/27/navy-quietly-downscales-destroyer-upgrades |first=Sam |last=LaGrone |title=Navy Quietly Downscales Destroyer Upgrades |date=27 May 2014 |website=usni.org |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven Flight I ships - DDG 51-53, 57, 61, 65, 69 - will get the full US$270m Baseline 9 upgrade.&lt;ref name=USNI20140527 /&gt; Deputy of surface warfare Dave McFarland said that this change was due to the budget cuts in the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/06/03/navy-altered-destroyer-upgrade-plan-due-budget-pressure-demand-ships |title=Navy Altered Destroyer Upgrades Due to Budget Pressure, Demand for Ships |last1=LaGrone |first1=Sam |date=3 June 2014 |website=usni.org |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Navy will begin the outfitting of 34 Flight IIA ''Arleigh Burke'' vessels with a hybrid-electric drive (HED) to lower fuel costs. While the four LM-2500 gas turbines of the ''Arleigh Burke''s are most efficient at high speeds, an electric motor is to be attached to the main reduction gear to turn the drive shaft to propel the ship at speeds under {{convert|13|kn|km/h}}, such as during ballistic missile defense or maritime security operations; use of the HED for half the time could extend time on station by 2.5 days before refueling. Two vessels are planned to be outfitted in 2016, with the rest upgraded at a rate of four per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2015/09/23/navy-set-to-install-hybrid-electric-drives-in-destroyer-fleet-staring-next-year |title=Navy Set to Install Hybrid Electric Drives in Destroyer Fleet Staring [sic] Next Year |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |website=usni.org |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute  |date=23 September 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also starting that year, four destroyers patrolling with the [[U.S. 6th Fleet]] based in [[Naval Station Rota, Spain]] ({{USS|Porter|DDG-78|6}}, {{USS|Carney|DDG-64|6}}, {{USS|Ross|DDG-71|6}}, {{USS|Donald Cook|DDG-75|6}}) will get a self-protection upgrade by replacing a Phalanx CIWS with the [[RIM-116 RAM#SeaRAM (weapon system)|SeaRAM]], a close-range ship defense system that combines the Phalanx sensor dome with an 11-cell RAM launcher, the first time the system has been paired with an Aegis ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2015/09/15/navy-integrating-searam-on-rota-based-ddgs-first-installation-complete-in-November |title=Navy Integrating SeaRAM on Rota-Based DDGs; First Installation Complete In November |last=Eckstein |first=Megan |website=usni.org |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute  |date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production restarted and further development ===
The class was scheduled to be replaced by {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|2}}s beginning in 2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Resource Implications of the Navy’s 2008 Shipbuilding Plan |url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=6985 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=23 March 2007 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an increasing threat from both long- and short-range missiles caused the Navy to restart production of the ''Arleigh Burke'' class and consider placing [[littoral combat ship|littoral combat]] mission modules on the new ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3657972 |title=Missile Threat Helped Drive DDG Cut |publisher=Defense News |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60G1U920100117|title=Navy's future linked to flexible weapons: chief|work=Reuters|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 the Navy announced a plan that limited the ''Zumwalt'' class to three units while ordering another three ''Arleigh Burke''-class ships from both [[Bath Iron Works]] and [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]].&lt;ref name=restart&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/business/09defense.html?_r=1&amp;em Contractors Agree on Deal to Build Stealth Destroyer].

Flight III ships, construction starting in FY2016 in place of the canceled [[CG(X)]] program, have various design improvements including radar antennas of mid-diameter increased to {{convert|14|ft|m}} from the previous {{convert|12|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opencrs.com/document/RL32109/2010-02-26/?24684 RL32109 Navy DDG-51 and DDG-1000 Destroyer Programs: Background and Issues for Congress]. CRS, 26 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These Air and Missile Defense Radars ([[AMDR]]) use [[Active electronically scanned array|digital beamforming]], instead of the earlier [[passive electronically scanned array]] radars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/pdfs/GAO-10-388SP?source=ra GAO-10-388SP, &quot;Defense Acquisitions: Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs&quot;]. GAO, 30 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, costs for the Flight III ships increased rapidly as expectations and requirements for the program have grown. In particular, this was due to the changing requirements needed to carry the proposed Air and Missile Defense Radar system required for the ships' ballistic missile defense role.&lt;ref&gt;Fabey, Michael. [http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/asd/2011/06/10/01.xml &quot;Potential DDG-51 Flight III Growth Alarms.&quot;] ''Aviation Week'', 10 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government Accountability Office]] found that the design of the Flight IIIs was based on &quot;a significantly reduced threat environment from other Navy analyses&quot; and that the new ships would be &quot;at best marginally effective&quot;. The U.S. Navy disagrees with the GAO findings, claiming the DDG-51 hull is &quot;absolutely&quot; capable of fitting a large enough radar to meet requirements. Installation of the AMDR would require double the power and double the cooling, but there is room to fit what is needed inside the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, Sydney J. Jr. [http://defense.aol.com/2012/10/05/navy-bets-on-arleigh-burkes-to-sail-until-2072-40-years-afloat/ &quot;Navy Bets On Arleigh Burkes To Sail Until 2072; 40 Years Afloat For Some.&quot;] 5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the production restart, the U.S. Navy is expected to fall short of its requirement for 94 missile-defense-capable destroyer and cruiser platforms starting in FY 2025 and continuing past the end of the 30-year planning window. While this is a new requirement as of 2011, and the U.S. Navy has never had so many large missile-armed surface combatants, the relative success of the Aegis ballistic missile defense system has shifted this national security requirement onto the U.S. Navy. The shortfall will arise as older platforms that have been refitted to be missile-defense-capable (particularly the cruisers) are retired in bulk before new destroyers are planned to be built.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rourke, Ronald.

In April 2014, the U.S. Navy began the early stages of developing a new destroyer to replace the ''Arleigh Burke''-class called the &quot;Future Surface Combatant&quot;. The new class is expected to enter service in the early 2030s and initially serve alongside the 22 Flight III DDGs.  No hull design or shape has been speculated yet, although the destroyer class will incorporate emerging technologies like lasers, on-board power-generation systems, increased automation, and next-generation weapons, sensors, and electronics. They will leverage technologies in use on other platforms such as the ''Zumwalt''-class destroyer, [[Littoral Combat Ship]], and {{sclass-|Gerald R. Ford|aircraft carrier}}s. The Future Surface Combatant may place importance on the ''Zumwalt''-class destroyer's electric drive system that propels the ship while generating 58 megawatts of on-board electrical power, levels required to operate future [[directed energy weapon]]s.  Laser weapon systems are likely to become more prominent to engage threats without using missiles that could potentially cost more than the target it is engaging. Less costly weapon systems may help keep the destroyer class from becoming too expensive. Initial requirements for the Future Surface Combatant will emphasize lethality and survivability, as well as being able to continue to protect aircraft carriers.  The ships also have to be modular to allow for inexpensive upgrades of weaponry, electronics, computing, and sensors over time as threats evolve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/04/09/navy-makes-plans-for-new-destroyer-for-2030s.html?ESRC=todayinmil.sm Navy Makes Plans for New Destroyer for 2030s] - Military.com, 9 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
{{see also|USS Cole bombing}}
''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}} was damaged on 12 October 2000 in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]] while docked, by an attack in which an apparently [[shaped charge]] of 200–300&amp;nbsp;kg in a boat was placed against the hull and detonated by [[suicide attack|suicide bombers]], killing 17 crew members.
