==Conference affiliation==
The Citadel competes in the Southern Conference for all sports.  Most matches are scored simultaneously using both smallbore and air rifle scoring systems.

===Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association===
From 1909 to 1935, The Citadel played as a part of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association, a congolomerate of many schools which gave birth to the Southern Conference during a clash over freshman eligibility. The Citadel remained in the SIAA after eight schools joined with six non-SIAA members to create the SoCon in 1921.

===Southern Conference===
Shortly after thirteen schools departed the Southern Conference to form the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), The Citadel and six other schools joined the conference. [[Furman University|Furman]] also joined in 1936, making them and The Citadel the schools with the longest current ''continuous'' tenure in the conference. ([[Virginia Military Institute|VMI]] joined even earlier in 1924, but was not a member from 2003 to 2014.)
