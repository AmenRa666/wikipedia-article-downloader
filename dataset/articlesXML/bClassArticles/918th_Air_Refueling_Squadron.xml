The '''918th Air Refueling Squadron''' is an inactive [[United States Air Force]] unit.  It was last assigned to the [[11th Bombardment Wing]] at [[Altus Air Force Base]], Oklahoma.

The 918th's predecessor, the '''18th Combat Mapping Squadron''', was active during [[World War II]].  Although most of the [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] remained in the United States during the war, part of its air echelon deployed to the Pacific where it performed photographic mapping missions until the unit was inactivated in 1944.

The squadron was allotted to the [[Air Force Reserve]] as the '''18th Reconnaissance Squadron''' and assigned to the [[66th Strategic Reconnaissance Group]] at [[Newark Army Air Base]], New Jersey in 1947.  It does not appear to have been fully equipped or manned before it was inactivated in 1949 as the reserves reorganized and eliminated units in the wake of President [[Harry S Truman|Truman's]] 1949 defense budget cuts.

The '''918th Air Refueling Squadron''' was organized at Altus in October 1960 along with the 921st Air Refueling Squadron as part of [[Strategic Air Command]]'s plan to disperse its bomber force.  However, planning changed a little over a month later and the squadron was inactivated and its personnel and equipment were returned to the [[96th Air Refueling Squadron]], which had provided its initial [[en cadre|cadre]].  The 18th and 918th squadrons were consolidated into a single unit in 1985.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:4th Reconnaissance Squadron F-5 Lightning 1945.jpg|thumb|F-5 Lightning]]
[[File:B-24 front quarter top.jpg|thumb|left|B-24 Liberator of a US based unit]]
The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated in July 1943 as the '''18th Photographic Mapping Squadron''' at [[Peterson Field|Colorado Springs Army Air Base]], one of the original squadrons of the [[4th Photographic Group]], and equipped with [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|Lockheed F-5 Lighting]] reconnaissance aircraft.  It trained in photographic reconnaissance under [[Second Air Force]].&lt;ref name=Maurer98&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons&quot;&quot;pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1942, the 4th group deployed to the South Pacific, where it flew combat missions with [[Thirteenth Air Force]].&lt;ref name=Maurer4PG&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only a portion of the squadron's air echelon deployed with the group.  This part of the squadron re-equipped with [[North American B-25 Mitchell]]s.&lt;ref name=Maurer98/&gt;

[[File:North American F-10 Mitchell.jpg|thumb|Reconnaissance version of the B-25 Mitchell]]
The bulk of the air echelon equipped with [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s and remained in the United States.&lt;ref name=Maurer98/&gt;  The deployed elements of the squadron flew missions over enemy-held territory in [[Guadalcanal]], New Guinea, the northern [[Solomon Islands]], and the [[Bismarck Archipelago]].  The unit became the '''18th Combat Mapping Squadron''' and produced maps of Allied and enemy held territory and prepared navigational charts for American units.&lt;ref name=Maurer4PG/&gt;  After October 1943, the unit was attached to the [[8th Photographic Reconnaissance Group]] in the [[China Burma India Theater]] and operated under that group's control until January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Simultaneously with the attachment of the deployed air echelon to the 8th group, the element remaining behind in the United States moved to [[Will Rogers Field]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Maurer98/&gt;

The United States echelon was inactivated on 15 January 1944 and the overseas echelon on 20 February 1944.&lt;ref name=Maurer98/&gt;

===Air Force Reserves===
The squadron was redesignated the '''18th Reconnaissance Squadron'''&lt;ref group=a&gt;This unit is not related to the [[18th Reconnaissance Squadron]], which is an active Air Force unit.&lt;/ref&gt; and again activated in 1947 as a reserve unit under [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC) at [[Newark Army Air Base]], New Jersey.  Its training was supervised by the 114th AAF Base Unit (later the 2231st Air Force Reserve Training Center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/011.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History Newark Municipal Airport Jul-Sep 1946|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/019.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History Newark Airport Jul-Nov 1948|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It does not appear that the unit was fully manned or equipped.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 99 (no aircraft listed as assigned to the squadron from 1947 to 1949)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 [[Continental Air Command]] assumed responsibility for managing reserve units from ADC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/896/983.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Mission Project Closeup, Continental Air Command|date=27 December 1961|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 18th was inactivated when Continental Air Command reorganized its reserve units under the [[Hobson Plan|wing base organization]] system in June 1949.&lt;ref name=Maurer98/&gt;  President [[Harry S Truman|Trumanâ€™s]] reduced 1949 defense budget also required elimination of a number of units in the Air Force, and the 18th was not replaced  as reserve flying operations at Newark ceased.&lt;ref&gt;Knaack, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic Air Command===
The '''918th Air Refueling Squadron''' was one of two [[air refueling]] squadrons activated in 1960 at [[Altus Air Force Base]], Oklahoma&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;Mueller, pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; for movement to other bases to provide [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] support to dispersed [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers.  [[en cadre|Cadre]] and aircraft for the squadron was drawn from the [[96th Air Refueling Squadron]], which was inactivated&lt;ref name=96AREFSfacts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=11953 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 96 Air Refueling Squadron (AMC)|date=3 April 2014|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision to organize squadrons at Altus for movement elsewhere was reversed shortly after the 918th was organized, and the squadron was inactivated and its personnel and aircraft were returned to the 96th, which was reactivated.&lt;ref name=96AREFSfacts/&gt;&lt;ref name=816AD&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/466/878.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 816 Air Division|date=1 December 1960|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1985, the '''18th Reconnaissance Squadron''' and the '''918th Air Refueling Squadron''' were consolidated into a single unit under the name '''918th Air Refueling Squadron'''.&lt;ref name=DAFMPM662q&gt;Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 662q, 19 Sep 85, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Tactical Squadrons&lt;/ref&gt;
