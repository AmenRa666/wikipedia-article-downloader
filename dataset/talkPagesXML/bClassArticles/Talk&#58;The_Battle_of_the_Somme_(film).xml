Has the copyright expired for this film yet?

does anyone know if this film is, or will be, released?

:I think the footage is included in the ''The Battles of the Somme and Ancre'' video that you can buy from the [http://www.iwmshop.org.uk/index.html IWM shop] though I don't own it nor have I seen it so I can't be sure. [[User:Gsl|Geoff/Gsl]] 22:54, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

Did a copy edit and changed the references to Reeves to 1986 as I couldn't find anything matching the dates given by a previous editor, please revert if my guess is wrong.[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 19:01, 5 October 2013 (UTC)

:Thanks for leading me to [[Template:Circa]] this, I didn't know it existed. ;O)[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 14:00, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

::No probs! I'd seen it before, but couldn't remember the wiki-code for it, but thankfully the [[circa]] article had it!  Saw the BBC article via [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26030435 this other BBC article] and thought it would be useful. And looking at this from the [[WP:FILM|Film Project's]] point-of-view, I just made some tiny changes due to style, etc. '''[[User:Lugnuts|&lt;font color=&quot;002bb8&quot;&gt;Lugnuts&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Lugnuts|Dick Laurent is dead]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:05, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

:I had a tinker with this [[The Great War (documentary)]] earlier and some of the sfn film-date formats you've revealed might help.[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 14:13, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

Swapped poster advert with infobox photo, tidied pic captions and a few infelicitous phrases. [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 15:18, 9 March 2015 (UTC)

== Battle of the Somme Screenings 2012 &amp; 1026 ==

I  have to stop and think very carefully before I express disagreement with [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]], who seems to be a prominent, experienced and valuable editor of this page. But I can't understand why he took the trouble to move my contribution about the 2012 screenings and the planned 2016 screenings to the Notes section. These screenings are relevant facts, and not in the category of interesting events or quotations such as appear in other of the notes above it, and it as if they have been unjustifiably relegated. I beg him to realise and reconsider, as I would not like to revert without his wise consideration. [[User:P0mbal|P0mbal]] ([[User talk:P0mbal|talk]]) 18:19, 7 January 2016 (UTC)

==Suggested improvement - add reception in North America==

Conspicuously absent in discussion of its international reception is any reference to its subesequent release and how it was received in Canada (which had troops involved later in the same campaign), Newfoundland (then separate Dominion, which had a contingent taking part on Day One) and the United States, apart from the fact it had a slightly different title when released in the US of &quot;Kitchener's Great Army in the Battle of the Somme&quot;. It is interesting that although Kitchener himself had died on June 5, 1916, his name was being firmly associated with the troops he raised and who came to be deployed in the battle, in the parlance of a then neutral nation. If anything citeable can be found, you are welcome to add it.[[User:Cloptonson|Cloptonson]] ([[User talk:Cloptonson|talk]]) 05:28, 1 July 2016 (UTC)
:There's lots like this to be added but sadly, I'm limited by my sources; I keep a look-out though. The recent edits have been an improvement but if you have a page like [[User:Keith-264/common.js]] you can add &lt;nowiki&gt;importScript('User:Ucucha/duplinks.js');&lt;/nowiki&gt; which added a dupe wikilinks detector to the toolbox, which appears on the left side of the article page. Press it and a red letterbox appears round wikilinks that appear more than once. Regards[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 06:23, 1 July 2016 (UTC)</text>
