The '''11th Gurkha Rifles''' was a [[Gurkha]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]].  It was formed in [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]] and [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]] in May 1918, saw active service in the [[Indian Army during World War I|First World War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]], and was disbanded in April 1922.

==History==
===Background===
Heavy losses suffered by the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] following the German [[Spring Offensive]] in March 1918 resulted in a major reorganization of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]]:
* two divisions{{snd}}[[52nd (Lowland) Division|52nd (Lowland)]]&lt;ref name=Becke115&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1936|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[74th (Yeomanry) Division|74th (Yeomanry)]]&lt;ref name=Becke121_2b&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1937|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} were transferred to France in April; they were replaced by the [[3rd (Lahore) Division|3rd (Lahore)]]&lt;ref name=Perry54&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[7th (Meerut) Division]]s&lt;ref name=Perry90&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]];
* nine [[yeomanry]] [[regiment]]s were dismounted, converted to machine gunners and sent to France at the end of the same month; the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th]]&lt;ref name=Perry2124&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|pp=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Divisions]]&lt;ref name=Perry2528&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|pp=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; were reformed with Indian cavalry regiments withdrawn from France and the [[15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade]] already in Egypt;
* the [[10th (Irish) Division|10th (Irish)]],&lt;ref name=Becke1516&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1938|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[53rd (Welsh) Division|53rd (Welsh)]],&lt;ref name=Becke120121&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1936|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[60th (2/2nd London) Division|60th (2/2nd London)]],&lt;ref name=Becke2930&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1937|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[75th Division (United Kingdom)|75th Divisions]]&lt;ref name=Becke126128&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1937|pp=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; were reduced to a single British [[battalion]] per [[brigade]].  They were reformed with nine Indian infantry battalions and an Indian [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]] battalion each.{{efn|The remaining infantry division in the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] in March 1918{{snd}}the [[54th (East Anglian) Division]]{{snd}}remained unaffected by these changes.&lt;ref name=Becke128129&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1936|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In fact, the 75th Division already had four Indian battalions assigned,{{efn|In March 1917, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force started forming the [[75th Division (United Kingdom)|75th Division]], originally to be made up of [[Territorial Force]] battalions arriving from India.  In May 1917, to speed up the formation of the division, it was decided to incorporate Indian battalions.&lt;ref name=Becke129&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1937|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end, the independent [[29th Indian Brigade]] was broken up in June 1917 and its battalions posted to 75th Division.&lt;ref name=Perry167&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} so of the 36 battalions needed to reform the divisions, 22 were improvised&lt;ref name=Perry174&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; by taking whole [[Company (military unit)|companies]] from existing units already on active service in Mesopotamia and Palestine to form the [[150th Infantry]] (3 battalions), [[151st Sikh Infantry]] (3), [[152nd Punjabis]] (3), [[153rd Punjabis]] (3), [[154th Infantry]] (3), [[155th Pioneers]] (2), [[156th Infantry]] (1) and the '''11th Gurkha Rifles''' (4).&lt;ref name=Perry177178&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The donor units were then brought back up to strength by drafts.  In the event, just 13 of the battalions were assigned to the divisions&lt;ref name=Hanafin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orbat.com/site/history/open4/uk_eygptianexpeditionaryforce1918.pdf |title=Order of Battle of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, September 1918 |last=Hanafin |first=James |publisher=orbat.com |format=PDF |accessdate=11 November 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109153754/http://orbat.com/site/history/open4/uk_eygptianexpeditionaryforce1918.pdf | archivedate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remaining nine were transferred from Mesopotamia to India in June 1918.&lt;ref name=PerryVar&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|pp=44,64,81,103,155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
The regiment formed four battalions.  The first three were formed in Mesopotamia in May 1918 with companies posted from Gurkha battalions (and the [[39th Garhwal Rifles]]) serving in the [[14th Indian Division|14th]], [[15th Indian Division|15th]], [[17th Indian Division|17th]], and [[18th Indian Division]]s.&lt;ref name=PerryVar2&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|pp=128,134,144,148}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were transferred to [[Mumbai|Bombay (Mumbai)]] in June 1918.&lt;ref name=Perry80&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three later took part in the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919 as part of the [[1st (Peshawar) Division]].&lt;ref name=Perry38&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were disbanded in India in 1921 and 1922 with personnel transferred to various regular Gurkha battalions.&lt;ref name=Gaylor246/&gt;

In contrast, the fourth battalion was formed in Palestine with three companies and two half-companies posted from Gurkha battalions serving in the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut), and British 75th Divisions.  It remained in Palestine until the end of the war, before returning to India.&lt;ref name=Becke121_2a&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1936|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was disbanded in 1920 with personnel transferred to the other three battalions of the regiment.&lt;ref name=Gaylor246/&gt;

The badge of the 11th Gurkha Rifles was crossed [[kukri]]s, points upwards, cutting edge inwards, with &quot;XI&quot; above the intersection.&lt;ref name=Gaylor246/&gt;  The [[11 Gorkha Rifles]], formed by the [[Indian Army]] in 1948 after the [[Partition of India]], uses the same badge.
