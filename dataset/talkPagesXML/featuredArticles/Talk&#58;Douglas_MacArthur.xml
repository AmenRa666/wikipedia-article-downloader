== Photo ==
There has been much discussion in this talk page but none about the photo.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MacArthur_Manila.jpg
Maybe it is genuine but to me it looks like some bizarre photoshopping. Is there any way to 'citation needed' or suchlike for a photo?

I take that back.  It seems that he really was known for using a eccentric pipe.  Probably worth mentioning this in the article.

== Article size ==

I've had this on my watchlist for some years having participated in its Featured Article Candidature and I notice it's increased markedly in size this year, from 78kb readable prose in January to 99kb now, with no sign it's going to slow down.  I don't claim to be an expert on Mac and I don't want to stifle content creation but I am interesting in discussing whether the additions are all vital and whether in fact some should be dropped or broken out into sub-articles so the main article doesn't get bigger than the subject's ego. What's everyone think? Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 04:39, 16 June 2016 (UTC)
:When the article went to FAC, it was trimmed to reduce it in size, as it was felt that the article was too large. But it has steadily grown larger since. I think some of the new material on the occupation of Japan should be in that article instead. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 06:41, 16 June 2016 (UTC)
:Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing the article trimmed back to where it was in January or earlier. It's just so easy to divide up the information into dozens of sub-articles about each phase in his life/historical period. This is an overview article and there's no need for excess detail.[[User:StoryKai|StoryKai]] ([[User talk:StoryKai|talk]]) 22:14, 15 August 2016 (UTC)

== Style is not Encyclopedic ==

Style is artificially colloquial and overly affectionate, as if to be entertaining, like a eulogy,. It greatly interferes with gleaning information from this article. An overall rewrite for style would make it a far better fit for Wikipedia. Why is it locked?--[[Special:Contributions/75.164.155.194|75.164.155.194]] ([[User talk:75.164.155.194|talk]]) 22:09, 22 August 2016 (UTC)

==Infobox==
{{RFC|bio|rfcid=12850B1}}
Should the infobox have the succession of his positions or not? --[[User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )]] ([[User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|talk]]) 04:21, 4 November 2016 (UTC)

*{{tick}} The &quot;officeholder infobox&quot; provides continuity with other people in the series, it displays the positions he held, none of the military information is left out. The old box &quot;buries the lede&quot; that he was Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. --[[User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )]] ([[User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|talk]]) 00:34, 4 November 2016 (UTC)
*{{tick}} It is important to list the offices held by the person. It is listed all the time on politician's userboxes, as well as others. Since Douglas MacArthur was a brigadier general in WWI, Supreme Allied Commander in the Pacific during WWII, and Commander of the UNC during The Korean War, he should have the boxes for the reason that he held high positions, both in military and in politics. [[User:UNSC Luke 1021|UNSC Luke 1021]] ([[User talk:UNSC Luke 1021|talk]]) 11:49, 4 November 2016 (UTC)

*{{tick}} Include offices - I think the template suitable for [[Chesty Puller]], but not for him any more than it is for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  It's partly the rank [[General of the Army (United States)]] seems above the scope of the template, partly that his additional positions between the wars or in Phillipines and Japan post-war or presidential candidacy and corporate career.  But mostly I think template is intended as a convenience and help, but should never be  a mandatory or limiting thing; and he, if anyone, is an example if one is able to vary when wanted or needed.

===Use the box without the succession of his positions===
* This article is a featured article which has been subjected to rigorous review. Now there is an attempt to substitute a new infobox for the [[template:infobox military person]]. This infobox has been developed for military biographies. It is consistently used for military biographies. ''Douglas MacArthur is a military person''.  The use of a different infobox for a chief of staff  makes the article inconsistent with other military biographies. The argument that it makes him inconsistent with of chiefs of staff is spurious; the same editor just added it to the other articles; it should be removed from them as well. 

:The change allows the chief of staff navigation into the infobox; but this loses some of our purely military fields, such as the service number (used for looking up personnel records in the archives), thus diminishing the value of the infobox. Loss of our infobox loses us control over the information in military articles.

: Moreover, the added information is redundant, because it is already provided in the navigation boxes at the bottom. These have always been preferred for military subjects as they usually hold a variety of military posts over the course of their career. This is the case with Douglas MacArthur. Duplicating the navigation information in the infobox adds no value to the article.

:Note that the ArbCom [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Infoboxes|infoboxes case]] gives the content creators priority over people wishing to add infoboxes. &quot;The use of an infobox in an article is a content decision, not a maintenance decision. They should be added as part of content creation; ''they should not be added systematically to articles''.&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2013-10-02/Arbitration_report] [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 00:46, 4 November 2016 (UTC)

* From an outside point of view, by placing the positions that he held at the top of the infobox, you make them more important than the details about the man himself. For an article about Douglas MacArthur, that sounds counter-intuitive. For example I know that Matthew Ridgway succeeded MacArthur as Supreme Commander before I even know if MacArthur is still alive. In my opinion it should be left as is. [[User:Llammakey|Llammakey]] ([[User talk:Llammakey|talk]]) 11:05, 4 November 2016 (UTC)
*He was a soldier first and foremost, so the infobox should be the military person style. From a practical point of view, Llammakey makes the case against the office holder infobox very well. The succession boxes at the end of the article provide the necessary info on his important positions. Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 12:11, 4 November 2016 (UTC)

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{infobox military person}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; works fine for me and there doesn't seem to be a compelling argument to change, indeed there are a number of drawbacks for the proposed alternative (as indicated above). At any rate surely we all have more constructive things we could be working on rather than fixing something that is not broken?

*I don't see the value of the new, more cluttered infobox. There's probably an infinite amount of data points that you could add to an infobox like that: Umpteenth Valedictorian of West Texas Military Academy... Umptyfrats Adjutant of 3rd Engineer BN... etc. Including his position as the Superintendent of West Point so high up in the infobox probably gives undue weight to a role that (for MacArthur, anyway) was a relatively minor aspect of his career.
