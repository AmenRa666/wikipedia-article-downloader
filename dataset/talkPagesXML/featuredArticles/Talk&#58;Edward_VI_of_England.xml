== Edward VI was Murdered ==
Whoever is writing this piece should read Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I. 

The essence of the book is that Elizabeth had children, one of which was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, better known to the world as William Shakespeare.  A similar book, Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom, by Charles Beauclerk, follows a similar line of logic.  Evidence is abundant that she had the child of Thomas Seymour, in July 1548.

In regards to Edward, it is most likely that Edward VI was poisoned by Robert Dudley who was the master of the bed chamber. John Dudley, the father, had every reason to poison him, and probably did so. Robert had a reputation for poisoning and the symptoms shown by Edward VI were the same as a later wife of Robert Dudley, who escaped death at his hands.

:Robert Dudley's main fault was being John Dudley's younger brother, for when the Duke of Northumberland went to the block, Robert barely escaped the same fate.  The rumors of poison were just that - rumors to sully and discredit Robert Dudley's reputation, mainly given life by the Spanish ambassador and Robert's rivals at court.  Wiki's own article discusses the poison rumor and the above, and mentions the fact that few reputable historians put any credence to the poison rumor.

== Why was he named Edward? ==
Henry VIII's three short-lived sons, two by Katherine of Aragon and one by Anne Boleyn, were all named as Henry Duke of Cornwall. Does anyone know why Edward was given a different name ? (Obviously he could have been named after Henry's grandfather Edward IV, but as the earlier namings suggest that Henry wanted to maintain his own regnal name for his successor, there must have been a reason for the change). [[User:RGCorris|RGCorris]] ([[User talk:RGCorris|talk]]) 22:32, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
:Perhaps it has to do with the fact that  the name Henry proved rather unlucky, and Henry VIII was superstitious enough to cause an international havoc with his first wife and behead the second for witchcraft. Also, you should bear in mind that at the time of Edward VI's birth, Henry VIII still had one living son named after him - [[Henry FitzRoy]]. FitzRoy died two weeks after Edward's birth. [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 22:47, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
::Not so - Henry Fitzroy died on 23rd July 1536, whereas Edward was born on 12th October 1537. It may be that after losing four sons named Henry the king thought a change of name might bring better luck but is there any documentary proof to confirm that ? It is also possible that he was named after his mother's eldest living brother, but that seems unlikely. [[User:RGCorris|RGCorris]] ([[User talk:RGCorris|talk]]) 12:14, 9 December 2013 (UTC)
:::How on Earth did I manage to put FitzRoy's death in September 1537? Anyway, I've tried googling, but did not find anything. [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 18:31, 9 December 2013 (UTC)
::::Guardian. His twin brother may have been named Henry? [[User:Gnostics|Gnostics]] ([[User talk:Gnostics|talk]]) 01:09, 18 September 2014 (UTC)
== He was never prince of wales ==
At the time of Henry VIII's death, there was talk of creating Edward prince of wales, but as far as I know, he wasn't. [[User:Ericl|Ericl]] ([[User talk:Ericl|talk]]) 18:04, 12 April 2015 (UTC)

== Deposition of Jane by Mary, figure altered ==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_VI_of_England&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=747312336&amp;oldid=747128101 This edit] (by [[User:HarryMiskelly|a user who has no other edits other than to place some bogus awards on his user page]]) changes the figure from 13 days to 9 days.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_VI_of_England&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=747312336 Subsequent edit] by a ''different'' editor [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] builds upon this, and he reverts my reversion saying &quot;''My removal of an unnecessary &quot;however&quot; was deliberate, and '''it's 9 days according to the main body of the article''' -- if you think I've misinterpeted something let's discuss...''&quot;.

If this is correct, then fair enough, but can you please clarify- thanks. [[User:Ubcule|Ubcule]] ([[User talk:Ubcule|talk]]) 20:39, 2 November 2016 (UTC)
:Tks for starting the discussion. My first thought when figures are changed without explanation in Featured Articles is to revert, but because the new figure didn't seem outrageous I checked the main body... Under the subsection ''Queen Mary and Queen Jane'' there is the following cited text: &quot;on 19 July the Council publicly proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end&quot; -- so &quot;nine days&quot; in the lead seemed valid. That's all I'm basing it on, there are others more expert than I in this area, e.g. {{u|Hchc2009}} and {{u|Ealdgyth}}, who might be able to confirm. Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 20:48, 2 November 2016 (UTC)
:Jane is traditionally called the &quot;Nine-Day Queen&quot;, and her reign is given as 10-19 July. Edward died on the 6th, so the extra four days comes from the 6-10. &quot;Within 13 days&quot; also does not contradict &quot;9 days&quot; because 9 days is within 13. [[User:Celia Homeford|Celia Homeford]] ([[User talk:Celia Homeford|talk]]) 08:13, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
::{{ping|Celia Homeford}}; Fair enough, if the nine day figure is correct, I'm happy to accept that. I was sceptical in the first place because unexplained changes of figures by anonymous users or those with negligible history (the person who made the original change) are frequently- though not always- misinformation vandalism. [[User:Ubcule|Ubcule]] ([[User talk:Ubcule|talk]]) 10:45, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
:::I'm not an expert in this period, but the 9 day statement is one I've seen elsewhere in the literature, and the &quot;nine-day Queen&quot; statement is a common label for her, as Celia says. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 18:42, 4 November 2016 (UTC)
{{od}} Tks all -- I think now that there was some ambiguity (which Celia has highlighted) because although Jane was deposed after nine days on the throne, it was 13 days after Edward's death. I've been bold and tried to remove that ambiguity, sticking to the nine-day reign bit -- it may be improved but I hope this makes things clearer for the reader. Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 21:18, 4 November 2016 (UTC)
:Yes, I think that's much clearer! [[User:Celia Homeford|Celia Homeford]] ([[User talk:Celia Homeford|talk]]) 08:15, 7 November 2016 (UTC)</text>
