'''Mehmed Talaat Pasha''' ({{lang-ota|محمد طلعت پاشا}}; {{lang-tr|Mehmet Talât Paşa}}; 1874 – 15 March 1921), commonly known as '''Talaat Pasha''', was one of the triumvirate known as the [[Three Pashas]] that ''de facto'' ruled the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sylvia&quot;&gt;Sylvia Kedourie, S Tanvir Wasti (1996) Turkey: Identity, Democracy, Politics. ISBN 0-7146-4718-7 p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; 
His career in Ottoman politics began by becoming Deputy for [[Edirne]] in 1908, then Minister of the Interior and [[List of Ottoman Ministers of Finance|Minister of Finance]], and finally [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]] (equivalent to Prime Minister) in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sylvia&quot;/&gt; Acting as the Minister of Interior, Talaat Pasha [[s:Circular on April 24, 1915|ordered]] on 24 April 1915 the [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|arrest and deportation]] of Armenian intellectuals in Constantinople, most of them being ultimately murdered, and on 30 May 1915 requested the [[Tehcir Law]] (Temporary Deportation Law); these events initiated the [[Armenian Genocide]]. He is widely considered the main perpetrator of the Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Taner Akçam|last=Akçam|first=Taner|title=A Shameful Act|publisher=Holt &amp; Co.|location=New York|year=2006|pp=165, 186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ben Kiernan|last=Kiernan|first=Ben|title=Blood and Soil: Genocide and Extermination in World History from Carthage to Darfur|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenbaum|first=Alan S.|title=Is the Holocaust Unique?|publisher=Westview Press|year=2001|pp=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Norman Naimark|first=Norman|last=Naimark|title=Fires of hatred|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2001|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the leaders of [[Young Turks|the Young Turks]] movement and the first Turkish Grand Master of the Freemasonry, according to the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mason.org.tr/web/03_turkiye.html#4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mason.org.tr/web/en_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 2–3 November 1918 and with the aid of [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]], Talaat Pasha and [[Ismail Enver Pasha]] (the two main perpetrators of the Genocide) fled the Ottoman Empire. Talaat was assassinated in [[Berlin]] in 1921 by [[Soghomon Tehlirian]] ([[Operation Nemesis]]), one of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sylvia&quot;/&gt;

== Early life ==
Mehmed Talaat was born in 1874 in [[Kardzhali|Kırcaali]] town of [[Edirne Vilayet]] into a family of [[Pomak]] and Turkish descent.&lt;ref&gt;Taner Timur, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=64NpAAAAMAAJ |page=53 }} Türkler ve Ermeniler: 1915 ve Sonrası]'', İmge Kitabevi, 2001, ISBN 978-975-533-318-2, p. 53. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a junior civil servant working for the government of the Ottoman Empire and was from a village in the mountainous southeastern corner of present-day [[Bulgaria]]. Mehmed Talaat had a powerful build and a dark complexion.&lt;ref name=&quot;mango67&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mango|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Mango|title=Atatürk|publisher=John Murray |location=London|year=2004 |page=67 |isbn= 978-0-7195-6592-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His manners were gruff, which caused him to leave the civil preparatory school without a certificate after a conflict with his teacher. Without earning a degree, he joined the staff of the telegraph company as a postal clerk in [[Edirne]]. His salary was not high, so he worked after hours as a [[Turkish language]] teacher in the Alliance Israelite School which served the Jewish community of Edirne.&lt;ref name=&quot;mango67&quot; /&gt;

At the age of 21 he had a love affair with the daughter of the Jewish headmaster for whom he worked. He was caught sending a telegram saying &quot;Things are going well. I'll soon reach my goal.&quot; With two of his friends from the post office, he was charged with tampering with the official telegraph and arrested in 1893. He claimed that the message in question was to his girlfriend. The Jewish girl came forward to defend him. Sentenced to two years in jail, he was pardoned but exiled to Salonica as a postal clerk.&lt;ref name=&quot;mango67&quot; /&gt;

He married Hayriye Hanım (later known as Hayriye Talaat Bafralı), a young girl from [[Ioannina]] on 19 March 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=cYlpAAAAMAAJ |title=Başverenler, başkaldıranlar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1898 and 1908 he served as a postman on the staff of the [[Thessaloniki]] Post Office. Eventually, having served 10 years at this postal unit, he became head of the Thessaloniki Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telekomculardernegi.org.tr/haber-2730-iz-birakan-ptt%E2%80%99ciler--1--talat-pasa-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Young Turk Revolution ==
{{Main article|Young Turk Revolution}}
In 1908, he was dismissed from membership in the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), the nucleus of the [[Young Turks]] movement. However, after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908, he became deputy of Edirne in the [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Parliament]], and in July 1909, he was appointed Minister of Interior Affairs. He became Minister of Post, and then Secretary-General of the CUP in 1912.

After the assassination of the Prime Minister (Grand Vizier) [[Mahmud Şevket Pasha]] in July 1913, Talaat Pasha again became Minister of Interior Affairs. Talaat, with [[Enver Pasha]] and [[Djemal Pasha]], formed a group later known as the [[Three Pashas]]. These men formed the [[triumvirate]] that ran the Ottoman government until the end of [[World War I]] in October 1918.

== Armenian Genocide ==
[[File:ArmenianDeportations.jpg|thumb|Armenians being deported]]
According to various sources, Talaat Pasha had developed plans to eliminate the Armenians as early as 1910. Danish [[Philology|philologist]] [[Johannes Østrup]] wrote in his memoirs that in the autumn of 1910, Talaat talked openly about his plans to &quot;exterminate&quot; the Armenians with him.&lt;ref name=danishdiplomat /&gt;&lt;ref name=ostrup&gt;{{cite book|last1=Østrup|first1=Johannes|title=Erindringer|date=1938|publisher=H. Hirsch-sprungs forlag|page=118|language=Danish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAI5SAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Østrup, Talaat stated: &quot;If I ever come to power in this country, I will use all my might to exterminate the Armenians.&quot;&lt;ref name=danishdiplomat&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bjørnlund|first1=Matthias|title='When the Cannons Talk, the Diplomats Must be Silent’ – A Danish diplomat in Constantinople during the Armenian genocide|journal=Genocide Studies and Prevention|date=Fall 2006|volume=1|issue=2|pages=197–223|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1246&amp;context=gsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ostrup /&gt; In November of that year, a decision to carry out such a plan was made in [[Thessaloniki]] where a secret conference was held by prominent members of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP). The conference concluded that the Ottoman Empire, which promoted equality among Muslims and non-Muslims alike, was not ideologically compatible anymore, and that the Ottoman Empire should adopt a policy of [[Turkification]].&lt;ref name=kiernan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|title=Blood and soil a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur|date=2007|publisher=Yale Univ. Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300137931|pages=404–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talaat, who attended the conference, was a leading advocate of this policy shift and stated in a speech that: &quot;there can be no question of equality, until we have succeeded in our task of ottomanizing the Empire.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;heather&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rae|first1=Heather|title=State identities and the homogenisation of peoples|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=052179708X|pages=153–4|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8ni5uLZtFkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a decision ultimately required the assimilation of non-Turkish elements within the Empire and if necessary, it could be done through force.&lt;ref name=kiernan /&gt; British ambassador [[Sir Gerard Lowther, 1st Baronet|Gerard Lowther]] concluded after the conference that the: &quot;committee have given up any idea of Ottomanizing all the non-Turkish elements by sympathetic and Constitutional ways has long been manifest. To them 'Ottoman' evidently means 'Turk' and their present policy of 'Ottomanization' is one of pounding the non-Turkish elements in a Turkish mortar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;heather&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=ungor /&gt;

Talaat, along with Enver and Cemal, eventually represented the radical faction of the committee. In 1913, the faction ultimately seized power through a [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|violent coup]] establishing the rule of the [[Three Pashas]], which was also known as the &quot;dictatorial triumvirate&quot;.&lt;ref name=praeger /&gt; The Three Pashas then became largely responsible for the Ottoman Empire's [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entry into World War I]]. With the start of World War I, the Three Pashas found a suitable opportunity to begin their campaign of exterminating the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=praeger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peretz|first1=Don|title=The Middle East today|date=1994|publisher=Praeger|location=New York, NY|isbn=0275945766|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqfHROAUevsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;waal&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Waal|first1=Thomas|title=Great Catastrophe: Armenians and Turks in the Shadow of Genocide|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019935071X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2KzBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jones&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Adam|title=Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136937978|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kBZBwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gettleman|editor1-first=Marvin|editor2-last=Schaar|editor2-first=Stuart|title=The Middle East and Islamic World Reader: An Historical Reader for the 21st Century|date=2012|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=0802194524|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw1D9Ab8l-8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Instruction of the Ministery of the Interior on april 24.png|thumb|180px|Original copy of instruction from Talaat on 24 April 1915 to arrest Armenian intellectuals and community leaders]]
On 24 April 1915, Talaat issued an [[s:Circular on April 24, 1915|order]] to close all Armenian political organizations operating within the Ottoman Empire and arrest Armenians connected to them, justifying the action by stating that the organizations were controlled from outside the empire, were inciting upheavals behind the Ottoman lines, and were cooperating with Russian forces. This order resulted in the arrest on the night of 24/25 April 1915 of 235 to 270 [[Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915|Armenian community leaders in Istanbul]], including politicians, clergymen, physicians, authors, journalists, lawyers, and teachers, the majority of whom were eventually murdered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs2009&quot; /&gt; Although the mass killings of Armenian civilians had begun in the [[Van, Turkey|Van]] [[vilayet]] several weeks earlier, these mass-arrests in Istanbul are considered by many commentators to be the start of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven L.

Talaat then issued the order for the [[Tehcir Law]] of 1 June 1915 to 8 February 1916 that allowed for the mass-deportation of Armenians, a principal vehicle of the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= PBS effort to bridge controversy creates more | author= Josh Belzman | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12397821/ | date=23 April 2006 | accessdate= 5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deportees did not receive any humanitarian assistance and there is no evidence that the Ottoman government provided the extensive facilities and supplies that would have been necessary to sustain the life of hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees during their forced march to the [[Syrian desert]] or after.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehorn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|editor1-last=Whitehorn|editor1-first=Alan|title=The Armenian Genocide: The Essential Reference Guide|date=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1610696883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vrnCQAAQBAJ|chapter=Tehcir Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StarveNYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Exiled Armenians starve in the desert; Turks drive them like slaves, American committee hears ;- Treatment raises death rate |work=New York Times |date=8 August 1916 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C17F73C5F13738DDDA10894D0405B868DF1D3 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202042507/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C17F73C5F13738DDDA10894D0405B868DF1D3 | archivedate=2 February 2012&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the deportees were subject to periodic rape and massacre, often the result of direct orders by the CUP.

[[Hasan Tahsin Uzer]], governor of [[Erzurum]], similarly testified during the [[Mamuretulaziz]] trial that the [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|Teskilat-ı Mahsusa]], under the command of [[Behaeddin Shakir]], was mobilized to kill Armenians and that this organization was in constant contact with the Ministry of Interior. He explained:
{{quote|Then there was another Teskilat-ı Mahsusa, and that one had Bahaeddin Sakir's signature on it.

[[File:Armeniagen6a.jpg|thumb|Corpses of massacred Armenians, 1918]]

Numerous diplomats and notable figures confronted Talaat Pasha over the deportations and news of massacres. In one such conversation with German Embassy representative Dr. Mordtmann, Talaat stated his aims of annihilating the Christians of Turkey under the cover of World War I: 
{{blockquote|&quot;Turkey is taking advantage of the war in order to thoroughly liquidate its internal foes, i.e., the indigenous Christians, without being thereby disturbed by foreign intervention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wolcott, Martin Gilman; The Evil 100 (2000); Page 350; Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dadrian|first1=Vahakn|title=Genocide as a Problem of National and International Law: The World War I Armenian Case and Its Contemporary Legal Ramifications|journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]]|date=1989|volume=14|issue=2|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeVKAQAAIAAJ|issn=0889-7743|oclc=12626339}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In a memorandum sent to Berlin demanding the removal of German ambassador [[Paul Wolff Metternich]] because he interceded on behalf of the Armenians, Talaat reaffirmed such a commitment: &quot;the work must be done now, after the war it will be too late.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dadrian|first1=Vahakn N.|title=The history of the Armenian genocide: ethnic conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus|date=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=1571816666|edition=6th rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCVJMAVoMM0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, the subsequent German ambassador [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff|Johann von Bernstorff]] described his discussion with Talaat: &quot;When I kept on pestering him about the Armenian question, he once said with a smile: 'What on earth do you want?

{{quote|&quot;Suppose a few Armenians did betray you,&quot; I said. &quot;Is that a reason for destroying a whole race? Is that an excuse for making innocent women and children suffer?&quot;

&quot;Those things are inevitable,&quot; he replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgenthau, Sr.|first1=Henry|title=Ambassador Morgenthau's Story|date=1919|publisher=Doubleday, Page|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQwMAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another exchange, Talaat demanded from Morgenthau the list of American insurance policy holders belonging to dead Armenians in an effort to appropriate the funds to the state. Morgenthau categorically refused his request describing it as: &quot;one of the most astonishing requests I have ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgenthau, Sr.|first1=Henry|title=Ambassador Morgenthau's Story|date=1919|publisher=Doubleday, Page|page=339|quote='I wish,' Talaat now said, 'that you would get the American life insurance companies to send us a complete list of their Armenian policy holders.

Will you do so?'&lt;br&gt;This was almost too much, and I lost my temper.&lt;br&gt;'You will get no such list from me,' I said, and I got up and left him.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQwMAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Turkish politicians and figures also condemned the policy. Turkish feminist [[Halide Edip]], writing in her memoirs, captured a defiant reaction from Talaat Pasha when she probed him on the deportations and extermination. He allegedly told her that he was of the conviction that as long as a nation does what is best for its own interests and succeeds, the world admires it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |title=Memoirs of Halide Edip by Halide Edip, The Century Company, NY, 1926 |page=387 |id=3tD_CMvaewEC }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdülmecid II]], the last [[Ottoman Caliphate|Caliph of Islam]] of the [[Ottoman Dynasty]], said: &quot;I refer to those awful massacres.

== Grand Vizier, 1917–1918 ==
[[Image:Talat Pasha.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Interior Minister Talaat Pasha, who ordered the arrests of the Armenians during the Armenian genocide.]]
In 1917, Talaat became the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]], a post equivalent to that of Prime Minister, but was unable to reverse the downward spiral of Ottoman fortunes in his new position.

Over the next year, [[Jerusalem]] and [[Baghdad]] were lost. On January 11, 1918, the special decree ''On Armenia'' was signed by Lenin and Stalin which rearmed and repatriated over 100,000 Armenians from the former Tsar's Army to be sent to the Caucasus for operations against Ottoman interests.&lt;ref name=McMeekin&gt;{{cite book | last = McMeekin | first = Sean | title = The Berlin-Baghdad Express: Ottoman Empire and Germany's bid for World Power | publisher = [[Harvard University Press|Belknap Press of the Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = 2010 | isbn = 9780674057395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Buffers&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = Michael A. | title = Buffers, not Brethren: Young Turk Military Policy in the First World War and the Myth of Panturanism | publisher = [[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]] | volume = 2003 | date = May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of January 1918 with the Tsarist Army of the Caucasus departing, he had been influential in pursuing an offensive policy, convinced that despite all the pacifist rhetoric coming from Moscow 'the Russian leopard had not changed its spots'. The fall of [[Kars]] on 25 April 1918 reversed Russia's last conquest from the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Treaty (1878)]] and Ottoman Turkey restored the 1877 borders against her Russian enemy. In October 1918 however, the British shattered both Ottoman armies they faced  - and the armistice the British forced on Turkey at [[Mudros]] (30 October 1918) obliged the Ottoman army to evacuate [[Transcaucasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Mcmeekin, The Berlin-Baghdad Express, p.330,337&lt;/ref&gt; With defeat certain, Talaat had resigned on 14 October 1918.

== Exile, 1919–1921 ==
[[File:İkdam,_4_Kasım_1918.jpg|right|thumb|The front page of the Ottoman newspaper ''[[İkdam]]'' on 4 November 1918 after the [[Three Pashas]] fled the country following World War I.]]
Talaat Pasha fled the Ottoman capital in a German submarine on 3 November 1918, from Constantinople harbour to [[Berlin]]. Just a week later the [[Sublime Porte|Ottoman Porte]] capitulated to the Allies and signed the Armistice of Mudros.

Public opinion was shocked by the departure of Talaat Pasha, even though he had been known to turn a blind eye on corrupt ministers appointed because of their associations to the CUP.&lt;ref name=&quot;flee&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Tevfik Pasha took the position of Grand Vizier the same day that British ships entered the Golden Horn. Tevfik Pasha lasted until 4 March 1919, replaced by Ferid Pasha whose first order was the arrest of leading members of the CUP.

=== Turkish courts-martial of 1919–1920 ===
{{See also|Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–1920}}
Following the [[occupation of Constantinople]] by the Allied Powers, the British exerted pressure on the [[Sublime Porte|Ottoman Porte]] and brought to trial the Ottoman leaders who had held positions of responsibility between 1914 and 1918, for having committed, among other charges, the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Those who were caught were put under arrest at the Bekiraga division and were subsequently [[Malta exiles|exiled to Malta]]. The courts-martial were designed by Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] to punish the Committee of Union and Progress for the Empire's ill-conceived involvement in World War I. The Pashas who had held the highest positions in the administration and whose names were at the top of the execution lists of the Armenian assassination teams could be condemned in absentia because they had gone abroad.

By January 1919, a report to Sultan Mehmed VI accused over 130 suspects, most of whom were high officials. The indictment accused the main defendants, including Talaat, of being &quot;mired in an unending chain of bloodthirstiness, plunder and abuses&quot;. They were accused of deliberately engineering Turkey's entry into the war &quot;by a recourse to a number of vile tricks and deceitful means&quot;. They were also accused of &quot;the massacre and destruction of the Armenians&quot; and of trying to &quot;pile up fortunes for themselves&quot; through &quot;the pillage and plunder&quot; of their possessions. The indictment alleged that &quot;The massacre and destruction of the Armenians were the result of decisions by the Central Committee of Ittihadd&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;V. Dadrian, &quot;The History of the Armenian Genocide&quot; p323-324.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court released its verdict on 5 July 1919: Talaat, Enver, Cemal, and Dr. Nazim were condemned to death in absentia.

However, the British were determined not to leave Talaat alone. The British had intelligence reports indicating that he had gone to Germany, and the British High Commissioner pressured [[Damad Ferit Pasha]] and the Sublime Porte to demand from Germany to return him to the Ottoman Empire. As a result of efforts pursued personally by (Sir) Andrew Ryan, a former [[Dragoman]] and now a member of the British intelligence service, Germany responded to the Ottoman Empire stating that it was willing to be helpful if official papers could be produced showing these persons had been found guilty, and added that the presence of these persons in Germany could not as yet be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Oke, Mim Kemal: The Armenian question 1914-1923.

=== Aubrey Herbert interview, 1921 ===
The last official interview Talaat granted was to [[Aubrey Herbert]], a British intelligence agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

These meetings corroborated earlier intelligence to the effect that Talaat Pasha was seeking support from Muslim countries to form a serious opposition movement against the Allied Powers, and that he was soon intending to take refuge in Ankara, where the [[Turkish national movement]] was forming. Furthermore, Talaat Pasha also threatened that he was going to incite the [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turanist]] and [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] movements against England unless it signed a peace treaty favorable for Turkey.

During this interview, Talaat maintained on several occasions that the CUP had always sought British friendship and advice; but Britain was in no mood to offer any assistance whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Assassination, 1921 ===

{{See also|Operation Nemesis}}
Before the assassination, the British intelligence services identified Talaat in [[Stockholm]] where he had gone for a few days. The British intelligence first planned to apprehend him in Berlin where he was planning to return, but then changed its mind because it feared the complications this would create in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. Another view in British intelligence was that Talaat should be apprehended by the [[Royal Navy]] at sea while returning from Scandinavia by ship. In the end, it was decided to let him return to Berlin, find out what he was trying to accomplish with his activities abroad, and to establish direct contact with him before giving the final verdict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britishrole&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The British intelligence service established contact with its counterpart in the [[Soviet Union]] to evaluate the situation. Talaat Pasha's plans made the Russian officials as anxious as the British. The two intelligence services collaborated and signed between them the 'death warrant' of Talaat. Information concerning his physical description and his whereabouts was forwarded to their men in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britishrole&quot; /&gt;

It was decided that Armenian revolutionaries carry out the verdict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britishrole&quot; /&gt; Talaat was assassinated with a single bullet on 15 March 1921 as he came out of his house in Hardenbergstrasse, [[Charlottenburg]]. His [[assassin]] was an [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] member from [[Erzurum]] named [[Soghomon Tehlirian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;operation&quot;&gt;[http://operationnemesis.com/condemned.html Operationnemesis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Soghomon Tehlirian admitted committing the shooting, but after a [[Trial of Soghomon Tehlirian|cursory two-day trial]], he was found innocent by a German court on grounds of temporary insanity because of the traumatic experience he had gone through during the genocide.

== Legacy ==

===Immediately Following World War 1===
[[File:NY Times Armenian genocide.jpg|thumb|right|The New York Times, December 15, 1915]]

Talaat Pasha received widespread condemnation across the world for his leading role in the [[Armenian Genocide]]. He was found guilty of massacre of Armenians and sentenced to death in absentia by the Turkish Court on July 5, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Dadrian, Vahakn, &quot;The History of the Armenian Genocide&quot;, Page 323-324, Berghahn Books, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the widespread rape, torture and killings of the Armenians, U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau wrote in his 1919 memoir:

{{blockquote|&quot;Whatever crimes the most perverted instincts of the human mind can devise, and whatever refinements of persecution and injustice the most debased imagination can conceive, became the daily misfortunes of this devoted people. I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared with the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Morgenthau, Ambassador Morgenthau's Story, Page 119, Blackmask Online, http://m.library.antibaro.gr/text/Mikra_Asia/Ambassador%20Morgenthau's%20Story%20-%20Armenia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Post mortem===
Shortly after the assassination of Talaat in March 1921, the &quot;Posthumous Memoirs of Talaat&quot; was published in the October volume of ''The New York Times Current History''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Posthumous&quot;&gt;Talaat Pasha, &quot;Posthumous Memoirs of Talaat Pasha&quot;, ''The New York Times Current History'', Vol. 15, no. 1 (October 1921): 295&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Talaat admitted to purposefully deporting the Armenians to the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces in a prepared scheme. He however blamed Armenian civilians themselves for the deportations, implying the civilian population could have caused a revolution and it was therefore justified to exterminate them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I admit that we deported Armenians from our eastern provinces, and we acted in this matter upon a previously prepared scheme. The responsibility of these acts falls upon the deported people themselves. Russians ... had armed and equipped the Armenian inhabitants of this district [Van] ... and had organized strong Armenian bandit forces. ... When we entered the Great War, these bandits began their destructive activities in the rear of the Turkish army on the Caucasus front, blowing up the bridges and killing the innocent Mohammedan inhabitants regardless of age and sex... All these Armenian bandits were helped by the native Armenians.&quot; Hovannisian, Richard; The Armenian Genocide in Perspective, Page 142, Transaction Publishers, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naturally the Christians became alarmed when placards were posted in the villages and cities ordering everybody to bring their arms to headquarters. Although this order applied to all citizens, the Armenians well understood what the result would be, should they be left defenseless while their Moslem neighbours were permitted to retain their arms. In many cases, however, the persecuted people patiently obeyed the command; and then the Turkish officials almost joyfully seized their rifles as evidence that a &quot;revolution&quot; was being planned and threw their victims into prison on a charge of treason. Thousands failed to deliver arms simply because they had none to deliver, while an even greater number tenaciously refused to give them up, not because they were plotting an uprising, but because they proposed to defend their own lives and their women's honour against the outrages which they knew were being planned. The punishment inflicted upon these recalcitrants forms one of the most hideous chapters of modern history. Most of us believe that torture has long ceased to be an administrative and judicial measure, yet I do not believe that the darkest ages ever presented scenes more horrible than those which now took place all over Turkey.&quot; Henry Morgenthau, Ambassador Morgenthau's Story, Page 112, Blackmask Online, http://m.library.antibaro.gr/text/Mikra_Asia/Ambassador%20Morgenthau's%20Story%20-%20Armenia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Talaat Pasha grave.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Talaat Pasha in the cemetery of [[Monument of Liberty, Istanbul]]]] 
He was buried in the Turkish Cemetery in [[Berlin]]. In 1943, his remains were taken to [[Istanbul]] and reburied in [[Şişli]].

=== Modern views ===

Talaat Pasha, [[Enver Pasha]] and [[Djemal Pasha]] are widely considered the main authors of the [[Armenian Genocide]] by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Alayaria, Aida; Consequences of Denial: The Armenian Genocide, Page 182, 2008, Karnac Books Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have cited the influence of the Armenian Genocide on the [[Holocaust]], which took place a few decades later. Records show the Nazis discussing and praising the Turkish model of extermination as early as the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the German interwar and Nazi discourses on the New Turkey, one finds a chilling propagation of what a post-genocidal country, one cleansed of its minorities, could achieve: To the Nazis, the New Turkey was something of a post-genocidal wonderland, something that Germany would have to emulate. The Nazis were discussing the Turkish model already in the early 1920s. A German-Jewish newspaper reader and critic of Anti-Semitism, Siegfried Lichtenstaedter, understood the &quot;Turkish lessons&quot; formulated in Nazi articles (in 1923 and 1924) to mean that the Jews of Germany and Austria should be, and had to be, killed and their property given to &quot;Aryans.&quot;&quot;; Ihrig, Stefan; How the Armenian Genocide Shaped the Holocaust; 2016; http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/24/how-the-armenian-genocide-shaped-the-holocaust.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Within modern Turkey, criticism also focuses on Talaat and the rest of the [[Three Pashas]] for causing the Ottoman Empire's entry into World War I and its subsequent [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioning by the Allies]]. Turkey's founder [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] widely criticized Talaat Pasha and his colleagues for their policies during and immediately prior to the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaylan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Muammer Kaylan|title=The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=aEh_IofABkYC |page=77 }} |publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-897-2|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multitude of streets in Turkey display his name, as well as a street in the city of Paphos in the Republic of Cyprus that contains a large Turkish minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talaat Pasha Street in Paphos&quot;&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Talat+Pa%C5%9Fa,+Baf,+Cyprus/@34.7792343,32.4185642,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x14e706f5e22edee9:0x6f305bf3b6478699]&lt;/ref&gt;
