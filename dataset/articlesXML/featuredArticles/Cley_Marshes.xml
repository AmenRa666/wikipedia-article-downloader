'''Cley Marshes''' is a {{convert|176|ha|acre|adj=on}} [[nature reserve]] on the [[North Sea]] [[coast]] of England just outside the village of [[Cley next the Sea]],  [[Norfolk]]. A reserve since 1926, it is the oldest of the reserves belonging to the [[Norfolk Wildlife Trust]] (NWT), which is itself the oldest county [[The Wildlife Trusts|Wildlife Trust]] in the United Kingdom. Cley Marshes protects an area of [[reed bed]]s, [[freshwater marsh]], [[pond|pools]] and [[wet meadow]]s and has been designated as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI), [[Special Area of Conservation]] (SAC), [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA), and [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Site]] due to the large numbers of birds it attracts.

The reserve is important for some scarce breeding species, such as [[pied avocet]]s on the islands, and [[western marsh harrier]]s, [[Eurasian bittern]]s and [[bearded reedling]]s in the reeds, and is also a major [[bird migration|migration]] stopoff and wintering site. There are also several nationally or locally scarce [[invertebrate]]s and plants specialised for this coastal habitat. It has five [[bird hide]]s and an environmentally friendly [[visitor center|visitor centre]] and further expansion is planned through the acquisition of neighbouring land and improvements to visitor facilities.

The site has a long history of human occupation, from [[prehistoric]] farming to its use as a [[prisoner of war]] camp in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The reserve attracts large numbers of visitors, contributing significantly to the economy of Cley village. Despite centuries of [[levee|embankment]] to reclaim land and protect the village, the marshes have been flooded many times, and the southward march of the [[shingle beach|coastal shingle]] bank and [[sea level rise|encroachment by the sea]] make it inevitable that the reserve will eventually be lost. New [[wetland]]s are being created further inland to compensate for the loss of coastal habitats.

== History ==

=== Prehistory to 1926 ===
Norfolk has a long history of human occupation. Both [[anatomically modern humans|Modern]] and [[Neanderthal]] people were present in the area before the last [[glacial period|glaciation]] between 100,000 and 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The [[Archaeology|archaeological]] record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the [[Mesolithic]], the sea level rose, filling what is now the [[North Sea]]. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea. The oldest signs of habitation on the marshes are prehistoric [[Clactonian]] [[flint]] blades possibly from 400,000 years ago, but few other prehistoric remains have been recorded here.&lt;ref name= NAE9&gt;Robertson ''et al.'' (2005) pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThomasTelford.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Telford|Thomas Telford's]] recommendations for keeping the access to Cley port open were not implemented.]]

Fragments of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] vase and jug have been found on the beach. A 1797 map showed what was described as the ruins of &quot;Cley Chapel&quot;, although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.norfolk.gov.uk/record-details?MNF6163 Norfolk Heritage Explorer; NHER Number: 6163]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1588 map showed &quot;Black Joy Forte&quot;, which may have been intended as a defence against the [[Spanish Armada]]. There are a number of [[medieval|post-medieval]] earthworks, presumably [[Coastal management|sea defence]]s, and pits which may have been associated with salt-making.&lt;ref name= NAE20&gt;Robertson ''et al.'' (2005) pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-1600s, much of the area now known as Cley Marshes was part of a vast tidal marsh and was covered by [[seawater]] twice a day. The [[shore]]line itself was hundreds of metres north of its present location.&lt;ref name=wrightchap/&gt; The raised area in the north-west corner, called the &quot;Eye&quot;, has been farmed since the earliest human habitation. It was 28&amp;nbsp;ha (70&amp;nbsp;acres) in extent in 1651, but is now much reduced by coastal erosion.&lt;ref name= brooks21&gt;Brooks (2011) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= bishop130&gt;Bishop (1983) pp. 130–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the Eye was by an ancient [[causeway]], passable at low tide.&lt;ref name= bishop130/&gt; John Heydon started the process of [[dike (construction)|embanking]] the marshes to reclaim the land in 1522, and his banks were extended and improved by Dutchman Jan van Hasedunch from 1630. Simon Britiff, Lord of the local Manor of Cley, completed the scheme by building the bank on the east side of the Cley channel. Only the east and west banks have survived; the north bank was breached by the sea in 1897,&lt;ref name= labrum&gt;Labrum (1993) pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; then rebuilt with a concrete facing, but abandoned after another bad storm in 1921.&lt;ref name= bishop130/&gt;

Cley and nearby [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]] had been prosperous and important ports in the [[Middle Ages]], but [[land reclamation]] schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the [[wharf]].&lt;ref name= pevsner/&gt; Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the [[Salthouse]] marshes to the east of Cley.&lt;ref name= commission/&gt; In an attempt to halt the decline, [[Thomas Telford]] was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports.&lt;ref name= pevsner&gt;Pevsner &amp; Wilson (2002) p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply.&lt;ref name= commission&gt;Hume, Joseph. &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GzQxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22cley+marshes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ogrwT6mHE9Gn8QONs9GwDQ&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cley%20marshes%22&amp;f=false Port of Cley and Blakeney]&quot; in appendix to {{cite book | author = Tidal Harbours Commission | title = Second report of the commissioners| year = 1846 | location = London | publisher = W Clowes &amp; Son| pages = 83a–84a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Lord of the Manor]] constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient [[Right of way (public throughway)|right of way]] across the marshes.&lt;ref name= bishop130/&gt;

In the decades preceding [[World War I]], this stretch of coast became famous for its [[Waterfowl hunting|wildfowling]]; locals were looking for food, but some &quot;Gentleman Gunners&quot; hunted to collect rare birds. One of the best known of the latter was  E. C. Arnold, who collected for more than fifty years, and gave his name to the marsh at the north-east corner of the present reserve.&lt;ref name= bishop9&gt;Bishop (1983) pp. 9–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature reserve era ===
[[File:Cley Marshes Nature Reserve - geograph.org.uk - 1405631.jpg|thumb|Looking inland across the reserve]]
Cley Marshes reserve was created in 1926 when Norfolk [[birdwatcher]] Dr Sydney Long bought the land which now makes up the reserve for the sum of £5,100, to be held &quot;in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary&quot;. Long then established the [[Norfolk Wildlife Trust]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Naturalworld&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title= £2.5m for Cley Marsh |journal=Natural World |date=Winter 2005  |pages=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = nwt100&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= The Wildlife Trusts celebrate 100 years of nature conservation| work= News, ''15 May 2012'' | url= http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/news/all-news/2012-05-15-the-wildlife-trusts-celebrate| publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust | accessdate = 7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reserve was extended in 1962 through the lease of the adjacent {{convert|11|ha|acre|adj=on}} Arnold's Marsh from the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]];&lt;ref name= turner/&gt; this had long been the primary feeding area for [[wader]]s, but much of the best habitat had been lost to the advancing shingle ridge. New pools and hides were created on the reserve from 1964, and the sale of permits for access to the hides became a useful source of income for the NWT.&lt;ref name= bishop40&gt;Bishop (1983) pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Further pools and hides were established during the 1970s, and a visitor centre was built in 1981 on the site of the current building.&lt;ref name= bishop130/&gt;

Over the long history of the reserve, it has had only three wardens, all from the same family. Robert Bishop was warden from 1926 to 1937, and was followed by his grandson, Billy, from 1937 to 1978. Billy's son, Bernard, who was appointed in 1978, is still managing the reserve.&lt;ref name= bishop9/&gt;&lt;ref name = edp2011&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Cley Marshes part of the family | newspaper = Eastern Daily Press | location = Norwich | publisher = Archant Community Media Ltd | date = 3 February 2011| url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/lifestyle/cley_marshes_part_of_the_family_1_791600| accessdate = 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = cleynwt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Protected bird nest closes Cley Marshes path days after it was unveiled by David Attenborough | newspaper = Eastern Daily Press | location = Norwich | publisher = Archant Community Media Ltd | date = 18 June 2015| url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/environment/protected_bird_nest_closes_cley_marshes_path_days_after_it_was_unveiled_by_david_attenborough_1_4117323| accessdate = 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reserve now covers {{convert|176|ha|acre|abbr=off}},&lt;ref name= turner/&gt; and is of international importance for its breeding and wintering birds. It was designated as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) in 1954, and in 1986 it was subsumed into the {{convert|7700|ha|acre|adj=on}} North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The larger area is now additionally protected through [[Natura 2000]], [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA) and [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] listings, and is part of the [[Norfolk Coast AONB|Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB).&lt;ref name = encitation&gt;{{cite web| author =| title= North Norfolk Coast | work= SSSI citations | url =http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001342.pdf | publisher= Natural England}} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aonb&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Other Conservation Designations within the AONB December 2009 | work= Norfolk Coast AONB Management Plan 2009–14  | url= http://www.norfolkcoastaonb.org.uk/mediaps/pdfuploads/pd001159.pdf | publisher= Norfolk Coast partnership}} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve has been referred to as &quot;a Mecca for birdwatchers&quot;.&lt;ref name = moss&gt;{{cite news | last = Moss| first = Stephen | title = Where to see wetlands in the UK | newspaper = The Guardian| location = London | publisher = Guardian News and Media | date = 1 February 2008 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/feb/01/wildlife.conservation | accessdate = 6 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WW2 Pillbox at Cley-next-the Sea - geograph.org.uk - 11710.jpg|thumb|Ruined [[World War II]] [[pillbox (military)|pillbox]] at end of west bank]]

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Royal Artillery]] [[British hardened field defences of World War II|military fortifications]] were established at the beach end of the reserve, including two 6-inch (15.24&amp;nbsp;cm) guns, five buildings, two [[pillbox (military)|pillboxes]], a [[minefield]],&lt;ref name= NAE20/&gt; and concrete anti-tank blocks. A [[Blacker Bombard|spigot mortar emplacement]] and an [[British hardened field defences of World War II#Allan Williams Turret|Allan Williams Turret]] [[machine gun]] emplacement were sited closer to the village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012.&lt;ref name = nhe&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Cley next the Sea | work=Norfolk Heritage Explorer | url=http://www.heritage.norfolk.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=TNF267 | publisher= Norfolk Landscape Archaeology }} Retrieved 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The military camp held 160 men and was later used to hold [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Italian, but not German, prisoners were allowed to attend dances at the [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] camp at nearby [[Stiffkey]]. Near the end of the war, the camp was used to house East European [[refugee]]s, and it was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1955, but the [[Electric generator|generator]] house was taken over by the [[coastguard]] service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a look-out, while the larger lower section became a beach café.&lt;ref name= brooks26&gt;Brooks (2011) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008 and subsequently demolished.&lt;ref name = parish&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Cley Parish News, May 2008| work= | url= http://www.cley.org.uk/webpics/parishnews08.pdf | publisher=Cley Parish Council }} Retrieved 4 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reserve is to the north of the [[A149 road|A149 coast road]] just east of the village of [[Cley next the Sea]], 6&amp;nbsp;km (3.7&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]]. The visitor centre and car park are to the south of the road, opposite the reserve. The reserve can be reached by [[public transport]] using the bus service that stops outside the visitor centre.&lt;ref name = cleynwt&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Cley Marshes| work= Nature reserves| url= http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/cley.aspx| publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust}} Retrieved 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reserve is viewable from the visitor centre, footpaths next to the A149 and down the East Bank, the beach and the road running from the beach back to the main road. It can be accessed by footpaths at three points, each leading to one or more [[bird hide]]s.&lt;ref name = cleyleaf&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= NWT Cley Marshes| work= Reserve leaflet | url= http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Documents/Reserves/Cley-Marshes.pdf| publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust}} Retrieved 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Beach Road and the beach itself form part of the [[Peddars Way]] [[long distance footpath]].&lt;ref name = peddar&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Peddars Way/Norfolk Coast Path| work= | url= http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/PeddarsWay/| publisher= National Trails}} Retrieved 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present visitor centre, which opened in June 2007, is on a small hill overlooking the reserve. It contains a café and shop, and is open daily. The reserve and hides are open at all times, with free access to NWT members, although non-members must buy a permit.&lt;ref name = cleynwt/&gt;

The visitor centre is built on [[environmentally friendly]] principles. Its roof is covered with living [[sedum]] plants, rainwater is collected for re-use, and the building's energy profile is reduced using [[solar water heating]], [[wind turbine]]s and [[geothermal heat pump]]s.&lt;ref name = cleynwt/&gt; It has won a number of awards including the Emirates Glass [[LEAF Award|LEAF architectural award]] for the sustainability category.&lt;ref name = lsi&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Cley Marshes | work= Projects | url=http://lsiarchitects.net/project.php?p=71109&amp;img=2 | publisher= LSI Architects LLP}} Retrieved 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the centre has led to plans to  develop it further, offering more services and educational facilities and enhancing its profitability for the Trust.&lt;ref name= nwtbusstrat&gt;Norfolk Wildlife Trust (2011b) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to wheelchair users.&lt;ref name = cleynwt/&gt;

In 2012 the NWT launched a public appeal to raise £1&amp;nbsp;million to purchase 58&amp;nbsp;hectares (143&amp;nbsp;acres) of private land immediately to the east of the existing reserve, and adjoining the existing 66&amp;nbsp;ha (163&amp;nbsp;acre) Trust reserve at [[Salthouse#Salthouse Marshes|Salthouse Marshes]]. This purchase would create a unified 8&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;mi) stretch of NWT-owned coastal land and expand the Cley reserve by one-third.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;NWT (2012) Cley Marshes land purchase appeal leaflet.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = salthousenwt&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Salthouse Marshes| work= Nature reserves| url= http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Wildlife-in-Norfolk/Reserves/Salthouse-Marshes.aspx| publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust}} Retrieved 30 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birds ===
[[File:Panurus biarmicus 2 (Martin Mecnarowski).jpg|thumb|[[Bearded reedling]]]]

The key breeding species are reed bed specialists such as the marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting avocet. Other birds nesting in the wetland include [[northern lapwing]], [[common redshank]] and [[sedge warbler|sedge]], [[Eurasian reed warbler|reed]] and [[Cetti's warbler]]s. [[Eurasian spoonbill]]s, [[ruff]]s and [[black-tailed godwit]]s are present for much of the year,&lt;ref name = harrup/&gt; and a pair of [[little egret]]s bred for the first time in 2010–2012.&lt;ref name = cleynwt/&gt;&lt;ref name= nwtann6/&gt;

Spring [[bird migration|migrants]] including  [[little gull]], [[black tern]], [[Temminck's stint]] and [[garganey]] may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere, and [[tern]]s frequently visit from the colonies on [[Blakeney Point]]. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north. Some, such as [[whimbrel]]s, [[curlew sandpiper]]s and [[little stint]]s, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, [[great skua|great]] and [[Arctic skua]]s, [[northern gannet]]s and [[black-legged kittiwake]]s may pass close by in favourable winds.

[[European water vole|Water voles]] are a highly threatened species in the UK, with a huge decline in numbers of 70–90%, mainly due to predation by the introduced [[American mink]], but also habitat loss and water pollution.

=== Plants ===
[[File:Polypogon monspeliensis 3881578658.jpg|thumb|[[Polypogon monspeliensis|Annual beard grass]]]]
The shingle ridge that protects the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts [[Sedum acre|biting stonecrop]], [[Silene maritima|sea campion]], [[Glaucium flavum|yellow horned poppy]], [[Armeria maritima|sea thrift]], [[Lotus corniculatus|bird's foot trefoil]] and [[sea beet]].&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; [[Hordeum marinum|Sea barley]] is a scarcer species of this habitat.&lt;ref name= dear/&gt; In the damper areas, [[Artemisia maritima|sea wormwood]], [[Limonium binervosum|sea lavender]] and [[Suaeda vera|scrubby sea-blite]] also thrive. The saltmarsh contains [[Salicornia|glassworts]] and [[Spartina anglica|common cord grass]] in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first [[Aster tripolium|sea aster]], then mainly sea lavender, with [[Halimione portulacoides|sea purslane]] in the creeks and smaller areas of [[Plantago maritima|sea plantain]] and other common marsh plants.&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; The uncommon [[Ruppia cirrhosa|spiral tasselweed]] and [[Carex extensa|long-bracted sedge]] are other saltmarsh specialists. The upper saltmarsh has a number of scarce species including [[Centaurium pulchellum|lesser centaury]], [[Parapholis incurva|curved hard-grass]] and [[Sagina maritima|sea pearlwort]], with [[Ceratophyllum submersum|soft hornwort]] in the dykes.&lt;ref name= dear/&gt;

The drier areas of the reserve contain maritime grasses such as [[Agropyron pungens|sea couch grass]] and [[Puccinellia maritima|sea poa grass]]. The reedbeds are dominated by [[Phragmites|common reed]] with [[Juncus gerardii|saltmarsh rush]], [[Ranunculus peltatus|brackish water crowfoot]], [[Bolboschoenus maritimus|sea clubrush]] and [[Typha latifolia|common bulrush]] also common in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and the adjacent Salthouse Marshes have [[Juncus articulatus|jointleaf rush]], [[Argentina anserina|common silverweed]] and less common grasses such as [[Polypogon monspeliensis|annual beard grass]], [[Alopecurus geniculatus|marsh foxtail]]&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; and [[Bupleurum tenuissimum|slender hare's-ear]]. The site is generally rich in plants, especially those that can cope with saline environments, but three species appear to have been lost: [[Carex divisa|divided sedge]] was last recorded in 1999, [[Corynephorus canescens|grey hair-grass]] in 1982 and [[Limonium humile|lax-flowered sea lavender]] in 1977. [[Lichen]]s are not suited to the prevailing habitat, but the nationally rare [[Cyphelium notarisii|soot lichen]] occurs on untreated wood. The locally rare [[bryophyte]] [[Heim's pottia]] occurs in the saltmarsh, and the coastal variety ''piliferum'' of [[Cuspidate Earth-moss|cuspidate earth-moss]] is found at Salthouse.&lt;ref name= dear/&gt;

[[File:Visitor Centre near Cley - geograph.org.uk - 1258833.jpg|thumb|The visitor centre attracts more than 100,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref name= nwtann11/&gt;]]
A 2005 survey at Cley and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39&amp;nbsp;per cent of visitors gave [[birdwatching]] as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7&amp;nbsp;million day visitors and 5.5&amp;nbsp;million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122&amp;nbsp;million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Cley Marshes, like [[Titchwell Marsh]] RSPB and Holkham NNR, attracts 100,000 or more visitors annually.&lt;ref name= nwtann11&gt;Norfolk Wildlife Trust (2011a) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liley (2008) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the six sites, Cley and Titchwell have the highest proportion of pre-planned visits, and Cley, together with neighbouring Blakeney, had the highest ''per capita'' spend per visitor. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley area are estimated to result from the £2.45&amp;nbsp;million spent by the visiting public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Valuing Norfolk's Coast | work= | url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/Valuing_norfolks_coast_tcm9-203973.pdf | publisher= Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)}} Retrieved 29 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The large number of tourists can have negative effects; wildlife may be disturbed, particularly species that breed in exposed areas, such as [[ringed plover]]s, and plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle.&lt;ref name =liley10&gt;Liley (2008) pp. 10–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Damage can be reduced by measures such as wardening the breeding colonies and using fences, [[boardwalk]]s and signs to control access.&lt;ref name =liley19&gt;Liley (2008) pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The access paths to the hides, other than the northernmost, are largely boardwalked,&lt;ref name =harrup/&gt; and an extensive programme of fence replacement and improvements to the control of water levels on the reserve took place in 2010–2011.&lt;ref name= nwtann6&gt;Norfolk Wildlife Trust (2011a) pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Shingle spit.jpg|The shingle ridge is moving southwards through the marshes.|thumb]]
The reserve shelters behind a ridge of shingle that runs west from [[Weybourne, Norfolk|Weybourne]] along the Norfolk coast, before becoming a spit extending into the sea at Blakeney Point. Saltmarshes can develop behind the shingle, but the sea attacks the ridge and spit through tidal and storm action.
