}}The '''8th Punjab Regiment''' was a [[regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] from 1922 to 1947. It was transferred to [[Pakistan Army]] on [[Partition of India]] in 1947 and merged with the [[10th Baluch Regiment|Baluch Regiment]] in 1956.

==Madras Infantry==
The 8th Punjab Regiment had its origins in the [[Madras Army]], where its first battalion was raised at [[Masulipatam]] in 1798. Four more battalions were raised in 1799-1800. In 1824, they were designated as the 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd and 33rd Regiments of Madras Native Infantry. In the early 19th century, these battalions were engaged in fighting the [[Marathas]] and took part in a number of foreign expeditions including the [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]]. Between 1890 and 1893, they were reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims and [[Sikh]]s as Burma Battalions and permanently based in [[Burma]] to police the turbulent Burmese hill tracts. Under the [[Kitchener Reforms]] of 1903, they were redesignated as the [[89th Punjabis|89th]], [[90th Punjabis|90th]], [[91st Punjabis (Light Infantry)|91st]], [[92nd Punjabis]], and [[93rd Burma Infantry]]. They were delocalized from Burma before the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad 2006&quot;&gt;Ahmad, Maj RN, and Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (2006). ''Unfaded Glory: The 8th Punjab Regiment 1798-1956''. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==

The 8th Punjabis have a most distinguished record of service during the First World War. Their long list of honours and awards includes the Victoria Cross awarded to Naik [[Shahamad Khan|Shahmed Khan]] of 89th Punjabis in 1916. The 89th Punjabis had the unique distinction of serving in more theatres of war than any other unit of the [[British Empire]]. These included Aden, where they carried out the first opposed sea-borne assault landing in modern warfare, Egypt, Gallipoli, France, Mesopotamia, [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]], Salonika and Russian [[Transcaucasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoghegan, Col NM, and Campbell, Capt MHA. (1928). ''History of the 1st Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment''. Aldershot: Gale &amp; Polden.&lt;/ref&gt; All battalions served in Mesopotamia, while 93rd Burma Infantry also served in France. The 92nd Punjabis were made 'Prince of Wales's Own' in 1921 for their gallantry and sacrifices during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad 2006&quot;/&gt;

In 1922, the five battalions along with the war-raised 2/89th Punjabis were united to form the 8th Punjab Regiment:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad 2006&quot;/&gt;

*1/[[89th Punjabis]] - 1st Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment
*[[90th Punjabis]] - 2nd Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment
*[[91st Punjabis]] (Light Infantry) - 3rd Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment
*[[92nd Punjabis|92nd (Prince of Wales's Own) Punjabis]] - 4th Battalion (Prince of Wales's Own)8th Punjab Regiment
*[[93rd Burma Infantry]] - 5th (Burma) Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment
*2/[[89th Punjabis]] - 10th Battalion (Training Battalion) 8th Punjab Regiment

The new class composition of the 8th Punjab Regiment was Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Hindu Gujars. [[Chinthe]] - the mythical Burmese lion-dragon guardian of Buddhist pagodas was chosen as its new emblem. The uniform was of drab colour with blue facings. In inter-war period, the Regiment saw extensive service on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad 2006&quot;/&gt;

==Second World War==

During the [[Second World War]] the 8th Punjab Regiment again distinguished itself, suffering more than 4500 casualties. It was awarded two Victoria Crosses to Havildar [[Parkash Singh]] and Sepoy [[Kamal Ram]], besides numerous other gallantry awards. The regiment raised a further nine battalions. Two of its battalions, the 1st and 7th, were captured on [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore Island]], when the [[British Commonwealth]] [[Malaya Command|Army]] surrendered there to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. Four battalions fought in the [[Burma Campaign]], while others saw service in [[Anglo-Iraqi War|Iraq]], [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Iran]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], [[French Indochina]] and the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Dutch East Indies]]. Two men from the 8th Punjab Regiment received the Victoria Cross: Havildar [[Parkash Singh]] in Burma and Sepoy [[Kamal Ram]] in Italy. By the end of the war, the Regiment consisted of 14 Battalions. However, most of the war-raised units were disbanded in 1946 except the 6th and 8th Battalions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad 2006&quot;/&gt;

==Post-independence history==
In 1947, the 8th Punjab Regiment was allocated to [[Pakistan]], and Sikhs and Gujars were exchanged with Hindustani Muslims from units allotted to [[India]]. In January 1948, 6th Battalion was disbanded, only to be re-raised in October along with the 9th Battalion, in response of the Kashmir War with India. In 1956, the eight battalions of 8th Punjab Regiment were merged with the Baluch Regiment. Their new designations were:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad 2006&quot;/&gt;[[File:91st Punjabis, Poona, 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Indian Officers of 1st Battalion 91st Punjabis (Light Infantry), Poona, 1920.|310px]]
