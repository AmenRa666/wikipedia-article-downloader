'''SS ''Black Osprey''''' was a [[cargo ship]] for the [[American Diamond Lines]] and the British [[Cairn Line]]. She was formerly known as '''SS ''West Arrow''''' when she was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] for the USSB during [[World War I]]. The ship was inspected by the [[United States Navy]] for possible use as '''USS ''West Arrow'' (ID-2585)''' but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] under that name.

''West Arrow'' was built in 1918 for the USSB, as a part of the ''West'' boats, a series of steel-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed cargo ships built on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the World War I war effort. Information about her early career is largely absent, but by the 1920s, news reports revealed that the ship was sailing on the North Atlantic. By the mid-1920s, ''West Arrow'' was sailing for American Diamond on their cargo service to [[Rotterdam]] and [[Antwerp]]. In 1935, American Diamond changed the ship's name to ''Black Osprey'' and the ship continued in Rotterdam service.

After the outbreak of [[World War II]], ''Black Osprey'', still under the registry of the still-neutral United States, was detained twice by British authorities, before the U.S.-established &quot;Neutrality Zone&quot; ended ''Black Osprey''{{'}}s Dutch service in late 1939. Sailing under [[ship chartering|charter]] to the [[Isthmian Line]] in 1940, ''Black Osprey'' called at various ports in the Pacific Ocean. American Diamond sold ''Black Osprey'' to the British [[Ministry of War Transport]] in late 1940. During the ship's first transatlantic crossing under the British flag, she was sunk by {{GS|U-96|1940|6}} on 18 February 1941, with the loss of 25 men. The 11 survivors were picked up by a Norwegian ship and landed in at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]].

== Design and construction ==
The ''West'' ships were [[cargo ship]]s of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the USSB for emergency use during [[World War I]]. All were given names that began with the word ''West'', like ''West Arrow'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crowell|Wilson|1928| pp= 358–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of some 24 ''West'' ships built by [[Skinner &amp; Eddy]] of [[Seattle, Washington]].{{sfn|Colton|2008|p=}}&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Skinner &amp; Eddy was an emergency shipyard that only operated from 1916 until about 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; ''West Arrow'' (Skinner &amp; Eddy No. 12){{sfn|Colton|2008|p=}} was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 20 September 1917 under the name ''Jas. G. Eddy'', [[ship naming and launching|launched]] as ''West Arrow'' on 19 January 1918, and completed on 26 February 1918.&lt;ref name=S&amp;E /&gt;

The ship was {{GRT|5,802|disp=long}},&lt;ref name=Miramar /&gt; and was {{convert|409|ft|5|in|m}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]) and {{convert|54|ft|2|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]]. ''West Arrow'' had a steel [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a [[deadweight tonnage]] of {{DWT|8,800}}.&lt;ref name=S&amp;E /&gt; The ship had a single [[steam turbine]] that drove her single [[screw propeller]], and moved the ship at a {{convert|10.5|knots|km/h|adj=on}} pace.&lt;ref name=Miramar /&gt;

== Career ==
''West Arrow'' was inspected by the [[13th Naval District]] of the [[United States Navy]] after completion and was assigned the identification number of 2585. Had she been [[ship commissioning|commissioned]], she would have been known as USS ''West Arrow'' (ID-2585), but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of ''West Arrow''{{'}}s early career, with almost no information regarding her World War I activities. During that war, many of the ''West'' ships carried grain products to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, but it is not known whether ''West Arrow'' did so or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crowell|Wilson|1928| pp= 358–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; One early mention of ''West Arrow'' in contemporary news accounts is found in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', which reported in February 1921 that the cargo ship had delivered 742 &quot;[[dairy cattle|milch cows]]&quot; to [[Bremen]] as a gift from American farmers from Texas and [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;

''Haverford'', headed from [[Philadelphia]] to Liverpool with passengers, struck the cargo ship on the [[port (direction)|port]] side, {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the [[bow (ship)|bow]]. A radio dispatch from ''West Arrow'' reported that she was proceeding under her own power and was not taking on any water.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1935, American Diamond changed the name of ''West Arrow'' to ''Black Osprey'',&lt;ref name=Miramar /&gt; which remained on the Rotterdam route into 1936. In March of that year, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''—reporting on a large gold shipment from the United States to [[The Netherlands|Holland]]—speculated that ''Black Osprey'' was the ship that had been selected to carry $345,000 of gold for export.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1938,&lt;ref&gt;[[List of shipwrecks in 1938]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Black Osprey'' was sailing in a dense fog off St. Catherine's Point on the [[Isle of Wight]] when she struck the {{GRT|311}} British cargo ship ''Chagford'', which sank within five minutes. Three of ''Chagford''′s six-man crew were picked up by ''Black Osprey'', whose crew searched in vain for three hours for the other three men. After the fog lifted, the ''Chagford'' survivors were transferred to a fishing vessel that landed the crewmen, and ''Black Osprey'' resumed her Rotterdam – Philadelphia journey.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, ''Black Osprey'', still registered in the neutral-United States, was seized by British authorities on 6 September and detained at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]]. After carefully inspecting the ship for any [[contraband]], the British released the ship after a week.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news
|agency = [[Associated Press]]
|title  = British free American ship

|date   = 14 September 1939
|page   = A &lt;!-- yes, this is the correct page number for that edition --&gt;
|ref    = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 31 October, the British again seized ''Black Osprey'', and had not yet released her by 8 November, when the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] released a list of 40 American ships that had been detained by [[belligerent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

|date   = 9 November 1939
|page   = 2
|ref    = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States established a &quot;Neutrality Zone&quot;—a zone where American-flagged ships could not enter—in late 1939. As a result, American Diamond was unable to continue its Dutch route, and [[ship chartering|chartered]] the eight vessels it employed in that service (which included ''Black Osprey'') to other U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de la Pedraja Tomán|1994|pp= 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Black Osprey'' was one of several chartered to the [[Isthmian Line]],&lt;ref name=NYT-british_seek&gt;
{{cite news

|work  = The New York Times

|ref    = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[typhoon]] with winds in excess of {{convert|115|mph}} hit [[Wake Island]] in early October, ''Black Osprey'' was diverted through heavy seas to check on the welfare of the 35 men on the island, all found to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;

|title = Wake Island, clipper base, hit by typhoon
|work  = The New York Times
|date  = 19 October 1940
|page  = A
|ref   = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, American Diamond sought the permission of the {{USMC|first=long}}, a successor to the {{USSB}}, to sell ''Black Osprey'' and seven other ships to the British.&lt;ref name=NYT-british_seek /&gt; The {{USMC}} granted the permission,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Black Osprey'' was sold to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] for operation by the [[Cairn Line]] of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], for about $50 per [[deadweight ton]], or around $440,000.&lt;ref name=NYT-british_seek /&gt;

The deal was completed before ''Black Osprey''{{'}}s 10 December sailing from Philadelphia to Baltimore under the British flag. ''Black Osprey'' then sailed from Baltimore on 25 January 1941 for [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], where she arrived on 30 January.&lt;ref name=CPDB&gt;

The ship's master and 24 crewmen died in the attack. ''Black Osprey''{{'}}s 11 survivors were picked up by the Norwegian refrigerated cargo ship ''Mosdale'' and landed at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;
