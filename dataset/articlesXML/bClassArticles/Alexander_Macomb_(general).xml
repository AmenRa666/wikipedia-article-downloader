'''Alexander Macomb''' (April 3, 1782 – June 25, 1841) was the [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General]] of the [[United States Army]] from May 29, 1828 until his death on June 25, 1841. Macomb was the field commander at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]] during the War of 1812 and, after the stunning victory, was lauded with praise and styled &quot;The Hero of Plattsburgh&quot; by some of the American press. He was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] for his conduct, receiving both the [[Thanks of Congress]] and a [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

==Early life==
Born at British-held [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], Macomb was the son of [[Alexander Macomb (American merchant)|Alexander Macomb]] and Mary Catherine Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. H. Richards, [http://mlloyd.org/gen/macomb/text/richards.htm ''Memoir of Alexander Macomb''] (NY: M'Elrath, Bangs &amp; Co., 1833), 14. and at [https://archive.org/details/memoirofalexande01rich Internet archive.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Note that any reference to the father as Sr. or the son as Jr. is an anachronism, used in the interest of disambiguity, and in no way implies a designation the men themselves used, but here is used in the original Latin sense, ''i.e.,'' the elder, the younger.--&gt;

He moved with his parents to [[New York City]] and received a [[classics|classical education]] at [[Newark Academy]], in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/CG&amp;CSA/Macomb-A.htm |last1=Bell |first1=William Gardner |title=Commanding Generals and Chiefs of Staff, 1775–2005: Portraits &amp; Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Center of Military History]] U.S. Army |year=2006 |isbn=0-16-072376-0 |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
In 1798, the age of 16, Macomb joined a New York militia company. In January 1799, with the recommendation of [[Alexander Hamilton]] during the [[Quasi-War|French emergency]], he was commissioned a [[Cornet (military rank)|Cornet]] in the Regular Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; In March he was promoted to second lieutenant, and honorably discharged, June 1800.

In February 1801, he was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]], 2d Infantry, serving as secretary to a commission that treated with the Indians of the Southeast.

He was commissioned a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], which was established in 1802 at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] to constitute a military academy, thereby being one of the first officers to receive formal training there.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt;

He then spent five years in charge of coastal fortifications in the Carolinas and Georgia. He also established fortifications at [[Fort Gratiot, Michigan]], Chicago, Mackinaw, Prairie du Chien, St. Peter's, and St. Mary's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlloyd.org/gen/macomb/text/jenkins.htm|title=Jenkins, John S., ''Daring Deeds of American Generals''. &quot;Alexander Macomb&quot;, (New York: A. A. Kelley, Publisher.1856), pp. 295–322.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the War of 1812, in July 1812, then 30-year-old Macomb was promoted to [[colonel]] of the newly organised [[3rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment (United States)|3rd Artillery Regiment]].

==Command at the Battle of Plattsburgh==
He won acclaim during the [[War of 1812]] as [[brigadier general#United States|brigadier general]] in command of the frontier of northern [[New York (state)|New York]]. At the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]] on September 11, 1814, with only 1,500 regular troops and some detachments of militia, he was opposed by a British force of 10,531 men under Lieutenant General Sir [[George Prevost]]. Macomb's heavily outnumbered troops fell back before the British columns in a series of encounters as Prevost advanced towards the American defensive works. In the weeks leading up to the battle, Macomb, knowing full well he would be outnumbered heavily, worked with his men to move trees and create fake roads in order to obscure the genuine roads and lead the British into dead-end traps far from the three nearby American forts (a maneuver Macomb called [[abattis]]).&lt;ref&gt;General Macomb's report to the Secretary of War Sept 15, 1814&lt;/ref&gt; The British attack was diffused. Long narrow lines of marching soldiers were unable to easily stop and about-face. They became entangled in the narrow false road maze, and were sitting targets for the waiting Americans.  The British were about to launch an assault on the American defenses when the news came through of the defeat of the British naval squadron on [[Lake Champlain]]. Prevost needed the British Lake Champlain squadron to supply his planned advance into Vermont. Without it, he had no choice but to abandon the Expedition. The British invaders marched off back to Canada. Although Commodore [[Thomas Macdonough]]'s sailors and not the Army had been largely responsible for stopping the British invasion,{{citation needed|date=August 2008}} Macomb was nevertheless showered with praise and styled &quot;the Hero of Plattsburgh&quot; by some in the American [[News media|press]]. He was promoted [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] for his conduct at this battle, receiving both the thanks of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and a [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

==[[Commanding General of the United States Army]]==
When Major General [[Jacob Brown]], the U.S. Army’s commanding general, died in February 1828, Macomb was the senior [[Brigadier-General]] on the Army List, and President [[John Quincy Adams]] promoted him to substantive Major-General as was Macomb's right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iq8BAAAAYAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA51], The United States Army List, 1820&lt;/ref&gt; The Army's 2nd and 3rd-ranking Brigadier-Generals &amp;mdash; [[Winfield Scott]] and [[Edmund P. Gaines]] &amp;mdash; bitterly contested this. They denounced each other publicly and for months had been vying for the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; Their quarrels scandalized the Army and drove Adams to nominate Alexander Macomb, the [[Chief of Engineers]] (who by then had reverted to the rank of colonel), as the Army’s top general.

His last active service in a [[theater (warfare)|theater of war]] was in the [[Seminole War]] in Florida, in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iM4-JZuRAacC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=Thank+of+Congress+Alexander+Macomb&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ZVA34pNXft&amp;sig=8brIt1ZOVIZ0fouwPW0b3fPuCQg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result Brown, John Howard, ''The Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Comprising the Men and Women of the United States Who Have Been Identified with the Growth of the Nation V5'' (Published by Kessinger Publishing, 2006) 700 pages, Alexander Macomb, p. 305.] ISBN 1-4254-8629-0, ISBN 978-1-4254-8629-7,
&lt;/ref&gt;

Macomb’s tenure as Commanding General was marked by &quot;continuing uncertainty about the responsibilities and authority of his position. To secure his seniority over the other two-star brevet major generals, Macomb added a provision in the 1834 regulations that 'the insignia of the major general commanding in chief should be three stars.' In the same document he sought to define his relationship to the Secretary of War and establish his primacy over the bureau chiefs, including his successor as [[Chief of Engineers]]. This was easier said than done. Most issues were not fully resolved until early the next century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hq.usace.army.mil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/vignettes/vignette_14.htm|title=Army Corps of Engineers, Office of History, Alexander Macomb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He advocated doubling Army strength, increasing enlisted pay, providing relief for some widows and orphans, and regularizing the officer retirement and replacement system. In 1840 the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] adopted the castle uniform insignia and first described the Corps of Engineers’ distinctive ''[[Essayons]]'' (Motto: &quot;Let us try&quot;) button.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/vignettes/vignette_14.htm Army Corps of Engineers, Office of History, Alexander Macomb.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809 and 1841, Macomb was the author of a seminal book (republished in the 21st century) on the conduct of [[courts-martial]] and [[martial law]].&lt;ref&gt;Macomb, Alexander, ''A Treatise on Martial Law, and Courts-Martial''. (Charleston: J. Hoff, 1809), republished (New York: Lawbook Exchange, June 2007), ISBN 1-58477-709-5, ISBN 978-1-58477-709-0, 340 pages. [http://www.antiqbook.com/boox/law/44805.shtml Macomb on Martial Law and Courts Martial.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote a play on [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]]'s siege of Detroit, which features his maternal grandfather, Robert Navarre. ''See'' Published Works and Further Reading, ''infra''.

Macomb was the first of five Commanding Generals (Chiefs of Staff after the 1903 reorganization) who had held Engineer commissions early in their careers. All transferred to other branches before rising to the top. The others were [[George B. McClellan]], [[Henry W. Halleck]], [[Douglas MacArthur]], and [[Maxwell D. Taylor]].

==Historical recognition==
Alexander Macomb is recognized in a Michigan Historical Marker that is situated at the corner of [[Gratiot Avenue]] and Macomb Street in [[Mount Clemens, Michigan]]. It is Registered Site S0418, erected in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michmarkers.com/default.asp|title=Michigan Historical Markers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
Alexander Macomb
In 1818 Territorial Governor [[Lewis Cass]] proclaimed the third Michigan county to be called Macomb. At that time the young General was Commander of the Fifth Military Department in Detroit. Born in that city in 1782, son of prominent local entrepreneurs, Macomb had entered the U.S. Army in 1799. He had gained national renown and honor during the War of 1812 for his victory at Plattsburgh in September 1814 over a far superior force of British invaders. Later as Chief Army Engineer he promoted the building of military roads in the Great Lakes area. From May 1828 to his death in June 1841, Macomb served as Commander in Chief of the Army. He is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington D.C. His birthday, April 3, is honored as Macomb County Heritage Day.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is recognized in several statues. One was sculpted by [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]] and erected in 1906 in downtown Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://detroit1701.org/MacombStatue.htm Alexander Macomb statue, Detroit.] [http://www.mlloyd.org/Gen/macomb/text/amstatue.html Photos of Macomb Statue.] [http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=165&amp;CFID=11907902&amp;CFTOKEN=64295350 ''The Detroit News'', The Monuments of Detroit.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430082132/http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=165&amp;CFID=11907902&amp;CFTOKEN=64295350 |date=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This statue was made from melted down cannons, and was a notable and monumental task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detroithistorical.com/collections/vewebsite2/exhibit3/e30012a.htm|title=Detroit Historical Society, Monuments and Sculptures in Detroit, Alexander Macomb statue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is in downtown [[Mount Clemens, Michigan]] in front of the Circuit Court building at 40 N.

[[File:Macomb grave CC.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Grave in the [[Congressional Cemetery]]]]
Macomb died while in office at [[Washington, D.C.]] He was originally buried at the [[Presbyterian Burying Ground]], but in 1850 his remains were disinterred and he was reburied at [[Congressional Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ShockingRuin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=All In Shocking Ruin|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 14, 1901|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoricGravesof&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic Graves of Arlington|newspaper=[[Washington Evening Star]]|date=September 24, 1905|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains, and those of his wife, Catherine, were disinterred again in June, 2008 so that the brick-lined burial vault beneath their 6&amp;nbsp;ton, 13-foot-tall marble monument could be repaired to prevent its impending collapse. During the month it took to make the necessary repairs, the couple's remains were kept at the [[Smithsonian]] and were viewed by several of the general's descendants including his great-great-great granddaughter. After the $24,000 repairs were completed by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]], their remains were re-interred on July 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Shepardson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Macomb's remains at rest again |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080718/METRO/80718&lt;0343/1014/rss03 |work= |publisher=''[[Detroit News]]'' |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/17/AR2008071702667.html Ruane, Michael, &quot;After 167 Years, Second Funeral for General Remains of War Hero and His Wife Were Exhumed to Fix Monument Atop Grave&quot;], ''[[Washington Post]]'', including slide show of second funeral.&lt;/ref&gt; The monument to Alexander Macomb is &quot;one of the most unusual in the nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Meyers |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Battle of Plattsburgh military leader re-buried in Washington|url= http://www.pressrepublican.com/homepage/local_story_201000117.html|work= |publisher=''[[Press Republican]]'' |date=2008-07-19 |accessdate=2008-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
