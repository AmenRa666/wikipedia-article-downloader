'''Diarmait mac Máel na mBó''' (died 7 February 1072) was [[King of Leinster]], as well as [[High King of Ireland]] (with opposition).&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. &amp; trans.), Lebor Gabála Érenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956. Pages 407 &amp; 413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation (1892), by [[John O'Hart]], - Volume: 1, pg.555, it says, quote; &quot;No.110 Diarmuid; second son of Donoch Maol-na-mBo; was the 47th Christian King of Leinster, and the 177th Milesian Monarch of Ireland; was slain on the 23rd Feb., 1072, at Odhba, near Navan; m. Darbhforgal (d. 1080), grand-daughter of the Monarch Brian Boromha.&quot; Internet Archive direct link; https://archive.org/stream/irishpedigreesor_01ohar#page/555/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the most important and significant kings in Ireland in the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|pre-Norman era]]. His influence extended beyond the island of Ireland into the [[Hebrides]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Wales]], and even into England.

==Background==
&lt;!--map[s]--&gt;
Diarmait belonged to the [[Uí Cheinnselaig]], a kin group of south-east [[Leinster]] centred on [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]]. His father, Donnchad mac Diarmata, became known more commonly by the [[epithet]] Máel na mBó (&quot;[[Baldness|Baldy]] of the Cattle&quot;), whence Diarmait's [[patronym]]. The last of Diarmait's ancestors to have been counted as king of all Leinster, [[Crimthann mac Énnai]], died in the late 5th century; but Diarmait's more immediate forebears, most recently his great-grandfather Domnall mac Cellaig (died 974), had been counted among the kings of the Uí Cheinnselaig. Diarmait's mother was Aife, daughter of [[Gilla Pátraic mac Donnchada]], [[king of Osraige]]. He had at least one sibling, a brother named Domnall whose son [[Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair]] later became king of Leinster.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, &quot;Diarmait&quot;; Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', pp. 271&amp;ndash;272 &amp; 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uí Cheinnselaig had been prominent in earlier times, but their power had been broken at the battle of ''Áth Senaig'' in 738. The rival [[Uí Dúnlainge]], based in northern Leinster around [[Naas]] and [[Kildare]], who also enjoyed the support of the powerful [[Clann Cholmáin]] [[kings of Mide]], dominated Leinster until the time of [[Brian Bóruma]]. The decline of Clann Cholmáin, and the defeat inflicted on the Uí Dúnlainge, led by [[Máel Mórda mac Murchada]], at the [[battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, changed the political landscape to favour the Uí Cheinnselaig once more.&lt;ref&gt;
Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', pp. 271&amp;ndash;272 &amp; 290; Hudson, ''Viking Pirates'', pp. 137&amp;ndash;142; etc
&lt;/ref&gt;

The return of the [[Vikings]] to Ireland in the early 10th century occasioned the development of new towns on the coasts. The towns, centres of trade and manufacture, would give significant political power to those who could control their wealth. Kings of Leinster found themselves in a particularly advantageous position to exploit this new wealth as three of the five principal towns lay in or near Leinster. In Leinster proper, in the south-eastern corner dominated by the Uí Cheinnselaig, lay [[Wexford]]. To the west of this, in the smaller [[kingdom of Osraige]], which had been attached to Leinster since the late 10th century, was [[Waterford]]. Finally, the most important Viking town in Ireland, [[Dublin]], lay at the north-eastern edge of Leinster. Compared to this, kings in the north and west of Ireland had easy access to no towns, while those in the south, in [[Munster]], had access to two: [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on the south coast and [[Limerick]] on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;DOC, EMI; Hudson, VP; and?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He made an alliance with [[Niall mac Eochada]], [[king of Ulaid]], which helped to put pressure both from the north and south on the kingdoms of [[Mide]], [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] and [[Dublin]] — ruled by the High King.&lt;ref&gt;N.B.: DOC, EMI, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1042 he was able to claim the title &quot;King of Leinster&quot; and install his son, [[Murchad mac Diarmata|Murchad]], as [[King of Dublin]]. Thus ruler of two of the most powerful and wealthy towns on the island, he was able to make a bid for the High-Kingship. It was during a battle against the king of Mide, [[Conchobar Ua Maelsechalinn]], that he was killed, near to [[Navan]]. [[County Meath]], on 7 February 1072.&lt;ref name=&quot;afm-m1072-3&quot;&gt;Annals of the Four Masters, M1072.3; http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005B/text017.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving sons of King [[Harold Godwinson]] of England escaped to Leinster after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066 where they were hosted by Diarmait. In 1068 and 1069 Diarmait lent them the fleet of [[Dublin]] for their attempted invasions of England.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

He is also famous as the ancestor of [[Diarmait MacMurrough]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis John Byrne]], Irish Kings and High-Kings. 2nd edition, Dublin: [[Four Courts Press]], 2001, page 290. ISBN 978-1-85182-196-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation (1892), by [[John O'Hart]], - Volume: 1, pages.555 &amp; 556 Internet Archive direct link; https://archive.org/stream/irishpedigreesor_01ohar#page/555/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diarmait's Death in the Annals of the Four Masters==
''&quot;Diarmaid, son of Mael-na-mbo, King of Leinster, of the foreigners of Ath-cliath, and of Leath-Mogha-Nuadhat, was slain and beheaded in the battle of Odhbha, on Tuesday, the seventh of the Ides of February, the battle having been gained over him by Conchobhar O'Maeleachlainn, King of Meath. There were also slain many hundreds of the foreigners and Leinstermen, along with Diarmaid, in that battle. In it was killed Gillaphadraig O'Fearghaile, lord of the [[Fortuatha]], &amp;c. Of the death of Diarmaid was said:&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;afm-m1072-3&quot;/&gt;

: Two, seven times ten above one thousand,
: From the birth of Christ is reckoned,
: To this year, in which Diarmaid,
: First man in Leinster, fell.
: Diarmaid, of the ruddy-coloured aspect,
: A king who maintained the standard of war,
: Whose death brought scarcity of peace,
: The loss of the heroes of Ladhrann, with their ships.
: Comely youths were cut down there,
: Together with the head of Claire and Cualann.
: It caused in the breeze an unpleasant noise,
: The loss of the King of Riada of great valour.
: Until at Muillenn-Chul was slain
: A brave chieftain of a strong fortress,
: Until the furious fire-brand fell by treachery,
: They found no hero who dared with him contend.
: It is a red wound through my firm heart;
: For the host from Caindruim it was not just
: To destroy our noble chief they had no right,
: It has quenched their spirit greatly,
: Diarmaid of the laughing teeth under violent sorrow;
: There is not on account of his death banquet or feast;
: There will not be peace, there will not be armistice.
