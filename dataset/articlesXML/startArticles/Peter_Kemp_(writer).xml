'''Peter Mant MacIntyre Kemp''' ([[Bombay]], 19 August 1913 â€“ [[London]], 30 October 1993), known as '''Peter Kemp''', was an [[English people|English]] soldier and writer. The son of a [[judge]] in [[British India]], Kemp was educated at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] and proceeded to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he studied [[classics]] and [[law]]. He became notable for his participation in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and during [[World War II]] as a member of the [[Special Operations Executive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent Obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-peter-kemp-1501984.html|title=Obituary: Peter Kemp|last=Foot|first=M. R. D.| authorlink = M. R. D. Foot|date=4 November 1993|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish Civil War==

As a staunch [[Conservatism|Conservative]] and [[Monarchism|Monarchist]], he was alarmed by the rise of [[Communism]] and in November 1936, shortly after the end of the [[Siege of Alcazar]], broke off from reading for the bar and travelled to [[Spain]] where he joined a [[Carlism|Carlist]] unit under the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]]. He was given journalistic cover for entry into Spain by [[Collin Brooks]], then editor of the ''[[Sunday Dispatch]]'', &quot;to collect news and transmit articles for the ''Sunday Dispatch'' from the Spanish Fronts of War.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Mine Were of Trouble|last = Kemp|first = Peter| publisher = [[Cassell &amp; Company]]| year = 1957|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to the [[Spanish Legion]] where, in a rare distinction for a non-Spaniard, he commanded a platoon. Kemp was often badgered by his Spanish comrades about whether he was a [[freemasonry|freemason]] due to his [[protestantism|protestant]] background.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5383218.stm|title=The other volunteers|last=Keene|first=Judith (''Fighting for Franco'')|date=27 September 2006|work=[[BBC News]] UK Magazine|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wounded several times, he continued fighting until he suffered a shattered jaw and badly damaged hands in the summer of 1938 - the result of a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] bomb, and was repatriated to [[England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent Obituary&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Having barely recovered from his jaw injury Kemp had a chance meeting with Sir [[Douglas Dodds-Parker]], the head of MIR- which  was a small department of the [[War Office]] and a precursor to the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Becoming one of the earliest pupils at the Combined Operations Training School, he sailed in the hold of {{HMS|Fidelity}} to [[Gibraltar]] and took part in a mission to pursue a German [[U-boat]]. A British [[Destroyer]] fired at the [[submarine]] carrying Kemp by mistake and the mission was abandoned. With further [[parachute]] and commando training he went on several cross-channel raids into [[Occupied France]] and was then posted to [[Albania]], where he spent 10 months in clandestine operations. A mission in [[Poland]] resulted in capture by the [[Red Army]]. Released after three weeks in prison, he spent two further months in [[Moscow]] awaiting an exit visa before being posted to [[Siam]] in the summer of 1945, where he ran guns to the [[French people|French]] across the border in [[Laos]]. [[Tuberculosis]] forced his retirement from the [[British Army|Army]] once the war had ended.

==Later life==

Post-war Kemp sold insurance policies and turned to writing. As a correspondent for ''[[The Tablet]]'' he travelled to [[Hungary]] to report on the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and helped some students escape to [[Austria]]. He was present in the [[Belgian Congo]] during the troubles that led to independence as [[Zaire]], and also covered revolutions in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] as the foreign correspondent for [[The Spectator]]. His first book ''Mine Were of Trouble'' described his experiences in the Spanish Civil War,  ''No Colours or Crest'' his wartime experiences in Albania and Poland  as a [[Special Operations Executive]] agent, and ''Alms for Oblivion'' his post-war experiences in [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]]. Before his death he produced an [[autobiography]] in 1990 called ''The Thorns of Memory''.
