==Deployment==
In the deployment section in mentions that none of the Yamato class battleships or Bismarck ever engaged an enemy battleship. This is untrue - the Bismarck engaged the battlecruiser HMS Hood and the battleship HMS Prince of Wales in the battle of Denmark Strait, sinking the Hood. [[User:Korandder|Korandder]] 09:24, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
*The wording is broken into two sentences. The &quot;Neither&quot; refers only to ''Mushashi'' and ''Yamato''. --[[User:Durin|Durin]] 12:11, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
Durin, thanks for the clarification on the wording. I wrote the deployment section a while back and never meant to imply that the Bismarck never engaged enemy battleships, only the Yamato and Musashi. Glad you saw that. [[User:SWO1975]]

== Contradiction ==

From the info box....
 Trial displacement of 68,200 British tons (69,294 tonnes) 
 Standard displacement of 64,000 British tons (65,027 tonnes)
 Maximum displacement of 72,000 British tons (72,820 tonnes)
The tons to tonnes conversion is clearly not consistent but I have no idea which of the figures are incorrect! Can someone with access to an accurate source tidy that up please. --[[User:LiamE|LiamE]] 22:57, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

== Number of 6.1&quot; guns? ==

One of the pictures they have for the yamato show's it with only 6 of it's 6.1&quot; guns. Did they took some out to put more AA guns? If so someone post a reply to this question.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.213.65.197|74.213.65.197]] ([[User talk:74.213.65.197|talk]]) 22:02, 15 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The text says &quot;In 1944, Yamato—the sole remaining member of the class—underwent significant anti-aircraft upgrades, with the configuration of secondary armament changed to six 6.1-inch (15 cm) guns,[55] ... in preparation for operations in Leyte Gulf.[56]&quot; Yamato was not &quot;the sole remaining member of the class&quot; UNTIL Leyte Gulf (October 1944) since Musashi was sunk in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea that was part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. An aerial photo of Yamato under attack during that battle already shows only two (fore and aft) 6.1&quot; turrets. The question is, was Musashi similarly upgraded before Leyte? Also, 6.1&quot; is equal to c. 155 mm (15.5 cm), not 150mm/15cm (which is usually referred to as 5.9&quot;).--[[User:Death Bredon|Death Bredon]] ([[User talk:Death Bredon|talk]]) 09:48, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

== Doctrines &amp; tactics ==

Sorry, I missed the A-class review of this. A few things strike me:
*Talking about the background to the ships. What about the 'out-ranging' concept?

Today, we military maniacs in Japan conclude that Yamato was not built for 'out-ranging', nor IJN did not intend it. Because (1)Yamato's armour was designed for main battle range as 20000m-30000m. Over 28000m far, 16in SHS would become critical for Yamato(though thay did not know SHS), and over 32000m, normal 16in shell also critical. (2)it was very dificult to hit enemy battleship over 30000m far and out-ranging was not effective.

*Is it worth pointing out that not only were they bigger than any other battleship, they were bigger than any other battleship the US could even theoretically design?
::You are referring to the fact that the US Navy was limited to ships with a beam no larger than 108 feet to allow the ships to cross through the Panama canal, thus it was thought the US would not build ships with guns of greater caliber than 16 inches.   In a battleship dominated naval war, Japan could potentially take an advantage by having 18 inch gunned battleships, with the later, larger 20 inch gunned battleships built in the mid to late forties, with the Yamato class upgraded to 20 inch guns in twin mount turrets.  For the US to counter they would have to build ships that would not fit through the canal.  I believe that is correct and I think it would be worth noting in the piece, but I do not have a solid reference to support it.[[User:Gunbirddriver|Gunbirddriver]] ([[User talk:Gunbirddriver|talk]]) 07:49, 11 March 2011 (UTC)
:::The new [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po0mht6LcwA [[History Channel]] video] discusses this  at 21'35&quot; - 22'25&quot;. --[[User:Eliyahu S|Eliyahu S]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Eliyahu S|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:03, 14 August 2012 (UTC)

*Is the symbolism of the names mentioned anywhere?

Yamato was the old name of Nara prefecture, and it was old name of Japan also. So Yamato was somewhat symbol of Japanese navy for soldiers. But Yamato class was the militaly secret, so people in Japan believed Nagato class was the strongest for the entire war period.

*There is very little information about why the ships were used as they were. What was their role and how did their deployment fulfill it?

Yamato class battleships was expected to form 1st (main-battleship)squadron with Nagato class battleships. IJN was afraid of numerical inferiority of battleships, so they could not use Yamato on minor battles. Yamatos ware only for decisive battles! Kongo class was expected for advanced guard with cruisers and destroyers, so IJN can use them on minor battles.
Fuel was not so big problem, Yamato's consumption ratio was larger than Kongo indeed, but its battle ability is far more than Kongo, so Yamato was economical over all. But night of solomon strait was not proper area for Yamato, since 14 inches shells and torpedoes would become critical threat on very close fight even for Yamato.

*Armour - how was armour distributed? How much protection did it actually provide? What was the quality of the steel used?

J.F.Dunnigan says that Class A armour of Iowa was equivalent to about 25% more thickness in terms of armour of Yamato. But we military maniacs in Japan think that VH armour of Yamato was same quality as class A, or at least only 10% inferior to class A.(mainly refence to &quot;ZOKU KAIGUN-SEIKOU-MONOGATARI(A continued Story of R&amp;D of Steel at the Navy)&quot; by Kazuo Horikawa)

*Armament - the 'underwater shots' idea should probably be mentioned.
I strongly recommend ''Kaigun'' by Evans &amp; Peattie as a valuable book for the bilbiography. Regards, [[User:The Land|The Land]] ([[User talk:The Land|talk]]) 20:05, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

== Thinking towards FA nomination ==

Perhaps it would be a good idea if people thought about changes that need to be made to the article before it can be nominated as a FA? If people are stuck perhaps looking at [[Montana class battleship]] and [[Iowa class battleship]] might be helpful given they're both FA. [[User:John Smith&amp;#39;s|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] ([[User talk:John Smith&amp;#39;s|talk]]) 20:13, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:The problem with comparing those articles to this one is the large amount of information that was kept by the U.S. on those ships and the length the ''Iowa''-class have been around...also, the Japanese destroyed most of the info about the ''Yamato''-class in the aftermath of the Second World War. —'''&lt;font face=&quot;Script MT Bold&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed &lt;font color=&quot;00008B&quot;&gt;17]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font face&gt;''' 20:23, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

==aircraft==

The Yamato class had below decks hanger space for five aircraft, and carried two catapults on the fantail. That implies the Yamato class could carry up to seven aircraft, enough to put up a reasonable size combat air patrol. Most American battleships had two catapults (no below decks hanger space) and deployed two or at most three floatplanes for scouting purposes. Does anyone have authoritive sources on the actual and theoretical employment of aircraft by the Yamato class? [[User:Naaman Brown|Naaman Brown]] ([[User talk:Naaman Brown|talk]]) 20:14, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:I will look at my sources on Friday and see if anything materializes. [[User:TomStar81|TomStar81]] ([[User talk:TomStar81|Talk]]) 02:32, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
::First, this is a great article and I love it. How did they land those planes, anyone? If they had floaters they should be very clumsy as fighter planes and my theory is that those where rather used for intelligence and/or directing artillery fire. --[[User:Malin Tokyo|Malin Randstrom]] ([[User talk:Malin Tokyo|talk]]) 04:49, 10 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Yeah, they were more recon/spotter planes - in the [[Battle off Samar]], her float-planes confirmed her hits on enemy ships. They would have also done occasional sub patrol likely. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 04:52, 10 February 2009 (UTC)
::::Just confirming what Cam said.  Kaigun doctrine was to use cruiser and battleship floatplanes for scouting and recon so that the carrier bombers and torpedo planes could be reserved completely for strike missions.  For example, at the [[Battle of Midway]] one of the reasons that the US carriers were sighted so late was because of mechanical problems with the cruiser or battleship floatplane assigned to that scouting patrol leg.  In night actions, such as at the [[Battle of Savo Island]], cruiser or battleship floatplanes were to drop flares over the enemy ships. [[User:Cla68|Cla68]] ([[User talk:Cla68|talk]]) 05:31, 10 February 2009 (UTC)
why is there not any information about the planes on the main page?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.206.22.245|76.206.22.245]] ([[User talk:76.206.22.245|talk]]) 04:58, 17 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Pre-FAC copyedit and comments ==

I've been working on a copyedit of the article before an eventual FAC nomination and have found several items that should be considered before the nomination is advanced:
=== Lead ===
* The ships are referred to as 72,800 metric tons at full load, which doesn't match what's in the infobox. Also, given that the infobox uses long tons first (with a metric ton conversion), it would be better to have the lead match the units and conversion, as well as the amounts.
::Fixed, went back through my books, the figure in the infobox is accurate.
* The guns fired a projectile in pounds up to a distance in kilometers: should probably have either kg &amp; km &lt;small&gt;OR&lt;/small&gt; lbs &amp; nmi.
::Fixed. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
=== Design ===
* Paragraph 1 (P1): first paragraph is uncited
::It's just sort of giving an introduction to what's going to be said throughout the next paragraphs, so I'm not entirely sure it needs them. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
* P2: Not sure of the significance of note A1 to this article, other than to contradict(?) the statement in the body of the article. If the details of ''Yamishiro'' and ''Fuso'' are relevant to ''this'' article, that relevance needs to be made more clear; if ''Yamishiro'' was not &quot;reconstructed or significantly modernized&quot;, the body text should read {{xt| Although most of Japan's battleships built prior to the ''Yamato'' class…}}
::Removed the note. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
* P2, Last sentence (S): I'm guessing that even though other countries were treaty-bound to ''not'' build larger vessels, they were, nonetheless, ''capable'' of building them. The conclusion of the sentence should probably be reworded to something along the lines of {{xt|… and free to build larger warships than the other major maritime powers.}}
::Fixed. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
* P3: There's a mixture of &quot;US&quot;, &quot;U.S.&quot;, and &quot;United States&quot;—choose one abbreviation or the other; there's really not a need to spell out &quot;United States&quot; either
::Fixed. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
* P4, S2: Is the figure in &quot;tons&quot; metric tons or long tons? When it's determined, it also needs a conversion
::Fixed. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
* P4, S2: Logically this sentence doesn't work for me. At design time, there was no way of knowing that these would be the largest ''ever'' built; ''yet'' built, certainly. Since they did turn out to be the largest ever built, I think the conclusion of the sentence should be broken out onto its own.
::Though even with the proposed ''Montana'' design of 1945, they were still the largest ever constructed. Nevertheless, I have fixed it. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
=== Ships, ''Shinano'' ===
* As with P4 of &quot;Design&quot;, the &quot;ton&quot; figures should be disambiguated and converted
* I see farther up on the talk page there was a name associated with the fourth hull. Since construction on ''Hii'' apparently began, this article would be the appropriate place to discuss its particulars, however limited they may be.
::The difficulty is that - other than up this talk page - I've never seen a fourth and fifth ship names mentioned. I'll ask Cla68 if he's got anything on them. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
=== Aspects of the ''Yamato'' class ===
* What is the reason for the separation of this section from &quot;Design&quot;? The subsections all seem to be ''design'' aspects…
::I'm modelling the page primarily off of [[Iowa class battleship]], and it has separate subsections for its armament, armour and propulsion and radar systems after the ones on the ships, and I simply couldn't figure out any other term to describe them than 'aspects'. [[User:Climie.ca|Cam]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Climie.ca|Chat]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
=== Armament ===
* P1: Is there any way to indicate the largest-ever-gun bit without using two different meanings of ''caliber'' in the same sentence?
* P1, n A3: I copyedited this note, but fail to see the significance here of the shell's possible nickname
* P2: Gun sizes here are given in inches first, but in the infobox as centimeters first.
=== Propulsion ===
* Can you check the source for the phrase &quot;installed horsepower&quot;? Should that be &quot;''indicated'' horsepower&quot; or is it a unit I'm unfamiliar with?
=== Proposed ''Super Yamato'' class battleships ===
* Significance to ''this'' article: any other than the name?
=== Cultural significance ===
* Any examples of ''Yamato''{{'}}s appearance in popular culture? Not that this should be a trivia section, but listing a typical mention might help the reader understand the point a little better.

== Is this worth including? ==

According to the ''Washington Post'', ''Jane's Fighting Ships'' first listed the Yamato and the Musashi in 1944, and a gave them a displacement of 45,000 tons each.  Another interesting example of how wrong the West was.  Is it worth including?  See: {{cite news|title = U.S. Navy Outnumbers Jap 10 to 1 | first = Richard | last = Tobin | work = The Washington Post | date = October 1, 1944 | page = B1}}  This same claim seems to have been widely reported in the American media.

== Suggested Link for addition to the Yamato Class Battleships Wiki Page ==

Hello.  I am new to Wiki and a caveman vis-a-vis understanding all the software, but MBK004 has just been kind enough to send me a note of suggestion, so - here I go:

I am an amateur historian, retired military officer, Phi Beta Kappa.  I have created the web's only comprehensive archive photo gallery (photos in public domain) of the Battleships Yamato and Musashi.  Dozens of Musashi/Yamato battle photos from Leyte, Samar and Okinawa taken by USN planes, too. The site does not spam, sell, advertise or benefit me in any way shape or form.

Under Wiki's policy I can't place a link to the site on the Yamato page myself (since I am the site's author and admin so-to-speak), but I invite other readers to peruse the site and decide whether they think it might be of use as an external link to this page.  

Here is the address to the site: http://webspace.webring.com/people/kb/bucketfoot_al/

Do let me know your thoughts.

Thank you.

Forgive me - establish that archive military photos that have appeared in (mostly) Japanese books and other obscure publication, and have nearly all been gotten from the National Archives are in the public domain?  Listen, I have ONE life to live, and in THAT one I don't have enough time to do the basics - like moving to DC and spending the next 3 years trying to satisfy such inane requests (unless someone is willing to fund me).  

I don't mean to be flippant, but it is OBVIOUS that these archive photos, all 64-70 years old, are in the public domain and since they are being used for purely educational purposes, that should alleviate any possible restrictions which would deal with commercial use (if they would even be applicable).  Back on topic, I won't argue with y'all any more, you have your sandbox here and far be it for an old crotchety geezer like me to try to discourse with kids half my age who can make me go 'poof' with a click of the button.

If you are interested for me to upload any of these photos, then please have it cleared with the powers that be, so that I do not go through the trouble only to have someone - or something mechanical - automatically delete them.  Can any of you perform that inquiry?  If the answer is yes, and permission is granted, then kindly point me to the uploading instructions (which I dearly hope are very simple instructions for loading the pictures - you gotta remember my IQ is only 139 and I am only the graduate of the #15 law school in this country, so I am a little slow on the uptake.)

*Sarcasm off*.  Yes, I am a curmudgeon, and yes, I am having a very bad day totally unrelated to this board - but I have no desire to make this my 5th job.  I am glad that some of you have recognized the uniqueness and value of my labor of love for the history of the Yamato - and if I can plug it into WIKI under the rules, I'd like to.  But I'm gonna need help (as asked above, albeit tongue-in cheek).

P.S.  If you are offended by my tone instead of finding this post humorous, remember that my sense of humor is quite idiosyncratic and anyone who knows me would get a chuckle reading the above, knowing the proper context.  Think of a frustrated Will Ferrell, or better yet, Steve Martin character - from his early days in the 1970s-80s of course....

Thanks Ed!  Great info!  All of the Aerial photos fit under the USN Gov't definition you linked - and the Japanese photos (few as they are) all fell into the hands of the US military at the end of WW2 and were likely sourced from there as well for the sources (books) I got them from.  I am amazed, given that the Japanese have literally scoured the US National Archives for every photo of the Yamato and Musashi (and all of the photos on my web site are available in various Japanese books on the two ships), that the Japanese language version of the WIKI Yam site is so poorly supplied with photos.

Now a question for you:  Assuming we can get past the legalese (which does not appear to be the problem as I believe every archive photo on my site came from US sources (either taken by USN personnel or taken from Japanese records by the US after the war), would you recommend uploading all of the photos or just a few representative ones?  I have no problem going either way, and since I moved my site to a provider that gives me a lot more webspace, I am going to go back eventually and 'uncrop' some of the aerial bombing shots (without shrinking them) in order to show more detail - this will be particularly beneficial vis-a-vis some of the high altitude Sho-Go bombing/torpedo shots of the Musashi.

Let me know.  Thanks!

== &quot;Largest, heaviest and most heavily-armed...&quot; ==

But what is &quot;largest&quot; supposed to mean if it doesn't mean &quot;heaviest?&quot; The ''Yamatos'' ''weren't'' larger than the ''Iowas'' in terms of length, after all, they were slightly shorter.

== Deck armor thickness? ==

The claim in the text is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Deck armour—75 millimetres (3.0 in) thick—was composed of a nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy. Ballistics tests at the proving ground at Kamegabuki demonstrated the deck alloy to be superior to the homogeneous Vickers plates by 10–15%
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet this is in apparent direct conflict with the data in the sidebar of deck armor being 8-9 inches - which is the true thickness?

If some parts are 8-9 inches, and other parts are only 3 inches, then both the claim in the text and the sidebar need to be clarified.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Gregory JH|Gregory JH]] ([[User talk:Gregory JH|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gregory JH|contribs]]) 08:29, 19 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Secret intimidation? ==

Japan went to great lengths to hide the size of the ship and its guns, wanting enemies to think the ship carried 16 inch guns. This was successful; Americans didn’t learn how big the ships and their guns were until the end of the war. How does one reconcile this with the intent to intimidate as stated: &quot;Many in Japan's Naval and Military Command also hoped these vessels would intimidate the United States into acquiescing to Japanese actions in the Pacific.&quot;

I propose to remove the quote unless I soon see a reasonable explanation about how Japan expected to intimidate with ships whose true capabilities were being hidden or even deliberately downplayed. Elsewhere in this same article it is made clear that Americans still thought the ships had 16 inch guns months after Yamato was sunk. It seems to me that Japan was trying to do whatever is the opposite of intimidation.

==The Most Powerful Battleship Ever Built==
The contributors deleting properly referenced sources in the case of reputable published authors, in this particular case Jentschura p. 39 quote, &quot;were the largest and most powerful battleships ever built&quot; are just about saying the same as Jentschura's quotation with their &quot;heaviest and most powerfully armed...&quot;  So its somewhat difficult to understand why the contributor(s) is (are) creating what Wiki calls an editorial war by continuously deleting properly referenced sources.  Wiki policy is the preference of properly referenced material and not POVs (Personal Point of Views).

The contributors &quot;heaviest and most powerfully armed...&quot; verses the published source's &quot;were the largest and most powerful battleships ever built&quot; basically state the same thing.  So whats this editors war all about?  The published author's quoted reference is simply a partial cumulative collection of the Yamato classes size, armament, engine power, speed, and fire control optics, among other aspects, that together created the &quot;largest and most powerful battleships ever built.&quot;
Another words the published source and the &quot;warring editors&quot; are saying the same thing!  But the Jentschura is a published reference and the contributor is not (in this case).  Wikipedia's policy is that they prefer published sources whenever practical.

&quot;If&quot; by chance the contributors that delete the referenced material and refer to insert their personal descriptions (heaviest and most powerfully armed) then that wording can also have a double meaning.  It could mean that the Yamato class battleships were the heaviest and most powerfully armed but were not the most powerful battleships ever built.  Which most probably stands the best reason for the constant deletion of referenced sources.  As it appears to be a lot within the past few weeks.  The involved contributors most likely have another battleship in mind as the most &quot;powerful battleship ever built.&quot;

&quot;If&quot; this is the case then that argument will have no ending as no battleship during WWII or WWI for that matter ever sunk another battleship during a ONE on ONE sea engagement:
1.  The only one that comes close was the [[USS Washington]] blasting the IJN [[Kirshima]] to a wreck.  But thats only because Washington sneaked up on the Kirshima while she was blasting the battleship [[USS South Dakota]] to a wreck.
2.  Bismarck was disabled by obsolete WWI style aircraft launched from [[aircraft carriers]], and then she committed suicide (scuttled as proven by [[Dr. Ballard]] during his expedition in the latter 20th century).
3.  [[Graf Spee]] also committed suicide (scuttled).  But this was an 11&quot; gun battlecruiser, and not a battleship.  She had smaller armament than US Large Cruisers which were 12&quot; gunned.

In short, there is no reason for deleting properly sourced material.  The purpose is to allow readers to research the material themselves if they wish to challenge the Wikipedia Article.  By consistently removing properly referenced sources, the contributor(s) is (are) doing an injustice to both Wikipedia and the public who depend upon the Wikipedia Encyclopedia for properly written and reference information.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.88.54.218|70.88.54.218]] ([[User talk:70.88.54.218|talk]]) 18:51, 5 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I don’t really mean to take sides in this matter, but I did understand perfectly the objection to the word “largest” since large can mean different things. I’ll grant that when someone speaks of a large person he usually means a heavy person, but sometimes it means a tall person, just as a small person can be either light weight or a short person. Saying that the Yamato class was the heaviest is not open to dispute, if you say it is the largest, someone might point out that Iowa was longer. Yes, there are some people who might think that largest would mean longest. I also have at least a little objection to calling the Swordfish torpedo planes “world war I style.” True, they were biplanes with fabric covering and non retractable landing gear, but I would say that they would have outperformed World War I planes by a large margin, and were designed much closer to WWII than WWI. I would prefer to call the Swordfish an early thirties style plane.

:Well, thanks for attempting to bring this to a discussion.  I attempted to address it as well on the discussion page for the [[Talk:Japanese_battleship_Yamato#Super battle ships|''Yamato'']].  I've been watching this back and forth for some time and have been extremely disappointed in it, for the same reason that IP 70.88.54.218 points out, that the two versions are essentially saying the same thing, with a subtle semantic difference.  I agree with The Land  and IP 207.30.62.198 that the term largest could be disputed as meaning the longest, which I believe would go to the ''Iowa'' s, but the change to most powerfully armed seems appropriate, as the 460 mm guns were the largest bore naval rifles ever set afloat.  Thus I would prefer using the phrase &quot;heaviest and most powerfully armed&quot;.   As to the quote, I would leave it out, but use that reference as the supporting citation.  I think that would be the best version, but any version used thus far would be adequate to get the idea across that the Yamatos were intended to trump all other battleships at sea.  Regardless,  the issue should be discussed and not handled as it has been thus far.  The snubbing of the IP editors, whom you would hope would be encouraged to help advance the encyclopedia, has been poor form.

:Put simply the Jentschura quote is misleading and objectively false; the Yamatos were ''not'' the largest battleships ever built in every way (the Iowas were longer, I'm fairly sure Fuso was taller), they were only the largest by displacement.

:::Still, it says largest, not most largest. In terms of which dimension you think of a ship being &quot;large&quot; in it's usually length, and they weren't the longest. The ''Yamatos'' weren't the largest BBs in every dimension, so it makes sense to state the precise ''way'' in which they were special (they were heaviest). Like I said on the page for ''Yamato'', you could find any number of quotes which simply say [[The Pentagon]] is the largest office building in the world, but it would be misleading to use one of those quotes with a ref over simply being specific and saying it's the largest ''by floor area''. As another point, HMS ''Hood'' was only two feet shorter than ''Yamato'' but at deep load was over 20,000 tons lighter; expressing this would require saying what dimension the two ships were alike in. It would be very misleading to say either that one ship was substantially smaller than the other, or that the two ships were almost equally large.

I agree that quoting random historians without taking their full views into account is a bad idea. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 08:37, 15 August 2012 (UTC)

Regardless which book is quoted, it doesn't change the POV by the author and we won't use POV statements. There are enough statements or data available the Iowas were more powerful or at least a more balanced design (better protection/armor layout, more accurate and faster firing guns to name some. --[[User:Denniss|Denniss]] ([[User talk:Denniss|talk]]) 09:42, 15 August 2012 (UTC)


:Indeed, vast amounts has been written about which was the 'best' battleship design of World War II, and there are several credible contenders. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 10:35, 15 August 2012 (UTC)
::The other problem is these comparisons are always WW2 ''Iowa'' versus ''Yamato''. Unfortunately, Cold War ''Iowa'' was also a battleship that was constructed, and could carry 32 cruise missiles which could all have nuclear warheads if you felt like it, and 18 inch guns don't really beat the ability to destroy a medium-sized country. A match between an 80s ''Iowa'' and ''Yamato'' would just come down to if there was anything left of ''Yamato'' to sink after the first hit.

::Really, we should change the heading to be exact there too and say she mounted the largest primary guns by calibre rather than the most powerful armament. [[User:Herr Gruber|Herr Gruber]] ([[User talk:Herr Gruber|talk]]) 06:38, 16 August 2012 (UTC)

'''There still has not been an explanation for deleting reference books from the bibliograhy section.  Such as Richard Worths battleship book.  I've replaced it in the section.  Furthermore, a contributors referencing of quotes or other information from reliable books is not a POV.  An editors opinion of an author, such as Jentschura, would be a POV.  Secondly, would not historians or readers agree that an 18&quot; gun would be more powerful than a 16&quot;, 15&quot;, 14&quot; and so forth gun?  After all todays 120mm tank guns are considered far more powerful than WWII era 37mm, 45mm, 88mm, etc tank guns.  The caliber rule should also apply to battlehips.'''  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/12.71.45.70|12.71.45.70]] ([[User talk:12.71.45.70|talk]]) 19:35, 11 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::&quot;Powerful&quot; is a misleading and vague term that fails to explain in what specific way these ships were powerful. It could refer to main armament, overall armament, engine power, or any combination of those. At least once of those is demonstrably not true (''Yamato'' did not have the most powerful overall armament because the 80s ''Iowa'' refits could carry nuclear weapons), so the article should clearly state in what way the ''Yamato'' was remarkable.

If yamato or musashi had faced any of the US battleships, or even the any of the british batleships on a 1v1 basis, who would have won the battle?

== Yamato at the Battle of Leyte Gulf  ==

The Yamato did not escort carriers at the battle of Leyte Gulf. It was part of Kurita's &quot;Centre Force&quot;. The carriers were in the &quot;Northern Force&quot; commande by Ozawa. Captain S.W. Roskill War at Sea Volume 3 Part 2 page 211. [[User:Ken farrington|Ken farrington]] ([[User talk:Ken farrington|talk]]) 21:31, 5 August 2012 (UTC) Ken Farrington

== Discrepancies ==

I found some discrepancies from this article and an article [[Japanese battleship Yamato]].

The discrepancies are:

1. In the article Yamato-class battleship thickness of the thicker part of the armoured deck is 230 mm (9 in) but in the article Japanese battleship Yamato it is 226.5 mm (8.92 in)

2. both articles stand for information that Yamato had 162 25 mm AA-guns in spring 1944 onwards as her final maximum amount. But there is also mentions that amount of the guns was increased twice after spring, which was not possible if Yamato had her final AA-complement already in spring 1944. Featured picture http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yamato1945.png, http://www.combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm and German Wikipedia all stands for 152 AA-guns as maximum. German Wikipedia also informs that amount of the guns was 98 in spring 1944 and 113 in summer 1944. Over all there is only one reference for 162 guns mentioned in articles. Besides there is a foto, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yamato_hit_by_bomb.jpg, wich shows to them who are familiarize themselves with Yamato that there wasn't 162 guns at least in 1944.

3. Both articles inform that Yamato's 15.5 cm wing turrets were removed in 1943, but again http://www.combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm and German Wikipedia inform that they were not removed before 1944, at the same time when 127 mm guns were added.

4. In Yamato-class battleship it is mentioned that Yamatos's AA-armament was upgraded in March 1945. Reference of this information is http://www.combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm. A problem is that this website don't have the information.

::re 2, 162 guns is referenced to a reliable source so far as I can see. The German wikipedia article seems lacking in references and wikipedia articles are not reliable sources (so that calls into question your assertion in 3 as well. The removal of turrets is referenced to Garzke and Dulin who generally have a high reputation. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 14:02, 2 March 2013 (UTC)
::No 4 is as you say not in the text. I went back through a year of article history but didn't see how when it was added. Possibly a mis-interpretation or a rewrite of a sentence resulting in changed meaning. I have edited it to reflect the source. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 14:16, 2 March 2013 (UTC)
::No. 1 is the most serious issue - as you say one article gives 9 inches, the other 8.92 inches, but the source has 9.1 inches and doesn't explain the meaning of the 25% either. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 14:26, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

:::Garzke and Dulin is probably a good source, but it is also old. Forexample the wreck of Yamato was  discovered after publishing of the book. And if you compare fallowing photos, you will note, as I mentioned, that there wasn't 162 guns at least in 1944. The photos are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yamato_hit_by_bomb.jpg taken in late 1944 and http://www.designcowboys.net/Yamato/Images/superstructure.jpg taken in early 1945. In 1945 there is clearly larger amount of guns.--[[Special:Contributions/84.249.89.206|84.249.89.206]] ([[User talk:84.249.89.206|talk]]) 20:21, 2 March 2013 (UTC)
:::It is also good to note that all new scale models of yamato has ether 150 or 152 guns although models aren't probably reliable sources.--[[Special:Contributions/84.249.89.206|84.249.89.206]] ([[User talk:84.249.89.206|talk]]) 20:23, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

== &quot;The design of the ''Yamato''-class battleships was shaped by expansionist movements&quot; ==

This whole paragraph is problematic. The ''Yamatos'' were designed specifically to outclass the ''Iowas'', whose likely characteristics the Japanese made some very shrewd guesses about, based on the American requirement that capital ships be able to traverse the Panama Canal. This statement about &quot;expansionist movements&quot; is not wrong, but that's mostly because it's too vague and meandering to be wrong. --[[User:Yaush|Yaush]] ([[User talk:Yaush|talk]]) 15:04, 21 January 2015 (UTC)

== Orphaned references in [[:Yamato-class battleship]] ==

I check pages listed in [[:Category:Pages with incorrect ref formatting]] to try to fix reference errors. One of the things I do is look for content for [[User:AnomieBOT/docs/OrphanReferenceFixer|orphaned references]] in wikilinked articles. I have found content for some of [[:Yamato-class battleship]]'s orphans, the problem is that I found more than one version. I can't determine which (if any) is correct for ''this'' article, so I am asking for a sentient editor to look it over and copy the correct ref content into this article.

&lt;b&gt;Reference named &quot;c8&quot;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From [[Japanese battleship Musashi]]: Chesneau, p. 178&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From [[Nagato-class battleship]]: Campbell, p. 198&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I apologize if any of the above are effectively identical; I am just a simple computer program, so I can't determine whether minor differences are significant or not.
