'''Charles Fleury Bien-aimé Guilloû''' (July 14, 1813 – January 2, 1899) was an American military physician.  He served on a major exploring expedition that included both scientific discoveries and controversy, and two historic diplomatic missions. He ran a hospital in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], before returning to the US.

==Life==
Charles Fleury Bien-aimé Guilloû was born in [[Philadelphia]] on July 26, 1813.
His father was Victor Gabriel Guilloû (1776–1841), who had escaped from the [[French Revolution]] and fought in the [[Haitian Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;philly&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Thomas Scharf |author2=Thompson Westcott | title =History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EsOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA964 |year=1884 | publisher=LH Everts &amp; company |page=964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father introduced him to [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] when he [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|visited the US]] in 1824.&lt;ref name=&quot;grog&quot;/&gt;  Guilloû attended a military academy and then graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] medical school in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine | title =Univ. of Pennsylvania medical bulletin: October, 1888 to February, 1911 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cqfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA279 |date= February 1899 |publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press |volume= XII | page = 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1836, he visited his father, who had moved to [[Cuba]] to start a sugar plantation after running a dance academy in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=&quot;philly&quot;/&gt;

===Exploration===
[[File:USS Peacock in ice, 1840.jpg|thumb|alt=sailing ship with icebergs | ''Peacock'' stuck in Antarctic ice]]
On February 9, 1837, Guilloû was appointed assistant surgeon for the {{USS |Porpoise |1836 |6}} in the [[United States Navy]]. It was one of the ships sent on the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] commanded by [[Charles Wilkes]], although it was 1838 before the squadron could depart. After a dispute with [[Cadwalader Ringgold]], he was transferred to the {{USS |Peacock|1828 |6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] |title = Sea of Glory: America's Voyage of Discovery, The US Exploring Expedition, 1838–1842 | year = 2003 |isbn = 978-0-14-200483-8 | publisher = Penguin Books |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5sTHSXlv5XAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He befriended young midshipman [[William Reynolds (US Navy officer)|William Reynolds]], whose journals provide a non-official version of the events of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= [[William Reynolds (US Navy officer)|William Reynolds]] | author2=Nathaniel Philbrick |title=The private journal of William Reynolds: United States Exploring Expedition, 1838–1842 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5URrWfwP9jMC&amp;pg=PT267 |date = October 18, 2004 | publisher = Penguin | isbn=978-0-14-303905-1 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1839, the squadron headed farther south, and in January 1840 provided the first sighting of the continent of [[Antarctica]] by a US Navy ship. Guilloû provided a sketch when the ''Peacock'' was stuck in the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Herman J Viola | author2 = Carolyn Margolis | title = Magnificent voyagers: the US exploring expedition, 1838–1842 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCaAAAAAMAAJ |year=1985 | publisher= Smithsonian Institution Press |isbn= 978-0-87474-946-5 | page = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They returned to Sydney for repairs, before resuming exploration.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Wilkes' imperious manner included dismissing many of the officers, leading to further low morale. Guilloû  attended to sailors injured by frequent floggings. In September 1841 the squadron arrived in [[Honolulu]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] to spend the winter. The three-year planned time of the voyage was over, and several members requested to leave. Wilkes insisted on reading all journals and letters. When Guilloû removed some pages from his journal, saying they were of a personal nature, Wilkes suspended Guilloû and prepared charges for various offenses. After the ''Peacock'' was lost in July 1841 while exploring the [[Pacific Northwest]], Guilloû was shuttled between various ships, officially under arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=William Ragan Stanton |title= The great United States Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l770FoaLsxsC&amp;pg=PA219 |year=1975 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-02557-8 |pages= 144, 219, 284–286, 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return in 1842, Guilloû helped organize the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery under [[William P. C. Barton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;/&gt; He was sentenced to dismissal at the [[court-martial]] trials in 1843 related to the Wilkes expedition, but President [[John Tyler]] reduced the sentence to a year suspension.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Guilloû filed seven charges against Wilkes, including questioning his claim to have &quot;discovered&quot; Antarctica. Wilkes was found guilty of only one: illegal punishment. Wilkes was sentenced to a public reprimand.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Charles Wilkes |author2= Charles Fleury Guilloû |author3=United States Navy Court-martial |title=The following defence of Lieut. Charles Wilkes: to the charge which he has been tried |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXIjHQAACAAJ |year=1843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy===
After being reinstated, Guilloû served on the {{USS |Columbus |1819 |6}}, under Commodore [[James Biddle]].  In June 1845 the ship was sent to [[Guangzhou]] (then known as Canton), on a diplomatic mission with the first treaty between the US and China.&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;/&gt; It then visited Japan.  When returning via Honolulu, at the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]], the ''Columbus'' was recalled to [[Monterey, California]] and the ranch of [[William A. Richardson]]. Guilloû met [[John Sutter]], and spoke French with the Swiss native on July 4, 1847; a year later the discovery of gold near Sutter's mill would spark the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Ryal Miller |title=Captain Richardson: mariner, ranchero, and founder of San Francisco |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BTYSAQAAIAAJ |year=1995 |publisher=La Loma Press |page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 28, 1847 he was promoted to the rank of full Navy Surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of the executive proceedings of the Senate of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4SIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA271 |date= December 30, 1847 |page= 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Columbus'' returned to [[Hampton Roads]] in March 1848.  [[File:US Navy 101021-N-7642M-317 USS Constitution returns to her pier after an underway to celebrate her 213th launching day anniversary.jpg|thumb|alt=reconstructed sailing ship | {{USS |Constitution }} as restored]]

Guilloû was then assigned to the {{USS |Constitution }} which took another diplomatic trip, this one to Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} On July 30, 1849, while at [[Gaeta]], the multilingual Guilloû acted as interpreter for a visit to the palace of [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]] by local diplomat John Rowan. They also met Cardinal [[Giacomo Antonelli]], who was [[Cardinal Secretary of State|secretary of state]] for the [[Papal States]].  On July 31 they visited [[Pope Pius IX]], and invited him and Ferdinand to visit the ship, with Guilloû again interpreting.&lt;ref name=&quot;grog&quot;/&gt;

On August 1, Ferdinand and Pius had their formal visit to the ''Constitution''.  Pius began to feel ill, and Guilloû treated him for seasickness.&lt;ref name=&quot;grog&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = An American Navy Surgeon and His Papal Patient |author= Harold Langley |series= ''The Grog Ration'' |volume= 1 |issue=4 |pages= 5–7 |date= November–December 2006 |publisher= US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery | work = History of Navy Medicine |url= http://www.history-navy-med.org/Text_Files/2006/The%20Grog%20Ration,%202006November-December.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;  The grateful pope delivered rosaries to the Catholics on the ship; Guilloû received inscribed prayerbooks and a medalion, along with a [[plenary indulgence]].&lt;ref name = &quot;grog&quot; /&gt;  The visit, however, proved to be a diplomatic embarrassment for the US, which was officially neutral in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|Italian revolutions]] that were happening at the time.  A visit to a navy ship was considered equivalent to stepping on &quot;US territory&quot;, which had never been done before by a pope.  Captain [[John Gwinn]] died before he could be formally reprimanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Commander Tyrone G Martin | title = The First Step |work= USS Constitution Museum |url= http://www.ussconstitutionmuseum.org/collections/ussc-history/first_step.htm |accessdate= March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return, Guilloû was stationed at the [[Brooklyn Naval Shipyard]] from 1852 to 1854.  He married Dinah Postlethwaite (1815–85), daughter of Samuel Postlethwaite (1772–1824) from [[Natchez, Mississippi]] in September 1852.  They had one daughter, Margaret Acelie Guilloû (born September 13, 1853), who married George Alfred Blackmore.  They also adopted Eloise (&quot;Polly&quot;) Thibault.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Hawaii===
Guilloû sailed to Honolulu in 1854. He first tried to establish a hospital with Robert W. Wood, but that failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Francis John Halford |title=9 doctors &amp; God |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sATPAAAAMAAJ |year=1954 |publisher=University of Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Active in [[Freemasonry]], he helped reactivate Lodge Le Progrés de l'Océanie in Honolulu that had been chartered from the French organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Frank J. Karpiel |title= Multinational Fraternity: Freemasonry in Hawai'i, 1843-1905 |journal= Hawaiian Journal of History |volume= 34 |pages= 139–168 |publisher= Hawaiian Historical Society |year= 2000 |id = {{hdl|10524/388}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an early member of the Hawaiian Agricultural Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Royal Hawaiian Agricultural Society |title=The Transactions of the Royal Hawaiian Agricultural Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lh8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA44 |year=1854  |pages=12, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He evidently decided to stick to medicine, since in 1856, he was one of the founding members of the Hawaiian Medical Society, with other prominent doctors such as [[Gerrit P. Judd]] and [[Thomas Charles Byde Rooke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hjh&quot;/&gt;

In 1857 [[Darius A. Ogden]], the American [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], appointed him as the [[Honolulu]] U.S. Seamen's Hospital physician in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David L. Gregg |title=The diaries of David Lawrence Gregg: an American diplomat in Hawaii, 1853-1858 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bT0cAAAAMAAJ |year=1982 |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 1858,  he gave a speech proposing to improve health care for [[native Hawaiians]] by opening a hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;kingdom2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1854-1874, twenty critical years |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom2&amp;l=en |volume=2 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1953 |isbn= 978-0-87022-432-4 |page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the plan would later be adopted, the resulting Queen's Hospital (now the [[The Queen's Medical Center]]) would pass up Guilloû and appoint German [[William Hillebrand]] to head the new institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;hjh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Richard A. Greer |title= Founding of the Queen's Hospital |journal= Hawaiian Journal of History |volume= 3 |pages= 110–145 |publisher= Hawaiian Historical Society |year= 1969 |id = {{hdl|10524/288}} |pmid= 11632066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilloû was appointed by [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] as the Consul of Italy to the Kingdom of Hawaii while he was there.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The State Department suspected overcharging for the seaman's hospital.
Commander William E. Hunt in of the {{USS |Levant |1837 |6 }} was sent to investigate.&lt;ref name=&quot;prologue&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Abner Pratt and Michigan's Honolulu House |publisher= U.S. National Archives |author= Peter von Buol |work= Prologue |volume=38 |number= 4 |year=2006 |url= http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/fall/pratt.html |accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[James W. Borden]], the new [[United States Minister to Hawaii]], published letters in the ''Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' newspaper of [[Henry Martyn Whitney]] with accusations against Guilloû and [[Abner Pratt]], the American Consul who replaced Ogden.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Pratt had already headed back to [[Marshall, Michigan]] where he built a majestic mansion, while the ''Levant'' was lost at sea. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Although Pratt was asked to return the funds, the [[American Civil War]] caused the government to never pursue the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;prologue&quot;/&gt; By 1861, the Seamen's Hospital was run by [[Seth Porter Ford]] (1817–1866).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Young Prince [[Albert Kamehameha|Albert Edward Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa]] became ill in August 1862. Guilloû was one of many physicians called in to help, but they could do nothing and the young prince died, leading to a series of succession crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Reminiscences of the court of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma |author= [[Curtis Iaukea|Curtis Piʻehu ʻIaukea]] |pages=17–27 |year= 1930 |work= Papers of the Hawaiian Historical Society |id= {{hdl|10524/961}}  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He returned to the US in 1867. He lived for a while in [[Petersburg, Virginia]], and then New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Guilloû died on January 2, 1899 in New York of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Death List of a Day—Dr. Charles F. Guillou |date= January 3, 1899 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30D11FE3E5811738DDDAA0894D9405B8985F0D3 |accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a book of his reminiscences (never published), and took many sketches during his travels.&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Charles F. Guillou papers, 1838-1947 |publisher= The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |url= http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/FIND_AID/hist/histcfg1.htm |accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His sketches of Oregon and California were published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Library of Congress. Copyright Office |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries. Third Series: 1961: July–December |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iQhAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1365 |year=1962 |publisher=Copyright Office, Library of Congress |page=1365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Charles Fleury Guilloû |author2=Emily Blackmore |title=Oregon and California drawings, 1841 and 1847 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQu_OwAACAAJ |year=1961 |publisher=Book Club of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grandson Charles Thomas Blackmore was born July 3, 1888, joined the British army in [[World War I]], and died on June 16, 1915 in the [[Battle of Bellewaarde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 4th Battalion Royal Fusiliers Memorial |work= Battle of Bellewaarde, 16 June 1915 |url= http://bellewaarde1915.co.uk/memorials/royal%20fusiliers%20deaths.htm |accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His widow donated Guilloû's papers to the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] in 1974.
Some of his effects such as medals are on display at the museum there.&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;/&gt;

Grandson Philip Guillou Blackmore was born January 18, 1890 in Virginia and entered the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;VMI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Blackmore, Philip Guillou (1911) | work = VMI Obituary |url= http://boards.ancestry.com/topics.obits2/51458/mb.ashx |accessdate= March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, he was commissioned into the coast artillery of the US Army on December 20, 1911. During World War I he also went to Hawaii, where he served at [[Fort Kamehameha]] and rose to be commander of [[Fort Ruger]]. During [[World War II]] he rose to the rank of temporary brigadier general. In August 1947 he assumed command of the [[White Sands Proving Ground]]. He married Emily Van Patten and had four children.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

He retired in 1950 and died April 7, 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;VMI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Brigadier General Philip Blackmore |publisher= White Sands Missile Range Museum |work= Commanders |url= http://www.wsmr-history.org/Commander2.htm  |accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
