The '''Singapore Army''' is the service of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) tasked with [[Army|land]] operations. It is the largest of the three Services. The Singaporean army is primarily a conscript army that, in the event of war, mobilises most of its combat power by calling up military [[Military reserve force|reservists]].

==History==
Two infantry regiments formed the nucleus of the Singapore Army. These were established pre-independence, in anticipation of self-rule following British decolonisation. The First Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR) was constituted in 1957, under British auspices. The Second Singapore Infantry Regiment (2 SIR) followed in 1963. After a fraught merger with the Federation of Malaya and subsequent separation in 1965, newly-independent Singapore formally established its army by passing the Singapore Army Bill in December 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Singapore Army Is Established|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/b125c943-1be5-4f98-99e1-68586e83de29|website=HistorySG|publisher=National Library Board Singapore|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Parliament passed further legislation (the Singapore Armed Forces Act) to reorganise and consolidate the armed forces' disparate commands and administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Armed Forces Act|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A%22f7446be9-daef-4a09-bb63-8e8da8b61f4c%22%20Status%3Apublished%20Depth%3A0;rec=0|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Armed Forces Come Into Effect|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/48b7e860-acdd-4e2e-aa14-b5289405ddb0|website=HistorySG|publisher=National Library Board Singapore|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Military Deployments'''
* May 2007-June 2013, [[International Security Assistance Force]]. Deployment of close to 500 personnel including Singapore Army soldiers as part of Singapore's contributions to multinational stabilisation and reconstruction efforts in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Armed Forces Concludes Deployment in Afghanistan|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/press_room/official_releases/nr/2013/jun/25jun13_nr.html|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2014–present, [[Military intervention against ISIL]]. Logistical support of coalition forces in the ongoing [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Statement Issued by Partners at the Counter-ISIL Coalition Ministerial Meeting|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/12/234627.htm|website=Office of Website Management, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=Office of the Spokesperson, Washington, DC|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic doctrine==
The stated mission of the Singapore Armed Forces is to deter armed aggression, and to secure a swift and decisive victory should deterrence fail. The Army is also tasked with conducting peace-time operations to further Singapore's national interests and foreign policy. These range from disaster relief to peacekeeping, hostage-rescue and other contingencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Singapore Army- About Us&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/About_Us.html |title=The Singapore Army- About Us |publisher=MINDEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army views technology as a [[Force multiplication|force-multiplier]] and a means to sustain combat power given Singapore's population constraints. Jointness across three branches of the SAF is integral to the Army's warfighting doctrine. Joint operations undertaken with the [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Navy]] and [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|Air Force]] include amphibious landings and critical disaster relief operations in the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].

The Army has a technically proficient, relatively well-educated draftee pool and officer corps (non-commissioned and commissioned) reflective of the population at large, and has sought to leverage this to ease its transition into a more sophisticated, networked fighting force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tim Huxley 2000, p.65&quot;&gt;Tim Huxley, Defending the Lion City, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2000, p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combat readiness is a linchpin of Army policy, and military exercises up to divisional level are conducted many times yearly, simulating full-spectrum operations, up to and including full-scale war. Divisional war games are a combined arms, tri-service affair involving the Republic of Singapore Navy and Air Force. Because training space is limited in Singapore—artillery fire would quickly traverse the island—some military exercises are conducted overseas. Reservists periodically &lt;ref name=&quot;mindef.gov.sg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/nsmen|title=NS Matters - Home|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; train abroad, their units regularly evaluated for combat readiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tim Huxley 2000, p.65&quot;/&gt; The Army also trains bilaterally with some host nations, and military exchanges are frequent. Training is billed as &quot;tough, realistic and safe,&quot; with a premium on safety, given the sensitivity of military deaths in a largely conscript army.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Singapore Army- About Us&quot;/&gt;

Following the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]], and in tandem with modernizing its weapons systems, the Army is forging a transition to a more network-centric fighting doctrine that better integrates the Air Force and Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/3g/home.html |title=The 3rd Generation SAF |publisher=MINDEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MINDEF Reserve (MR) NS Divisions====

=====2 People's Defence Force=====

2 People's Defence Force (PDF) is responsible for homeland security, including that of key civilian installations and infrastructure. 2 PDF is also responsible for the coordination and secondment of military resources to civilian agencies in the event of a civil emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/ourforces/2PDF.html|title=The Singapore Army - 2 People's Defence Force|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisation:
* HQ 2 PDF
* HQ 21 Singapore Infantry Brigade
* HQ 22 Singapore Infantry Brigade
* HQ 26 Singapore Infantry Brigade
* HQ 27 Singapore Infantry Brigade
* HQ 29 Singapore Infantry Brigade
* HQ 32 Singapore Infantry Brigade
* 8th Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment (8 SIR)
* 9th Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment (9 SIR)

=====21st Division=====

Designated as Army Operational Reserve (AOR), the 21st Division is a [[rapid deployment force]] of highly mobile infantry ([[Singapore Guards]]) specializing in [[Amphibious Warfare|amphibious]], [[Air Assault|heliborne]], and maneuver warfare. The armoured and artillery components of the division are lightweight, amphibious, and rapidly deployable.

Organisation:
* 7th Singapore Infantry Brigade
* 13th Singapore Infantry Brigade
* 15th Singapore Infantry Brigade
* Divisional Artillery
* 21st Signal Battalion
* 21st Divisional Support Command
* 18th Divisional Air Defense Artillery Battalion
* Divisional Combat Engineer Battalion

Of the three infantry brigades, one is active and staffed mainly by career servicemen. Two are held in reserve, one tasked with heliborne operations, the other tasked with amphibious landings.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Huxley, Defending the Lion City, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2000, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====25th Division=====

Also designated as Army Operational Reserve (AOR).

Organisation:
* 11th Singapore Infantry Brigade
* 14th Singapore Infantry Brigade
* 63rd Singapore Infantry Brigade
* 65th Singapore Infantry Brigade

=====32nd Division=====

Tim Huxley speculates in Defending the Lion City that &quot;the reorganisation of 1991 and 1995 left one armoured brigade, 4 SAB, outside the divisional structure, prompting speculation that it has been earmarked to form the core of a conceptualised new mechanised division.&quot; Huxley asserts that it was &quot;initially codenamed as 32nd Division at the planning stage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Huxley, Defending the Lion City, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2000, p.127. Huxley's source note on 32nd Division appears to refer to an article by defence journalist Prasun Sengupta (1992, p.76), but Huxley's bibliography is incomplete.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond speculation, there is no indication that the division was ever constituted.

====Non-Divisional Units, some appended to the General Staff====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
* [[military intelligence|Military Intelligence]] Battalion (1MIBN – 1st Military Intelligence Bn)
* Commandos Battalion (1CDO – 1st Commando Bn)
* Special Operations Task Force – joint task force consisting of the Naval Diving Unit, Commandos and the Special Operations Force
* Aggressor Company – subordinate to TRADOC/ATEC, this company-sized detachment organizes itself according to the hypothesized enemy's order of battle and acts as the OPFOR in training evaluations. They are the 'red' opposing force in ATEC evaluations.
* Medical Response Force (MRF) – Company-sized counter-chemical and -biological warfare unit, staffed by combat medics.
* Heavy Tank Battalion – 48 SAR
* Armoured Brigade – 4 SAB
