'''HMS ''Thistle''''' was a [[Bramble-class gunboat (1898)|''Bramble''-class gunboat]] of the [[Royal Navy]], launched in 1899 and broken up in 1926. She is notable for being the last classic Victorian [[gunboat]], and the last British warship to retain a practical sailing rig.

==Design==
{{main|Bramble-class gunboat (1898)}}
HMS ''Thistle'' was the last of four ''Bramble''-class vessels, built in the 1890s to patrol the remote outposts of the [[British Empire]] in the era of [[gunboat diplomacy]].

In most respects, she resembled a scaled-down [[protected cruiser]], a steel warship with a modern design and up-to-date armament, and very comfortable quarters for her crew. However, in order to navigate on uncharted coasts and tropical rivers, she was given a very compact shallow-draught hull, and this meant she only had a very limited coal supply. In addition, [[low technology]] was used to minimize construction cost and logistical requirements. As a result, the ''Thistle'' was given a two-masted sailing rig as a supplementary means of propulsion, along with a number of other [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] features such as a manual [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] to raise the [[anchor]], and [[candle]]s rather than [[light bulb]]s.

Policy changes shortly after the ''Thistle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s launch meant that no further gunboats would be built for the Royal Navy, and the use of sail propulsion was strongly discouraged. Nonetheless, problems with using ''Thistle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s engines for long-range cruising would prompt the restoration of her sailing rig in 1919, while her usefulness on colonial stations meant that she was refitted to maintain her capabilities in the 1920s, acquiring an anti-aircraft armament.

==Service history==
The ''Thistle'' was laid down at the [[London and Glasgow Shipbuilding Company|London &amp; Glasgow]] shipyards in [[Govan]] in December 1897. She was the last ship of her class to be launched, on 22 June 1899, and would not complete her fitting-out until 1901. On her sea-trials, she performed well, reaching her design speed of 13.5 knots under engine power.

===West Africa, 1902-1905===
HMS ''Thistle'' was initially deployed to [[West Africa]] under the command of Lieutenant and Commander E. S. Houseman. During Spring 1902 she toured the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], visiting [[São Vicente, Cape Verde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Thursday |date=20 March 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36720| }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbados]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=2 April 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36731| }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bermuda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date= 14 April 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36741}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York City|New York]]. After arrival at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in early May,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=5 May 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36759| }}&lt;/ref&gt; she was fitted out for [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] fishery protection service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=9 May 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36763| }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1904, her crew provided teams for the first competitive games of [[cricket]] and [[Association football|football]] in [[Nigeria]], being convincingly beaten in both matches by local teams from [[Hope Waddell Training Institution]]. In 1905, she was at [[Simon's Town|Simon's Bay]] to witness the arrival of [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky|Admiral Rozhestvensky]]'s fleet on their long, laborious voyage from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. The fact that only ''Thistle'' and the cruiser [[HMS Crescent (1892)|HMS ''Crescent'']] were available to deter an entire fleet of battleships caused considerable local alarm.

===Far East, 1906-1914===
The ''Thistle'' was subsequently transferred to the [[China Station]], where she was assigned to protect British imperial interests in the [[treaty ports]] along the [[Yangtze]] river, and was deployed 600 miles inland at [[Hankou]] (now part of the [[Wuhan]] conurbation). The early years of this assignment were relatively leisurely, and the ''Thistle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; surgeon, [[Walter Perceval Yetts]], acquired a deep admiration for Chinese civilization, which would lead him to become an important [[sinologist]].

In 1911, however, the ''Thistle'' found herself in the front line of the crisis which developed into the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]. She was subsequently withdrawn to Hong Kong, spending increasingly long stretches in harbour, and making occasional voyages across the [[South China Sea]] to coastal anchorages in mainland China. She now relied exclusively on her engines, and when the [[World War I|Great War]] broke out, ''Thistle'' and the other gunboats on the China Station were decommissioned to provide a crew for the old battleship [[HMS Triumph (1903)|HMS ''Triumph'']], which was now regarded as a more important military asset.

===East Africa, 1915-1918===
In 1915, it was decided to reactivate HMS ''Thistle'' and transfer her to [[East Africa]]. The initial intention was to send her into the [[Rufiji River|Rufiji Delta]] to fight the German cruiser [[SMS Königsberg (1905)|SMS ''Königsberg'']], but the Admiralty modified its plans by also sending the [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]] HMS ''[[HMS Mersey (1913)|Mersey]]'' and HMS ''[[HMS Severn (1913)|Severn]]'' through the [[Suez Canal]], and they subsequently [[Battle of Rufiji Delta|destroyed the ''Königsberg'']] before the ''Thistle'' even set sail.

Nonetheless, the ''Thistle'' was recommissioned under a new captain, Lieutenant-Commander [[Hector Boyes]], and set out to steam from Hong Kong to [[Zanzibar]]. The first stages as far as the [[Straits of Malacca]] were characterized by mechanical problems, and ''Thistle'' spent much of this part of the journey being towed by other ships. The machinery proved less problematic on the long treks across the [[Indian Ocean]] from [[Singapore]] to [[Colombo]] and from the [[Maldives]] to the [[Seychelles]], but on both these stages, the ship was close to running out of coal by the time she reached her destination. HMS ''Thistle'' eventually arrived in East Africa in November 1915, and would remain there for the rest of World War I.
[[File:Bramble class gunboat 1915 AWM P01236.013.jpeg|thumb|left|HMS ''Thistle'' in East Africa.]]
In September 1916, the ''Thistle'' participated in the amphibious campaign against [[German East Africa]], providing inshore protection for landings at [[Dar es Salaam]] and elsewhere, and pushing through difficult channels to bring fire support to soldiers striking inland. The ''Thistle'' was somewhat overshadowed by the continuing presence of the more powerful ''Mersey'' and ''Severn'', but the gunboat nonetheless distinguished herself, particularly in the defense of [[Lindi]] against a German artillery position, an action which earned Commander Boyes the [[Order of St Michael and St George]], and [[Fireman (steam engine)|Leading Stoker]] James Leach the [[Conspicuous Gallantry Medal]].

The most important moment of the gunboat's time in East Africa was still to come, however. By July 1918, the German column had entered [[Portuguese Mozambique]], and routed the opposing Anglo-Portuguese troops. The ''Thistle'' was anchored in the harbour at [[Quelimane]], and seemed to be the last line of defence against a major German victory. The port was supposedly defended by the Portuguese cruiser ''[[NRP Adamastor|Adamastor]]'', but the governor, Colonel Tómas de Sousa Rosas, was intent on using the ship to simply evacuate himself and his luggage, abandoning the harbour and its stockpiles and supply facilities to the German forces. Commander Boyes resolved to stand and fight with the ''Thistle'' and her small crew, an action which shamed Sousa Rosas and ''Adamastor'' into holding their ground, thus dissuading the Germans from an attack. This act of determination earned Boyes the Portuguese [[Order of Aviz]].

===West Africa, 1919-1924===
In 1919, HMS ''Thistle'' was ordered to return to West Africa, but almost as soon as the ship left Zanzibar, the starboard propellor failed. The gunboat's new captain, Lieutenant-Commander Cecil Cruttwell, had been educated aboard the [[Square rig|square-rigged]] [[training ship]] [[HMS Conway (school ship)|HMS ''Conway'']], and he promptly set the crew to making a new set of sails.

The new sails seem to have always been used in combination with whatever engine power was available, increasing speed and thus reducing fuel consumption, but they were seen as useful enough to be retained when the engine was repaired. The limited coal supply continued to be a problem, and on a visit to [[Liberia]] in 1920, the gunboat's crew had to obtain [[wood]] in [[Monrovia]] in to avoid running completely out of fuel. HMS ''Thistle'' would retain a sailing rig for the rest of her career.

The ''Thistle'' seems to have no longer had her main topmast by 1919, as the [[mainmast]] was demoted to become the [[mizzen]], and the ship adopted what was effectively a [[ketch]] sailplan, with a [[jib]] in the bows, a tall [[square rig|square-rigged]] foremast carrying a [[Course (sail)|mainsail]] and [[topsail]], and two fore-and-aft sails on the shorter mizzen, a [[staysail]] and a [[trysail]] [[Spanker (sail)|spanker]]. Subsequently, she adopted a reduced rig of just three sails - her jib, one square sail on the foremast, and a single fore-and-aft sail on the mizzen.

Although the sails were only used in conjunction with the engines, the fact that the ''Thistle'' had returned to sail as a means of propulsion distinguishes her from a number of other Royal Navy warships which resumed the use of [[staysail]]s to improve their [[seakeeping]] and [[Nautical stationkeeping|stationkeeping]] ability (a practice which was not fully abandoned until [[HMS Reclaim|HMS ''Reclaim'']] paid off in 1979).

The ''Thistle'' remained on the Atlantic coast of Africa. She was refitted and rearmed, losing her secondary artillery and machine guns in exchange for anti-aircraft cannons, and she was still performing [[gunboat diplomacy]] in early 1925. A few months later, however, HMS ''Thistle'' sailed for home. International newspapers reported on the final passing of the age of sail.

The hulk of ''Thistle'' was subsequently sold for scrap in August 1926.
