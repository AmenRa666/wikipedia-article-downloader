The '''''Liberté'' class''' was a group of four [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s of the [[French Navy]]. The class comprised [[French battleship Liberté|''Liberté'']], the [[lead ship]], [[French battleship Justice|''Justice'']], [[French battleship Vérité|''Vérité'']], and [[French battleship Démocratie|''Démocratie'']]. The ships were in most respects repeats of the previous {{sclass-|République|battleship|4}}, and the major difference was the adoption of {{convert|194|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns for the secondary battery, rather than the {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} guns of the ''République'' class. Due to their similarity, the two classes are sometimes treated as one basic design. The four ''Liberté''-class ships were built between 1903 and 1908; they were completed over a year after the revolutionary British {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, which rendered the French ships obsolete before they entered service. 

In September 1909, three of the ships, ''Liberté'', ''Justice'', and ''Vérité'' visited the United States for the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]]. Two years later, ''Liberté''{{'}}s forward [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazines]] exploded in [[Toulon]] harbor, destroying the ship and killing approximately 250 of her crew. The three surviving ships saw action early in [[World War I]] at the [[Battle of Antivari]], and spent the remainder blockading the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and were later stationed at [[Mudros]] in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. They were stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1921&amp;ndash;1922 and broken up for scrap. ''Liberté'' was left on the bottom of Toulon harbor until 1925, when she was raised and broken up for scrap.

==Design==
The Fleet Law of 1900 authorized the French Navy to build six new battleships, along with a host of other warship types; the law signaled an end to the ''[[Jeune École]]'' doctrine that emphasized commerce raiding and [[torpedo boat]]s instead of a battle fleet of [[capital ship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; The first two battleships ordered, the {{sclass-|République|battleship|4}}, formed the design basis for the subsequent four of the ''Liberté'' class.&lt;ref name=G297&gt;Gardiner, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; The naval engineer [[Émile Bertin]] designed both the ''République'' and ''Liberté'' classes.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

===General characteristics and machinery===
[[File:Liberté class battleship diagrams Brasseys 1906.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1906&lt;/center&gt;]]

The ships were {{convert|133.81|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a beam of {{convert|24.26|m|abbr=on|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.41|m|abbr=on|ftin}}. The ships displaced between {{convert|14489|MT|sp=us}} for ''Vérité'' to {{convert|14860|MT|sp=us}} for ''Justice'' at full load. The ships were built with a tall [[forecastle]] deck that extended all the way to the mainmast. The ships retained a small fighting mast for the foremast, but had a lighter pole mast for the mainmast. They had a crew of between 739 and 769 officers and enlisted men. The ships had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|1.1|m|abbr=on}}, and were equipped with [[bilge keel]]s to increase their stability.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

The ships were powered by three 4-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s with twenty-two [[Belleville boiler]]s, with the exception of ''Justice'', which was equipped with twenty-four [[Niclausse boiler]]s. The boilers were divided into three boiler rooms, each of which were trunked into their own [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]. The engines were rated at {{convert|18500|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. Normal coal storage amounted to {{convert|900|MT|abbr=on}}, and at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}, the ships had a radius of action of {{convert|4200|nmi|lk=in}}. Additional space aboard the ship could be used to store a total of {{convert|1850|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, which increased the cruising radius to {{convert|8500|nmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trials of French Battleships Democratie and Justice&quot;, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament and armor===
The main battery for the ''Liberté''-class ships consisted of four [[Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of ten [[Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1902]] guns; six were mounted in single turrets, and four in [[casemate]]s in the hull. They also carried thirteen 9-pounder guns and ten 3-pounder guns for close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. The ships were also armed with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

The ships' armor layout was nearly identical to the previous ''République'' class. The [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick at the [[waterline]] and extended for almost the complete length of the hull, from the bow to near the stern. The belt was reduced to {{convert|240|mm|abbr=on}} on the top edge and {{convert|81|mm|abbr=on}} on the bottom. On the bow and stern, the thicknesses were reduced to {{convert|180|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|140|mm|abbr=on}}, and 81&amp;nbsp;mm, respectively. The armored deck was {{convert|53|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[amidships]], and increased to {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}}  on the slopes that connected to the belt. The main battery was protected by up to {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor, and had bases with {{convert|254|mm|abbr=on}} thick armor plate. The secondary turrets had {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick faces and 280&amp;nbsp;mm thick back plates to balance the turrets, and were mounted on bases with 140&amp;nbsp;mm thick armor, compared to the {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} thick armor of the ''République''s' turret bases. The casemate guns were protected with 140&amp;nbsp;mm of armor. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Justice 1909 LOC det 4a16114.jpg|thumb|''Justice'' at the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in September 1909]]
''Liberté'', the [[lead ship]] of the class, was laid down at the ''[[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]]'' shipyard in November 1902, launched on 19 April 1905, and completed in March 1908. ''Justice'' and ''Vérité'' were both laid down in April 1903, ''Justice'' at the [[Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée|La Seyne shipyard]] in [[Toulon]] and ''Vérité'' at the ''[[Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde]]'' shipyard in [[Bordeaux]]. ''Justice'' was launched on 27 October 1904 and completed in February 1908, and ''Vérité'' was launched on 28 May 1907 and completed in June 1908. ''Démocratie'', the last vessel of the class, was laid down at the [[Arsenal de Brest]] shipyard on 1 May 1903, launched on 30 April 1904, and completed in January 1908.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt; The ships were completed after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}; her design, which incorporated a uniform main battery of ten {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} guns and high-speed [[steam turbine]]s, rendered all other [[pre-dreadnought]]s like the ''Liberté'' class obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1909, ''Liberté'', ''Justice'', and ''Vérité'' visited the United States for the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine &amp; Panetta, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1911, ''Justice'' and ''Vérité'' were used with success in the Navy's experiments with [[wireless telegraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alger, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in September, ''Liberté'' was destroyed by a huge explosion in her forward [[propellant]] magazines. Several nearby warships were damaged by debris, including the battleship [[French battleship République|''République'']]. The explosion aboard ''Liberté'' killed some 250 officers and men.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 653&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck was left in Toulon until 1925, when it was raised and broken up for scrap.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, the three surviving ships were assigned to the 2nd Squadron of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey, pp. 179&amp;ndash;180&lt;/ref&gt; They assisted in escorting troop convoys from French North Africa to metropolitan France in the first days of the war,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (1995), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; and then moved to the southern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] to prevent the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] from breaking out into the Mediterranean. There, at the [[Battle of Antivari]], the French battlefleet caught and sank the Austro-Hungarian [[cruiser]] {{SMS|Zenta}} in late August.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2004), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, ''Justice'', ''Vérité'', and ''Démocratie'' were sent to [[Mudros]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the conflict, all three ships were placed in reserve and stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1921&amp;ndash;1922 and sold for scrap.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;
