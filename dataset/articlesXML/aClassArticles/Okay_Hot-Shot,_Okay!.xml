'''''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!''''' (sometimes '''''Okay Hot-Shot''''') is a 1963 [[pop art]] painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] that uses his [[Ben-Day dots]] style and a [[text balloon]]. It is one of several examples of [[military art]] that Lichtenstein created between 1962 and 1964, including several with aeronautical themes like this one. It was inspired by panels from four different comic books that provide the sources for the plane, the pilot, the text balloon and the graphic [[onomatopoeia]], &quot;VOOMP!&quot;.

Lichtenstein made several alterations to the source images as he compiled them into this composition. He used themes in this work that relate to those expressed in several of his other works. The narrative content is also said to relate to themes from other works, but instead of Lichtenstein's own works it relates to [[Jackson Pollock]]'s contemporaneous works.

== Background ==
During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of [[comic strip]]s. Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. [[Andy Warhol]] produced his earliest paintings using this style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced ''Look Mickey'' and ''Popeye'' in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livingstone 2000&quot;&gt;

Soon, Lichtenstein advanced from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and combat depictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanchner 2009&quot;&gt;

Lichtenstein said that at the time, &quot;I was very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanchner 2009&quot;/&gt; The work was inspired by five different comic book panels made by [[Russ Heath]] and [[Irv Novick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker 2011-04-06&quot;&gt;

Lichtenstein was a trained draftsman and artist. He also received training during [[World War II]] as an army pilot,  but never saw active combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;LFO Chronology&quot;&gt;

His list of aeronautically themed works is extensive, including several others featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as ''[[Jet Pilot (Roy Lichtenstein)|Jet Pilot]]'' (1962), ''[[Brattata]]'' (1962), and ''[[Bratatat!]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pisano 2003 01&quot;&gt;

''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'' is one of several comics-based works, including ''Jet Pilot'' and ''Von Karp'', inspired by the World War II U.S. fighter pilot Johnny Cloud of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Losers (comics)|The Losers]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;YaleUP 2012-06-26&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   The January–February 1962 DC Comics' ''[[All-American Men of War]]'' issue #89 was the inspiration for several Lichtenstein paintings, providing two of the source panels of ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'' as well as sources for ''Brattata'', ''Blam'', ''Whaam!'' and ''Tex!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4381129|title=High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture: Searching High and Low|author= Armstrong,  Matthew|volume=2|issue=6|date=Autumn 1990|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|pages=4–8, 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The graphite pencil sketch, ''Jet Pilot'' was also from that issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;ID 3163&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=3163&amp;year=1962&amp;decade=60# | title = Jet Pilot | accessdate = June 24, 2013 | publisher = LichtensteinFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical appraisal ==

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
In the source, the pilot wore traditional World War II headgear, but Lichtenstein altered the headgear to that of a [[cosmonaut]], [[astronaut]] or modern air force pilot of the [[Cold War]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pisano 2003 02&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Lichtenstein also shifted the subject so that his left [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is in the frame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker 2011-04-06&quot;/&gt; The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of &quot;machine and embodied vision&quot; as exhibited in works such as ''[[Crak!]]'', ''Bratatat!'', and ''Jet Pilot''.&lt;ref name=RLGB&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|editor=Bader, Graham|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01258-4|chapter=Technology Envisioned: Lichtenstein's Monocularity|author=Lobel, Michael|pages=118–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative content, &quot;Okay, hot-shot, okay! I'm pouring! [ammunition into the enemy]&quot; is said to have a dual meaning that alludes to the style of poured painting being made famous at the time by Pollock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker 2011-04-06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pisano 2003 01&quot;/&gt; Melodrama through heightened tension ties this with some of Lichtenstein's most notable works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lobel 2002 03&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

While melding the elements and motifs of panels from two artists, Lichtenstein simplified the hatching and use of color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lobel 2002 02&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In Lichtenstein's [[obituary]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Christopher Knight said the use of color in this work harkened back to works by [[Morris Louis]] and the explosion's graphic elements recalled [[Kenneth Noland]]'s target work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1997-09-30&quot;&gt;

In an account published in 1998 after Lichtenstein was famous, Irv Novick said that he met Lichtenstein in the army in 1947 and, as his superior officer, had responded to Lichtenstein's tearful complaints about the menial tasks he was assigned by recommending him for a better job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beaty&quot; /&gt; Jean-Paul Gabilliet has questioned this account, saying that Lichtenstein had left the army a year before the time Novick says the incident took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gabilliet| first = Jean-Paul| title = Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J1t8g_yX1wcC&amp;pg=PA350| year = 2009| publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]]| isbn = 1-60473-267-9| page = 350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart Beaty, noting that Lichtenstein had appropriated Novick for works such as ''Whaam!'' and ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'', says that Novick's story &quot;seems to be an attempt to personally diminish&quot; the more famous artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beaty&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/crv/summary/v034/34.3beaty.html|title=Roy Lichtenstein's Tears: Art vs. Pop in American Culture|accessdate=June 30, 2013|volume=34|issue=3|year=2004|author=Beaty, Bart|work=Canadian Review of American Studies|pages=249–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;
