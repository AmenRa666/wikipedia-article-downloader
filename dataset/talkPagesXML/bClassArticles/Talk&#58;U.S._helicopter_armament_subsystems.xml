==Unheard==
very good work here, but I think we need to make this article more prominent, otherwise all the effort here will be wasted.--[[User:Ariedartin|Ariedartin]] 14:28, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

==AH-64 Subsystem To Be Added==
we'll need to add a section detailing the armament subsystem of the [[AH-64 Apache]]. its younger brother the [[AH-1 Cobra]] has a section, but the big brother and main actor doesn't. hmm..--[[User:Ariedartin|Ariedartin]] 07:39, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
:The real issue with the AH-64 is that, at least as of right now, there's only one subystem for it, the M139, which covers everything (including the AH-64s defensive flare launcher), except its missile launch capabilities.  I am unsure if there are actually designated subsystems, or whether it suffices to say that the AH-64 has the ability to launch the AGM-114 HELLFIRE, FIM-92C/D Air-To-Air Stinger (ATAS), or previously the the AIM-9 series.  --[[User:Thatguy96|Thatguy96]] 09:12, 4 May 2006

==XM8 Merger==
'''Support''': It appears to me that the XM8, because of the extremely limited scope of the article, will be a perpetual stub.  Suggest moving it in with this article. -- [[User:Thatguy96|Thatguy96]] 14:34, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

'''Support''', as the US Helicopter Armament Subsystems article covers it already. [[User:Sharkface217|Sharkface217]] 18:27, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

==On the definition of a subsystem==
A recent revert on my part makes me think I should at least clarify on the talk page what I understand a subsystem to be in the context of this article.  Maybe it will allow for some better text to be added to the introduction.  What I ''do not'' consider to be a subsystem are physical extremities of an aircraft, ie stub wings and hardpoints, pylons and the like.  This gets into a certain amount of potential confusion over the inclusion of turrets and similar components that are essentially standard on certain helicopters (mainly purpose built attack helicopters).  These systems are included only because the respective services treat them as separate systems.  Hardpoints and pylons that ''are'' mentioned are mention for the same reason, because they are treated as optional subsystems, such as the M156 universal mount, the mention of the BRU-type pylons, the EFSS, and the Universal Weapons Pylon.  None of these systems appear on all UH-1/UH-60/OH-58 helicopters, respectively, nor even on all of a certain variant (the designation OH-58D does not specify the usage of the UWP, the EFSS can be mounted on any UH-60, and so on).  The six external hardpoints on the AH-56 were to be found on all production AH-56, as are the four on AH-1s and AH-64s.  These I understand to be an integral part of the aircraft and not a subsystem, similar to the hardpoint mounting &quot;stations&quot; on UH-1 helicopters to which subsystems are attached.  -- [[User:Thatguy96|Thatguy96]] ([[User talk:Thatguy96|talk]]) 21:06, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

: I kinda thought that, but the lead mentions rockets.  So I wasn't sure.  I only added the hardpoints (part of aircraft) to cover the TOW missile pods and Folding fin rocket launchers that are mounted on them not the hardpoitn themselves.  Anyway I added that text to the AH-56 article and will expand it as well. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 21:16, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

:I know this is an old discussion, but also for consideration is the primary mission of the aircraft. The Apache was primarily designed to kill tanks, and then provide some CAS. It is a launch platform for Hellfire missiles. Therefore, maybe they should be considered an actual subsystem. Why else would the fire control be specifically designed to fire that missile using another subsystem, the TADS/PNVS? --[[User:The Founders Intent|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''''T&lt;small&gt;HE&lt;/small&gt; F&lt;small&gt;OUNDERS&lt;/small&gt; I&lt;small&gt;NTENT &lt;/small&gt;'''''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:The Founders Intent|''PRAISE'']]&lt;/sup&gt;  17:03, 30 June 2011 (UTC)</text>
