A '''directed-energy weapon''' ('''DEW''') emits highly focused [[energy]], transferring that energy to a target to damage it.

Potential applications of this technology include anti-personnel weapon systems, potential missile defense system, and the disabling of lightly armored vehicles such as cars, drones, watercraft, and electronic devices such as mobile phones.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10303988/Golden-Eye-style-energy-beam-is-developed-by-Nato-scientists.html &quot;Daily Telegraph, 12th September 2013&quot;], ''Golden Eye-style energy beam is developed by Nato scientists'', Oct. 08, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milsat2&gt;[http://www.satnews.com/story.php?number=1272864526 &quot;Milsat Magazine, Satnews Daily, June 24th 2009&quot;], ''U.S. Navy Laser Versus UAVs... Laser Wins...'', Oct. 08, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Pentagon]] is researching technologies like directed-energy weapon and [[railgun]]s to counter maturing threats posed by missile and [[hypersonic glide vehicle]]s.  These systems of missile defense are expected to come online in the mid to late-2020s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/defense/thaad-er-search-mission Thaad-ER In Search Of A Mission] - Aviationweek.com, 20 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational advantages==
Directed energy weapons could have several main advantages over conventional weaponry:

* Direct energy weapons can be used discreetly as radiation above and below the visible spectrum is invisible and does not generate sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Defence IQ Press&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenceiq.com/army-and-land-forces/articles/we-talk-to-dr-pali-ek-about-directed-energy-system/ &quot;Defence IQ talks to Dr Palíšek about Directed Energy Weapon systems&quot;], ''Defence iQ', Nov. 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmb.physics.wisc.edu/tutorial/spectrum.html Spectrum Tutorial], University of Wisconsin Electromagnetic Spectrum Tutorial, accessed 22/06/2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Light is only [[Gravitational lens|very slightly affected by gravity]].

== Types ==

=== Microwave weapons ===

Although some devices are labelled as microwave weapons, the microwave range is commonly defined as being between 300&amp;nbsp;MHz and 300&amp;nbsp;GHz which is within the [[RF]] range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wifiinschools.org.uk/15.html RF vs Microwave Freq range], Microwaves and radio waves&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of weapons which have been publicized by the military are as follows:

* [[Active Denial System]] is a millimeter wave source that heats the water in the target's skin and thus causes incapacitating pain. It is being used by the [[Air Force Research Laboratory|U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory]] and [[Raytheon]] for riot-control duty. Though intended to cause severe pain while leaving no lasting damage, concern has been voiced as to whether the system could cause irreversible damage to the eyes. There has yet to be testing for long-term side effects of exposure to the microwave beam. It can also destroy unshielded [[electronics]]: see [[TEMPEST]] (research into unintended electronic release of information).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[CBS News]] | date = 2008-06-01 | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | title = The Pentagon's Ray Gun | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/29/60minutes/main3891865.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device comes in various sizes including attached to a [[humvee]].
* [[Vigilant Eagle]] is an airport defense system that directs high-frequency microwaves towards any projectile that is fired at an aircraft.&lt;ref name=AZrep&gt;
''Raytheon focuses on non-lethal weapons,Andrew Johnson, (The Arizona Republic, 09-17-2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of a missile-detecting and tracking subsystem (MDT), a command and control system, and a scanning array. The MDT is a fixed grid of passive infrared (IR) cameras. The command and control system determines the missile launch point. The scanning array projects microwaves that disrupt the surface-to-air missile's guidance system, deflecting it from the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/rtnwcm/groups/rms/documents/content/rtn_rms_ps_vigilanteagle_datas.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bofors HPM Blackout]] is a high-powered microwave weapon system which is stated to be able to destroy at distance a wide variety of [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) electronic equipment. It is stated to be not lethal to humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/BAE_GCSW_hpm_blackout.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185029/http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/BAE_GCSW_hpm_blackout.html |date=August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Karlsson (2009). &quot;Bofors HPM Blackout&quot;. Artilleri-Tidskrift (2-2009): s. s 12-15. Retrieved 2010-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;cp=19&amp;gs_id=a&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=Bofors+HPM+Blackout&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=Bofors+HPM+Blackout&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=d8c3d6158c86e07e&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=916 Google search]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) of the [[EL/M-2080 Green Pine|EL/M-2080 Green Pine radar]] makes it a possible candidate for conversion into a directed-energy weapon, by focusing pulses of radar energy on target missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green Pine&quot; /&gt; The energy spikes are tailored to enter missiles through antennas or sensor apertures where they can fool guidance systems, scramble computer memories or even burn out sensitive electronic components.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green Pine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/12195p3.xml&amp;headline=Israel%20Tests%20Improved%20Arrow%20Interceptor |publisher=''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'' |title=Israel tests improved Arrow interceptor|date=2005-12-17 |first=David A. |last=Fulghum |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AESA]] radars mounted on fighter aircraft have been slated as directed energy weapons against missiles, however, a senior US Air Force officer noted: &quot;''they aren't particularly suited to create weapons effects on missiles because of limited antenna size, power and field of view''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AW&amp;ST-radar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://omega.twoday.net/stories/955265/|publisher=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |title=Radar Becomes A Weapon|date=2005-09-06 |author=David A. Fulghum |author2=Douglas Barrie |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potentially lethal effects are produced only inside 100 metres range, and disruptive effects at distances on the order of one kilometre. Moreover, cheap countermeasures can be applied to existing missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grisha&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-130408-1.html |publisher=Air Power Australia |title=Grisha's Radar fry-off|date=2008-04-13 |author=Colonel of Aviation Grigoriy &quot;Grisha&quot; Medved (retd) |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrolaser ===

{{Main article|Electrolaser}}
An electrolaser lets [[blooming (directed-energy weapon)|ionization]] occur, and then sends a powerful electric current down the conducting [[ionization|ionized]] track of plasma so formed, somewhat like [[lightning]]. It functions as a giant high energy long-distance version of the [[Taser]] or [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]].

=== Pulsed energy projectile ===
{{Main article|Pulsed energy projectile}}

Pulsed Energy Projectile or PEP systems emit an infrared laser pulse which creates rapidly expanding [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] at the target. The resulting sound, shock and electromagnetic waves stun the target and cause pain and temporary paralysis. The weapon is under development and is intended as a non-lethal weapon in crowd control though it can also be used as a lethal weapon.

=== Dazzler ===

A [[Dazzler (weapon)|Dazzler]] is a directed-energy weapon intended to temporarily blind or disorient its target with intense directed radiation. Targets can include sensors or human vision. Dazzlers emit [[infrared]] or invisible light against various electronic sensors, and [[visible light]] against humans, when they are intended to cause no long-term damage to [[eye]]s. The emitters are usually [[laser]]s, making what is termed a ''laser dazzler''. Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a [[laser diode]]) or green (a [[diode-pumped solid-state laser]], DPSS) areas of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Initially developed for military use, non-military products are becoming available for use in law enforcement and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/us-cops-and-military-to-get-laser-guns-602983 |title=US cops and military to get laser guns |date=27 May 2009 |author=Mark Harris |publisher=[[Techradar.com]] |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20011548-71.html |title=Police to experiment with blinding 'Dazer Laser'? |author=Chris Matyszczyk |date=23 July 2010 |publisher=[[CNET]].com |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weapons designed to cause permanent blindness are banned by the 1995 [[United Nations]] [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]]. The dazzler is a [[non-lethal force|non-lethal]] [[weapon]] intended to cause [[Flash blindness|temporary blindness]] or disorientation and therefore falls outside this protocol.

[[Image:PHASR Rifle.jpg|thumb|200px|PHASR Rifle]]
The [[personnel halting and stimulation response rifle]] (PHASR) is a prototype [[Non-lethal force|non-lethal]] [[laser]] [[dazzler (weapon)|dazzler]] developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate, U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;Eva D.

Blinding laser weapons have been tested in the past, but were banned under the 1995 UN [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]], which the United States [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|acceded]] to on 21 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/__80256ee600585943.nsf/(httpPages)/3ce7cfc0aa4a7548c12571c00039cb0c?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1%2C3%2C2#_Section1|title=United Nations Office at Geneva|publisher=www.unog.ch|accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PHASR rifle, a low-intensity laser, is not prohibited under this regulation, as the blinding effect is intended to be temporary.  It also uses a two-wavelength laser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirtland.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070404-043.pdf PERSONNEL HALTING and STIMULATION RESPONSE (PHaSR) Fact Sheet], Air Force Research Laboratory, Office of Public Affairs, April 2006; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080313035036/http://www.kirtland.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070404-043.pdf Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; The PHASR was tested at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], part of the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] [[Air Force Research Laboratory#Directorates|Directed Energy Directorate]] in [[New Mexico]].

==Problems with laser weapons==
=== Blooming ===
{{See also|Thermal blooming}}
Laser beams begin to cause [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] breakdown in the atmosphere at energy densities of around one [[Joule|megajoule]] per cubic centimetre. This effect, called &quot;blooming,&quot; causes the laser to defocus and disperse energy into the surrounding air.  Blooming can be more severe if there is [[fog]], [[smoke]], or [[dust]] in the air.

Techniques that may reduce these effects include:

* Spreading the beam across a large, curved mirror that focuses the power on the target, to keep energy density en route too low for blooming to happen. This requires a large, very precise, fragile mirror, mounted somewhat like a searchlight, requiring bulky machinery to slew the mirror to aim the laser.
* Using a [[phased array]]. For typical laser [[wavelength]]s, this method would require billions of [[micrometre]]-size [[antenna (radio)|antennae]].  There is currently no known way to implement these, though [[carbon nanotube]]s have been proposed. Phased arrays could theoretically also perform [[Nonlinear optics|phase-conjugate amplification]] (see below). Phased arrays do not require mirrors or lenses, and can be made flat and thus do not require a turret-like system (as in &quot;spread beam&quot;) to be aimed, though range will suffer if the target is at extreme angles to the surface of the phased array.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3x.html#laser Atomic Rocket: Space War: Weapons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using a phase-conjugate laser system. This method employs a &quot;finder&quot; or &quot;guide&quot; laser illuminating the target. Any mirror-like (&quot;specular&quot;) points on the target reflect light that is sensed by the weapon's primary amplifier. The weapon then amplifies inverted waves in a positive feedback loop, destroying the target with [[shock wave|shockwaves]] as the specular regions evaporate. This avoids blooming because the waves from the target pass through the blooming, and therefore show the most conductive optical path; this automatically corrects for the distortions caused by blooming. Experimental systems using this method usually use special chemicals to form a &quot;[[phase-conjugate mirror]]&quot;. In most systems, the mirror overheats dramatically at weapon-useful power levels.
* Using a very short pulse that finishes before blooming interferes.
* Focusing multiple lasers of relatively low power on a single target.

===Countermeasures===
The Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] has invested in the development of coatings that can deflect beams fired by U.S. military lasers.  Lasers are composed of light that can be deflected, reflected, or absorbed by manipulating physical and chemical properties of materials.  Artificial coatings can counter certain specific types of lasers, but if a different type was used than the coating was designed to handle it would be able to burn through it. The coatings are made of several different substances including low-cost metals, [[rare earths]], [[carbon fiber]], silver, and diamonds that have been processed to fine sheens and tailored against specific laser weapon systems. China is developing anti-laser defenses because protection against them is considered far cheaper than creating competing laser weapons themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1444732/us-lasers-pla-preparing-raise-its-deflector-shields US lasers? PLA preparing to raise its deflector shields] - SCMP.com, 10 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Particle-beam weapons ==
{{Main article|Particle-beam weapon}}
Particle-beam weapons can use charged or neutral particles, and can be either endoatmospheric or exoatmospheric. [[Particle beam]]s as beam weapons are theoretically possible, but practical weapons have not been demonstrated. Certain types of particle beams have the advantage of being self-focusing in the atmosphere.

[[Blooming (directed-energy weapon)|Blooming]] is also a problem in particle-beam weapons. Energy that would otherwise be focused on the target spreads out; the beam becomes less effective:

* Thermal blooming occurs in both charged and neutral particle beams, and occurs when particles bump into one another under the effects of thermal vibration, or bump into air molecules.
* Electrical blooming occurs only in charged particle beams, as ions of like charge repel one another.

=== Plasma weapons ===
{{Main article|Plasma weapon}}

Plasma weapons fire a beam, bolt, or [[particle beam|stream]] of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is an excited [[state of matter]] consisting of atomic electrons &amp; nuclei and free electrons if [[ionization|ionized]], or other particles if [[pinch (plasma physics)|pinched]].

The [[MARAUDER]] (''Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed-Energy and Radiation'') used the [[Shiva Star]] project (a high energy capacitor bank which provided the means to test weapons and other devices requiring brief and extremely large amounts of energy) to accelerate a toroid of plasma at a significant percentage of the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7369133 |title=Energy Citations Database (ECD) - - Document #7369133 |doi=10.1063/1.860681 |publisher=Osti.gov |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sonic weapons ==
{{Main article|Sonic weaponry}}

Cavitation, which affects gas nuclei in human tissue, and heating can result from exposure to ultrasound and can damage tissue and organs. Studies have found{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} that exposure to high intensity ultrasound at frequencies from 700&amp;nbsp;kHz to 3.6&amp;nbsp;MHz can cause lung and intestinal damage in mice.  Heart rate patterns following vibroacoustic stimulation have resulted in serious arterial flutter and [[bradycardia]]. Researchers have concluded that generating pain through the auditory system using high intensity sound risked permanent hearing damage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

&lt;/ref&gt; involved high intensity audible sound experiments on human subjects.  Extra-aural (unrelated to hearing) bioeffects on various internal organs and the central nervous system included auditory shifts, [[vibrotactile]] sensitivity change, muscle contraction, [[cardiovascular]] function change, [[central nervous system]] effects, [[vestibular]] ([[inner ear]]) effects, and [[chest wall]]/lung tissue effects.  Researchers found that low frequency sonar exposure could result in significant [[cavitation]]s, [[hypothermia]], and tissue shearing. Follow-on experiments were not recommended.

Tests performed on mice show the threshold for both lung and liver damage occurs at about 184 [[Decibel|dB]].  Damage increases rapidly as intensity is increased.  Noise-induced [[neurological]] disturbances in humans exposed to continuous low frequency tones for durations longer than 15 minutes involved development of immediate and long-term problems affecting brain tissue. The symptoms resembled those of individuals who had suffered minor head injuries. One theory for a causal mechanism is that the prolonged sound exposure resulted in enough mechanical strain to brain tissue to induce an [[encephalopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) ===

[[File:soundweapon1.jpg|thumb|right|The LRAD is the round black device on top of the [[New York City]] police Hummer.]]
The '''[[Long Range Acoustic Device]]''' ('''LRAD''') is an [[acoustic hailing device]] developed by [[LRAD Corporation]] to send messages and warning tones over longer distances or at higher volume than normal [[loudspeaker]]s. LRAD systems are used for long range communications in a variety of applications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lradx.com/application/ Applications - LRAD Corporation website]&lt;/ref&gt; including as a means of non-lethal, non-kinetic crowd control.  Though they have been called &quot;sonic weapons&quot;, {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} LRADs are not inherently for military use.

According to the manufacturer's specifications, the systems weigh from {{convert|15|to|320|lb}} and can emit sound in a 30°- 60° beam at 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0kUYUOtG0AC&amp;pg=PA65 |page=65 |last=Corbett |first=Peter |title=A Modern Plague of Pirates |isbn=0-9562107-0-8|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturer also produces systems for public address and mass notification use that broadcast 360°.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lradx.com/product_categories/lrad_mass_notification_systems/ LRAD Corporation website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mirrors of Archimedes  ===
[[File:Archimedes Heat Ray conceptual diagram.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a [[parabolic reflector]] to burn ships attacking [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].]]
{{main article|Archimedes#Heat ray}}
According to a legend,  [[Archimedes]] created a mirror with an adjustable focal length (or more likely, a series of mirrors focused on a common point) to focus sunlight on ships of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fleet as they invaded [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], setting them on fire.&lt;ref name=noScifi&gt;Bill Sweetman. &quot;[http://aviationweek.com/defense/directed-energy-weapons-no-longer-science-fiction#slide-0-field_images-1341101 Directed-Energy Weapons: No Longer Science Fiction] ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'', 2015. [http://web.archive.org/web/20150810084543/http://aviationweek.com/defense/directed-energy-weapons-no-longer-science-fiction Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Historians point out that the earliest accounts of the battle did not mention a &quot;burning mirror&quot;, but merely stated that Archimedes's ingenuity combined with a way to hurl fire were relevant to the victory. Some attempts to replicate this feat have had some success; in particular, an experiment by students at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] showed that a mirror-based weapon was at least possible, if not necessarily practical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/lectures/10_ArchimedesResult.html Archimedes Death Ray: Idea Feasibility Testing]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Watson-Watt ===
In 1935, the British [[Air Ministry]] asked [[Robert Watson-Watt]] of the [[Radio Research Station]] whether a &quot;[[death ray]]&quot; was possible. {{cn|date=August 2016}} He and colleague [[Arnold Wilkins]] quickly concluded that it was not feasible, but as a consequence suggested using radio for the detection of aircraft and this started the development of [[radar]] in Britain.

=== Engine-stopping rays ===
Engine-stopping rays are a variant that occurs in fiction and myth. Such stories were circulating in Britain around 1938. The tales varied but in general terms told of tourists whose car engine suddenly died and were then approached by a German soldier who told them that they had to wait. The soldier returned a short time later to say that the engine would now work and the tourists drove off. A possible origin of some of these stories arises from the testing of the television transmitter in [[Feldberg, Baden-Württemberg|Feldberg]], Germany. Because electrical noise from car engines would interfere with field strength measurements, sentries would stop all traffic in the vicinity for the twenty minutes or so needed for a test. A distorted retelling of the events might give rise to the idea that a transmission killed the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=R.V. |authorlink=Reginald Victor Jones |title=Most Secret War: British Scientific Intelligence 1939–1945 |date=1978 |publisher=Coronet |isbn=0-340-24169-1 |pages=84,124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern automobile engines are not mechanically but electronically controlled. Disabling the electronics can indeed stop the engine. This has been implemented in [[OnStar]], which has a remote control feature, but this is not a weapon. It is an add-on to the electronics of the car. Because a car is operating on a closed system, it would be impossible to use an electronic means of disengaging an engine, short of electrocuting it via laser or pulse weaponry. See also [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP), which is known for its engine-stopping effect, but is an undirected-energy weapon.

In 2015, Lockheed Martin reported a demonstration of the ATHENA Laser Weapons System that disabled the engine of a truck from a distance of one mile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2015/march/ssc-space-athena-laser.html|title=Turning Up The Heat: Latest Evolution Of Lockheed Martin Laser Weapon System Stops Truck In Field Test|date=March 3, 2015|publisher=[[Lockheed Martin]]|access-date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tesla ===
[[Nikola Tesla]] (1856–1943), a noted inventor, scientist and electrical engineer, developed early high frequency technologies. Tesla worked on plans for a directed-energy weapon from the early 1900s until his death. In 1937, Tesla composed a treatise entitled ''The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media'' concerning charged particle beams.&lt;ref&gt;
Seifer, Marc J., ''Wizard, the Life and Times of Nikola Tesla''. ISBN (HC) pg. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German World War II experimental weapons ===

During the early 1940s [[Axis Powers|Axis]] engineers developed a [[sonic cannon]] that could cause fatal vibrations in its target body. A [[methane gas]] [[combustion chamber]] leading to two [[parabolic dish]]es pulse-detonated at roughly 44 [[Hertz|Hz]]. This [[infrasound]], magnified by the dish reflectors, caused [[vertigo]] and [[nausea]] at {{convert|200|-|400|m|yd}} by vibrating the [[middle ear]] bones and shaking the [[Cochlea|cochlear fluid]] within the [[inner ear]]. At distances of {{convert|50|-|200|m|ft}}, the [[sound wave]]s could act on organ tissues and fluids by repeatedly compressing and releasing compressive resistant organs such as the [[kidney]]s, [[spleen]], and [[liver]]. (It had little detectable effect on malleable organs such as the [[heart]], [[stomach]] and [[intestine]]s.) [[Lung]] tissue was affected at only the closest ranges as [[Atmosphere|atmospheric air]] is highly compressible and only the blood rich [[alveoli]] resist compression. In practice, the [[weapon system]] was highly vulnerable to enemy fire. [[Rifle]], [[bazooka]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds easily deformed the parabolic reflectors, rendering the wave amplification ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Weird Weapons: The Axis |series=Modern Marvels |serieslink=Modern Marvels |network=The History Channel |credits=Martin O'Collins, director |date=21 February 2006 |season=12 |number=8 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later phases of [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] increasingly put its hopes on research into technologically revolutionary secret weapons, the ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n''.

Among the directed-energy weapons the Nazis investigated were [[X-ray]] beam weapons developed under Heinz Schmellenmeier, Richard Gans and Fritz Houtermans. They built an electron accelerator called Rheotron (invented by [[Max Steenbeck]] at [[Siemens-Schuckert]] in the 1930s, these were later called [[Betatron]]s by the Americans) to generate hard X-ray [[synchrotron]] beams for the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM). The intent was to pre-ionize ignition in aircraft engines and hence serve as anti-aircraft DEW and bring planes down into the reach of the FLAK. The Rheotron was captured by the Americans in Burggrub on April 14, 1945.

Another approach was Ernst Schiebolds 'Röntgenkanone' developed from 1943 in Großostheim near [[Aschaffenburg]]. The Company Richert Seifert &amp; Co from Hamburg delivered parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.main-netz.de/nachrichten/region/aschaffenburg/aschaffenburg-land/land/art3986,883119 |title=Forschungsstätte für Hitlers &quot;Todesstrahlen&quot; |publisher=Main-netz.de |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave weapons were investigated together with the Japanese.

=== Strategic Defense Initiative ===
In the 1980s, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] proposed the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) program, which was nicknamed ''[[Star Wars]]''. It suggested that lasers, perhaps space-based [[X-ray laser]]s, could destroy [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] in flight. Panel discussions on the role of high-power lasers in SDI took place at various laser conferences, during the 1980s, with the participation of noted physicists including [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. P.  (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '85'' (STS, McLean, Va, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. J. Duarte|Duarte, F. J.]]  (Ed.), [[The International Conference on Lasers and Applications, Lasers 'XX|''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '87'' (STS, McLean, Va, 1988)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the strategic missile defense concept has continued to the present under the [[Missile Defense Agency]], most of the directed-energy weapon concepts were shelved. However, Boeing has been somewhat successful with the [[Boeing YAL-1]] and [[Boeing NC-135]], the first of which destroyed two missiles in February 2010. Funding has been cut to both of the programs.

=== Iraq War ===

During the [[Iraq War]], electromagnetic weapons, including high power microwaves, were used by the U.S. military to disrupt and destroy  Iraqi electronic systems and may have been used for crowd control. Types and magnitudes of exposure to electromagnetic fields are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;

===Alleged tracking of Space Shuttle ''Challenger''===
The [[Soviet Union]] invested some effort in the development of [[ruby laser|ruby]] and [[carbon dioxide laser]]s as anti-ballistic missile systems, and later as a tracking and anti-satellite system. There are reports that the [[Terra-3]] complex at [[Sary Shagan]] was used on several occasions to temporarily &quot;blind&quot; US spy satellites in the IR range.

It has been claimed that the USSR made use of the lasers at the Terra-3 site to target the Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=FAS&gt;{{cite web|last=Kononenko|first=Boris|title=Silent Space Is Being Monitored|url=https://fas.org/news/russia/1996/druma189_s96005.htm|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane's&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaloga|first=Steven|title=RED STAR WARS|url=http://www.oook.info/dyson/sdi.html|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Soviet Union were concerned that the shuttle was being used as a reconnaissance platform. On 10 October 1984 ([[STS-41-G]]), the Terra-3 tracking laser was allegedly aimed at ''Challenger'' as it passed over the facility. Early reports claimed that this was responsible for causing &quot;malfunctions on the space shuttle and distress to the crew&quot;, and that the United States filed a diplomatic protest about the incident.&lt;ref name=FAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane's&quot;/&gt; However, this story is comprehensively denied by the crew members of STS-41-G and knowledgeable members of the US intelligence community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sts41g.htm |title=STS-41-G |publisher=Astronautix.com |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-lethal weapons ==
The TECOM Technology Symposium in 1997 concluded on [[non-lethal weapons]], &quot;determining the target effects on personnel is the greatest challenge to the testing community&quot;, primarily because  &quot;the potential of injury and death severely limits human tests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Human Effects Advisory Panel Program; presented to: NDIANon-Lethal Defense IV [https://web.archive.org/web/20041114161030/http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/nld4/kenny.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, &quot;directed energy weapons that target the central nervous system and cause neurophysiological disorders may violate the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention of 1980. Weapons that go beyond non-lethal intentions and cause &quot;superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering&quot; may also violate the Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1977.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Non-Lethal Weaponry:  From Tactical to Strategic Applications; Colonel Dennis B. Herbert, USMC (Ret.), program developer, Institute for Non-Lethal Defense Technologies at Pennsylvania State University; pg. 4 [https://web.archive.org/web/20031223201043/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/jfq_pubs/1621.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common bio-effects of non-lethal electromagnetic weapons include:
* Difficulty breathing
* [[Orientation (mental)|Disorientation]]
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Pain]]
* [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]]
* Other systemic discomfort.
Interference with breathing poses the most significant, potentially lethal results.

Light and repetitive visual signals can induce [[epilepsy|epileptic]] seizures. [[Sensory illusions in aviation|Vection]] and [[motion sickness]] can also occur.
