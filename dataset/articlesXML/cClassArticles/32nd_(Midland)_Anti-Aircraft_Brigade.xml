The '''32nd (Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade''' was an air defence formation of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] in Britain's [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) from 1936 to 1955, charged with defending the [[East Midlands]] of England.

==Origin==
The formation was raised on 1 November 1936 at Normanton House, [[Derby]], as '''32nd (South Midland) Anti-Aircraft Group''', forming part of [[2nd Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Anti-Aircraft Division]]. It comprised anti-aircraft (AA) 'brigades' of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) and AA battalions of the [[Royal Engineers]] (RE), but when the RA redesignated its brigades as regiments in 1938, the group adopted the more usual title of '''32nd (Midland) Ant-Aircraft Brigade''' in November 1938. On first formation the brigade comprised the following units:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/2-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1936-38-.pdf 2 AA Division 1936 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 69th (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade RA (TA) – ''Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) unit formed at [[Birmingham]] in 1936 by conversion of the 6th Battalion, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]''
** HQ, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 199th Anti-Aircraft Batteries
* [[High Peak Rifles|40th (The Sherwood Foresters) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA)]] – ''Searchlight unit formed at [[Chesterfield]] in 1936 by conversion of the [[High Peak Rifles|6th Battalion]], [[Sherwood Foresters]]''
** HQ, 358th, 359th, 360th, 361st Anti-Aircraft Companies
* [[Robin Hood Battalion|42nd (The Robin Hoods, Sherwood Foresters) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA)]] – ''Searchlight unit formed at [[Nottingham]] in 1936 by conversion of [[Robin Hood Battalion|7th (Robin Hood Rifles) Battalion]], Sherwood Foresters''
** HQ, 366th, 367th, 368th, 369th Anti-Aircraft Companies
* [[Leicester Town Rifles|44th (The Leicestershire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA)]] – ''Searchlight unit formed at [[Leicester]] in 1936 by conversion of the [[Leicester Town Rifles|4th Battalion]], [[Leicestershire Regiment]]''
** HQ, 374th, 375th, 376th, 377th Anti-Aircraft Companies
* [[Birmingham Rifles|45th (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA)]] – ''Searchlight unit formed at Birmingham in 1936 by conversion of the [[Birmingham Rifles|5th Battalion]], [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]''
** HQ, 378th, 379th, 380th, 381st Anti-Aircraft Companies

All these units had previously been infantry battalions of the former [[46th (North Midland) Division]], which had been converted into 2 AA Division in 1935.&lt;ref name = TA&gt;''TA 1927'' and ''Army Lists''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
With the continued expansion of AA defences, especially after the [[Munich Crisis]] of 1938, new formations appeared, culminating in the creation of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], responsible for all TA air defence units in the UK. As a result of this expansion, some existing units transferred from 32 AA Bde to the new formations, while newly formed units replaced them, although the brigade remained within 2 AA Division. On the outbreak of war its order of battle was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/2-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1939-.pdf 2 AA Division 1939 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=6697&amp;page=1 AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376; Table LX, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[68th (North Midland) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|68 AA Regiment RA]] – ''HAA unit formed in 1936 by conversion of 62nd Field Brigade, Royal Artillery, also from 46th Division''&lt;ref name = TA/&gt;
** 200 &amp; 220 (Derby) AA Btys at Derby
** 276 &amp; 277 AA Btys at Nottingham
* 42 (Robin Hoods) AA Battalion RE – ''see above''
* 44 (Leicester) AA Battalion RE – ''see above''
* [[1st Northamptonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps|50 (Northamptonshire Regiment) AA Battalion RE]] – ''formed in 1937 by conversion of 4th Bn [[Northamptonshire Regiment]]''
** 400, 401, 402, 403 AA Coys
* 32nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade Company, [[Royal Army Service Corps]]

In 1940 the RE AA battalions were transferred to the RA, and that summer the AA regiments of the RA were redesignated Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed. During [[The Blitz]] of 1940–41, 32 AA Bde controlled the following AA units defending the East Midlands:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page49.html 2 AA Division at RA 39–45] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041131/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page49.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/2-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1940-.pdf 2 AA Division 1940 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, Annex D, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the AA Divisions were disbanded in 1942, 32 AA Bde came under the command of [[5th Anti-Aircraft Group (United Kingdom)|5 AA Group]], based in Nottingham, and remained with it for the rest of the war.

==Postwar==
The Brigade was reformed in the TA in 1947, still based at Derby, but renumbered as '''58 AA Brigade (TA)''', with the following composition:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbat.com/site/history/library-new/1946-1990/britishempire/ta47.html The Territorial Army 1947] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303000000/http://www.orbat.com/site/history/library-new/1946-1990/britishempire/ta47.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Bdeon&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/aa-brigades-67-106.html 67–106 Brigades at British Army 1945 on]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 262 (North Midlands) HAA Regt at Derby – formerly 68 (North Midland) HAA (''see above'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/235-265-regiments.html 235–265 Regiments at British Army 1945 on]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 526 HAA Regt at Derby – formerly [[26th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|26 LAA Regiment]]&lt;ref name = 520on&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/520-563-regiments.html 520–563 Regiments at British Army 1945 on]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 528 LAA Regt at Nottingham – formerly [[28th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|28 LAA Regiment]]&lt;ref name = 520on/&gt;
* 575 (6th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters) S/L Regt at Chesterfield – formerly 149 LAA, and before that 40 S/L (''see above'')&lt;ref name = 564on&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/564-591-regiments.html 564–591 Regiments at British Army 1945 on]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 577 (The Robin Hoods, Sherwood Foresters) S/L Regt at Nottingham – formerly 42 S/L (''see above'')&lt;ref name = 564on/&gt;

In 1954, 262 and 526 HAA Regiments amalgamated as 262 Regiment. Then on 10 March 1955, AA Command was disbanded and a number of AA units were disbanded or merged. From 58 AA Bde, 262 HAA Regiment became P (North Midland) Battery of a new 438 LAA Regiment (which also included the former Leicester and Northampton Searchlight Regiments, ''see above''), while 528 and 577 Regiments merged into 350 Regiment in Nottingham. Finally, the brigade was placed in suspended animation on 31 October 1955, and completely disbanded on 31 December 1957.&lt;ref name = Bdeon/&gt;
