{{dyktalk|5 May|2005|entry=...that the '''[[National Socialist Motor Corps]]''' was a motorized paramilitary group of the [[National Socialist German Worker's Party|Nazi Party]], numbering almost 500,000 in membership?}}
== Transfer from [[Talk:National Socialist German Workers Party|NSDAP Talk Page]] ==

I don't think the National Socialist Driver Corps was a paramilitary troop, considering it consisted of all german drivers (as far as I know) and belongs to the category of suborganisations of the NSDAP. By the way, changed it from &quot;Automobil Korps&quot; to &quot;Kraftfahrerkorps&quot;, it did not consist of cars. [[User:Noya Watan|Noya Watan]] 12:56, 2005 May 1 (UTC)
:The Automobile Korps was the predecesor name to the Motor Korps, so you were right to change it.  However, you are incorrect that it was not paramilitary as the group was a part of the SA until 1931 and had paramilitary uniforms and ranks almost identical to the SA.  The group also had plenty of automobiles as well as trucks and motorcycles.  Sources of this is the Third Reich Encyclopedia (1985 Sudwest Verlag) -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 18:59, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
::Hmm, seems I've better listened more carefully in my history lessons. Thanks for clarifying, I was simply not sure about it, and its a rather sensitive topic, so I thought I'd better ask.
::But, I do not understand the translation, the term &quot;Kraftfahrer&quot; refers to &quot;driver&quot;, not to &quot;motor&quot;, so I do not know why it should be &quot;National Socialist Motor Corps&quot;, rather than &quot;National Socialist Drivers Corps&quot;. [[User:Noya Watan|Noya Watan]] 20:27, 2005 May 1 (UTC)
::You inspired me to write a big old [[National Socialist Motor Corps|article]] about it.  Good point about the literal translation.  Who knows what they were thinking back in 1931. -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 20:47, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
:::And it is really called &quot;Motor Corps&quot; in English? If it's so, I'll make a redirect from &quot;National Socialist Drivers Corps&quot; to your page (by the way, good article) for the &quot;more literal translaters&quot; or german readers visiting the english wikipedia. [[User:Noya Watan|Noya Watan]] 21:09, 2005 May 1 (UTC)
I made the redirect page as per your suggestion and added the alternate title in the article.  I think its called that in the UK.  Most American textbooks list it as &quot;Motor Corps&quot;.
:Wow, I bow before you, doing all this just because I asked for clarification ... *deeply impressed*, true spirit of wikipedia found ;-). [[User:Noya Watan|Noya Watan]] 21:44, 2005 May 1 (UTC)
::I also needed something to do on a Sunday afternoon ;-) -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 21:50, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
:::Yeah, editing wikipedia is exactly what I do Sunday afternoons ... anyway, I think I'll have to leave for now, tomorrow I'll come back and see what I can do. Good night. [[User:Noya Watan|Noya Watan]] 22:03, 2005 May 1 (UTC)

== Proper Name ==

Shouldn't the German name for the organization be mentioned? [[User:John Kenney|john]] [[User_talk:John Kenney|k]] 21:07, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
:Excellent point.  I added this name as well as the alternate name of &quot;Drivers Corps&quot;. -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 21:12, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

== Roadside assistance group comparison ==

''&quot;In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, much comparable to the modern day American Automobile Association.&quot;''

Why is the NSKK being compared to a US organisation? Is there a specific similarity? Wouldn't it make more sense to change it into something like this?

''&quot;In the mid 1930s, the NSKK also served as a roadside assistance group, much comparable to modern day organisations such as the German ADAC.&quot;''

[[User:JeroenHoek|JeroenHoek]] 17:50, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:I think Triple A is a very good comparison as most people will understand it and it links to a very comprehensive article on roadside assistance.  We are not saying AAA people are Nazis, only that the emergency road side features of the NSKK were similar. -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 17:33, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

::I'm not worried about such a comparison, but I don't think the AAA is that well-known outside of the US because most countries have their own roadside assistance organisations (which is why a mention of the German ADAC seems appropriate). I do agree that it seems to be the only organisation of its kind with an extensive article on Wikipedia. Perhaps a mention of both the German and the American groups would be preferable?

::[[de:ADAC|German Wikipedia ADAC article]] ~ [[User:JeroenHoek|JeroenHoek]] 17:50, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:::Sounds like a plan!  Id like to learn about what the ADAC is.  I image those autobahns can get pretty rough with no speed limit. -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 18:04, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

'''[[:Image:NSKK.png]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:NSKK.png|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.
