[[Citing fuel and maintenance costs]], the Thunderbirds aerobatic display team of the U.S. Air Force used the T-38 Talon from 1974 until 1983 when it was replaced by the F-16 Fighting Falcon.'''

The underlined phrase is vague.

Were fuel and maintenance costs the reason they continued using the t-38 from 74 to 83 (e.g. it was the least expensive option at the time) or was that the reason they abandoned it for teh F-16 (because it was too expensive)?

Actually, fuel and maintenance costs were the reason they were flown from 74 until 83 (post Vietnam war, oil crisis).  The T-38 is a very inexpensive aircraft to fly and that is why it will still be operating as a advanced flight trainer until 2020.


== History ==
The statement &quot;...it is estimated that some 50,000 military pilots have trained on this aircraft&quot; seems to be an understatement.  From the early '60s until the early '90s, every USAF pilot training student flew the T-38.  Since the '90s, about 30% of the USAF pilot trainees have flown the T-38.  During the Cold War the USAF had at least 20,000 pilots at any given time, and today it must be around 15,000.  The total number of pilots who trained on the T-38 must be at least 150,000.  Does anyone have a better number than 50,000? [[User:Hildenja|Hildenja]] 17:55, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
:Check the given source for this one. Realize that there are likely only 100-400 students that complete training at each base each year. While the cadre of Air Force pilots does primarily come from UPT, there are other sources of training. Some are pilots that have transferred from the Army/Navy. Others flew with the Navy in joint training. Others may be reservists who got experience from flying with the airlines. Still others got training prior to the introduction of the T-38. That said, 50,000 to 70,000 seems pretty close (there was a significant drawdown in pilot training after Vietnam...a kneejerk reaction by nearsighted politicians...) &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: maroon; color: white&quot;&gt;[[User:BQZip01|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;'''— ''BQZip01'' —'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:BQZip01|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:22, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

== Picture error ==

The picture labled as a restored t-38 is infact an f-5. I believe it is the B model, but you can tell it is not a t-38 because  of the wingtip rails used to mount fuel tanks or missiles.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.27.56.209|76.27.56.209]] ([[User talk:76.27.56.209|talk]]) 02:41, 11 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::??? Appears to be a T-38. Note the dual canopies. F-5s don't have those. While there is certainly only one pilot on board, it cartainly can fly with only one person. Furthermore, some T-38s have those connection points or perhaps they were taken from an F-5, but the fuselage looks nothing like an F-5. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: maroon; color: white&quot;&gt;[[User:BQZip01|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;'''—&amp;nbsp;''BQZip01''&amp;nbsp;—'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:BQZip01|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:56, 11 May 2008 (UTC)

Dry thrust and thrust with afterburner should have the same units, no?  lb vs. lbf (foot-lbs?). --[[User:InsufficientData|InsufficientData]] ([[User talk:InsufficientData|talk]]) 09:18, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

I found this image of a t-38, thought it might be a better image then that which is already here:

== Aircraft on display ==

There is an T-38 on static display at the main gate of Beale AFB, CA.  The base also has a number of T-38's that are supported by Lockheed Martin, but are Air Force owned.  These aircraft are painted in black. 07:50, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

== Use by shuttle astronauts ==
There seems to be (or have been, now) something of a tradition of space shuttle crews arriving at the launch site in these aircraft prior to their missions. See e.g. [http://www.universetoday.com/83456/discoverys-final-crew-arrives-at-nasas-kennedy-space-center/ this report]. What was the reason for that? [[User:Beorhtwulf|Beorhtwulf]] ([[User talk:Beorhtwulf|talk]]) 19:30, 23 August 2011 (UTC)

:That is a long-standing tradition, back to the Gemini and Apollo days. The astronauts would habitually fly in the T-38 to do ''all'' of their business travel from their base in Houston (e.g., to spacecraft contractor sites), and that includes to KSC for launch.

== Safety record improvement? ==

A question occurred to me, in the same vein as the above thread, while looking through the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] article. I find it surprising that the four Gemini-Apollo era astronaut fatalaties listed here are the only ones (for ''astronauts''), in light of the fact that there were approximately 54 in the first five groups back then, a rate of one in 13.5. Since many more astronauts have been added since then, and the article gives the current active number at 53, wouldn't it be reasonable to expect several more fatalities since 1967? If they're still flying the T-38's, what caused the safety record to improve? Or are we missing more T-38 astronaut fatalaties?

== Mention of Pakistan as an operator ==

Someone had added Pakistan to the list of operators after unconfirmed rumors of Turkey donating a number of T-38 to Pakistan. Turkey is indeed donating some jet trainers to Pakistan, but they are Cessna T-37's, not T-38 Talons. 

Turkish Air Force uses its T-38 fleet very actively, and does not have any T-38 to spare as gifts to any country. I removed Pakistan from the list of operators.

== T-38 Fact Sheet update ==

The article uses an archived version of the USAF's T-38 Fact Sheet as a reference.  The current Fact Sheet is located at: http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/224/Article/104569/t-38-talon.aspx  It states that the USAF has 546 T-38 aircraft (as of January 2014), while the article says 508 (as of September 2012), from a different source.

== T-38 on display ==

This one is missing from the list. Its tail number is 10806 and was built in 1961. Was retired from the USAF in 1994 and installed on this pedestal by the American Legion in 1996.

== Germany still operates the T-38 ==

The article lists Germany as en ex-operator of the airraft, however the Luftwaffe still operates some 35 T-38C. They are based at Sheppard AFB with the 80th Flying Training Wing. Due to legal reasons, the planes fly in US markings but still are property of the Luftwaffe.
