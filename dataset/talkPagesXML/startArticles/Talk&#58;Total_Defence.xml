==Implications==

Content transferred from article:
:''By expanding the notion of defence to encompass all segments of society and everything people do, there is the possibility that failure to support any aspect of Total Defence can be seen as being unpatriotic and inimical to the sovereignty of Singapore, especially as the tenets of Total Defence are elucidated and promulgated by the government, which in Singapore is very much conflated with the PAP, the ruling party for the last 3 decades.''
:''For example, graduates refusing to retrain and sell fried chestnuts in the market could be seen as undermining Economic Defence, and decrying governmental social engineering in the form of HDB racial quotas could be seen as being injurious to Social Defence.''
:''Psychological Defence also raises the question of whether one must support one's country in all circumstances, even if it is in the wrong.''

Please provide citations or examples for the above, especially the fried chestnuts case. --[[User:Vsion|Vsion]] ([[User talk:Vsion|talk]]) 21:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

==Fair use rationale for Image:Total defence logo.png==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Total defence logo.png]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Total defence logo.png|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

What's the deal with all the talk about Singapore? [[Special:Contributions/122.106.202.24|122.106.202.24]] ([[User talk:122.106.202.24|talk]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment was added on 11:52, 17 February 2009 (UTC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Nominating for neutrality evaluation ==
This page needs to be checked for neutrality. [[User:Veinofstars|Veinofstars]] ([[User talk:Veinofstars|talk]]) 19:11, 10 December 2008 (UTC)

== WRT edit summary for recent edit. ==

My assertion that the removed text was biased comes from the tone and obvious &quot;position&quot; of the text (Or position of the writer) and completely uncritical repetition of the official definition. As to it being copied and pasted, a quick search of various phrases on Google shows that the text was in many cases taken directly from various official websites. For example: http://www.google.com/search?q=%22brings+together+all+relevant+government+agencies%2C+private+sector+organisations+and%22+site%3A.sg

Even if the websites being copied are not copyrighted, just lifting text from governmental websites that make no pretense of neutrality (and are too close to the subject to be neutral anyway) is a recipe for a biased articel.

== Globalize ==

I have added {{tl|Globalize}} to this page, as I think that the term ''Total Defence'' is a common term and not just limited to Singaporre. As the article states the term is &quot;''adapted from countries like Sweden and Switzerland''&quot;. In Sweden the term is ''totalförsvaret'' which translates directly to ''total defence''. In Denmark as similar term ''totalforsvar'' is used to describe this (don't know about Switzerland). I'm in doubt if this page should be moved to an independent Singapore-version or it should be expanded to include country specific usages similar to i.e. [[lifeguard]] and many others. Any thoughts would be appreciated. --[[User:Hebster|Hebster]] ([[User talk:Hebster|talk]]) 10:56, 2 January 2010 (UTC)

:Sorry, didn't see your note here. The article as it stands is purely about the Singaporean perspective. If there are no other articles which use this name or something very similar as their title, there is no need to disambiguate by &quot;Total Defence (Singapore)&quot; or similar. When such articles are eventually written, we can consider turning this into a disambiguation page, or to an overview page of the various forms of such ideas. --[[User:Rifleman 82|Rifleman 82]] ([[User talk:Rifleman 82|talk]]) 11:06, 24 February 2010 (UTC)

::That's quite okay :). My point was that since Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland also uses this term and more or less the same principle/definition, the article should contain information about those as well. --[[User:Hebster|Hebster]] ([[User talk:Hebster|talk]]) 08:15, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

== Suggestion for the content merged from [[Total Defence Day]] ==

I don't see any references supporting the content in the [[Total Defence Day]] article (which is short), probably except for the official website. I also see content about the warning signal and what the date is about in the [[Total Defence]] article, not just in the [[Total Defence Day]] article. So I may suggest merging the non-redundant contents from [[Total Defence Day]] into here with the new level three heading &quot;Events&quot; or some equivalent on the section &quot;Initiatives&quot;. --[[User:Merlion444|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#ed2939;padding:2px;color:white; 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''Merlion'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Merlion444|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#287121&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''444'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] 12:34, 23 February 2010 (UTC)
