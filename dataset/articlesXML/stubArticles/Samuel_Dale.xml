'''Samuel Dale''' (1772 &amp;ndash; {{#formatdate:May 24, 1841}}), known as the &quot;Daniel Boone of Alabama&quot;, was an American frontiersman, trader, miller, hunter, scout, courier, soldier, spy, army officer, and politician, who fought under General [[Andrew Jackson]], in the [[Creek War|Creek War of 1813-1814]], later, becoming a brigadier general in the U.S. Army, and an advocate for Alabama statehood.

Samuel Dale was born in 1772, in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]] to [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] parents, from Pennsylvania. As a boy, both he and his parents moved, many times, with westward border expansion, most notably in 1775 and 1783. With the death of his parents in December 1792, he was responsible for the welfare of eight younger children. From 1793&amp;ndash;96 he served as a [[United States Government]] [[Reconnaissance|scout]]. He abandoned work as a trader between [[Savannah, Georgia]] and the border settlements and as a mill owner-operator to guide immigrants into [[Mississippi]], over [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands.

Dale was present, in 1811, when [[Tecumseh]] enlisted local [[Alabama]] Native Americans to fight against Americans, during his campaign to establish a pan-Indian confederacy. Dale was involved in, many of, these confrontations, particularly in 1814, when he served as a [[courier]] bringing documents to [[Andrew Jackson]] in [[New Orleans]], from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in just eight days.

&quot;General Dale, as a scout, a pilot to the emigrants who blazed the first path through the Creek Nation, from Georgia to Tombigby, with arms in there hands, and subsequently, as a spy among the Spaniards, at Pensacola, and as a partisan officer, during the most sanguinary epochs of the late war(1813 First Creek War - Red Stick War), present at every butchery, remarkable for &quot;hair-breadth 'scapes,&quot; for caution and coolness in desperate emergencies, for exhibitions of gigantic personal strength and great moral courage, his story is studded over with spirit-stirring incidents, unsurpassed by any thing in legend or history.  His celebrated 'canoe fight,' where, in the Alabama river, he, with Smith and Jeremiah Austill, fought nine warriors, with clubbed rifles, killed them all, and rowed to shore, would be thought fabulous, if it had not been witnessed by many soldiers, standing upon the banks, who could render them no assistance.  Some years before, he was attacked by two warriors, who shouted their war-whoop, as he was kneeling down to drink, and rushed upon him with their tomahawks.  He knifed them both, and, though bleeding from five wounds, he retraced their trail nine miles, crept stealthily to their camp, brained three sleeping warriors and cut the thongs of a female prisoner, who lay by their side.  While in this act, however, a fourth sprang upon him, from behind a log.  Taken at such a disadvantage, and exhausted by the loss of blood, he sank under the serpent-grasp of the savage, who, with a yell of triumph, drew his knife, and, in a few moments, would have closed the contest.  At that instant, however, the woman drove a tomahawk deep into the head of the Indian, and thus preserved the life of her deliverer''.&quot; From &quot;History of Alabama, and incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the earliest period, Volume II&quot; by Albert James Pickett, 1851

Dale was elected to the first [[Alabama General Assembly]] in 1817, serving until 1829. As a [[legislator]] and distinguished veteran [[brigadier general]], he and four other men received the visiting [[Marquis de Lafayette]] of [[France]] into [[Alabama]]. A decade later, he was accidentally injured and was not able to carry out the illegal (against a ruling of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]) forced relocation of the local [[Choctaw language|Choctaw-speaking]] Indians the complete distance from Alabama and Mississippi to their assigned territories in [[Oklahoma]]. General Dale was the first elected member of the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] to come from [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi]]. He next visited [[Washington, D.C.]], to request compensation for the supplies that were bought for his troops. He was disappointed when he received no recognition from the Federal Government.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Dale died on May 24, 1841, in Lauderdale County, Mississippi, and was buried there near [[Daleville, Mississippi|Daleville]], which was named in his honor.  [[Dale County, Alabama]] is also named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lewis | first = Herbert J. &quot;Jim&quot; | title = Samuel Dale | publisher = Encyclopedia of Alabama | date = July 25, 2012 | url = http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2460}}&lt;/ref&gt;
