== Balli Kombetar ==
[[Balli Kombetar]] according to plenty of sources collaborated with the Nazis. Not with Fascist Italians though, the statement that the Nazis engaged previous collaborators of the Italians such as Balli Kombetar, etc should be corrected.
&lt;br&gt;The article [[Albanian resistance during World War II]] clearly states them on the Nazi side from 1943 and on the other side before 1943.

:You're going to need a reliable scholarly source to even have that version of events included in the article. Tomasevich is highly reliable academic source, and his version of events will remain. You can't use WP articles as a reference, that would be [[WP:CIRCULAR]]. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 21:36, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

== ''Operations'' ? ==

Maybe ''Operations, war crimes''?[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 06:07, 14 May 2015 (UTC)

== Oder–Neisse vs police regiment ==

This text is unclear:
:The men from II Battalion fought with the Prinz Eugen until February 1945, when they were sent north to defend the Oder–Neisse line.[61] That month, the battalion was disbanded altogether and its remaining manpower was assigned to the German police regiment near Zagreb.
It sounds like the sequence for II Battalion in February 1945 was...
# fighting in Yugoslavia alongside Prinz Eugen
# defending the Oder–Neisse line
# police regiment near Zagreb
...but that seems implausible. Did they really go all the way north to Oder-Neisse only to come back down south weeks later? [[User:Jnestorius|jnestorius]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Jnestorius|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 12:43, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
:Details in Stein are sparse, but the article doesn't actually say they did any fighting on the Oder line, only that they were sent north. Tomasevich provides more detail, and he is the one that says they were re-assigned to Zagreb. I think I'll pull the Oder line information from Stein out and put it in a note. Thanks for the comment.

[[:21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)]] → {{no redirect|21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg}} – There are no other articles that could be referred to as &quot;21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg&quot;, therefore the parenthetical disambiguator is unnecessary. For an example of an article about a military division that has rightly avoided unnecessary disambiguation, see [[24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstjäger]]. [[User:Neelix|Neelix]] ([[User talk:Neelix|talk]]) 20:04, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
*'''Support''' per [[WP:MILMOS#UNITNAME]]. Its recommendation for pre-disambiguation is questionable, but fortunately not an issue here. This unit's name is &quot;clearly unique&quot; and does not need disambiguation. Many other members of {{cat|Foreign volunteer units of the Waffen-SS}} already don't have superfluous disambiguators; at a glance, some of the others can safely drop theirs. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 20:28, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
*'''Support''' per above. [[User:Khestwol|Khestwol]] ([[User talk:Khestwol|talk]]) 21:50, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
::'''Comment''', it appears many other SS Divisions at [[Template:SS Divisions]] also need more [[WP:CONCISE]] titles. They all should have [[WP:CONSISTENCY]] in their title pattern. [[User:Khestwol|Khestwol]] ([[User talk:Khestwol|talk]]) 22:03, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' if you want short names, any one of &quot;[[21st Waffen SS Division]]&quot;, &quot;[[1st Albanian Waffen SS Division]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Skanderbeg Waffen SS Division]]&quot; would do. I can never tell whether a Wikiproject outside my fields of knowledge is applying [[WP:COMMONNAME]] in a correct manner not obvious to the uninitated, or just has a [[WP:LOCALCONSENSUS]] to ignore WP:COMMONNAME and do something fancy for some [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=276 nerdview] reason. [[User:Jnestorius|jnestorius]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Jnestorius|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 21:53, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' (1st Albanian) isn't disambiguation, it is part of the translation of the official name. The reason ''Karstjager'' doesn't have it is because the division didn't have one as part of its name. But some of the comments here reflect a lack of knowledge of the subject. This is one of four Balkan Waffen divisions of the SS I've helped get to FA, and so far as I know, they are the only SS divisions at FA. The comments about about consistency and what other &quot;short&quot; name structures would be acceptable show a lack of understanding about the structure of these &quot;foreign&quot; SS division names. SS division names aren't consistent, because they weren't consistent. The structure indicates something about the division, these foreign divisions are called &quot;Waffen&quot; divisions &quot;of the SS&quot; rather than &quot;Foost SS Division&quot; because they were made up largely of non-Germans. However, if the consensus is for dropping the &quot;(1st Albanian)&quot; in the article title, that's ok with me. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 23:46, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
** [[WP:NAME]] is not [[WP:OFFICIALNAMES]]. [[User:Jnestorius|jnestorius]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Jnestorius|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 09:06, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
*** Yes, I know that. However, your suggestions are not based on UCN either, and you clearly don't get the nuances. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 09:14, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' As per common name the article name would be '''Skanderbeg Division'''. See also [[Walloon Legion]].--[[User_talk:Zoupan|Z&lt;small&gt;oupan&lt;/small&gt;]] 12:17, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
:*what evidence do you have that is the common name? Unsupported conjecture at this stage... [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 13:30, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
::It is obviously the short name, and more oftenly used than the official name based on Gbooks and Gscholar. I don't think I'm obliged to present the results, you'll have to take my word, or refute my conclusion. It is commonly recognized as such, and does support Recognizability, Naturalness and Conciseness.--[[User_talk:Zoupan|Z&lt;small&gt;oupan&lt;/small&gt;]] 14:43, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
:::I'll do neither. If you make a claim, you back it up. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 22:30, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
* '''Comment''': I've produced some data, based on the first one-third of the article sources (or rather the subset I could search on Google Books). I checked the cited pages and/or the index.  Perhaps if this table were completed the debate might proceed on the basis of information rather than assertion. [[User:Jnestorius|jnestorius]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Jnestorius|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 15:23, 16 May 2015 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - While it is possible that there is a better title for this article than [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg]], there seems to be clear consensus that the parenthetical disambiguator &quot;(1st Albanian)&quot; is inappropriate. We can certainly discuss other title options, but I recommend that we remove the disambiguator in the meantime. [[User:Neelix|Neelix]] ([[User talk:Neelix|talk]]) 20:26, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' As I've already said, it is not a disambiguator, it's part of the official name. But go right ahead with removing the (1st Albanian) as that appears to be the consensus. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|crack... thump]]) 23:13, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
