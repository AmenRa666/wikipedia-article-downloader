'''USS ''Hunley'' (AS-31)''' was a [[submarine tender]] of the [[United States Navy]] launched on 28 September 1961 and commissioned 16 June 1962. The ''Hunley'' was designed to tend most of the long-term requirements of the Polaris Class of submarines. The ship achieved several records and milestones in its service. The ''Hunley'' was decommissioned from the regular navy, in 1995 transferred to the US [[Maritime Commission]], and in 2007 sold as scrap to a metal recycling company in Louisiana. In September 2008, during Hurricane Gustav, the decommissioned ship broke free of its moorings in the [[Industrial Canal|New Orleans Inner Harbor]],  but caused little or no damage while adrift. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2008/09/hold_please.html Coast Guard trying to secure a barge and two vessels in the Industrial Canal] by Michelle Krupa, The Times-Picayune. Monday September 01, 2008, &lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and Construction==
''Hunley'' had the distinction of being the first ship designed and built from the [[keel]] up to service and maintain the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Fleet. She had complete facilities for servicing the complex [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris Weapons Systems]] and for accomplishing any [[submarine]] repair other than a major [[shipyard]] overhaul. The hull was laid down in  by the [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company]], [[Newport News, Virginia]] and sponsored by Mrs. J. Palmer Gaillard, wife of the Mayor of [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  The ship was named in honor of Horace Lawson Hunley, the designer of the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in naval history, the Confederate submarine [[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|H. L. Hunley]].

==Career==
With Captain Douglas N. Syverson in command, ''Hunley'' sailed 25 July 1962 for [[sea trial|shakedown]] training off [[Cuba]] until 6 September 1962. She visited several Gulf and Atlantic ports and returned to [[Norfolk]] 28 September for post-shakedown alterations until 8 December, 1962. After which the ''Hunley'' paid a 3-day visit to [[New York City]] to host the Naval Reserve Officers Seminar &quot;New Ships for the Modern Navy&quot;. She departed from the Norfolk Operating Base 29 December 1962 for [[Holy Loch]], [[Scotland]], arriving 9 January 1963. Almost immediately she began taking the load off [[USS Proteus (AS-19)|USS ''Proteus'']], whom she officially relieved 15 March 1963 as tender to [[SUBRON|Submarine Squadron 14]] at Holy Loch. This duty continued until 12 April 1964 when ''Hunley'' sailed for conversion that provided capability of handling the new A3 Polaris Missile. She resumed her duties at Holy Loch on 15 June 1964.

[[File:USS Hunley (AS-31) Holy Loch 1981.jpeg|thumb|USS ''Hunley'' servicing SSBNs at Holy Loch, Scotland (UK), 1981.]]

A Polaris milestone was reached in December 1965 when [[USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610)|USS ''Thomas A. Edison'']] came alongside to commence the 100th refit of a nuclear ballistic submarine (SSBN) by the ''Hunley''. This signified that one hundred SSBN submarines had gone out on time from ''Hunley'' and not one of them had to make an early return from patrol. This represented some 200 months of Polaris on station or 16Â½ years of submerged strategic deterrent since ''Hunley's'' arrival in Holy Loch 9 January 1963. ''Hunley's'' motto was &quot;We Serve to Preserve Peace&quot;. ''Hunley'' returned to the United States late in 1966. She was deployed to Guam under the Command of Captain Thomas and navigated by Lt James Gutierrez. Leaving the day after Christmas 1967, she passed through the Panama Canal on New Years Eve. In Guam she relieved the Proteus to allow the Proteus to overhaul herself there in Apra harbor. In 1968 she returned to Charleston, South Carolina under the command of Captain Anders. In 1971 Hunley again relieved Proteus in Guam in order for Proteus to go to the shipyard. It was while Hunley was in Guam that the Machinery Repair Division received the Meritorious Unit Commendation having expended 4500 hours of repair labor on various units of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In 1973 Hunley returned to Bremerton Shipyard for conversion overhaul. After completion Hunley returned to Charleston South Carolina to again service the Atlantic Submarine Fleet.

''Hunley'' was decommissioned on 30 September 1994 and struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 3 May 1995 and turned over to the [[Maritime Commission]] on 1 May 1999. ''Hunley'' was subsequently sold to the [[Southern Scrap Materials Company]] on 5 January 2007 for scrapping.

==Advanced capabilities==
Among jobs carried out by ''Hunley'' was welding on SSBN [[Submarine hull#Pressure hull|pressure hulls]] or reactor plant fluid systems. Once unheard of in submarine tending, these jobs were only a few of many carried out by ''Hunley's'' crew. These and many other alterations were carried out as a matter of routine to keep SSBN's on the line with the newest possible technical improvements and safety devices. For example, an auxiliary &quot;Sub-Safe&quot; package was accomplished on the [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (SSBN-600)|USS ''Theodore Roosevelt'']] in which over 40 fittings and more than 100 feet of new piping in a major system were installed. A battery replacement for the [[USS Ethan Allen (SSBN-608)|USS ''Ethan Allen'']] was completed in only 11 days. ''Hunley'' met demands from making water-borne [[Propeller#Marine|propeller]] replacements to encapsulation of [[Induction motor|AC induction motors]]; delicate repairs to navigation and fire control, and many other varied tasks to ensure that each SSBN had the finest of care on each refit. In 1976 from June through September an Extended Refit was performed on an SSBN assigned to Hunley and a tiger team made up from the Hunley the SSBN and the Charleston shipyard completed an in drydock overhaul of many systems as well as hull and propeller. The Hunley team leaders were Lt. Charles (Chuck) Emery, Engine Chief Petty Officer G.A. Page and a second class Petty Officer George Campbell. After the ERP and the paperwork was completed the SSBN returned to her duties in the Atlantic.

==Stowaway incident==
After a 1973 port call in [[Sydney]], en route to [[Pearl Harbor]], two teenage girls from [[New Zealand]] were found hiding out in one of the ''Hunley's'' [[missile crane]] control cabs, when a sailor was spotted carrying food up the ladder to the crane. ''Hunley'' was diverted to [[Brisbane]] to offload the [[stowaway]]s, and the &quot;helpful&quot; sailors were disciplined.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tendertale.com/ttsp/ttsp.html Hunley stowaway incident], see report of From W. Wiacek, and the  Note from Webmaster, who confuses the Hunley with the Proteus; see talk.&lt;/ref&gt;
