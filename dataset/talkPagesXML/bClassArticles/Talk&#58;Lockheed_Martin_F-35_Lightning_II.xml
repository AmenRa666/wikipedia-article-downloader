== Article too long? ==
As of right now this article has a prose size of 105 KB. Per [[WP:SIZERULE]], articles with prose size over 100 KB should &quot;almost certainly should be divided&quot;. Would it be appropriate to split portions of this article into sub-articles? The most obvious section to be split would be the Program cost increases and delays section, which has an {{tl|undue}} tag on it due to its length. Thoughts? [[User:SSTflyer|sst✈]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SSTflyer#top|(discuss)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:00, 1 December 2015 (UTC)

:Surely that would be a considered a POV fork and thus not a good idea? [[User:Antiochus the Great|Antiochus the Great]] ([[User talk:Antiochus the Great|talk]]) 16:57, 1 December 2015 (UTC)

::Some subjects are just larger than others, which is why [[WP:SIZERULE]] is a guideline and not a rule or policy and therefore not mandatory. The procurement articles have already been split out of here to make this smaller. - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 18:28, 1 December 2015 (UTC)

:::While it is certainly true that a guideline is not an absolute rule, it is meant to encourage editors to find ways to adhere to them when possible. Moving the program cost section to its own article as [[User:SSTflyer|SSTflyer]] suggests, leaving only a brief summary of its most important aspects here in the main F-35 article, would certainly put it in a better position of compliance.

:::I also completely disagree with [[User:Antiochus the Great|Antiochus the Great]]'s claim that doing so would be a [[WP:POVFORK|POV fork]]. We wouldn't have two articles with similar names competing with each other, nor would we be attempting to give undue prominence to a minority point of view. The new article created would maintain its current level of balance of opposing viewpoints, only it would exist in a different article. --[[User:GoneIn60|GoneIn60]] ([[User talk:GoneIn60|talk]]) 06:24, 5 February 2016 (UTC)

::::The development section (as a whole) is indeed extremely long. I would however, at this time, opt to leave it in. Once the plane is fully operational in significant numbers, we might consider splitting off the then largely historical development section. But let's leave it in as long as it is so central to current ongoing debate. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] ([[User talk:Arnoutf|talk]]) 17:47, 5 February 2016 (UTC)

:::::It's 2016, the plane is flying and operating normally for a newly deployed airframe, and you guys are still leaving in the bashing section, which is probably courtesy of the Russian government. I have faith that one day this article won't look like the ridiculous attempt to discredit the plane that it is. [[User:Torriende|Torriende]] ([[User talk:Torriende|talk]]) 04:21, 5 May 2016 (UTC)
::::::Most of those two sections could be outright deleted. The majority of it is worthless conjecture, speculation or media spin wildly exaggerated. I'd be inclined to condense it down to the Pentagon reports over performance issues and then how these issues were fixed, and any official Audit reports that outline the cost overruns, why those occurred, and what measures were put in place to prevent further cost overruns. Left as is, it is very off-putting to any reader and 99% will skip those large blocks of boring text anyway. [[User:Antiochus the Great|Antiochus the Great]] ([[User talk:Antiochus the Great|talk]]) 19:59, 27 July 2016 (UTC)
:::::::I would agree with [[User:Antiochus the Great]] most of the stuff was just speculation and tabloid stuff added to the article during development most of which is as Antiochus has said could be condensed and summarised. [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] ([[User talk:MilborneOne|talk]]) 20:04, 27 July 2016 (UTC)

==Resolving Undue Weight template==
Continuing from the previous Article too long? -discussion: There's been an Undue Weight -template in the article since May 2015. Perhaps we should finally do something about it. I'm considering moving the most bloated chapters ''Program cost overruns and delays'' and ''Concerns over performance and safety'' into one sub-article. Only some of their content would be left and the rest would be placed into new main article (like [[Joint Strike Fighter program]] for chapter JSF program requirements and selection). Any opinions regarding this? --[[User:Ras|Ras]] ([[User talk:Ras|talk]]) 20:21, 18 October 2016 (UTC)
:I think this has to be approached carefully. The most unique thing about this aircraft has been it development problems and this shouldn't be moved or cut without careful consideration. - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 20:42, 18 October 2016 (UTC)
:: I agree with the OP, good idea to move into one sub-article, giving consideration to [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]]'s concerns. [[User:Twobells|Twobells]] ([[User talk:Twobells|talk]]) 12:07, 22 October 2016 (UTC)

== Page won't edit properly ==

For some reason, on this article only (so far), it's almost impossible to edit the page. When I click &quot;edit&quot;, it sits and thinks and thinks, then finally tells me the &quot;A script has stopped working&quot;. It'll go half way into edit mode, but the text is still solid like when it's an article. Try to reload it, and the same thing happens, or the blue bar gets halfway across and stops. When you finally get it to give you an edit page with a cursor, as you type, the letters will suddenly stop typing, and delay for 10 seconds before catching up. When I finally managed to get the two sentences I wanted to add typed, I click on &quot;Cite&quot;; the button goes grey, like it had been clicked, and it sits and thinks for thirty seconds. I click it again, and suddenly a random citation number &quot;635&quot; pops up next to my text: I haven't even entered an address or title yet, so I have no idea what citation it's trying to give to my text! I delete this, and decide to just enter the address in the text, maybe someone can fix it later. I try to save it, and after thinking about it for a while, it tells me there was an error and it can't save. Try again, same thing happens. So, go back to previous page, forward to &quot;F-35&quot; again, click &quot;Edit&quot;, same damn $%#! happens, only this time it finally lets me save. What is it with this particular page that makes it act like this? I've edited other pages since, and they work fine, but this one's still doing this. Is this an extra subtle way of discouraging people from editing or vandalizing the page, or what? It's very frustrating.[[User:AnnaGoFast|AnnaGoFast]] ([[User talk:AnnaGoFast|talk]]) 00:53, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
:In testing the page it edits fine using Firefox 46.0.1 on Linux. I suspect the problem may be your browser. Which browser and version are you using? - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]])

:It's probably because the page is way too big (over 317,000 bytes now), and your browser can't handle the page size. Can you edit sections without problems? I can't edit the whole article on my tablet, but I can edit sections. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 01:49, 21 May 2016 (UTC)

==Dogfight==

I read in the paper today that an F-35  recently lost a (mock) dogfight to a 1970s fighter.  Is it so?  is it relevant? [[Special:Contributions/64.53.191.77|64.53.191.77]] ([[User talk:64.53.191.77|talk]]) 16:07, 8 September 2016 (UTC)
:Are you referring to [http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/f-35-loses-dogfight-to-fighter-jet-from-the-1980s/ this]? - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 16:56, 8 September 2016 (UTC)
:: That is mentioned in the article as &quot;F-35 to be less maneuverable than an older F-16D&quot; in the &quot;Concerns over performance and safety&quot; section. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 18:05, 8 September 2016 (UTC)
