== Renaming ==

As this article also details the northward migration as well as the southward one, I suggest renaming it [[Vietnamese migration of 1954]], as the Vietnamese article had done. [[User:DHN|DHN]] 22:25, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

== Prados and numbers ==

The numbers cited are from the most recent piece of research based on US Navy Records by respected historian John Prados, , author of ''Valley of Decisions: The Siege of Khe Sanh'', ''The Sky Would Fall: Operation Vulture - the US Bombing Mission in Indochina'', ''Lost Crusader: The Secret Wars of CIA Director William Colby'', and ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA'' among several others, and senior analyst at the [[National Security Archive]].  Please do not rubbish scholarship just because you don't happen to like its results.  The article carefully explains how the figure of one million was a propaganda piece, and that of the 800,000 actually transported in Operation Passage to Freedom, 350,000 were either military or non-Vietnamese.

:Well, it seems that he is still in the minority and isn't the mainstream yet. All the other books I have consulted still all use 800-1,000.

::That would be because they are all quoting other secondary sources, whereas this is a piece of primary research using the French and U.S. Navy records.  The numbers quoted within it are the precise numbers transported as recorded by those who were organising and carrying out the transportation.  Indeed within the article there appears to be the inflation of numbers and ignoring of sources you cite elsewhere when their numbers do not match the one million claim (e.g. the article currently claims that 'North Vietnam' had 1.5 million Catholics, whereas Seth Jacob's book, which is heavily cited elsewhere, says that it only had one million, and that of these 55% moved south, rather than 60% quoted in the article (although Jacobs cites no source for this information, which makes it a questionable source anyway).  There are numerous other sources which put the Catholic population of Vietnam at the time at 1.5 million, with a 2:1 ratio above the 17th parallel in 1953.  Authoritative sources such as Tran Thi Lien put the number of Catholics who moved south at about 650,000 out of a total of 850,000 but as Prados shows, not all of these were civilians.  The point made by John Prados (and by the way if you haven't heard of John Prados then I am not sure you are in any position to be claiming ownership of any article relating to the Vietnam War, and particularly the involvement of the U.S. in it) is that of the widely quoted figure of 800,000 to one million who moved from North to South is misleading, as of the 800,000 who were transported under military supervision a little over half of these were civilians.  '''That is what the US and French naval archives record.'''  This also accords with figures contained in other of the sources you quote, such as Bui Van Luong writing in Lindholm, p. 49, who concedes that the actual number of refugees could have been as low as 600,000.  Kevin Ruane uses similar figures, so if you haven't seen these figures in any of the books you have read then I suggest you might want to read a little more widely.

:::1) Undue weight, 2) this article isn't published in a peer reviewed journal or a book, but a veterans website, 3) per Kevin Forsyth's comment about the same topic on Ngo Dinh Diem, it was 450,000 net, not total.

== 2nd sentence ==

I think the 2nd sentence, starting with &quot;When Turkey does it...&quot;, should be removed. This is subjective polemics, absolutely irrelevant with regard to the article.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/212.29.35.250|212.29.35.250]] ([[User talk:212.29.35.250|talk]]) 13:17, 26 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
