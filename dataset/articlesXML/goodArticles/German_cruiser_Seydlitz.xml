'''''Seydlitz''''' was a [[heavy cruiser]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', fourth in the {{sclass-|Admiral Hipper|cruiser|4}}, but was never completed. The ship was laid down in December 1936 and launched in January 1939, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] slowed her construction and fitting-out work was finally stopped in the summer of 1940 when she was approximately 95&amp;nbsp;percent complete. The unfinished ship remained pier-side in the shipyard until March 1942, when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants. ''Seydlitz'' was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers.

Renamed ''Weser'', the ship was to have had a complement of ten [[Bf 109]] fighters and ten [[Ju 87]] divebombers. Work was not completed, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to [[Königsberg]] where she was eventually scuttled. The ship was seized by the advancing [[Soviet Army]] and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sistership {{ship|German cruiser|Lützow|1939|2}} for the [[Soviet Navy]]. This plan was also abandoned, and the ship was broken up for scrap.

== Construction ==

{{main|Admiral Hipper-class cruiser}}
[[File:Admiral Hipper ONI.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing of an ''Admiral Hipper''-class cruiser]]

''Seydlitz'' was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the [[Deschimag]] shipyard in [[Bremen]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=65}} ''Seydlitz'' was originally designed as a [[light cruiser]] version of the {{sclass-|Admiral Hipper|cruiser|4}} [[heavy cruiser]]s, armed with twelve {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} guns instead of the ''Admiral Hipper''{{'}}s eight {{convert|20.3|cm|abbr=on}} guns. The Kriegsmarine decided, however, to complete the ship identically to ''Admiral Hipper'' on 14 November 1936.{{sfn|Gröner|p=66}} Her keel was laid on 29 December 1936,{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}} under construction number 940.{{sfn|Gröner|p=65}} The ship was launched on 19 January 1939, but after the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, work was halted when the ship was approximately 95&amp;nbsp;percent complete.{{sfn|Gröner|p=67}}{{sfn|Evans|p=13}}

''Seydlitz'' was {{convert|210|m|ft|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a beam of {{convert|21.80|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum draft of {{convert|7.90|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The ship had a design displacement of {{convert|17600|MT|abbr=on}} and a full load displacement of {{convert|19800|LT|abbr=on}}. ''Seydlitz'' was powered by three sets of geared [[steam turbine]]s, which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired [[boiler]]s. The ship's top speed was {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}, at {{convert|132000|shp|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=65}} As designed, her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men.{{sfn|Gröner|p=66}}

''Seydlitz''{{'}}s primary armament was eight [[20.3 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|20.3|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} SK L/60]] guns mounted in four twin [[gun turret]]s, placed in [[superfire|superfiring pairs]] forward and aft.{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} Her anti-aircraft battery  consisted of twelve {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} L/65 guns, twelve {{convert|3.7|cm|abbr=on}} guns, and eight {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} guns. The ship also carried a pair of triple {{convert|53.3|cm|abbr=on}} torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure. The ship was equipped with three [[Arado Ar 196]] seaplanes and one catapult.{{sfn|Gröner|p=66}} ''Seydlitz''{{'}}s [[belt armor|armored belt]] was {{convert|70|to|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick; her upper deck was {{convert|12|to|30|mm|abbr=on}} thick while the main armored deck was {{convert|20|to|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The main battery turrets had {{convert|105|mm|abbr=on}} thick faces and 70&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides.{{sfn|Gröner|p=65}}

== Conversion ==
[[File:Seydlitz reconnaissance photo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Seydlitz'' in May 1942, before conversion work began]]

Following the loss of the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} in May 1941, during which British aircraft carriers proved instrumental, and the near torpedoing of her sistership {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} in March 1942, the Kriegsmarine became convinced of the necessity of acquiring aircraft carriers.{{sfn|Garzke &amp; Dulin|p=296}} Work on the purpose-built carrier {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}}, which had been halted in April 1940, was resumed in March 1942.{{sfn|Gröner|p=72}} The Kriegsmarine also decided to convert a number of vessels into auxiliary aircraft carriers. ''Seydlitz'' was among the ships selected for conversion, along with several passenger liners.{{sfn|Garzke &amp; Dulin|p=296}}

At the same time as construction of ''Graf Zeppelin'' resumed, conversion work began on ''Seydlitz''.{{sfn|Fontenoy|p=75}} The majority of the [[superstructure]] was cut away, with the exception of the funnel, to prepare for the installation of a [[flight deck]] and an aircraft hangar.{{sfn|Gröner|p=67}} In total, approximately {{convert|2400|MT|abbr=on}} of material from the ship was removed.{{sfn|Gröner|p=76}}  The flight deck was to have been {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} wide. The hangar was {{convert|137.50|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} wide forward and {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} wide amidships and aft.{{sfn|Gröner|p=75}} Her armament was reduced to an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm L/65 guns in twin mounts, two forward of the [[conning tower]] and three aft, ten 3.7&amp;nbsp;cm guns in dual mounts, and twenty-four 2&amp;nbsp;cm guns in quadruple mounts.{{sfn|Gröner|p=76}}

''Seydlitz''{{'}}s air complement was to have consisted of ten [[Bf 109]] fighters and ten [[Ju 87]] Stuka divebombers.{{sfn|Gröner|p=76}} The Bf&amp;nbsp;109 fighters were a [[navalized]] version of the &quot;E&quot; model, designated as Bf 109T. Their wings were longer than the land-based model to allow for shorter take-off.{{sfn|Caldwell &amp; Muller|p=80}} The Ju&amp;nbsp;87s were to have been the &quot;E&quot; variant, which was a navalized version of the Ju&amp;nbsp;87D, and were modified for [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] launches and were equipped with [[arresting gear]].{{sfn|Kay &amp; Couper|p=157}}

The ship was renamed ''Weser'', but work was ceased in June 1943, before the conversion was completed.{{sfn|Gröner|p=76}} The unfinished vessel was then transferred to [[Königsberg]], where she remained for the rest of the war. On 29 January 1945, the ship was scuttled before the advancing Soviet [[Red Army]] could seize her. The [[Soviet Navy]] nevertheless considered using the wreck for parts to complete the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Lützow|1939|2}}, a sister-ship of ''Seydlitz'' the Soviets had purchased unfinished before the outbreak of war. This was not carried out, however, and the ship was broken up for scrap.{{sfn|Gröner|p=67}}
