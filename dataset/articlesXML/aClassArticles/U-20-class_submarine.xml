{{confuse|German submarine U-20}}
The '''''U-20'' class''' was a [[ship class|class]] of four [[submarine]]s or [[U-boats]] built for and operated by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) during [[World War I]]. The class is sometimes referred to as the '''''Havmanden'' class''' because it was based upon the design of the [[Royal Danish Navy]]'s 1911 [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class submarines]], three of which were built in [[Fiume]].

With a small fleet of six U-boats at the beginning of World War I, two of which were not operational, the Austro-Hungarian Navy acted to bolster its fleet. They reluctantly ordered four ''U-20'' boats in 1915 because construction could start immediately, even though the ''Havmanden''-class design was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war. Political considerations caused the order to be split between Austrian and Hungarian firms, which contributed to construction problems and delays, keeping any of the boats from being operational until the middle of 1917.

The class boats were just over than {{convert|127|ft|m}} long and were armed with two front torpedo tubes, a [[deck gun]], and a [[machine gun]]. The engines for the boats were unreliable, which compounded handling problems with the design. The ''U-20'' class did not claim any wartime successes, yet lost two of the boats—''U-20'' and ''U-23''—to enemy action during the war. The remaining two were delivered as [[war reparations]] and broken up. The [[conning tower]] from ''U-20'', which was raised and salvaged in 1962, is on display in a military museum in [[Vienna]].

== Background ==
The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]'s U-boat fleet at the beginning of [[World War I]] consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational.&lt;ref name=Con-341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;{{SMS|U-1|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} and {{SMS|U-2|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} were in drydock awaiting [[diesel engine]]s to replace their inadequate [[gasoline engine]]s. See: Gardiner, pp. 340–41.&lt;/ref&gt; When it became apparent that the war would not be a short one,&lt;ref name=Hal-382&gt;Halpern, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria-Hungary moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class submarines]],&lt;ref name=Con-344&gt;Gardiner, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; three of which had been built at [[Robert Whitehead#Initial years|Whitehead’s]] in [[Fiume]].&lt;ref name=Con-354&gt;Gardiner, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete,&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hal-383 /&gt; it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards.&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt; The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for four boats on 27 March 1915.&lt;ref name=Hal-382 /&gt;

== Design and construction ==
Before construction could begin, the Navy found itself in the midst of political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that a substantial portion of the submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms.&lt;ref name=Hal-382 /&gt; After intricate negotiations,&lt;ref name=Hal-382 /&gt; the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with ''U-20'' and ''U-21'' built at the Pola Navy Yard, and ''U-22'' and ''U-23'' built at the Hungarian &lt;small&gt;UBAG&lt;/small&gt; yard at Fiume.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt; The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms,&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies.&lt;ref name=Hal-383&gt;Halpern, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt;

[[File:Havmanden-Xsection.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A cross section of the Danish submarine ''Havmanden'', the lead ship of the class upon which the ''U-20'' class was based.]]
The ''U-20''-class boats were ocean-going submarines that displaced {{convert|173|t|ST}} surfaced and {{convert|210|t|ST|0}} submerged. The boats were {{convert|127|ft|2|in|m}} long with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9|ft|m|1}}. For propulsion, they featured a single shaft, a single {{convert|450|bhp|abbr=on}} [[diesel engine]] for surface running, and a single {{convert|160|shp|abbr=on}} electric motor for submerged travel.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; The boats were capable of {{convert|12|knots|km/h}} while surfaced and {{convert|9|knots|km/h}} while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for the ''U-20'' class, the ''Havmanden'' class, upon which it was based, had a range of {{convert|1400|nmi|km}} at {{convert|10|knots|km/h}}, surfaced, and {{convert|23|nmi|km}} at {{convert|8|knots|km/h}} submerged.&lt;ref name=Con-354 /&gt; The ''U-20'' class boats were designed for a crew of 18.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;

The ''U-20'' class boats were armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. They were also equipped with a 66&amp;nbsp;mm/26 (2.6&amp;nbsp;in) [[deck gun]] and an {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]].&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; The first of the class to be launched was ''U-21'', when it slid down the ways on 15 August 1916; the final boat launched was ''U-22'' on 27 January 1917.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; The boats entered service between August and November 1917.&lt;ref name=Hal-383 /&gt;

== Class members ==
During their active service, the boats of the ''U-20'' class suffered from unreliable engines which compounded the already poor handling characteristics of the boats.&lt;ref name=Hal-383 /&gt; None of the class had any successes and two of their number were sunk during the war.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt; ''U-23'' was the first sunk when she went down on 21 February 1918 from an explosive [[paravane (weapon)|paravane]] in the [[Straits of Otranto]]. ''U-20'', the [[lead ship|lead boat]] of the class, sank in July 1918 when she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine [[Italian submarine F-12|''F-12'']] in the [[Tagliamento|Tagliamento estuary]]. The remaining two boats were surrendered at war's end, with ''U-21'' being ceded to Italy in 1920, and ''U-22'' to France; both were broken up.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt;

=== SM ''U-21'' ===
{{main|SM U-21 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-21'' was built at the Pola Navy Yard and was launched on 15 August 1916, and was the first of the class to be launched.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; ''U-21'' was damaged in a diving trial in January 1917, requiring seven months for repairs. The U-boat was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 August 1917.&lt;ref name=Tengeral /&gt; In early October, ''U-21'' conducted patrols off the [[Albania]]n coast, but a mid-October [[Mediterranean]] patrol was cut short by a leaky seal on her main [[trapdoor|hatch]]. After an additional eight months of repairs, ''U-21'' again conducted patrols off Albania. A broken piston in her diesel engine cut short her war career. At Pola at the war's end,&lt;ref name=Gib-279&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-21'' was ceded to Italy in 1920 as a [[war reparation]] and broken up. ''U-21'' did not have any successes during the war.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt;

=== SM ''U-22'' ===
{{main|SM U-22 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-22'' was built at the Hungarian &lt;small&gt;UBAG&lt;/small&gt; yard and was launched on 27 January 1917, the last of the class to be launched.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; The still-incomplete boat sank in the harbor at [[Fiume]] in June 1917, but was raised, repaired, and relaunched in October. From her November commissioning, ''U-22'' conducted patrols off the [[Po River]] estuary and, later, northern [[Adriatic]] patrols from [[Trieste]]. After three months of repairs for her failed electric motor in mid 1918, ''U-22'' resumed service, patrolling the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] coast out of [[Cattaro]].&lt;ref name=Tengeral /&gt; In port at Cattaro at war's end,&lt;ref name=Gib-279 /&gt; she was ceded to France as a [[war reparation]] and broken up.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt; ''U-22'' sank no ships during the war.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt;

=== SM ''U-23'' ===
{{main|SM U-23 (Austria-Hungary)}}
