==Professional career==
Melson became a professional in 2010 to raise research funds to honor a woman who had been his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Chee/Chee1109eee05.htm |title=USA Boxing news: The Countdown to the Opening Bell Begins |publisher=Doghouseboxing.com |date=November 9, 2005 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=12054&amp;more=1 |title=The Nation’s Top Boxers to Face Off at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials – Boxing, August 20–26 |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date=August 13, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2360461 |title=Melson wins at 152 lbs.; defending champs advance |publisher=ESPN |date=March 8, 2006 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had been in a wheelchair for 17 years, since the age of 10, following a diving accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;thejewishweek1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rain/&gt;  They had met during his senior year at West Point, when she was already using a wheelchair due to a diving accident.&lt;ref name=Rain/&gt;

Melson worked tirelessly to educate himself on spinal cord injuries and stem cell research. He traveled abroad with girlfriend Christan Zaccagnino so she could undergo experimental procedures that are not currently offered in the United States. While there, they were exposed to the vast expansion of work being done in this field that does not involve the use of embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;Boxing 101, [http://www.worldboxing101.com/2012/12/11/boxer-boyd-melson-is-on-a-soldiers-fight-to-walk/ &quot;Boxer Boyd Melson Is On A Soldier's Fight To Walk&quot;], December 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Melson donates all of the money he earns in his boxing matches to [[stem cell research]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thejewishweek1&quot;/&gt;  He gives it to Justadollarplease.org, a [[non-profit organization]] that raises money for the first U.S. [[spinal cord injury]] trial in using [[umbilical cord]] [[stem cells]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boxingnews1&quot;/&gt;  Along with Justadollarplease.org, Melson created Team Fight to Walk, to increase awareness in boxing of the importance of stem cell research for spinal cord injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxingnews1&quot;/&gt;  Team Fight to Walk is composed of Melson, former [[Rutgers University]] football player [[Eric LeGrand]], former two-time [[IBF]] [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]] champion [[Steve Cunningham]], US Olympians [[Shawn Estrada]] and [[Demetrius Andrade]] and contender [[Deandre Latimore]] amongst other boxers.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxingnews1&quot;/&gt;

Through April 2014, Melson was 14–1–1, with 4 of his wins by way of knockout and the sole defeat coming via controversial decision in what was considered one of the best local fights on the New York scene in recent memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxrec2&quot;/&gt;  [[Welterweight]] [[Dmitry Salita]] said of him following a May 2011 bout: &quot;I have seen tremendous improvement in Boyd in the last two fights. He is a very talented fighter and sets an example inside and outside the ring.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eastsideboxing1&quot;/&gt;

Since 2012, Melson has been training with head coach Simon Bakinde &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldboxingnews.net/news/press-releases/2013/04/24/perez-steps-in-to-oppose-melson-on-saturday-night.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227183647/http://www.worldboxingnews.net/news/press-releases/2013/04/24/perez-steps-in-to-oppose-melson-on-saturday-night.html |archivedate=February 27, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
