The '''1992 Coalisland riots''' were a series of clashes on 12 and 17 May 1992 between local [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] civilians and [[British Army]] soldiers (of the [[3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment|Third Battalion of the Parachute Regiment]]&lt;ref name=ecn&gt;[[The economist]], Volume 323, Issues 7761-4&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]]) in the town of [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland. The Third Battalion 1992 tour's codename was &quot;'''Operation Gypsy'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/infantry/parachute-regiment-2/parachute-regiment-3rd-bn.html British Army 1945 on locations and dates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisional IRA attack==
On 12 May 1992, a unit of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) [[Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade|East Tyrone Brigade]] launched a bomb attack on a British Army patrol near the republican stronghold of [[Cappagh, County Tyrone|Cappagh]], County Tyrone. One soldier of the Parachute Regiment, Alistair Hogdson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/paratrooper-who-lost-legs-is-british-191964 Alistair Hogdson profile], mirror.co.uk; accessed 3 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cumbria/8458700.stm Cumbrian amputee claims skydiving honour] BBC News, 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David (1998). ''Paras: an illustrated history of Britain's airborne forces''. Sutton, p. 197; ISBN 0750917237&lt;/ref&gt; lost both legs as a result. The landmine was described in an IRA statement as an &quot;anti-personnel device&quot;.&lt;ref name=may&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37019&amp;Itemid=18 &quot;New Paratroop controversy&quot;], emigrant.ie, 18 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered a rampage by members of the Parachute Regiment in the nearby, overwhelmingly [[Irish nationalist]] town of [[Coalisland]], some ten miles to the east.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;British troops launch charm attack in Belfast&quot;, by Peter Millership, [[Reuters]], 8 August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bound/&gt; The IRA attack was described as a &quot;provocation&quot; tactic, devised to produce an over-reaction by troops to make them even more unpopular among local nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, C.J.M. (1998). ''Terrorists' Target Selection''. Palgrave Macmillan, p. 41; ISBN 0-312-21197-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment of the paratroopers, which began in April&lt;ref name=ecn/&gt;&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; had already been criticised by republican activist and former Member of Parliament [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]], who denounced beatings, shootings and damages to property reportedly carried out by the troops.&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/3539 &quot;British army terrorises Irish town&quot;], Greenleft.org, 1 July 1992.&lt;!--very POV source so text should be reworded for NPOV--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These previous incidents included the destruction of fishing boats and equipments &lt;!-- what are &quot;equipments&quot;? --&gt;in the townland of Kinturk, near [[Ardboe]].&lt;ref name=green/&gt; [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] politician and [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] officer [[Ken Maginnis, Baron Maginnis of Drumglass|Ken Maginnis]], then-[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for the area, called for the withdrawal of the regiment after receiving a large number of complaints about their behaviour.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline (1997). ''The origins of the present troubles in Northern Ireland''. Longman, pg. 164; ISBN 0-582-10073-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The confrontation==

===12 May===
Two hours after the IRA attack, members of the regiment sealed off the town of Coalisland, ten miles east of Cappagh. According to a [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] politician,&lt;!--no name provided by cited source--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;may&quot;/&gt; the soldiers fabricated a bogus bomb warning, while the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) stated that the operation began when a joint police/military patrol was stoned by a crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;may&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=woods&gt;Wood, Ian S. (1994). ''Scotland and Ulster''. Mercat Press, p. 161; ISBN 1-873644-19-1&lt;/ref&gt; Two pubs were ransacked by the troops&lt;ref name=cain&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch92.htm#May CAIN âˆ’1992 chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of civilian cars were damaged. Several people were allegedly hit with sticks. Following this, a lieutenant was suspended from duty&lt;ref name=may/&gt; and the regiment was removed from patrol duties in Coalisland.&lt;ref name=fort/&gt;

===17 May===
On the evening of 17 May, a fist-fight began at Lineside Road, where a group of young men were having a drink. A passing four-man patrol of the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] (KOSB) regiment was challenged to a 'boxing match' by the residents.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The soldiers set aside their weapons and engaged the youths. Injuries were reported on both sides, none critical. The official claim was that the patrol was attacked by a mob&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; of at least 30 people.&lt;ref&gt;Alsing-BÃ¸rgesen, Kai (1993). ''The Lift: Basisbog for Hf Og Gymnasiet''. Gyldendal Uddannelse, p. 134; ISBN 8700106984&lt;/ref&gt; In the melÃ©e, a rifle and a [[GPMG|light machine gun]] were stolen. The rifle was later recovered nearby.&lt;ref name=fort&gt;''Fortnight'' issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, p. 6&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The youths smashed a [[Clansman|backpack radio]] which had been left behind by the troops.&lt;ref name=rib&gt;McAliskey, Bernardette (1992). ''The Moral of Coalisland''. Spare Rib (issues 231â€“39), p. 47&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two KOSB soldiers were hospitalised.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

The Parachute Regiment was called to the scene again, and at 8:30 PM, a major riot started outside The Rossmore pub&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; between local people and about 20 to 25 paratroopers.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The soldiers claimed one of their colleagues was isolated and dragged by the crowd. Some witnesses claimed paratroopers were in a frenzy, showing their guns and inviting civilians to try to take them. Suddenly, shots were fired by the troops â€”first into the air and then towards the people outside the pub. Three civilians were rushed to hospital in [[Dungannon]] with gunshot wounds, while the soldiers returned to their barracks.&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; Another four civilians suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref name=cain/&gt; One of the wounded was the brother of IRA volunteer Kevin O'Donnell, who had been killed by the [[Special Air Service]] in February during an [[Clonoe ambush|ambush at the nearby hamlet of Clonoe]], shortly after carrying out a machine-gun attack on the local RUC base.&lt;ref name=rib/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Coalisland - geograph.org.uk - 275069.jpg|thumb|220px|One of the roads to Coalisland centre, which was blocked by British paratroopers on 12 May 1992]]
About 500 people attended a protest rally in Coalisland on 19 May, and the wisdom of deploying the troops to patrol the town was questioned by members of the [[DÃ¡il Ã‰ireann|DÃ¡il]] in Dublin. The  [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[David Andrews (Irish politician)|David Andrews]], asked the British Government to withdraw the regiment. As a result, the paratroopers were redeployed outside the urban areas.&lt;ref name=may2&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37020&amp;Itemid=18 ''The Irish Emigrant''], &quot;Paratroopers remain in North&quot;. Issue No. 277, 25 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=su/&gt; The RUC claimed that the stolen machine gun was found 11 days later at Cappagh, along with another light machine gun and an [[AK-47]] rifle.&lt;ref&gt;''Fortnight'', issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans questioned whether the weapon had really been stolen, suggesting this was merely an excuse for the soldiers' rampage in Coalisland.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;&lt;ref name=rib/&gt; British officials accused [[Sinn FÃ©in]] of being the instigators of the riots,&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; while [[Michael Mates]], then [[Minister of State]] at the [[Northern Ireland Office]], stated that the incidents were due to &quot;a gang of thugs motivated by the IRA&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1992-05-21/Orals-1.html House of Commons, Thursday, 21 May 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the battalion's 1992 tour in Northern Ireland was scaled down, with the patrols suspended before the official end of the deployment. The Third Brigade's commander, Brigadier Tom Longland&lt;ref name=usa&gt;Irish America (1992), Irish Voice, Inc., volume 8&lt;/ref&gt; was replaced by Brigadier Jim Dutton.&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;&lt;ref name=su&gt;Wood, Ian S.

The last patrol took place on 27 June, when two paratroopers drowned while crossing the [[River Blackwater, Ulster|River Blackwater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationbanner.com/roh/default.asp?MonthAsNumber=6 Operation Banner Deaths: Roll of Honour], operationbanner.com; accessed 17 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fortnight, issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, there were further clashes with local residents, this time in the town of [[Cookstown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1992.html CAIN â€“ Listing of Programmes for the Year: 1992 â€“ [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] news, 27 June 1992], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 17 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six soldiers faced criminal charges for their roles in the May riots,&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ulster-soldiers-to-face-charges-1554277.html The Independent], 29 September 1992&lt;/ref&gt; but were acquitted one year later.

Dungannon priest Father [[Denis Faul]] was of the opinion that the soldiers should have been charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=bound&gt;[[David McKittrick|McKittrick, David]].
