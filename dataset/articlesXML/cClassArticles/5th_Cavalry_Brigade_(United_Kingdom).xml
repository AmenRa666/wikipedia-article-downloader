The '''5th Cavalry Brigade''' was a [[cavalry]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Army]].  It served in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (notably at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]), in the [[British Army during the First World War|First World War]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] where it was initially independent before being assigned to the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Cavalry Division]], and with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Cavalry Division]] during [[World War II]].

==History==
===Napoleonic Wars===
From June 1809, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] organized his cavalry into one, later two, cavalry [[Division (military)|divisions]] ([[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]] and [[2nd Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd]]) for the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref name=Reid79&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These performed a purely administrative, rather than tactical, role;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haythornthwaite|1990|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; the normal tactical headquarters were provided by brigades commanding two, later usually three, regiments.&lt;ref name=Reid75&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cavalry brigades were named for the commanding officer, rather than numbered.{{efn|This could be a source of confusion as brigades acquired new commanders, or they moved between brigades.  For example, Fane's Brigade became [[George de Grey, 3rd Baron Walsingham|De Grey's]] Brigade from 13 May 1810 when [[Henry Fane (British Army officer)|Henry Fane]] went to [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]];&lt;ref name=Reid80&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  De Grey's Brigade was broken up 29 January 1812.&lt;ref name=Reid83&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 May 1813, Fane took over [[Sir John Slade, 1st Baronet|Slade's]] Brigade;&lt;ref name=Reid85&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second Fane's Brigade was unrelated to the original one although coincidentally, and to add to the potential confusion, the [[3rd Dragoon Guards]] served in both.&lt;ref name=Reid7986&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2004|pp=79–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  For the [[Hundred Days|Hundred Days Campaign]], he numbered his British cavalry brigades in a single sequence, 1st to 7th.{{efn|The British cavalry included five regiments of the [[King's German Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717034259/www.napoleonic-literature.com/Waterloo_OB/Allied.htm |date=17 July 2012 |title=The Anglo-Allied Army at napoleonic-literature.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/British_Order_of_Battle_WATERLOO.html | title=Wellington's Army in 1815 | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The 5th Cavalry Brigade consisted of:
*[[7th Queen's Own Hussars|7th (The Queen's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars)]]
*[[15th The King's Hussars|15th (The King's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars)]]
*[[King's German Legion|2nd Hussars, King's German Legion]]
It was commanded by [[Major General]] [[Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Vivian|Sir Hussey Vivian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1998|p=540}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[13th Hussars|13th Regiment of Light Dragoons]] was attached to the brigade (from [[7th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Cavalry Brigade]]) in the absence of the 2nd Hussars, KGL.&lt;ref name=BoW&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/British_Order_of_Battle_WATERLOO.html | title=Battle of Waterloo | publisher=Napolun.com | accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigade took part in the [[Battle of Waterloo]].  During the battle, the 7th Hussars suffered 155 casualties (56 killed, 99 wounded), the 15th Hussars 79 (23 killed, 51 wounded, 5 missing)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1998|p=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 13th Light Dragoons 108 (12 killed, 78 wounded, 18 missing).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1998|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This represented a loss rate of about 27%.{{efn|7th Hussars had a strength of 362, 15th Hussars 450, and 13th Light Dragoons 455.&lt;ref name=BoW/&gt;}}

===World War I===
====Mobilization====
5th Cavalry Brigade was a peacetime formation of the British Army, based in [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern]] and [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Commands]].  At the outbreak of the war, it was [[Headquarters (military)|headquartered]] at [[York]] and commanded the [[Royal Scots Greys|2nd Dragoons]] (York), [[12th Lancers]] ([[Norwich]]), [[20th Hussars]] ([[Colchester]]) and 5th Signal Troop, [[Royal Engineers]] (York).  [[Ipswich]]-based [[V Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|V Brigade, RHA]] ([[G Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|G]] and [[O Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|O Batteries]]) was attached.&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;{{cite web | url = http://marksrussianmilitaryhistory.info/BRIT14.html | title = The British Army, 1914 | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Mark | year = 1996 | accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On mobilization, the brigade took on a role independent of [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|The Cavalry Division]].  It moved to France in August 1914 with its three cavalry regiments and signal troop, and with the addition of [[J Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|J Battery, RHA]], 4th Field Troop, Royal Engineers, and 5th Cavalry Brigade Field Ambulance.&lt;ref name=Becke10/&gt;

====Early Actions====
In its independent role, the brigade took part in the [[Battle of Mons]] (23–24 August), [[Cerizy]] (28 August), the [[Retreat from Mons]] (23 August–5 September) and in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] (6–9 September).&lt;ref name=Becke10/&gt;  On 6 September, it joined [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Cavalry Brigade]] in [[Gough's Command]] (under 3rd Cavalry Brigade's [[Brigadier-General|Br-Gen]] [[Hubert Gough]]).  As part of Gough's Command, it took part in the [[First Battle of the Aisne]] (12–15 September).  On 13 September, Gough's Command was redesignated as [[2nd Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Cavalry Division]] with the addition of divisional troops ([[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]], [[Royal Engineers|RE]], etc.).&lt;ref name=Becke14/&gt;  It remained with 2nd Cavalry Division on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Becke12/&gt;

====2nd Cavalry Division====
In 1914, the brigade, with the division, took part in [[First Battle of Ypres]], notably the battle of Gheluvelt (29–31 October).  In 1915, the division was in action at the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] (10–12 March 1915) and the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] notable the Battle of St Julien (26 April–3 May) and the Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge (24–25 May).&lt;ref name=Becke14&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 1916, a [[Machine Gun Corps|Machine Gun Squadron]] was formed from the machine gun sections of the brigade's constituent regiments.&lt;ref name=LLT_Cav_MGC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mgccav.html | title=Cavalry units of the Machine Gun Corps | publisher=The Long Long Trail | last=Baker | first=Chris | accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1916 saw no notable actions, but in 1917 the division saw action in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (First Battle of the Scarpe, 9–11 April). and the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (the Tank Attack of 20–21 November, the Capture of Bourlon Wood of 24–28 November and the German Counter-Attack of 30 November–3 December).&lt;ref name=Becke14/&gt;  At other times, the brigade formed a dismounted unit and served in the trenches as a regiment under the command of the brigadier.&lt;ref name=Becke11&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====War of movement====
1918 saw the return of the war of movement and the division took part in the [[First Battle of the Somme (1918)|First Battle of the Somme]] notably the [[Operation Michael#The Battle of St. Quentin (21 – 23 March 1918)|Battle of St Quentin]] (21–23 March), the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] (Battle of Hazebrouck of 14–15 April), the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] (8–11 August) and the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|Second Battle of the Somme]] ([[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]] of 21–23 August and the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]] of 31 August–3 September).&lt;ref name=Becke15&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division was then split up with the 5th Cavalry Brigade serving with [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]].&lt;ref name=Becke15/&gt;  It took part in the battles of the [[Hindenburg Line]]: the battles of [[Battle of St. Quentin Canal|St. Quentin Canal]] (29 September–2 October), [[Battle of the Beaurevoir Line|Beaurevoir Line]] (3–5 October) and [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Cambrai]] (8–9 October); and in the [[Pursuit to the Selle]] (9–12 October).  Its final action was to take part in the [[Advance in Picardy]] (17 October–11 November) including the [[Battle of the Sambre (1918)|Battle of the Sambre]] (4 November).&lt;ref name=Becke15/&gt;

====Armistice====
At the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], the brigade had reached [[Clairfayts]] with Fourth Army.  On 15 November, the division was re-assembled near [[Maubeuge]] and ordered to advance into Germany as an advance screen for Fourth Army and form part of the Occupation Force. The move began on 17 November, [[Ciney]] and [[Rochefort, Belgium|Rochefort]] were reached five days later and the 5th Cavalry Brigade crossed the German border south of [[St. Vith]] on 1 December.&lt;ref name=Becke15/&gt;

In late December, the division moved to winter quarters south and south-east of [[Liège]].  It remained here until 30 January 1919 when it exchanged regiments with [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]] and [[3rd Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Cavalry Divisions]] then gradually moved back to England.  The Division ceased to exist at midnight 31 March / 1 April 1919.&lt;ref name=Becke15/&gt;
