The '''54th Fighter Group''' is an active [[United States Air Force]] unit, stationed at [[Holloman Air Force Base]], New Mexico and assigned to the [[56th Fighter Wing]] of [[Air Education and Training Command]]. The group was reactivated in March 2014.

The group was first activated as the '''54th Pursuit Group''' during the buildup of the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] just prior to [[World War II]].  It served in Alaska during the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]], earning a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]].  It then returned to the United States and served as a training unit.

The group was again activated in 1955 as part of [[Air Defense Command]]'s Project Arrow, replacing the [[500th Air Defense Group]].  It served in the [[air defense]] role until 1958 when it was inactivated.

The group was activated once again as a training unit for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] in 2014.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:42d Fighter Squadron P-39E Adak Alaska.jpg|thumb|left|42d Fighter Squadron P-39F at Adak, Alaska]]

The group was activated as the '''54th Pursuit Group''' (Interceptor) at the beginning of 1941 at [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]], California. with the [[42d Flying Training Squadron|42d]],
[[56th Fighter Squadron|56th]], and [[57th Fighter Squadron|57th Pursuit Squadrons]] assigned.&lt;ref name=Maurer228/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units''pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer195&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons''p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer227&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons''. p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;  It trained with [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]]s and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]s, then moved to [[Paine Field|Everett Army Air Field]], where it served as a part of the [[air defense]] force for the northwest Pacific coast during the first few months of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;/&gt;  The [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] and its [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] were redesignated as [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] units in May 1942.&lt;ref name=Maurer228/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer195/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer227/&gt;

The air echelon, equipped with [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s, served in Alaska against the Japanese forces that invaded the Aleutian Islands during the summer of 1942, and for these operations the group received a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;/&gt;

[[File:P-51B 42d Fighter Squadron Hillsborough Army Airfield FL 1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|54th Fighter Group P-51 at Hillsborough AAF]]

The air echelon returned to the US in December 1942 and rejoined the group, which had been assigned to Third AF in Louisiana, and became a replacement training unit (RTU) for [[North American P-51 Mustang]] pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;/&gt;  RTUs were oversized units training individual [[aviators|pilots]] or [[aircrew]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Craven &amp; Cate, Vol. VI, Introduction, p. xxxvi,&lt;/ref&gt;   In early May 1943, the group began a split operation, with [[headquarters]] and the 56th and 57th Fighter Squadrons relocating to [[Bartow Army Air Field]],&lt;ref name=Maurer228/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer227/&gt; Florida, while the 42d was at [[Hillsborough Army Air Field]].&lt;ref name=Maurer195/&gt;  The AAF was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.&lt;ref&gt;Craven &amp; Cate, Vol. VI p. 75, The Organization and its Responsibilities, Chapter 2 The AAF&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 1944 the group was disbanded as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system.&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;/&gt;  The units at Bartow were replaced by the 340th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter),&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/169/647.xml |title=Abstract, History Bartow AAF May–Jul 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those at Hillsborough transferred their mission, equipment, and personnel to the 343d AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter).&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/173/299.xml |title=Abstract, History Hillsborough AAF May–Jun 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:42d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron North American F-86L-50-NA Sabre 52-10073.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|54th Fighter Group F-86 Sabre at Greater Pittsburgh Apt]]
In 1955, the group was redesignated as the '''54th Fighter Group''' (Air Defense) and activated at Greater Pittsburgh Airport&lt;ref name=&quot;M CU 116&quot;/&gt; to replace the [[500th Air Defense Group]]&lt;ref&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; as part of ADC's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Buss (ed), Sturm, Denys &amp; McMullen, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  The group assumed host responsibilities for the USAF portion of the airport and was assigned a USAF Dispensary,&lt;ref name=54USAFD1955&gt;''See'' {{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/406/786.xml |title=Abstract, History 54 Dispensary July–Dec 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Base Squadron and Materiel Squadron&lt;ref name=CJ155&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; to fulfill this responsibility.  Because Project Arrow was also intended to reunite fighter squadrons with their former groups, the [[42d Flying Training Squadron|42d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], which was stationed at [[O'Hare Airport]] moved to Pittsburgh and assumed the personnel and equipment of the 500th group's [[71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], including its [[radar]] equipped and [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]] armed [[North American F-86 Sabre]]s. The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] transitioned into [[data link]] equipped F-86Ls in the spring of 1957 for interception control through the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] system and flew them until the group and squadron were inactivated in early 1958.&lt;ref name=cj115&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
The group was reactivated in March 2014 at [[Holloman Air Force Base]], New Mexico.  It is an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] training unit and will be associated with the [[56th Fighter Wing]] at [[Luke Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name=54FGjoins&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.12af.acc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123403234 |last1=Cannon|first1=A1C Chase|last2=Arlan|first2=|title=54th Fighter Group joins Team Holloman|date=2014-03-12|publisher=49th Fighter Wing Public Affairs|deadurl=no |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has approximately 800 personnel assigned and trains about 160 F-16 pilots annually.&lt;ref name=Luke54FG/&gt;
