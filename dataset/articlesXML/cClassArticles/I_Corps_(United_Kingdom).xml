'''I Corps''' (&quot;First Corps&quot;) was an [[army corps]] in existence as an active formation in the [[British Army]] for most of the 80 years from its creation in the [[World War I|First World War]] until the end of the Cold War, longer than any other corps. It had a short-lived precursor during the [[Waterloo Campaign]].

==Napoleonic precursor==

Assembling an army in Belgium to fight Napoleon’s resurgent forces in the spring of 1815, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] formed it into army corps, deliberately mixing units from the Anglo-Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian and German contingents so that the weaker elements would be stiffened by more experienced or reliable troops. As he put it: ‘It was necessary to organize these troops in brigades, divisions, and corps d’armee with those better disciplined and more accustomed to war’.&lt;ref&gt;Hofschroer, ''Ligny and Quatre Bras'', p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; He placed I Corps under the command of the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and it was this corps that was first contacted by the advancing French at [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] on 16 June 1815. However, Wellington did not employ the corps as tactical entities, and continued his accustomed practice of issuing orders directly to divisional and lower commanders. When he drew up his army on the ridge at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], elements of the various corps were mixed up, and although he gave the Prince of Orange nominal command of the centre, that officer had different forces under him. Subsequent to the battle, the corps structure was re-established for the advance into France, I Corps being commanded by [[John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford|Maj-Gen Sir John Byng]], the Prince of Orange having been wounded at Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;Hofschroer, ''The German Victory'', p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition of I Corps in the Waterloo Campaign===

==Prior to the First World War==

After Waterloo the army corps structure largely disappeared from the British Army, except for ad hoc formations assembled during annual manoeuvres (e.g. [[Army Manoeuvres of 1913]]). In 1876 a Mobilisation Scheme for eight army corps was published, with 'First Corps' based on [[Colchester]]. In 1880 First Corps' organization was:

**C (Telegraph) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot)
**23rd Company Royal Engineers and Field Park (Chatham)

This scheme had been dropped by 1881.&lt;ref&gt;''Army List'' 1876–1881.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanhope Memorandum of 1891 (drawn up by [[Edward Stanhope]] when [[Secretary of State for War]]) laid down the policy that after providing for garrisons and India, the army should be able to mobilise three army corps for home defence, two of regular troops and one partly of militia, each of three divisions. Only after those commitments, it was hoped, might two army corps be organised for the unlikely eventuality of deployment abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt; When war with the Boer Republics was imminent in September 1899, a Field Force, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes 1st Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was, in fact, 'about the equivalent of the First Army Corps of the existing mobilization scheme',&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop p 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and was placed under the command of Gen Sir [[Redvers Buller]], GOCinC of Aldershot Command. However, once in South Africa the corps never operated as such, and the three divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd) were widely dispersed.

The 1901 Army Estimates introduced by [[William St John Fremantle Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|St John Brodrick]] allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands (Aldershot, Southern, Irish, Eastern, Northern and Scottish) of which only I Corps ([[Aldershot Command]]) and II Corps ([[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] on Salisbury Plain) would be entirely formed of regular troops.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop pp 130-40.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these arrangements remained theoretical, the title 'I Corps' being added to Aldershot Command. In 1907 the title changed to 'Aldershot Corps' but reverted to simply 'Aldershot Command' the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''Army List''&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the [[Haldane Reforms]] of 1907 established a six-division [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] for deployment overseas, but only Aldershot Command possessed two infantry divisions and a full complement of ‘army troops’ to form an army corps in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop p 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
Pre-war planning for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) did not envisage any intermediate headquarters between [[Headquarters|GHQ]] and the six infantry divisions, but it was assumed that if corps HQs became necessary, then the [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] Aldershot Command would automatically become GOC I Corps in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; On mobilisation in August 1914 the decision was made to conform to the two-division army corps organisation employed by the French armies alongside which the BEF was to operate.&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1914'', Volume I, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], then commanding at Aldershot, therefore took I Corps HQ to France with [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Division]] and [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]] under command, and it remained on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] throughout the war.  It had a peripheral part at the [[Battle of Mons]], then saw hard fighting at the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] and [[First Battle of Ypres]] in 1914, at the [[Battle of Aubers Ridge]] in the Spring of 1915 and alongside the [[Canadian Corps]] at the [[Battle of Hill 70]], as well in many other large battles of the First World War.

===Composition of I Corps in First World War===

The composition of army corps changed frequently. Some representative orders of battle for I Corps are given here.

'''Order of Battle at Mons 23 August 1914'''&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1914'', Volume I, Appendix 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

**No 1 Bridging Train, Royal Engineers
**B Squadron, [[North Irish Horse]]
**Company, 1st Bn [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]]
**B &amp; C Sections, No 19 Field Ambulance, [[RAMC]]

By the time of the battles of [[Battle of Aubers Ridge|Aubers Ridge]] and [[Battle of Festubert|Festubert]] (May 1915), I Corps still had 1st and 2nd Divisions under command, but had been reinforced by [[47th (1/2nd London) Division]] of the Territorial Force, and [[1st Canadian Division]].&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1915'', Volume I, Appendix 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the era of trench warfare had set in on the Western Front (1915–17), the BEF left its army corps in position for long periods, so that they became familiar with their sector, while rotating divisions as they required rest, training, or transfer to other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders Marble, 'Offensive versus Subsidiary Attacks, 1916–1918: The British Expeditionary Force Balancing its Options', ''Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research'', Volume 87, No 351 (Autumn 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 1918, for the final battles, I Corps was transferred from First Army to [[William Birdwood|Sir William Birdwood]]'s [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]].&lt;ref&gt;''Official History 1918'' Volume 5, p 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

===Battle of France===
[[File:British Generals 1939-1945 O398.jpg|thumb|[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Dill|Sir John Dill]], GOC I Corps, inspecting soldiers digging trenches at Flines, France.]]

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], I Corps' first assignment was again to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) where it was commanded by General [[John Dill|Sir John Dill]], and then Lieutenant General [[Michael Barker (British Army officer)|Michael Barker]] from April 1940. After the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Germans]] broke through Allied lines in the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940, the BEF was forced to retreat to [[Dunkirk]] for [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation to England]]. The [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the BEF, General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]], ordered Barker to form the rearguard with I Corps to cover the evacuation, and surrender to the Germans as a last resort. However, the [[Acting (rank)|acting commander]] of [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]], Major General [[Bernard Montgomery]], advised Gort that Barker was in an unfit state to be left in final command, and recommended that Major General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]] of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Division]] should be put in charge. Gort did as Montgomery advised, and in the event the bulk of I Corps was successfully evacuated. As Montgomery recalled: '&quot;Alex&quot; got everyone away in his own calm and confident manner'.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===North-West Europe===
After returning to England I Corps then remained in the [[United Kingdom]], based at [[Hickleton Hall]] in [[South Yorkshire]] within [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]] on anti-invasion duties, preparing defences to repel a [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Newbold, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lieutenant General J T Crocker, Cb, Cbe, Dso, Mc, Commander of 1st Corps, France, August 1944 TR2167.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General John Crocker, pictured here in August 1944.]]

I Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General [[John Crocker]], then took part in the [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944 where, along with [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Gerard Bucknall]] (who had commanded I Corps between April and August 1943), it was a spearhead corps of Lieutenant General [[Miles Dempsey]]'s [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]], itself part of the [[21st Army Group]]. The corps was then involved in the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] in fierce attritional fighting for control of the Normandy beachhead. After fighting for two months in the [[Battle for Caen]], I Corps was subordinated on 1 August 1944 to the [[First Canadian Army|Canadian First Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant-general (Canada)|Lieutenant General]] [[Harry Crerar]], for the remainder of the Normandy campaign &lt;ref&gt;Hart, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent operations in the [[Low Countries]] and Germany until 1 April 1945,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 466. participating in [[Operation Astonia]], the capture of [[Le Havre]], and the operations to [[clearing the Channel Coast|clear the Channel Coast]], later helping to garrison &quot;The Island&quot; area between Arnhem and Nijmegen in the aftermath of the failed airborne invasion of the Netherlands, [[Operation Market Garden]].&lt;/ref&gt; I Corps Headquarters then took over administration of the 21st Army Group's logistics area around the port of [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] until the end of the war.

==British Army of the Rhine==
After the defeat of Germany, the 21st Army Group became the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR), and I Corps, under the command of [[Lieutenant-general (United_Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Gwilym Ivor Thomas]], was transformed into a corps district, with an administrative, rather than combat, role. It was disbanded in 1947.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FPAMQ3oIT_4C&amp;pg=PT5&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;dq=1+Corps,+British+Army+of+the+Rhine+(BAOR)+1948&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6yRegYgzqL&amp;sig=2eXF2CITGxdLgs1vslqDy7HaRJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0YchS86nIOK4jAeC26zWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=1%20Corps%2C%20British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine%20(BAOR)%201948&amp;f=false The British Army in Germany: An Organizational History 1947-2004 By Graham Watson, Richard A. Rinaldi, Page 11] Tiger Lily, 2005, ISBN 978-0-9720296-9-8&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in October 1951 the corps was reactivated to become the principal combat element of the BAOR, with its HQ based in [[Bielefeld]]. In March 1952, following the reactivation of [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]], its component formations were:
*[[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Infantry Division]]
*[[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]]
*[[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]
*[[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]]

Included as part of this was [[Canada]]'s [[Canadian Forces Europe|contribution]] to the NATO land forces in Germany. A Canadian mechanised brigade remained part of BAOR until 1970. The size of this force, 6,700, was such that it was referred to within British circles as a &quot;light division&quot;.

In a following 1958-60 reorganisation the Corps was formed into three mixed armour/infantry divisions including five brigade groups, which were in 1965 brought together into three centralised divisions. With the end of National Service manpower across the whole of BAOR dropped from around 77,000 to 55,000.

In the late 1970s the Corps was reorganised as four small five battle group armoured divisions plus a roughly brigade sized infantry 'Field Force'. It then comprised:
*[[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]]
*[[2nd Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Armoured Division]]
*3rd Armoured Division
*4th Armoured Division
*5th Field Force

Following the 1981-3 reorganisation, the Corps consisted of [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st]] and [[4th Infantry Division (United_Kingdom)|4th Armoured Divisions]], which would have manned the front line against the anticipated attack by the [[3rd Shock Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 3rd Shock Army]], plus in an in-depth, reserve role the [[3rd Division (United_Kingdom)|3rd Armoured Division]] and finally the [[2nd Infantry Division (United_Kingdom)|2nd Infantry Division]] which was tasked with rear-area security.&lt;ref&gt;Isby &amp; Kamps, pp.256-258&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the [[Cold War]],  in 1992 1 (BR) Corps was disbanded, and its HQ closed. Some of the staff serving in HQ 1(BR) Corps were reassigned to the new HQ UK Support Command (Germany) which was formed from the rump of HQ BAOR. The remainder of the staff formed the British component (50% of the total staff in the HQ)  in the [[Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps]] (HQ ARRC), a newly instated multi-national NATO Rapid Reaction Corps HQ.  The Corps Commander reported to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe [[SACEUR]], but had no troops under command except when assigned to ARRC by NATO member nations, for operations or for exercises. HQ ARRC moved to [[Rheindahlen Military Complex|Rheindahlen]] in 1994.
