The '''Supermarine Attacker''' was a British single-seat [[Naval aviation|naval]] jet [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] built by [[Supermarine]] for the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA). The type has the distinction of being the first jet fighter to enter operational service with the FAA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bingham109&quot;&gt;Bingham 2004, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other [[first-generation jet fighter]]s, it had a short service life due to the rapid development of increasingly advanced aircraft during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Design and development==
The Attacker developed from a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) fighter jet project, under [[List of Air Ministry Specifications#1940-1949|Air Ministry Specification E.10 of 1944]] (the E for experimental). The design of the Attacker used the [[laminar flow]] straight-wings of the [[Supermarine Spiteful]], a piston-engined fighter intended to replace the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], and what became the Attacker was originally referred to as the &quot;Jet Spiteful&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler Aeroplane p54,6&quot;&gt;Buttler 2010, pp. 54, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was intended to provide an interim fighter for the RAF while another aircraft, the [[Gloster E.1/44]] also using the Nene engine, was developed. An order for three prototypes was placed on 30 August 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler Aeroplane p54&quot;&gt;Buttler 2010, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  the second and third of which were to be [[navalised]]. An order for a further 24 pre-production aircraft, six for the RAF and the remaining 18 for the [[Fleet Air Arm]] was placed on 7 July 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&amp;Morgan p269&quot;&gt;Andrews and Morgan 1989, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler Aeroplane p56-7&quot;&gt;Buttler 2010, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Handling problems with the Spiteful prototype delayed progress on the jet-powered version, leading to the pre-production order of 24 being stopped, although work on the three prototypes continued.  The Fleet Air Arm instead bought 18 [[de Havilland Vampire|de Havilland Vampire Mk. 20]]s to gain experience with jet aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&amp;Morgan p269-0&quot;&gt;Andrews and Morgan 1987, pp. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason Fighter p350&quot;&gt;Mason 1992, p.350.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF rejected both designs since they offered no perceptible performance advantage over the contemporary Gloster Meteor and the [[de Havilland Vampire]], the RAF's first two operational jet aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1969, pp. 432–433.&lt;/ref&gt; Supermarine offered a navalised version of the project to the [[Admiralty]]. The prototype Type 392 serial number ''TS409'' land version was first flown on 27 July 1946, by test pilot [[Jeffrey Quill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&amp;Morgan p270&quot;&gt;Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attacker suffered from deficiencies which led to it quickly being superseded; one being that the aircraft retained the Spiteful's tail-wheel [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] (due to the extent of the [[Machine tool|re-tooling]] that would have been required to alter the Spiteful's wing),{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;!--what's the connection to the wing, here?--&gt; rather than a nose-wheel undercarriage, thus making the Attacker more difficult to land on [[aircraft carrier]]s. This same tail-down attitude meant that when operating from grass airfields the jet exhaust would create a long [[Plough|furrow]] in the ground that &quot;three men could lie down in&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gunston 1975, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the new wing was apparently aerodynamically inferior to the original Spitfire elliptic one, with lower critical [[Mach number]], leading to someone quipping that &quot;they rather should have left the Spitfire wing on the thing&quot;.

The first navalised prototype, Type 398 ''TS413'' flew on 17 June 1947 flown by test pilot [[Mike Lithgow]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&amp;Morgan p271&quot;&gt;Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; three years after the Meteor had made its first flight. Production orders for the FAA were placed in November 1949. The first production aircraft to take to the skies was the '''F.1''' variant in 1950, entering service with the FAA in August 1951 with the first squadron being [[800 Naval Air Squadron]]. The F.1's armament consisted of four 20&amp;nbsp;mm (.79&amp;nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk. V cannon]]s, with 125 rounds of ammunition per gun. It was powered by a single [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] Mk. 101 [[turbojet]] engine.

==Operational history==
[[File:Supermarine Attcker FB.2 WP290 ST812 1831 Sqn STN 25.02.56 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Attacker FB.2 of 1831 Squadron RNVR landing at [[RNAS Stretton]] in 1956]]

===UK===
The Attacker had a brief career with the Fleet Air Arm, not seeing any action during its time with the FAA and being taken out of first-line service in 1954. It remained in service with the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] (RNVR) for a little while longer, being taken out of service in early 1957. The Attacker was replaced in the front line squadrons by the later and more capable [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] and [[de Havilland Sea Venom]].

===Pakistan===
In the early 1950s, when the newly formed Royal Pakistan Air Force (RPAF; later Pakistan Air Force) sought to acquire jet fighters, a lack of funds, combined with pressure from British suppliers persuaded it to acquire the Supermarine Attacker “P” (Type 538), a “de-navalised” variant of the type used by the FAA.

The only squadron to be equipped with these aircraft,  from  1953, was an interceptor unit, No. 11 “Arrows” Squadron. A total of 36 Attackers had been acquired when “Arrows” Squadron officially converted to the F-86F Sabre, on 18 January 1956. However, some sources state that Attackers were used by PAF until 1960.

In the RPAF the Attacker was regarded as unsatisfactory, due to frequent maintenance problems and a relatively high attrition rate.

==Variants==
Two more variants of the Supermarine Attacker were built for the FAA. The '''FB 1''' was a fighter-bomber which differed little from the F 1 except that it was expected to operate as a [[ground attack aircraft]]. The third, and last, variant of the Attacker was the '''FB 2''' which introduced a new Rolls-Royce Nene engine and modifications to its structure. The Supermarine Attacker now had eight underwing pylons which could carry two 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb (454&amp;nbsp;kg) bombs or eight unguided rockets.

;Attacker FB.2
:Updated fighter-bomber variant powered by the Nene 102, 24 ordered on 21 November 1950, 30 ordered on 16 February 1951 and a further 30 ordered on 7 September 1951, all 84 built at South Marston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sturtivant&quot; /&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 23 May 1950, Vickers test pilot [[Les Colquhoun]] was flying the first production Attacker F.1 ''WA469''; he carrying out high speed tests when during one of the tests the outer portion of the starboard wing folded up and the ailerons became locked. Colquhoun decided not to eject and managed to do a high-speed landing at Chilbolton, in the course of which he used all but the last 100 yards (90m) of the runway and burst a tyre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bingham101&quot;&gt;Bingham 2004, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; He had saved the aircraft so the cause of the incident could be discovered and was awarded the [[George Medal]] for his efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;gm&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=38982 |date=1 August 1950 |startpage=3949 |supp=x |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 5 February 1953, Attacker FB.1 ''WA535'' from [[RNAS Stretton (HMS Blackcap)|RNAS Stretton]] crashed near [[Winwick, Cheshire]], killing the pilot.
* On  21st July 1953 FB.2 Attacker WP293 (803 NAS) from RNAS Ford, crashed at North Stoke Farm, near Arundel, Sussex, killing the pilot Lieutenant Commander William T R Smith.   
* An accident on 10 November 1955, in Attacker FB.2 ''WP281'', claimed the life of the chief Flying Instructor, Lieutenant Commander Charles James Lavender DSC (''see [[RNAS Stretton]]'').&lt;ref&gt;MoD Accident Report number 01005/4 22 November 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its retirement from service in 1956, Attacker F.1 [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|Serial number]] ''WA473'' was placed on display on the gate at [[RNAS Abbotsinch]]. Completed at VAs South Marston factory in July 1951, it had served with 702 and 736 Naval Squadrons. In late 1961 it was moved to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] in [[Somerset]], [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleetairarm.com/exhibits/planes.asp?plane=85 &quot;Supermarine Attacker.&quot;] ''Fleet Air Arm Museum''.
