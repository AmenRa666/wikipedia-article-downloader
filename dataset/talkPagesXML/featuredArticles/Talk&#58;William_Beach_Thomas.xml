== Images ==
The National Portrait Gallery in London has an image of Beach Thomas that was taken in 1917 but it is not (yet) available online. I only know of one other image, which appears [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Jbeach.htm here] and in Peter Stothards ''TLS'' blog piece of 2007. Alas, the two sources cannot agree whether BT is 2nd or 3rd from the left and, in any event, it is not a great picture. The hunt goes on ... - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 20:13, 13 November 2013 (UTC)
:I've now resolved this issue in part, assuming that the [[Imperial War Museum]] is a reliable source to explain away the apparent contradiction between Stothard and the other reproduction. I've deliberately not included any of the present images at the head of the article: they're pretty poor and I'm now aware that a chalk drawing exists of BT. That was done by W. bone and is in the holdings of the IWM. It is not online but I know a trustee of the IWM and will see if I can move things forward - they're usually pretty good when it comes to educational use. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 01:27, 17 November 2013 (UTC)
::NPG uploaded the portrait in May 2014. I've now added it to the head of the article. No infobox! - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 11:45, 5 August 2014 (UTC)

== Parody, but not actual quote? ==

Why is it that the article has a lengthy quote of a parody of his war reporting, but no actual quotation of his war writing? [[User:Cullen328|'''&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Cullen&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;328&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User talk:Cullen328|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;''Let's discuss it''&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:08, 21 November 2013 (UTC)
:Because he was known for being parodied. In fact, nowadays it seems to be his major claim to fame. I've got access to the report that the parody was based on but it is pretty long by comparison. If you want to do something with it then I can email it to you. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 20:16, 21 November 2013 (UTC)
::Yes, please do. Perhaps I can find a section of comparable length about tanks, so that readers can see the style that is being parodied. [[User:Cullen328|'''&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Cullen&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;328&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User talk:Cullen328|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;''Let's discuss it''&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:22, 21 November 2013 (UTC)
:::It would be good if you could. I'm off out soon but if you drop me an email then I'll download the pdf and whack it over to you before long. I read it online &amp; didn't store the file (I have access to backcopies ''The Times'', ''The Observer'' and ''The Guardian'' from their first publication until the mid-2000s, so if ever you need anything else just let me know). - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 20:32, 21 November 2013 (UTC)
::::Opps, had a brain fart there - the report was in the ''Daily Mail'', of course. There is a heavily-ellipsis'd version reproduced at pp. 123-124 of [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZwwNAQAAIAAJ this]. There are some other examples [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/mirror05_01.shtml here] (I know that some sources say he worked also for the ''Daily Mirror'' during the war but I've been trying to clarify the relationship because he was definitely an employee of the ''Mail''.) somewhere, I've read a fantastic one where he talks of being in a balloon over the battlefield and it ends pretty much as the parody does, ie: got to stop writing now and get back to the action. I'll see if I can find it again. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 21:47, 21 November 2013 (UTC)
:::::I've still not clarified the ''Daliy Mirror'' relationship but I'm going to include a mention at some point. THere are plenty of examples at the [[British Newspaper Archive]]. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 11:47, 5 August 2014 (UTC)
