'''USS ''Fort Worth'' (LCS-3)''' is a {{sclass-|Freedom|littoral combat ship|0}} [[littoral combat ship]] of the [[United States Navy]]. She is the first ship to be named after [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the 16th-largest city in the United States.

== Construction ==
[[File:USS Fort Worth (LCS-3) Ship christening 01.jpg|thumb|left|''Fort Worth'' sliding into the Menominee River during her christening ceremony on 4 December 2010]]
The ship's name was announced 6 March 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Name announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Navy Names Littoral Combat Ship USS Fort Worth |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=12538 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was after a long public relations campaign by United States Representative [[Kay Granger]], former Deputy Defense Secretary [[Gordon R.

Her [[keel]] was laid on 11 July 2009 during a ceremony at [[Marinette Marine]] Shipyard in [[Marinette, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marinelink.com/news/article/keel-laid-for-uss-fort-worth-lcs-3/331205.aspx | title=Keel Laid for USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) | publisher=Marine Link | date=13 July 2011 | accessdate=30 December 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62gcmA4sk | archivedate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fort Worth'' includes additional stability improvements to deal with issues found on the first ship in the class, {{USS|Freedom|LCS-1|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/CRS-LCS-May-2010.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service |title=Navy Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Program: Background, Issues, and Options for Congress |first=Ronald |last=O'Rourke |format=pdf |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 80% completed ship was launched by its contractor on 4 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://wtaq.com/news/articles/2010/dec/05/marinette-marine-christens-uss-fort-worth/ | title=Marinette Marine Christens USS Fort Worth | work=WTAQ.com | date=5 October 2011 | accessdate=30 December 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62gcX6Qra | archivedate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/lcs-3-fort-worth-will-be-christened-and-launched-dec-4/ | title=LCS 3 Fort Worth Will Be Christened and Launched Dec. | publisher=Defense Media Network | date=2 December 2010 | accessdate=30 December 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62gcQ4FS3 | archivedate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel underwent sea trials in [[Lake Michigan]] during late 2011, with the completion of these trials announced on 24 October 2011. The ship successfully completed its acceptance trials, which also took place on Lake Michigan, on 4 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shipbuildingtribune.com/2011/10/24/usa-lockheed-martin-completes-sea-trials-for-third-littoral-combat-ship/ | title=USA: Lockheed Martin Completes Sea Trials for Third Littoral Combat Ship | publisher=Shipbuilding Tribune | date=24 October 2011 | accessdate=30 December 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62gc0X46A | archivedate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=67017 |title=USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) Completes Acceptance Trials |publisher=Navy News Service |date=7 May 2012 | accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspectors found only ten severe deficiencies during the trials, an &quot;exponential&quot; improvement over ''Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steele |first=Jeanette |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/aug/07/third-littoral-class-ship-much-improved-navy-says/ |title=Third littoral class ship much improved, Navy says.|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=7 August 2012 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvements to the ship include a lengthened hull, which makes her faster than ''Freedom'' and ten percent more fuel efficient. ''Fort Worth'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] at [[Galveston, Texas]] on 22 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nishimura |first=Scott |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/09/22/4280079/uss-fort-worth-commissioned-in.html |title=USS Fort Worth commissioned in Galveston |work=Fort Worth Star Telegram |date=22 September 2012 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023140337/http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/09/22/4280079/uss-fort-worth-commissioned-in.html |archivedate=23 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She set sail on a 16-month deployment in the Fall of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140106/DEFREG02/301060023 |title=Next LCS Deployment To Last 16 Months |last1=Cavas |first1=Christopher P. |date=6 January 2014 |website=defensenews.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media Corporation |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fort Worth'' will rely on automated sensors to perform &quot;conditions-based maintenance&quot; and hopefully avoid the greatly overworked crew problems that ''Freedom'' had on her first deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/04/sleepless-in-singapore-lcs-is-undermanned-overworked-says-gao/ |title=Sleepless In Singapore: LCS Is Undermanned &amp; Overworked, Says GAO |last1=Freedberg Jr. |first1=Sydney J. |date=4 April 2014 |website=breakingdefense.com |publisher=Breaking Media, Inc. |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fort Worth'' lacks the bow thruster mounted on ''Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20120905/DEFREG02/309050002/U-S-Navy-8217-s-Newest-Ship-Gets-8-000-Mile-Shakedown |title=U.S. Navy’s Newest Ship Gets 8,000-Mile Shakedown |last1=CAVAS |first1=CHRISTOPHER P. |date=5 September 2012 |website=defensenews.com |publisher=TEGNA |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In November 2013, ''Fort Worth'' conducted successful live-fire tests of its 57&amp;nbsp;mm and 30&amp;nbsp;mm cannons against small boat targets conducting swarm attacks. ''Fort Worth'' was moving fast through the water and assisted by an [[MH-60R]] helicopter. The ship's fire control system locked on to and fired on the small maneuvering boats in day and night situations with optical sights. The helicopter provided radar targeting which was passed on to the ship's fire control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defensetech.org/2013/11/12/lcs-defends-against-swarm-boats-in-live-fire-tests/ |title=LCS Defends Against Swarm Boats in Live Fire Tests |publisher=Defensetech.org |last=Osborn |first=Kris |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fort Worth'' conducted additional evaluations of its surface warfare technologies in early 2014 in scenarios involving small boat swarms, engagements with its 57&amp;nbsp;mm gun, and search and seizure exercises. Evaluations were successful and validated the surface warfare mission package on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defensetech.org/2014/05/01/lcs-fort-worth-completes-test-as-congress-cools-on-program/ |title=LCS Fort Worth Completes Test as Congress Cools on Program |last=Osborn |first=Kris |publisher=Defensetech.org |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, ''Fort Worth'' became the first LCS to test operations with the [[Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout]] a critical capacity for the LCS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=77663 |title=USS Fort Worth Launches First UAV, Demonstrates LCS Capability |date=15 November 2013 |website=www.navy.mil |publisher=Navy News Service |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2014, the commander of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|U.S. 7th Fleet]] announced that ''Fort Worth'' would deploy to the Asia-Pacific region in January 2015.  The ship will be used to expand operational envelopes that were not done by the previous deployment of USS ''Freedom'' to the region, particularly concerning the mine counter measures (MCM) package. Emphasis on MCM is based on periodic provocations made by North Korea, which has deployed sea mines around the peninsula that have sunk South Korean vessels in the past, so the Navy wants to test the MCM mission in and around the [[Korean peninsula]]. Another area of focus is to use the ship to provide &quot;non-traditional&quot; maritime lift for [[U.S. Marines]] due to constraints in the number of big deck amphibious vessels available to the 7th Fleet.  Operational trials made by  ''Freedom'' also showed the potential to improve vertical lift replenishment in shallow waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/imps-news/second-us-lcs-arrive-asia-end-2014/ |title=Second US LCS to arrive in Asia end of 2014] |publisher=Shephardmedia.com |date=10 September 2014|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She deployed with the surface warfare mission-equipment package and was the first LCS deployment with the MQ-8B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defensetech.org/2014/11/13/fort-worth-first-lcs-to-deploy-with-uas/ |title=Fort Worth First LCS to Deploy with Drone Aircraft |last1=Osborn |first1=Kris |date=13 November 2014 |website=defensetech.org |publisher=Monster |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fort Worth'' departed her homeport of [[San Diego]] on 17 November 2014 for a 16-month rotational deployment to [[Singapore]] in support of the U.S. Navy's strategic rebalance to the Pacific. The ship is the first LCS to deploy under the &quot;3-2-1&quot; manning concept, swapping fully trained crews roughly every four months. Under this concept three rotational crews will support two LCS ships and maintain one deployed ship. ''Fort Worth'' also deploys with an aviation detachment from Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 35 (HSM-35) &quot;Magicians&quot;, the U.S. Navy's first composite expeditionary helicopter squadron. The aviation detachment will consist of one [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60R Seahawk]] helicopter and one [[Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout]] unmanned autonomous helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=84483 |title=USS Fort Worth Commences 16-Month Rotational Deployment to Western Pacific |publisher=Navy News Service |date=17 November 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fort Worth'' reached the 7th Fleet area of responsibility on 4 December 2014. The ship is expected to remain in the area until March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.usni.org/2014/12/04/uss-fort-worth-lcs-chops-7th-fleet |title=USS Fort Worth LCS Chops to 7th Fleet |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |publisher=USNI.org |date=4 December 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the longest deployment of a U.S. warship in 42 years, since the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}} was under way for 327 days in 1973. The long deployment is to stress the Navy’s logistics capabilities and identify potential problems. Once the deployment is completed, ''Freedom'' will take the ship's place, returning to the area again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/navy/littoral-combat-ship-readies-for-pacific-deployment-the-navy-s-longest-in-decades-1.313954 |title=Littoral combat ship readies for Pacific deployment, the Navy’s longest in decades |last=Hlad |first=Jennifer |work=Stars and Stripes.com |date=13 November 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2014, ''Fort Worth'' was dispatched from Singapore to the [[Java Sea]] to take part in the search for [[Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501]] that crashed on 28 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/dec/30/second-san-diego-based-navy-ship-joins-recovery-ef/|title = Second San Diego-Based Navy Ship Joins In Recovery Effort For Air Asia Jet|date = 30 December 2014|accessdate = 30 December 2014 |work= KPBS.com|publisher=KPBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.usni.org/2014/12/30/u-s-destroyer-sampson-station-airliner-search-black-box-detector-prepped |title=U.S. Destroyer Sampson On Station for Airliner Search, Fort Worth LCS Being Made Ready |publisher=USNI.org |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |date=30 December 2014 |accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 2015 she arrived in the area to commence search efforts alongside the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Sampson|DDG-102|6}} at the request of the Indonesian government. The maneuverability and shallow draft of the design allowed her to conduct expeditious visual and radar searches in the congested, shallow water environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpf.navy.mil/news.aspx/030497 USS Fort Worth Joins USS Sampson in AirAsia Search Effort] - CPF.Navy.mil, 2 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Both ships concluded search efforts on 15 January 2015 after performing 650 combined search hours. ''Fort Worth'' provided unique capabilities over the larger ''Sampson'', and employed her two {{convert|11|m|adj=on}} RHIBs in 107 hours of operations. A team from [[Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit One]] was embarked on the ship, operating three Tow Fish side scan sonar systems to search for wreckage during 78 hours over {{convert|12|nmi2|mi2 km2|abbr=on}}, the AN/PQS-2A passive sonar to listen for black box pings during 17 hours over {{convert|24|nmi2|mi2 km2||abbr=on}}, and a [[remotely operated vehicle]] to investigate objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=85201 USS Sampson and USS Fort Worth Detach From AirAsia Search] - Navy.mil, 15 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2015 the Chinese foreign ministry sent a complaint to the United States after ''Fort Worth'' made [[Freedom of navigation]] passage near [[Spratly Islands]] claimed by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/13/china-warning-us-south-china-sea-islands/27229987/ |title=China, U.S. head toward face-off in South China Sea |last1=Korte |first1=Gregory |date=13 May 2015 |website= |publisher=USA TODAY |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her deployment to the [[South China Sea]], ''Fort Worth'' encountered several warships of the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]], putting the new rules of the [[Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea]] into practice in a &quot;professional&quot; manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2715 |title=Littoral Combat Ship USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) Completes South China Sea Patrol |date=14 May 2015 |website=Navyrecognition.com |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2016, according to a memo from the service, it was reported that ''Fort Worth'' was sidelined in port at [[Singapore]] indefinitely because of damage to gears that propel the vessel, which resulted from a failure to use enough lubricating oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Littoral Combat Ship USS Fort Worth Sidelined in Singapore with Propulsion System Damage|url = http://news.usni.org/2016/01/21/littoral-combat-ship-uss-fort-worth-sidelined-in-singapore-with-propulsion-system-damage|website = USNI News|access-date = 2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, on 28 March 2016, [[Commander_(United_States)#Naval|CDR]] Michael Atwell, the commander of LCS crew 101 (the LCS is manned by a rotating crew), was relieved of duty and was temporarily replaced by CDR Lex Walker, deputy commodore of [[Destroyer Squadron 7]]. The Navy cited the reason for CDR Atwell's removal was &quot;due to a due to loss of confidence in Atwell's ability to command,&quot; stemming from initial findings into the incident that sidelined ''Fort Worth''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Navy fires Fort Worth commander amid investigation into engine damage|url = http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/2016/03/28/fort-worth-littoral-combat-ship-michael-atwell/82082090/|website = Navy Times|access-date = 2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the repairs to ''Fort Worth'' would cost between $20 and $30 million according to defense officials, and it was feared that the ship would need to be [[Heavy-lift ship|heavy-lifted]] back from Singapore to San Diego so it can be repaired during its scheduled overhaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-07/damage-extensive-for-crippled-u-s-littoral-ship-in-singapore |title= Damage Extensive for Crippled U.S. Littoral Ship in Singapore |last1=Capaccio |first1=Anthony |date=7 April 2016 |website=www.bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the USN announced on 13 April 2016, that ''Fort Worth'' would transit back to San Diego on her gas turbines instead, with the journey scheduled for summer 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USS Fort Worth Slated for Gas Turbine Transit, Repair Period in San Diego|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=94171|website =  U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs|access-date = 29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expected that ''Fort Worth'' would take 6 weeks to travel from Singapore to San Diego with several underway replenishments and planned fueling stops along the way. However, a subsequent assessment found that the damage to ''Fort Worth'' was less severe than initially believed, and her engines were repaired in Singapore by late July ahead of returning to the United States for further repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavas|first1=Christopher P.|title=LCS Fort Worth’s Return Journey Brightens|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense-news/2016/07/22/lcs-fort-worth-navy-littoral-combat-ship/87447454/|accessdate=22 August 2016|work=DefenseNews|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
