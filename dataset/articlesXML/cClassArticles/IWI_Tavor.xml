The '''Tavor''' is an [[Israel]]i [[bullpup]] [[assault rifle]] chambered for [[5.56×45mm NATO]] ammunition with a [[selective fire]] system, selecting between [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic mode]] and [[Automatic firearm|full automatic fire mode]].

It is produced by [[Israel Weapon Industries|Israel Weapon Industries (IWI)]]. It is produced in three main variants: the TAR-21; the CTAR-21; and the [[IWI X95|MTAR-21]].

Built around a long-stroke piston system (as found in the [[M1 Garand]] and [[AK-47]]), the Tavor is designed to maximize reliability, durability, and ease of maintenance, particularly under adverse or battlefield conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decidedly Different: The IWI Tavor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/decidedly-different-the-iwi-tavor|title=American Rifleman - Decidedly Different: The IWI Tavor|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the TAR-21 was selected by the IDF to gradually replace the [[M16 rifle]] variants as the standard issued weapon of the Israeli infantry by the end of 2018. The first Tavor (MTAR-21 variant) rifles were issued to infantry units in 2013, replacing the M-16 rifles.&lt;ref name=&quot;inn.co.il&quot;&gt;[http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/251955 The first time the IDF recruits were issued the &quot;Micro-Tavor&quot;] Israel National News, 22/02/13 13:01&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and design objectives==
[[Israel Military Industries]] (now [[Israel Weapon Industries]]) initiated the Tavor development team in 1995, under the direction of gun designer Zalmen Shebs.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAVOR History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israel-weapon.com/?catid=%7B9490BE81-EAFC-456A-ADC5-D042220A1625%7D|title=TAVOR History|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the project was to create an assault rifle that was more reliable, durable and easier to maintain than the [[M4A1 Carbine]], while also being better suited to close-quarters combat and  mechanized infantry roles. As a result, they hoped that the weapon would be officially adopted by the [[Israel Defense Forces]].

Due to the military's close-quarters and mechanized infantry requirements, the project team selected a bullpup design, that would allow the weapon to be compact while keeping a long barrel able to achieve ballistically favorable high muzzle velocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAVOR History&quot;/&gt; A long-stroke piston system, similar to that found in the AK-47 and M1 Garand, was selected to ensure the weapon's reliability under adverse conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Future Weapons 2007&quot;/&gt;

===Design features and engineering===

====Long-stroke piston system====
[[File:Gas OPR.gif|thumb|left|250px|The Tavor uses a long-stroke piston system, as found in the M1 Garand and the AK 47.]]

The Tavor rifle uses a non-lubricated [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long-stroke piston]] system, as found in the [[M1 Garand]], [[IMI Galil]] and the [[AK 47]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Future Weapons 2007&quot;&gt;''Future Weapons'', by Kevin Dockery, (Penguin 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the AK-47, the long-stroke piston mechanism contributes to the extreme forcefulness of the Tavor's extraction and chambering.&lt;ref name=&quot;sadj&quot;/&gt;

A long-stroke piston system may increase a weapon's reliability in extreme conditions (in comparison to the less reliable short-stroke piston systems), as has been found to be the case in both the M1 Garand and the AK 47.&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II'', By Russell C. Tilstra, (McFarland 2014) page 25-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tavor's attachment of the piston to a heavy bolt carrier, and the extension of the mainspring into the hollow stem of the bolt carrier, bears a family resemblance to the internal mechanism of the AK 47.&lt;ref name=&quot;Future Weapons 2007&quot;/&gt;

====Ambidexterity and modularity====
The TAR-21 has ejection ports on both sides of the rifle so it can easily be reconfigured for right or left-handed shooters. However, this process requires partial disassembly, so it cannot be quickly reconfigured while the rifle is in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtubevideo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS3vHnEQXBg#t=25s|title=Bullpup Forum SHOT Show Interview| publisher=Bullpup Forum|date= |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue related to this is the original plastic cover on the unused ejection can allow gas to escape during the course of fire. Due to the bullpup design this vents right under the shooters face causing issues, such as inhaling ejection gases and the fouling of glasses and face with ejection debris. The issue is exacerbated when the weapon is suppressed.  The characteristic black smudge from this has been nicknamed &quot;Tavor face&quot; by some shooters. This has been addressed by various non-factory solutions which increase sealing of the unused port.

Its ambidextrous [[selective fire|fire mode]] selector above the pistol grip has a [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic mode]] and a [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic mode]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weapon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israel-weapon.com/default.asp?catid={BE33B6E6-080B-45B8-AD85-C4E1E40D0422}|title=Israel Weapon Industries (I.W.I.): TAVOR TAR-21 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm|publisher=Israel-weapon.com|date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tavor features a self-contained, drop-in [[trigger group]], so that the trigger group can be changed or replaced without the use of additional tools.

====Barrel====
The Tavor barrels are made from CrMoV steel and cold hammer-forged (CHF) on the premises of the IWI factory in [[Ramat HaSharon]]. The barrel is chrome-lined for durability and corrosion resistance. The barrel features 6 grooves in a 178&amp;nbsp;mm (1 in 7 inch) twist, or 32 calibers right hand [[Rifling|twist rate]].

The barrel is fitted with a  'birdcage' style [[flash suppressor]], which can be fully disassembled without the need of additional tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;sadj&quot;/&gt;

====Chambering, ammunition and magazines====
[[File:Nightshot3332214.JPG|thumb|The X95 (foreground) during IDF Warrant Officers' training]]

The Tavor is primarily chambered for [[5.56×45mm NATO]], although [[9×19mm Parabellum]] and [[5.45×39mm]] Russian models are also available.

The IDF uses both 55-grain M193 and 62-grain M855 5.56×45mm rounds.  M193 rounds are used by regular infantrymen for better terminal effects at shorter distances, while the heavier M855 is used by sharpshooters.&lt;ref name=&quot;sadj&quot;/&gt;

The TAR-21 accepts standard [[STANAG magazine]]s. It can also be mounted with the [[M203 grenade launcher]].

====Bullpup configuration====
The Tavor uses a [[bullpup]]  configuration, in which the [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]], bolt carrier group and [[Magazine (firearms)#Function and types|magazine]] are placed behind the pistol grip. This shortens the firearm's overall length without sacrificing barrel length. As a result, the TAR-21 provides [[carbine]] overall length, yet can achieve [[rifle]] muzzle velocities if equipped with a rifle-length barrel. The Tavor can also be configured as a compact [[close quarters combat]] (CQC) weapon with a shorter 38&amp;nbsp;cm (15.0&amp;nbsp;in) length barrel, and in that form is called the CTAR-21.

====Last round bolt-open catch====
The Tavor features a last round bolt catch, whereby the bolt holds open after the last round discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwi.us/TAVOR|title=Tavor - IWI US|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a request of modern armies, as it helps to allow soldiers to know when their magazine empties and to reduce reloading times during combat.&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II
'', By Russell C. Tilstra, Russell C. Tilstra, (McFarland  2014), page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reliability, ease-of-maintenance and waterproofing====
The design objectives of the Tavor aimed for reliability and ease-of-maintenance, particularly under adverse or battlefield conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decidedly Different: The IWI Tavor&quot;/&gt; According to Russell C. Tilstra, the Tavor is &quot;easily considered  more reliable&quot; than the M16 and M4 series rifles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II'', By Russell C. Tilstra, (McFarland 2014) page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tavor is designed to be easily field-stripped, without the need for any additional tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwi.us/iwi/media/Manuals/TAVOR-SAR-Manual-V08-011-01-09-53RevA.pdf Tavor Sar] page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The rifle is waterproofed and its internal mechanism is sealed from outside elements, so that it can pass over-the-beach requirements.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons'' (Gun Digest Books, 26 Sep 2007), By Jack Lewis, Robert K. Campbell, David Steele, page 246&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trials in Israel===
[[File:Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_The_Strongest_Trees_in_the_Golan_Heights_(7).jpg|thumb|In use with Israel's Golani Brigade]]
The Tavor prevailed over the [[M4A1 Carbine]] in a series of trials of conducted during 2001 and 2002. Qualities tested included Mean Rounds Between Failures (MRBF), reliability, ergonomics during long marches, and ease-of-maintenance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decidedly Different: The IWI Tavor&quot;/&gt;

Following these trials, the IDF adopted the Tavor as its future standard arm for all branches of the infantry, with a gradual changeover beginning in 2006 and expected completion among front line troops by end of year 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAVOR History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sadj&quot;&gt;[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1125 IWI X95: A Bullpup For IDF Special Forces] - SAdefensejournal.com, 21 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Micro-Tavor''' ('''MTAR-21''') is the version of the Tavor that was selected as the future standard infantry weapon of the IDF.&lt;ref name=&quot;dover.idf.il&quot;&gt;[http://dover.idf.il/IDF/News_Channels/bamahana/09/043/01.htm מיקרו–תבור לכל לוחם חי&quot;ר]. Dover.idf.il. Retrieved on 2010-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Micro-Tavor was issued for the first time as the standard infantry weapon to recruits of the Givati Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/251955 The first time the IDF recruits were issued the &quot;Micro-Tavor&quot; ] Israel National News, 22/02/13 13:01&lt;/ref&gt;

With the use of a relatively simple conversion kit, the MTAR-21 can be converted from a 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm assault rifle to a 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[submachine gun]] loaded with 20, 25, and 32-round magazines. A [[suppressor]] can also be added to the weapon, as part of the 9&amp;nbsp;mm conversion kit. An integrated grenade launcher is currently being developed for the Micro Tavor.

When configured to fire 9&amp;nbsp;mm rounds, the gun uses a [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback]] operation to eject and reload rounds, but in the same body as the gas-operated rifle reloading system.  It is fed from [[Uzi]] magazines.  A suppressor can be mounted that allows for the use of standard velocity 9&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition, not specialized subsonic ammo.  The barrel is the same length as the rifle version, but has a 1:10&amp;nbsp;in rifling twist to stabilize heavy 9&amp;nbsp;mm bullets.&lt;ref name=&quot;sadj&quot;/&gt;

Compared to the {{convert|35|in|mm|abbr=on}} long M4 with its stock extended with a {{convert|14.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel, the X95 is {{convert|23|in|mm|abbr=on}} long with a {{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel.&lt;ref name=&quot;sadj&quot;/&gt;

It comes in a number of variants (including):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel-weapon.com/files/brochure_2012/IWI_X95_Family.pdf] IWI X95 brochure&lt;/ref&gt;
* X95 (5.56mm, compact assault rifle/carbine with 330mm/13&quot; barrel)
* X95L (5.56mm, compact assault rifle/carbine with 419mm/16.5&quot; barrel)
* X95 SMG (9mm, SMG with 330mm/13&quot; barrel)
* X95R (5.45×39mm,compact assault rifle/carbine with 330mm/13&quot; barrel)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel-weapon.com/default.asp?catid=%7BC0019E41-FA8C-47E3-A10B-6225A11CC8BD%7D IWI page about X95-R]. Retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* X95S (9mm, integrated suppressor with 275mm/10.8&quot; barrel, and a rate of fire of ~1200 rds/min)

;7.62 NATO X95
In March 2013, it was reported that IWI would be making an X95 Tavor chambered in [[7.62 NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/03/05/iwi-developing-a-7-62x51mm-tavor-x95-rifle/ IWI Developing A 7.62mm Tavor X95 Rifle] - Thefirearmblog.com, March 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

;5.45 Russian X95
In April 2013, IWI introduced a conversion kit for the X95, chambered for the [[5.45×39mm]] Russian.  The kit was designed for export customers to allow for the rifle to fire 5.45&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition already used in their inventories&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/04/28/israel-weapon-industries-extends-capabilities-of-x95-assault-rifle-for-defense-agencies/ Israel Weapon Industries Extends Capabilities Of X95 Assault Rifle For Defense Agencies], [[Jewish Business News]], Apr 28th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/landwarfareintl/iwi-unveils-conversion-kit-x95-assault-rifle/|title=IWI unveils conversion kit for X95 assault rifle  - News - Shephard|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-automatic TC-21===
The semi-automatic Tavor Carbine (TC-21) was first made available for civilian customers to purchase in [[Canada]] from 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaammo.com/product.php?productid=12&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1|title=IWI Tavor civilian semi-automatic carbine|publisher=Canadaammo.com|date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian civilian version initially shipped with the Mepro reflex sight and a slightly longer barrel to meet the Canadian requirement for non-restricted semi-automatic centerfire rifles to have a barrel length of at least 470&amp;nbsp;mm.  Current version are shipped with a full length Picatinny rail, without optics.

IWI started a new US subsidiary, which is manufacturing the semi-automatic Tavor for US sales, with a market date of April 2013. Versions are for sale, with two barrel lengths (16.5&quot; and 18&quot;). The longer barrel is likely to meet [[National Firearms Act|NFA]] requirements for overall length with the muzzle device removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwi.us&quot;&gt;[http://www.iwi.us/] IWI-US.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the Tavor is available to civilian customers in the United States through IWI's US subsidiary,&lt;ref name=&quot;iwi.us&quot;/&gt; The weapon is manufactured with a combination of Israeli and US parts.  It is available in black, OD green, or flat dark earth colors and with either a 16.5&quot; or 18&quot; barrel. Also available on the 16.5&quot; variant is an integrated Mepro reflex sight. The standard versions come with a full length picatinny rail along the top in addition to the 45-degree offset rail on the ejection side of the foregrip. These variants have an integrated backup sight system that collapses into the rail, with a tritium equipped front post. All variants are compliant with the National Firearms Act. Also available from IWI-US are 9mm conversion kits which accept [[Colt 9mm SMG|Colt SMG]] style magazines, as well as left-to-right-hand, or vice versa, conversion bolts.

The designations for the US rifles are the Tavor SAR-B16, -B18, -B16L, and -B18L.

IWI US had shipped 50,000 Tavors to US civilian customers by early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/IWIUS/photos/a.240365686093959.59088.238732556257272/788866087910580/?type=3&amp;theater Another great milestone reached today! 50,000 Tavor SAR's out the door!] IWI US, Facebook&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the Czech company Zeleny Sport recently (December 2015) imported semi-automatic Israeli-made TAR-21 Flattop rifles, equipped with Mepro M5 or M21 reflex sight, which are now available for both civilian and law enforcement customers.

In 2016, it was announced that IWI would begin selling a civilian legal version of the X95, equipped with the lighter trigger-pack (that has also been issued to the IDF in recent years), on the American market later that year.

====Aftermarket parts====
A significant aftermarket of spare and replacement parts has developed around the Tavor, including the development of [[match grade]] [[accurizing]]  triggers for the rifle that are produced by manufacturers such as Geissele Automatics and double stage trigger pack TAV-D from Shooting Sight.&lt;ref name=&quot;israeldefense.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.israeldefense.com/?CategoryID=485&amp;ArticleID=2800 The success of the 'Tavor' has taken us by surprise&quot;] Amir Rapaport  10/3/2014&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Shlomi Sabag, Deputy CEO of IWI, says that one of the indicators of the success of the rifle in the shooting sports or civilian market, is the fact that &quot;an aftermarket of products associated with the Tavor rifle, like triggers, has evolved very quickly.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;israeldefense.com&quot;/&gt;

==Awards==
The [[National Rifle Association]]'s ''[[American Rifleman]]'' awarded the Tavor the 2014 Golden Bullseye Award as its rifle of the year.
