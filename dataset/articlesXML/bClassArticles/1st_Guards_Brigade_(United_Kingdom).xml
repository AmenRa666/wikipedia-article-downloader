The '''1st Guards Brigade''' was an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Army]], formed in the [[World War I|First World War]]. It was formed in August 1915 by the redesignation of the [[4th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th (Guards) Brigade]] on its transfer from the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]] to the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]]. It served with the Guards Division on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the rest of the war.

==History==
===4th (Guards) Brigade===
The [[4th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Brigade]] was an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Army]] with a history that stretched back to the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717034259/www.napoleonic-literature.com/Waterloo_OB/Allied.htm |date=17 July 2012 |title=The Anglo-Allied Army at napoleonic-literature.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/British_Order_of_Battle_WATERLOO.html | title=Wellington's Army in 1815 | accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, the 4th Brigade was a [[regular army]] formation stationed in [[London District (British Army)|London District]] and assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]].&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marksrussianmilitaryhistory.info/BRIT14.html | title=The British Army, 1914 | last=Conrad | first=Mark | year=1996 | accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated as '''4th (Guards) Brigade''' as it commanded four [[battalion]]s of [[Foot Guards#British Army|Foot Guards]].&lt;ref name=Becke44&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigade was among the first British formations to be sent overseas as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), crossing to France between 11 and 16 August 1914. It served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1914 and 1915 taking part in the [[Battle of Mons]] (23 and 24 August 1914), the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (6{{snd}}9 September), the [[First Battle of the Aisne]] (13{{snd}}20 September), the [[First Battle of Ypres]] (19 October{{snd}}30 November), and the [[Battle of Festubert]] (15{{snd}}20 May 1915).&lt;ref name=Becke46&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
On 19 August 1915, the brigade was transferred complete to the newly formed [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] and redesignated as '''1st Guards Brigade''' the next day.&lt;ref name=Becke28&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained with the division for the rest of the war, serving exclusively on the Western Front.&lt;ref name=Becke30&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War service===
In September 1915, the brigade took part in the [[Battle of Loos]] (26 September{{snd}}8 October) and [[Hohenzollern Redoubt]] (18{{snd}}19 October). In 1916, it fought in the later stages of the [[Battle of the Somme]], in particular the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] (15{{snd}}16 and 20{{snd}}22 September), the [[Battle of Morval]] (25{{snd}}28 September), and the [[Capture of Lesboeufs]] (25 September). In 1917, it saw action in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] including the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]] (31 July{{snd}}2 August), the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] (9 October), and the [[First Battle of Passchendaele]] (12 October). It then took part in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (24 November{{snd}}3 December).&lt;ref name=Becke30/&gt;

[[File:The German Spring Offensive, March-july 1918 Q8595.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stretcher bearer]]s passing by motor lorries of the 2nd Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]], near [[Arras]], [[France]], 22 March 1918.]]

In February 1918, British{{efn|name=reduced|As distinct from the Australian, Canadian and the New Zealand divisions which remained on a 12-battalion basis.}} divisions on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] were reduced from a 12-battalion to a 9-battalion basis (brigades from four to three battalions).&lt;ref name=Becke28/&gt; As a result, the [[4th Guards Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Guards Brigade]] was formed on 8 February 1918 by taking a battalion from each of the brigades of the Guards Division and the 1st Guards Brigade lost the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards.&lt;ref name=Becke29&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[4th Guards Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Guards Brigade]] also gained the 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]] from the [[2nd Guards Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Guards Brigade]] and the 4th Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]] from the [[3rd Guards Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Guards Brigade]].&lt;ref name=Becke29/&gt;}}

1918 saw the return of the war of movement. It had to withstand the [[German Army (German_Empire)|German Army]]'s [[Spring Offensive]] in the [[Operation Michael|First Battles of the Somme]] (1{{snd}}25 March) then switched over to counter-attack in the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|Second Battles of the Somme]] (21{{snd}}23 August), the [[Battle of Arras (1918)|Second Battle of Arras]] (26 August{{snd}}3 September), the [[Battles of the Hindenburg Line]] (12 September{{snd}}12 October), and in the [[Final Advance in Picardy]] including the battles of the [[Battle of the Selle|Selle]] and of the [[Battle of the Sambre (1918)|Sambre]]. Its final action was the Capture of [[Maubeuge]] on 9 November.&lt;ref name=Becke31&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===
After the signing of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the brigade was at [[Assevent]], north-east of Maubeuge,&lt;ref name=James41&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 17 November it regained 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards from the disbanding 4th Guards Brigade. The next day it began the march on Germany and crossed the frontier on 11 December. By 19 December it had reached the [[Cologne]] area. Battalions started returning to England on 20 February 1919 and the last units had completed the move by 29 April.&lt;ref name=Becke31/&gt;
