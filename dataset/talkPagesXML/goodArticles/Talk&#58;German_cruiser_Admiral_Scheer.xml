==Info==

Added some WW2 history from &quot;Defiance at Sea&quot; by Jon Guttman (ISBN 0-304-35085-0). [[User:Wiki-Ed|Wiki-Ed]] 00:16, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

==Armament==

There seems to be some dispute over the armament. The source I have in front of me (&quot;The Illustrated Directory of Warships from 1860 to the Present Day&quot;, David Miller, Salamander Books Ltd, London 2004, ISBN 0-86288-677-5) states that the ''Scheer'' had the following:
6 x 280mm, 
8 x 150mm, 
6 x 88mm,
8 x 37mm AA,
8 x 533mm TT

I suggest the two of you cite your sources and we can work out which is correct. [[User:Wiki-Ed|Wiki-Ed]] 10:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

: I've corrected the armament information, the 88mm AA were replaced with 105mm AA before the war. Source: [http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/panzerschiffe/admiralscheer/index.html German-Navy.de Admiral Scheer]. I assume it started with someone accidently mistyping the 105 as 150 and then people started believing this to be correct -- [[User:Nevfennas|Nevfennas]] 11:09, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
That is correct. My Father was a gunner at the 105 mm AA.--[[Special:Contributions/87.184.192.218|87.184.192.218]] ([[User talk:87.184.192.218|talk]]) 13:50, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

== Changing the masculine pronouns to feminine ==

Though it may very well be the case that the sailors on board considered the ''Admiral Scheer'' to be male, I suggest that the masculine pronouns in this article be changed to feminine to follow standard English language usage relating to ships.  As it is now, the masculine pronouns serve mainly to confuse and distract readers used to seeing ships referred to as &quot;she,&quot; thereby detracting from the article.  Furthermore, precedent on the English Wikipedia when dealing with ships that are male in their native tongue (e.g. those of the Russian navy) is to use female pronouns.  There is no reason the ''Admiral Scheer'' should be treated any differently. [[User:Jrt989|Jrt989]] ([[User talk:Jrt989|talk]]) 23:20, 5 December 2009 (UTC)

I agree. It's good to know that the ship's crew referred to the ship as &quot;he&quot;, but the article should call the ship &quot;it&quot; or &quot;she&quot;.[[User:Ettormo|Ettormo]] ([[User talk:Ettormo|talk]]) 14:50, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

:Since there's been no dissent in the nearly three months since I posted, I have changed the pronouns to feminine. [[User:Jrt989|Jrt989]] ([[User talk:Jrt989|talk]]) 03:09, 23 February 2010 (UTC) 

A better solution would be to follow the original common use. When the ship was called &quot;he&quot;, it was only &quot;the Scheer&quot; without the &quot;Admiral&quot;-prefix.

== saving text during rewrite ==
Just to note, I'm overhauling this article (and will do ''Deutscland/Lutzow'', ''Admiral Graf Spee'', and the class article as well). I've got Williamson's book on the way, so it'll be a few days before I can finish the rewrite. If anyone wants to help out, please do, and please cite reliable sources when adding material. I'm saving some text here during the rewrite for possible reuse. Thanks. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 13:50, 22 August 2011 (UTC)

Towards the end of its Spanish deployments, ''Admiral Scheer'' served in April 1938 as a polling booth for the extraterritorial vote of German and Austrian clerics, studying at the German college of [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]], on the question of the German annexation of Austria (''[[Anschluss]]''). For this purpose, she anchored in the harbour of [[Gaeta]]. Contrary to the overall German result, these clerical votes rejected the ''Anschluss'' with over 90%, an incident which was coined as &quot;[[Shame of Gaeta]]&quot; (Vergogna di Gaeta, Schande von Gaeta) at the time.

== Reichsmarine &amp; Kriegsmarine and more ==

Please note that the Reichsmarine was renamed to Kriegsmarine in 1935. Also noteworthy is that Ernst Lindemann was first gunnery officer durig the Spaish Civil War. [[User:MisterBee1966|MisterBee1966]] ([[User talk:MisterBee1966|talk]]) 20:36, 7 September 2011 (UTC)

:Fixed the first part and grabbed the citation from Lindemann's bio. Thanks for pointing those out. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 22:24, 7 September 2011 (UTC)

== Ersatz Lothringen ==


Suspect that this in fact is Elsa√ü Lothringen (the German name for Alsace-Lorraine)

[[User:DeGency|DeGency]] ([[User talk:DeGency|talk]]) 21:21, 26 February 2012 (UTC)

:Nope, &quot;[[Ersatz]]&quot; means replacement - {{SMS|Elsass}} and {{SMS|Lothringen}} were two different ships. ''Admiral Scheer'' was ordered as a replacement for ''Lothringen'', while ''Elsass'' was replaced by [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']]. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 21:34, 26 February 2012 (UTC)

== photos ==

In regard to some of the photos on the main page: Unless I am ignorant of alterations to SCHEER, three of the photos appear to be of the GRAF SPEE, not the SCHEER.

Joseph Couture[[User:Moosemin|Moosemin]] ([[User talk:Moosemin|talk]]) 23:45, 2 January 2016 (UTC)

:Yes, you are mistaken. These are all photos of ''Admiral Scheer'', which received the same mast as ''Admiral Graf Spee'' - it was ''Deutschland'' that had the smaller pole mast. One easy way to check is to look at the bow ornaments - it's somewhat hard with these low-res photos, but see for instance [[:File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-64, Panzerschiff &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;.jpg|this one of ''Admiral Scheer'']] and [[:File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-06, Panzerschiff &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;.jpg|this one of ''Admiral Graf Spee'']] (and for reference, here's [[:File:Panzerschiff Deutschland in 1936.jpg|this one of ''Deutschland'']]).
