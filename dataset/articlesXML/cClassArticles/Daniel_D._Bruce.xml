'''Daniel Dean Bruce''' (May 18, 1950 &amp;ndash; March 1, 1969) was a [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] who [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] received the [[Medal of Honor]] for heroism in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].  In March 1969, he was on night watch when an enemy [[hand grenade|explosive charge]] was thrown at his position, he caught it, held it close to his body, and ran from his position, saving the lives of three fellow Marines.

==Biography==
Daniel Bruce was born on May 18, 1950 in [[Michigan City, Indiana]], where he attended Garfield Grammar School, Barker Jr. High School, and Elston Sr. High School.

He enlisted in the [[Marine Forces Reserve|U.S. Marine Corps Reserve]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on May 20, 1968 and was discharged to enlist in the regular Marine Corps on July 17, 1968.

Upon completion of [[recruit training]] with the 2nd Recruit Training Battalion, Recruit Training Regiment, [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]], [[California]] in September 1968, he was transferred to the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]], California. He completed [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|individual combat training]] with Company U, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Training Regiment in November, and basic infantry training with Weapons Company, Basic Infantry Training Battalion, 2nd Infantry Training Regiment in December.

On January 1, 1969, Bruce was promoted to private first class, and later that month was ordered to the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]. He was assigned duty as anti-tank assault man with Headquarters and Service Company, [[3rd Battalion 5th Marines|3rd Battalion, 5th Marines]], [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]. 

While participating in combat at [[Firebase Tomahawk]], Quang Nam Province, on March 1, 1969, he was [[killed in action]] &amp;mdash; for his gallantry on this occasion, which saved the lives of three fellow Marines, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.  He was on night watch when an enemy explosive was thrown at his position.  He caught the charge, held it to his body, and ran from his position &amp;mdash; away from fellow Marines who would have been killed by the explosion.  Seconds later, the charge exploded and the full force of the blast was absorbed by Bruce.&lt;ref name=Dekever&gt;Dekever, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: High Mobility and Standdown 1969|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|url=https://archive.org/details/HighMobilityAndStanddown|year=1988|isbn=978-1494287627|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;
