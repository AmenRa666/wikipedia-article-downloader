[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''Sir Henry Evelyn Wood''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]] (9 February 1838&amp;nbsp;– 2 December 1919) was a [[British Army]] officer. After an early career in the [[Royal Navy]], Wood joined the British Army. He served in several major conflicts including the [[Indian Mutiny]] where, as a lieutenant, he was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that is awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces, for rescuing a local merchant from a band of robbers who had taken their captive into the jungle, where they intended to hang him. Wood further served as a commander in several other conflicts, notably the Third [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Anglo-Ashanti War]], the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], the [[First Boer War]] and the [[Mahdist War]]. His service in Egypt led to his appointment as [[Sirdar]] where he reorganised the [[Egyptian Army]]. He returned to Britain to serve as [[Aldershot Command|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Aldershot Command]] from 1889, as [[Quartermaster-General to the Forces]] from 1893 and as [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant General]] from 1897. His last appointment was as Commander of [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|2nd Army Corps]] (later renamed [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]]) from 1901 to 1904.

==Ancestry and early life==
[[File:E. Wood, 1852.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Wood in 1852 when in the Royal Navy (from a painting by Lady Wood)]]
Wood was born at [[Cressing]] near [[Braintree, Essex]] as the fifth and youngest son of Sir John Page Wood, [[Page Wood baronets|2nd Baronet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p314&quot;&gt;Heathcote 1999, p314&lt;/ref&gt; a clergyman,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;&gt;Reid 2006, p60-1&lt;/ref&gt; and Emma Caroline Michell, sister of [[Charles Collier Michell]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37000?docPos=2|title=Sir Evelyn Wood|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood was an elder brother of [[Katharine O'Shea|Katherine Parnell]] (Kitty O'Shea). [[Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet]], was his grandfather and [[Lord Chancellor]] [[William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley]] was an uncle. His maternal grandfather had been an admiral in the Portuguese navy. One of  his mother’s brothers was a British admiral, another rose to be Surveyor-General of Cape Colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p239-40&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p239-40&lt;/ref&gt; Wood was educated at [[Marlborough College]] but ran away after an unjust beating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p314&quot;/&gt;

==Early military career==

===Crimea===
Like his near contemporary [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]], Wood began his career in the Royal Navy, serving under his uncle Captain Frederick Mitchell on [[HMS Queen (1839)|HMS ''Queen'']], but vertigo stopped him going aloft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;/&gt; Wood served as a [[midshipman]] in the [[Crimean War]] during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854)|siege of Sebastopol]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p314&quot;/&gt; in Captain [[William Peel (Royal Navy officer)|William Peel]]’s 1,400 strong naval brigade, whose job was to man some guns on a ridge opposite Sebastopol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p241-2&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p241-2&lt;/ref&gt; He was at [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]] and aged 16, he was seriously wounded in an attack on the [[Redan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p314&quot;/&gt; almost losing his left arm, which doctors wanted to amputate. Wood was [[mentioned in despatches]] and received his first, but unsuccessful, recommendation for a VC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cornet Wood.jpg|thumb|right|Cornet Wood, 13th Light Dragoons, 1855]]
Invalided home with a letter of recommendation from [[Fitzroy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], written five days before his own death, Wood left the [[Royal Navy]] to join the [[British Army]], becoming a [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]] (without purchase) in the [[13th Light Dragoons]] on 7 September 1855&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=21778 |date=7 September 1855|startpage=3362 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reporting to their depot with his arm still in a sling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;/&gt; He had only £250 a year in private income, rather than the £400 needed, and was soon in debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p241-2&quot;/&gt; His uncle paid for his promotion to [[lieutenant]] (1 February 1856).&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p314&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p243&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p243&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood returned to the Crimean Theatre (January 1856) but within a month was in hospital at [[Selimiye Barracks|Scutari]] with pneumonia and typhoid.  His parents were told he was dying, so his mother arrived on 20 March 1856 only to find one of [[Florence Nightingale]]’s nurses striking him.  He was so emaciated that his hip bones were poking through his skin. Against medical advice he was brought home to England to recover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;/&gt;

===India===
Wood considered joining the [[French Foreign Legion]], but instead became a lieutenant in the [[17th Lancers]] to gain passage to India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p314&quot;/&gt; He reached Bombay on 21 December 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p243-4&lt;/ref&gt; While out hunting he was attacked by a wounded tiger – it was shot in the nick of time by a hunting companion; – he also rode a giraffe belonging to a friendly Indian prince to win a bet with a brother officer - he stayed on long enough to win the bet, but was trampled badly, the animal's rear hoof breaking through both cheeks, crushing his nose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p314&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p245-6&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p245-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], Wood saw action at Rajghur, Sindwaho, Kharee, and Barode during the [[Indian Mutiny]].  On 19 October 1858 during an action at [[Sindwaho]] while in command of a troop of [[3rd Bombay Light Cavalry|light cavalry]], twenty-year-old Lieutenant Wood attacked a body of rebels, whom he routed almost single-handedly.  At [[Sindhora]], with the help of a ''[[daffadar]]'' and a ''[[sowar]]'', he rescued a local merchant from a band of robbers who had taken their captive into the jungle, where they had intended to hang him.  For this act of selfless bravery, Wood was awarded the Victoria Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/historical_figures/3698686.html?showAll=y&amp;c=y |title=Henry Evelyn Wood |author=Martin J. Hadwen |publisher=''Military History'' magazine, April 1994 (reprinted on historynet.com) |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His citation read:
{{quote|For having, on the 19th of October, 1858, during Action at Sindwaho, when in command of a Troop of the 3rd Light Cavalry, attacked with much gallantry, almost single handed, a body of Rebels who had made a stand, whom he routed. Also, for having subsequently, near Siudhora, gallantly advanced with a Duffadar and Sowar of Beatson's Horse, and rescued from a band of robbers, a Potail, Chemmum Singh, whom they had captured and carried off to the Jungles, where they intended to hang him.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=22419 |date=4 September 1860 |startpage=3257 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wood also saw action at Kurai (25 October 1859).  He became temporarily deaf for a week whilst studying Hindustani at Poona, which he attributed at the time to overwork.  In December 1859 he joined the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|2nd Central India Horse]], whose main function was the suppression of [[banditry]].  In this role he had to deal with an incipient mutiny and sort out the regimental accounts.  He was invalided back to Britain in November 1860 with fever, sunstroke and ear problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p245-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;&gt;Heathcote 1999, p315&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Staff College ===
On 16 April 1861, Wood was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=22502 |date=16 April 1861 |startpage=1616 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His captaincy cost him £1,000 official payment to the government and £1,500 “over regulation” to buy out his predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p246&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p246&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted again this time to [[brevet (military)|brevet]] major (for services in India) on 19 August 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=22654 |date=19 August 1862|startpage=4111|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood passed the exam to enter the new [[Staff College, Camberley]], but another officer from 17th Lancers had higher marks and as at that time only one officer was permitted from each regiment each year, Wood had to transfer to the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot]] on 21 October 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=22673 |date=21 October 1862|startpage=4990|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up his place in January 1863, and graduated in 1864.  Whilst at Staff College he took part in boxing lessons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p246&quot;/&gt;

In the autumn of 1865 the 73rd were ordered to Hong Kong, but Wood disliked the new commanding officer so much that he paid £500 to transfer into the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|17th (Leicestershire) Regiment of Foot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=23035|date=10 November 1865|startpage=5247|endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having just written to propose to his future wife, he read in 1867 that “General Napier” was to lead an [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|expedition to Abyssinia]]; he packed his bags and went to London to volunteer, but then learnt that this was not to be General [[William Craig Emilius Napier|William Napier]] whom he knew from India, but General [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Robert Napier]], whom he did not know and who was unlikely to grant him a staff position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p247&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p247&lt;/ref&gt;

After a stint as an [[aide-de-camp]] in Dublin, where the damp climate brought on a recurrence of fever and ear trouble,&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p246&quot;/&gt; Wood was given a staff position until 1871.  He was Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General, then brigade major of [[Aldershot Garrison#North Camp|North Camp at Aldershot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p247&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1871 he paid £2,000 to purchase a full majority in the [[90th Light Infantry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=23789 |date=27 October 1871|startpage=4387 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the last such transactions before the [[purchase of commissions]] system was abolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt; Nursing his children through diphtheria (he had sent his pregnant wife away), he was prescribed morphine for insomnia and nearly died of an overdose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p248&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p248&lt;/ref&gt;
Evelyn Wood was promoted to brevet [[lieutenant-colonel]] on 19 June 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=23947 |date=11 February 1873 |startpage=587 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial wars==

===Third Ashanti War===
In 1874, Wood served in the Third [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Anglo-Ashanti War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt; commanding a flank at the [[Battle of Amoaful]] (21 January 1874) where he was wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt; and at the Battle of Esaman. He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the [[Fante people|Fantis]] that “it would be difficult to imagine a more cowardly, useless lot of men”. He did, however, discourage British officers from using physical abuse on them.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p249&lt;/ref&gt;

He was wounded just above the heart, confining him to a stretcher for a day.  Relying on [[chlorodyne]] and [[laudanum]] to keep going, he was ordered to lead the sick and wounded back to the coast.  It was erroneously reported in the London press that he had been captured and probably flayed alive.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p249&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 31 March 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24082 |date=31 March 1874 |startpage=1921 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood presented two African chieftains with a walking stick, a hat and an umbrella.  Twenty-two years later, later his eldest son was also in [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]].  While there, he saw a native carrying a stick which the man would not sell, saying it belonged to his chief.  On closer inspection, Wood Junior read an inscription; 'Presented to Chief Andoo by Colonel Evelyn Wood, 1874.'&lt;ref&gt;Reagan 1992, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted brevet [[colonel]] on 1 April 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24082|date=31 March 1874 |startpage=1924 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed Superintendent of Garrison Instruction at [[Aldershot]], a position he held until 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt; A man of modest means for much of his life, Wood took his profession very seriously – like many who had served under [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount]] in the Ashanti War he was a member of the reforming “[[Wolseley ring]]”, although the two men were never on particularly good terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;/&gt;  With a young family to support but not hopeful of getting a staff position, Wood had studied law.  He was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] at the [[Middle Temple]] in 1874.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p248&quot;/&gt;

===Zulu War===
[[File:Evelyn Wood Vanity Fair 1879-11-15.jpeg|left|thumb|Wood by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1879]]

In 1878 Wood fought with the [[90th Light Infantry]] under [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lieutenant-General Thesiger]] (who later became Lord Chelmsford) in Natal.  Evelyn Wood was employed as field officer of 90th clashed with the [[Gaika people|Gaika]] tribe in the last of the Battle of Tutu Bush (May 1878) during the [[Xhosa Wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p250-1&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p250-1&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel on 13 November 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24651 |date=29 November 1878|startpage=6696|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1879, Wood took part in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] and was given command of the 3,000-strong 4th column on the left flank the army when they crossed the Zulu frontier.  Defeat of other British forces at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]] would force Wood to retreat to fortified positions at Kambula.  Defeated at [[Battle of Hlobane|Hlobane]] on 28 March 1879, where he had his horse shot from under him.  He recovered and the following day decisively beat the Zulus at [[Battle of Kambula|Kambula]] (29 March 1879).&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt; He was preferred for the local rank of brigadier-general on 3 April and also took part in the final battle at [[Battle of Ulundi|Ulundi]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning 2007, p111&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, Wood headed the negotiations which took place on Conference Hill.  The Zulus squatted round the negotiating tent in a large crescent.  According to one witness, they were 'apathetic'.  The tension rose when Wood emerged from the tent and ordered his band to play '[[God Save the Queen]]'.  The accompanying soldiers gave good cheer; the bandmaster was then told to play something lively.  Being Irish, the master 'treated them to 'Patrick's Day in the Morning'.  The effect was magical; one after another, the Zulus rose and, swaying and dancing, swarmed around the British soldiers on their horses.  Of particular interest to the Zulus was the bass drummer whom they seemed to greatly admire.  Their negotiations were successful.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan 1992, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was also advanced to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] on 23 June 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24737 |date=24 June 1879|startpage=4086|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manning 2007, p134, text of appointment refers to Wood as &quot;Colonel&quot;, although no specific date is given for an apparent lapse in his local rank as brigadier-general&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood was paid £100 for a series of London newspaper articles, his first published work.  By now Wood was so deaf from various fevers that an officer had to accompany him at night as he might not hear a sentry’s challenge.  He was disappointed not to be made a major-general.  Evelyn Wood and his wife were obliged by the Queen to take a six-month trip to escort the former [[Empress Eugenie]] to see the spot where her son, the [[Prince Imperial]], whose safety had aroused national concern, had been killed.  To his annoyance he received no pay whatsoever for this mission, despite being official business at the Queen's request.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p250-1&quot;/&gt; Wood recommended [[Redvers Buller]] for his VC after the Zulu War.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p255&lt;/ref&gt; Wood was briefly placed on the staff in [[Ireland]] and in that role was again given the local rank of [[brigadier-general]] in December 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24792 |date=16 December 1879|startpage=7417|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Boer War===
Wood was then posted to command the [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] Garrison ranked again in January 1880 as brigadier-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24799 |date=9 January 1880|startpage=102|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[First Boer War]] reaching a crescendo, he was sent back to South Africa in January 1881, again with the local rank of brigadier-general,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24924 |date=14 January 1881|startpage=180|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as second-in-command to [[George Pomeroy Colley|Sir George Colley]], Governor and Commander-in-Chief in Natal, succeeding him after his defeat and death at [[Battle of Majuba Hill|Majuba Hill]] (27 February 1881),&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p316&quot;&gt;Heathcote 1999, p316&lt;/ref&gt; earning promotion to the local rank of [[major-general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24953 |date=22 March 1881|startpage=1308|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood had intended to renew the fight to relieve the towns under siege, but was ordered by the Cabinet to make peace.  Wood wrote to his wife that the treaty would make him ”the best abused man in England for a time”.  Wolseley (who thought the treaty “infamous” and “ignominious”) and other officers thought he should have resigned his commission rather than sign it.  He had to travel to Pretoria, and was injured on the way when the horses of his carriage bolted, was offered but declined, the Governorship of Natal.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p251-2&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1881 he was appointed to a commission of inquiry into all matters relating to the future settlement of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=24960 |date=8 April 1881|startpage=1734|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the peace negotiations were an embarrassing reverse for Britain, they brought Wood political and royal favour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;/&gt; The Queen thought highly of him (and Buller).  Wood had already impressed [[Benjamin Disraeli|Lord Beaconsfield]] (Prime Minister at the time), who had met him at the Queen’s suggestion after the Zulu War, and now impressed [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], the current Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p257&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p257&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted permanently to the rank of major-general (30 November 1881)&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=25042 |date=29 November 1881|startpage=6215|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in Natal until February 1882, awarded a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]] on 17 February 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=25073 |date=17 February 1882|startpage=653|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to England and to the Chatham command.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=25074 |date=21 February 1882|startpage=709|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt and Sudan===
Wood was given command of a brigade in the Egyptian expedition to suppress the [[Urabi Revolt]]. However, his brigade remained behind in Alexandria, so he missed the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p253-4&quot;&gt;Farwell 1985, p253-4&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief visit to England in November 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=25166|date=10 November 1882 |startpage=4983|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to be [[Sirdar (Egypt)|Sirdar]] (commander) of the Egyptian Army from December 1882 until 1885, during which period he thoroughly reorganised it, with [[Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell|Francis Grenfell]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] working under him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p316&quot;/&gt; He had 25 British officers (who were given extra pay and Egyptian ranks a grade or two higher than their British ones) and a few NCOs, although to Wood’s annoyance Lt-Gen Stephenson, commander of the British occupation forces, was confirmed as his senior in June 1884. During the cholera epidemic of 1883, British officers earned the respect of Egyptian soldiers by nursing them. Wood gave Sundays off from drill as well as Fridays (the Muslim holy day), so that Egyptian soldiers would see that their British officers took their own religion seriously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p253-4&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Nile Expedition|Gordon Relief Expedition]] (see [[Mahdist War]]) Wood was in charge of the line of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=25431|date=9 January 1885 |startpage=122|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded the British at the [[Battle of Ginnis]] in December 1885.  He was the only officer to be given an important command despite advising against Wolseley’s choice of the Nile route.  Wood briefly took Redvers Buller’s place as Chief of Staff as Buller had to take charge of the desert column after Stewart was mortally wounded at [[Battle of Abu Klea|Abu Klea]].  In this job Wood became unpopular for employing female nurses (against the advice of army doctors at that time) and quarrelled with his friend Buller when Wood recommended a more cautious advance which would give time to build up supply depots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/biography/evelynwood.htm|title=Sir Evelyn Wood|publisher=British Empire|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this stage Wood was so deaf that Wolseley complained he had become hoarse from shouting at him. Wolseley wrote of Wood that “he has done worse than I expected” and in his journal described him as “the vainest but by no means the ablest of men.  He is as cunning as a first class female diplomatist … (but has not) real sound judgement…… intrigues with newspaper correspondents … he has not the brains nor the disposition nor the coolness nor the firmness of purpose to enable him to take command in any war … a very second rate general … whose two most remarkable traits (a)re extreme vanity &amp; unbounded self-seeking&quot; although a letter to his wife (complaining that Wood was “a very puzzle-headed fellow”, wanting in method  and vain) suggests that Wolseley still bore Wood a grudge about the peace after Majuba Hill.  Ill once again, Wood handed over the job of Sirdar to [[Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell|Francis Grenfell]].  To his annoyance, he received no honours from the Nile expedition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p253-4&quot;/&gt;

==Home commands==

===Aldershot===
[[File:Colonel Wood's quarters.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Wood's quarters in Aldershot]]
In 1886 Wood returned to Britain to take charge of [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]] at Colchester. Then, from 1 January 1889 to 8 October 1893 he was [[General Officer Commanding]] of [[Aldershot Command]], one of the most important posts in the army at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/museum/aldershot-museum/local-history-aldershot/military-biographies/field-marshal-sir-evelyn-wood.htm |title=Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood VC GCB GCMG|publisher=Aldershot Museum|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[lieutenant-general]] (1 April 1890) and advanced to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] on 30 May 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=26167 |date=30 May 1891|startpage=2921 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Aldershot]] Wood was concerned with the well-being of both troops and animals, recommending the rebuilding of barracks and training of army cooks.  At Aldershot he arranged for sick men’s food to be prepared in hospitals rather than brought in tins from their own units.  He experimented with training soldiers on bicycles, night marches (in the teeth of opposition, particularly from the [[Duke of Cambridge]], who thought it might interfere with horses’ rest) and negotiated with the railway companies for cheap rail tickets for soldiers going on leave. He also carried out extensive training manoeuvres for the regulars under his command and for [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;Manning pp 198-206.&lt;/ref&gt; He made contributions to a Baptist chapel for a time, and ensured that Baptist services were as well publicised as those of other denominations. With the help of some high-ranking Roman Catholic friends, he agreed on an ecumenical service for Irish regiments which was acceptable both to Roman Catholic soldiers and their Anglican officers and chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p257, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wood was at Aldershot his [[Aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] included Captain Edward Roderic 'Roddy' Owen ([[Lancashire Fusiliers]]), a famous amateur jockey, which his biographer has identified as due to Wood's keen interest as rider and foxhunter,&lt;ref&gt;Mai Bovill and George R. Askwith, ''Roddy Owen: A Memoir'', London, John Murray, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; and Major [[Hew Dalrymple Fanshawe]], [[19th Hussars]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning p 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Fanshawe (who commanded [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] during World War I), later became Wood's son-in-law, marrying his elder daughter Anna Pauline Mary on 25 July 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''Burke's Landed Gentry'': 'Fanshawe, formerly of Donnington Hall'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administering the Army===
[[File:Wood-evelyn.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A coloured photograph from Celebrities of the Army, London 1900]]
Wood saw further staff service at the [[War Office]] as [[Quartermaster-General to the Forces]] from 1893 to 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p316&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to full general on 26 March 1895 and was [[Adjutant-General to the Forces]] from 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=26895 |date=28 September 1897|startpage=5321|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p316&quot;/&gt; His duties in the 1890s were similar to those of a Chief of the General Staff, had such a job then existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid 2006, p60-1&quot;/&gt; He also served as [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Essex from 10 August 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=26884 |date=20 August 1897 |startpage=4674|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and granted the [[freedom of the city|freedom]] of the Borough of [[Chelmsford]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europese-bibliotheek.nl/en/Books/Chelmsford_in_old_picture_postcards/100-133880/Article/4|title=Chelmsford in old picture postcards|publisher=Bibliotheek|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the responsible colonel of the 5th Battalion, the [[Essex Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=28213 |date=8 January 1909|startpage=234 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood wrote several books at this time by writing each day for an hour before daybreak – in 1895 he published a book on the Crimean War, in 1896 a book on Cavalry at Waterloo, and in 1897 ''Achievements of Cavalry''.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p262-3&lt;/ref&gt; He was a patron of Captain [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], who had attracted his attention by reporting on French cavalry manoeuvres in the early 1890s, although they did not actually meet face-to-face until an 1895 [[staff ride]] where Haig was serving as an aide to Colonel [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]].  Haig wrote that Wood was “a capital fellow to have upon one’s side as he always gets his own way”.  He arranged Haig's posting to the 1898 Sudan War – with orders to write privately to him reporting on Kitchener, the general officer commanding, and on his expedition's progress.&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p60-1, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 Wood also acknowledged the abilities of [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]], who had returned to Parliament after his divorce scandal of the 1880s and who hoped (in vain, as it turned out) one day to be [[Secretary of State for War]]: &quot;You cannot think&quot;, remarked Wood, &quot;how grateful I am to anyone who takes an intelligent interest in the Army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D.P.43916, 94; Jenkins, Dilke, p.403&lt;/ref&gt;

Evelyn Wood, who had experience of commanding both infantry and cavalry, supported the concept of [[mounted infantry]] and proposed that each infantry battalion should have one mounted company.  The concept of mounted infantry fell back into disfavour in the Edwardian period as French and Haig, pure cavalrymen, rose to the top of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p112&lt;/ref&gt; Wolseley informed him that his role in the 1881 Peace made it impossible for him to be given a field command in the [[Second Boer War]], despite his offer to serve under Buller, his junior.  Nonetheless he was disappointed when [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Roberts]] was appointed commander-in-chief rather than himself.  His three sons also served in the war.  During the campaign, Evelyn Wood became ill from War Office work.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p264&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to command the [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Army Corps]] and [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] 1 October 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=A command for Sir Evelyn Wood|day_of_week=Thursday |date=5 September 1901 |page_number=4 |issue=36552| }}&lt;/ref&gt; holding the positions until 1904.  On 8 April 1903, he was promoted [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] and one of the most senior officers at [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] during a period of fundamental restructuring and reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=27547 |date=28 April 1903|startpage=2693|endpage= |supp=|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Wood became colonel of the [[Royal Horse Guards]] in November 1907 and a [[Gold Stick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=28080 |date=15 November 1907|startpage=7683 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 1913, only months before the outbreak of war, King George V reviewed the Household Cavalry in Windsor Great Park. &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;With a bevy of princes and famouse soldiers, a blue body with red wings flecked with gold and lit up by the twinkling of the sun on many breastplates...[Sir Evelyn Wood] paid unusual attention to his appearance,&quot; as Colonel of the Blues.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, vol.3, p.47; White-Spunner, p.449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Evelyn Wood epitomised the imperial hero, at the end of his life he was the last to see the rise and fall of the great Victorian cavalry command reach its apogee and then be made obsolete by the trenches of the Great War.  The Gold Stick was proud of his regiment: &quot;You can picture my pleasant thoughts when I contrast the spirit of the BLUES turning up to the duties of Machine Gunners, and the false swagger of the men... in a Light Dragoon Regiment&quot; he wrote contradicting their brigade commander. Evelyn Wood's youthful courage gave way to a shrewd appreciation of progress and the value of modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, 3, pp.196-7;White-Spunner, pp.483-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Field-Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood.jpg|thumb|Photo of Wood, c. 1917]]
===Family===
Wood’s mother was left short of money after 1866 when her husband died and, already 66 years old, she went on to write fourteen novels, translating [[Victor Hugo]]’s [[The Man Who Laughs|''L’Homme qui Rit'']] into English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p239-40&quot;/&gt; His sister Anna was also a novelist under her married name Steele - one of her novels featured a henpecked VC who was probably based on her brother.  She left her husband on her wedding night - apparently still a virgin - when she discovered that he expected to have sex with her.  Evelyn was once sued for assault after striking Colonel Steele in one of his many attempts to “reclaim” his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p239-40&quot;/&gt; During the Indian Mutiny another sister, Maria Chambers, conveyed her children to safety through mutineer-controlled country carrying a phial of poison for each child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p239-40&quot;/&gt;

===Marriage and children===
In 1867 Wood married the Hon. Mary Paulina Anne Southwell, a sister of [[Thomas Southwell, 4th Viscount Southwell]], a friend from India.  Southwell opposed the marriage as the Southwell family were Roman Catholic and Wood, although not a man of particularly strong religious views, refused to leave the Church of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p315&quot;/&gt; Having barely seen Paulina for four years, he proposed by letter in 1867 on the understanding that she would never “by a word or even by a look” try to prevent him from volunteering for war service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell 1985, p247&quot;/&gt; They had three sons and three daughters  but she died on 11 May 1891, while Wood was commanding at Aldershot.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manning p 201.&lt;/ref&gt; After his wife’s death Wood was deeply touched to receive 46 letters of condolence from NCOs and private soldiers who had served under him.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p262&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting===
Wood hunted an average 46 days out of his 60 days leave each year, almost up until his death.  He was convinced that hunting was of great value in training officers by encouraging horsemanship and developing an eye for terrain and for rapid decision-making in dangerous situations.  He was often injured, on one occasion whilst at Staff College falling on the crown of his head so badly that his neck swelled as if he were suffering from a large double [[goitre]].  During the Second Boer War he was injured in the chest when he fell against a crucifix, worn under his shirt, which had belonged to his late wife.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p246, 263-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parnell divorce scandal===
The Wood family were financially dependent on their wealthy, eccentric spinster Aunt Ben. She gave each sibling £5,000 but Evelyn received nothing since he had married a Catholic.  She later paid him an allowance for a time.  His brother-in-law later paid him enough of a salary to keep horses, grooms, hounds and servants, supposedly for supervising estates in Ireland, although it is unclear that he ever devoted much time to this task.  Wood had to appeal to Aunt Ben for cash after the First Boer War.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p248, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood and his siblings, Charles and Anna, demanded equal shares of Aunt Ben's inheritance, but in March 1888 she made a new will, leaving everything (£150,000 plus lands) in a trust for the sole benefit of her favourite niece, Wood's sister Katherine, better known as [[Kitty O'Shea]].  The other siblings tried to have Aunt Ben declared insane, a petition dismissed after she was examined by the eminent physician [[Sir Andrew Clark, 1st Baronet|Sir Andrew Clark]].  When Aunt Ben died in May 1889, the siblings alleged undue influence by Kitty.  Her husband, Captain [[William O'Shea]] ([[18th Hussars]]), an Irish MP, at this point also contested the will, claiming it contravened his marriage contract and also sued for divorce.  Kitty was the lover of the Irish nationalist politician [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the ensuing public scandal helped to destroy his career and any chance of [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]].  It is unclear whether the siblings had encouraged O’Shea in his divorce to blacken Kitty’s name.  It was suggested that Wood’s sister Anna Steele was herself a former lover of [[William O’Shea]] – when the will was overturned Anna used her share to live as a recluse, keeping a pet monkey to which she fed anchovy sandwiches.  Sir Evelyn probably received about £20,000 in the eventual settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p259-61&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final years ===
[[File:evelynwoodgrave.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wood's grave in [[Aldershot Military Cemetery]]]]
After retiring from active service in December 1904, Wood lived at [[Upminster]] in [[Essex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42829|title=A History of the County of Essex: Volume 7|publisher=British History on-line|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became chairman of the Territorial Force Association for the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=28099 |date=14 January 1908|startpage=319 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 1911 he was appointed [[Constable of the Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=28477 |date=21 March 1911|startpage=2320 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a governor of [[Gresham's School]] from 1899 to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I16211&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged|title=Sir Evelyn Wood|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a qualified barrister, he had become Honorary Colonel of the [[Inns of Court Regiment|14th Middlesex (Inns of Court) Rifle Volunteer Corps]] in November 1899 and supported its incorporation as an officer training unit in the new [[Haldane Reforms|Territorial Force]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote 1999, p316&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=28271 |date=16 July 1909|startpage=5468 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood's autobiography appeared in 1906. In retirement he wrote ''Our Fighting Services'' (1916) and ''Winnowed Memories'' (1917) which one historian described as “stuffed with adulatory letters he had received, extracts of speeches he had given and anecdotes in which his wisdom or cleverness figured”.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell 1985, p262-3, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood died in 1919, and was buried with full military honours in the [[Aldershot Military Cemetery|Military Cemetery]] at Aldershot in [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=grave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/hampshir.htm|title= Grave location for Holders of the Victoria Cross|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Victoria Cross is displayed at the [[National Army Museum]] in [[Chelsea, London]].&lt;ref name=grave/&gt; A [[Pub|public house]] known as the &quot;Sir Evelyn Wood&quot; is located in Widford Road in [[Chelmsford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuart166axe/4114970753/|title=Sir Evelyn Wood|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
