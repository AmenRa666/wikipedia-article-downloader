== Operation Enduring Freedom =/= Fighting piracy ==

Operation Enduring Freedom refers specifically to USA's anti-terror operations in various parts of the world. Please do not mix various countries anti-terror operations with it. China or Iran sending their naval warships to Somalia to fight piracy has got nothing to do with Operation Enduring Freedom. Both Iran and China are not a part of [[Combined Task Force 150]] and [[Combined Task Force 151|151]]. --[[User:Nosedown|Nosedown]] ([[User talk:Nosedown|talk]]) 02:44, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

== Why is FRENCH Flag noted under belligerents?? ==

This is not to diminish the contributions of any nation concerened, but on first glance, one might assume that FRANCE is contributing on a massive scale when they in fact, ARE NOT!!

As of July, 2009, France actually ranks about 7th or 8th of all the NATO nations and has sustained 28 casualties from the start of their partipation. 

'''Canada''', on the other hand, with a &quot;tiny&quot; military in relation to France has continually fielded between '''2,500 and 3,000 troops''' from the very beginnning of this conflict. Frances current committment is about '''1,000''' and they are located just outside Kabul. Probably the LEAST dangerous sector in the entire country if any area can be described as such. France has also announced that they will be COMPLETELY withdrawing its committment. (and may in fact have aleady begun to do so??)

The Canadians are currently tasked with partolling and figthing in one of the most dangerous provinces in all of Southern Afghanistan (along with the British) and are subject to attacks on a daily basis. They were one of (if not the very first) contributor to actually field Main Battle Tanks in support of their and other NATO troops. 

Tragically, Canada has up to this point sustained over '''120 dead''' (The third highest casualty rate after the US &amp; Great Britain!!!), to France's 28.

My point is this.... When one prominently notes the flag of a nation, that in reality is '''NOT''' doing the majority of the fighting and as a side note underneath states '''&quot;and approximately 39 other nations&quot;''', you have in effect, belittled and diminished the real sacrificies of others, and that is SHAMEFUL.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.239.34.128|99.239.34.128]] ([[User talk:99.239.34.128|talk]]) 16:01, 12 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

''Emotion should not be taken into account. Shame and sacrifice are irrelevant. Simply because France is not doing the &quot;majority&quot; of the fighting does not mean that their contribution is not worth mentioning in an encyclopedia.''

== Strength(?) ==

Just noticed that this war/conflict does not have a &quot;Strength&quot; section in the summary/info area.  I was curious to see what the US Troop Strength (ie # of troops there) was in Afghanistan but to no avail...  Anyone know the #'s?

== Operation Enduring Freedom - Kyrgyzstan ==

I was wondering about the Operation Enduring Freedom in Kyrgyzstan. I didn't know that a full fledged anti-terrorist operation is going on there. I know that the US and other countries are using Manas Int'l Airport as a base but is there really, or was there really an operation there? I cannot really seem to find any information on that. Can someone please clue me in?

== New People's Army/Jose Maria Sison ==

I removed these from the list of belligerents. Even though [[Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines]] is part of the campaign, it's inaccurate to include [[New People's Army]] and [[Jose Maria Sison]] them in that conflict. Not to discount the fact that NPA has been classified by the United States as a terrorist organization, no mention is found in any OEF articles of either the group or Sison.

Regarding:

: In 1996, Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden moved to Afghanistan upon the invitation of the Northern Alliance leader Abdur Rabb ur Rasool Sayyaf.

I doubt the Northern Alliance would have anything to do with Osama bin Laden. What is the source? 

For instance, article ''[[Najim Jihad]]'' has:

: In mid-1997, the Northern Alliance threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing Bin Laden to abandon Nazim Jihad

== OEF is not  &quot;the official name&quot; of the WoT ==

Absent an &quot;official&quot; statement from an authorized US gov. official that corroborates the claim made in the first sentence of this article, it is simply false. OEF originally pertained exclusively to Afghanistan in distinction from the Iraq operations, all of which were under the umbrella term War on Terror. Granted WoT is a meaningless term to the extent it is defined as &quot;US efforts to harm, defeat and destroy any person, organization or state the US designates as terrorist&quot;, but that does not mean that OEF is synonymous with WoT, either officially or colloquially.

As this article notes, OEF &quot;ended&quot; and was replaced with OFS. As the WoT main article notes, Bush arguably coined the term WoT (which he used as a synonym for 'crusade') in 9/2001, and that term referred broadly to any fight against terrorists anywhere, not just Afghanistan. Obama even stopped using the term WoT altogether, preferring instead to use some other hopelessly ambiguous term - but not OEF.

This may sound like pedantry but it is critical that terminology used as a euphemism for war has a reasonably objective definition. Sloppy language allows for things like calling the decades old US interventions in Central/South America OEF, and according to this article therefore part of the WoT, despite US involvement predating the WoT, despite the lack of belligerents on one side.

This entire article is full of dubious claims, but the first sentence is fairly outrageous.[[User:BTercero|BTercero]] ([[User talk:BTercero|talk]]) 05:01, 9 June 2016 (UTC)
