==History==
[[File:Cdndepartmentdefense.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[NDHQ|National Defence Headquarters]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]]]
The Department of National Defence was established by the [[National Defence Act]], which merged the [[Department of Militia and Defence (Canada)|Department of Militia and Defence]] (which was created in 1906 when the British Army withdrew its forces stationed in Canada), the [[Department of Naval Services]] (the department responsible for the administration of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]), and the [[Air Board (Canada)|Air Board]] (which oversaw aviation in Canada). The National Defence Act was passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] on June 28, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gough|first=Barry|title=Historical Dictionary of Canada|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-5496-1|authorlink=Barry M. Gough|page=xxxvii}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 December 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[Image:Defence_Team_Organisational_Structure_2014.jpg|right|400px]]

Both the Canadian Armed Forces (military) and the Department of National Defence (civilian civil servants) are, although two separate organizations, known collectively as the '''Defence Team''' as both institutions work closely together in the defence of Canada. The Minister of National Defence, as the member of cabinet responsible to Parliament for National Defence, heads the Defence Team. The Department of National Defence is headed by the Deputy Minister of National Defence. Under the Deputy Minister are a variety of associate deputy and assistant deputy ministers who are responsible for various aspects of the department (human resources, policy, etc.). The Deputy Minister is appointed by the Governor General on behalf of the Queen of Canada ([[Queen-in-Council]]) on the [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=AboutDND&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/about-notresujet/index-eng.asp | title=The Deputy Minister of National Defence | publisher=Department of National Defence | date=February 1, 2012 | accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-5/page-2.html#h-6 | title=National Defence Act | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | year=2012 | accessdate=September 2, 2012 | pages=R.S., c. N-4, s. 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Armed Forces, as a separate and distinct organization, is headed by the Chief of the Defence Staff, and reporting to him are the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force, and a variety of other commands. There are also a variety of offices and support organizations which report to both the Chief of Defence Staff and the Deputy Minister. 

The [[Monarchy in Canada|Canadian Sovereign]], represented by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], is responsible for appointing the Minister, Deputy Minister, and Chief of Defence Staff on the recommendation of the [[Queen's Privy Council of Canada]]. Although not part of the Defence Team organizational structure, the legal military chain-of-command within the Canadian Forces originates from the Queen of Canada as [[Commander-in-Chief of Canada|Commander-in-Chief]] (represented by the Governor General), through the Chief of the Defence Staff to all military officers by virtue of their holding of the Queen’s Commission, and thus through them to all members of the Canadian Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/about-org-structure/chief-of-defence-staff.page | title=Role of the Chief of Defence Staff | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Defence Portfolio==
{{Main|Minister of National Defence (Canada)}}

The Minister of National Defence is responsible for the entire Defence Portfolio comprising several organizations, including the Canadian Forces, the [[Communications Security Establishment]], [[Defence Research and Development Canada]], and the Department of National Defence, amongst others. The Department is not responsible for all of these organizations itself, but rather exists to support the minister in carrying out all of his duties within the Defence Portfolio. The Canadian Forces are a distinct and separate entity from the Department of National Defence.&lt;ref name=AboutDND/&gt;
