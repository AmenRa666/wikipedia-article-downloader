==Hyphen==
Congratulations for featuring an article with an incorrectly spelled title. No one has apparently noticed it. Has none of you heard of hyphens? - [[Special:Contributions/81.182.83.210|81.182.83.210]] ([[User talk:81.182.83.210|talk]]) 11:10, 9 December 2009 (UTC)
:You have a point, but this is the common name for all articles of this type (see some others on [[WP:OMT|majestic titan]]). Perhaps it's time to change [[WP:SHIPNAME]]? —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 17:34, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

== Inconsistent dates ==

From the cancellation section:

:''Atago and Takao were canceled on 31 July 1924, and broken up for scrap that year.
:''In 1923 the Great Kantō earthquake in Tokyo caused significant stress damage to the hull of Amagi. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. Amagi was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924.''

...as this currently reads, the earthquake in September 23 damaged the hull making it unusable, it was sold for scrapping in April 24, and then the ''other'' two ships were cancelled in July 24. It doesn't quite make sense to cancel the two less complete ships after you've already scrapped one of the two more complete ones - either the date should be 1923, or the reasoning for cancelling two of the Amagi's needs clarifying. [[User:Shimgray|Shimgray]] | [[User talk:Shimgray|talk]] | 20:43, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

:I'm not entirely sure I understand your question, but perhaps this will clarify things: after ''Amagi'' was damaged in the September 1923 quake, ''Tosa'' was designated in December 1923 for conversion to a carrier, in ''Amagi''{{'}}s place—so ''Atago'' and ''Takao'' had to be canceled, per the Treaty. [[User:Maralia|Maralia]] ([[User talk:Maralia|talk]]) 23:06, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

== Pearl Harbor ==

Why does it say the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred on 6 December 1941? - [[User:Denimadept|Denimadept]] ([[User talk:Denimadept|talk]]) 21:19, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

== Totals ==

In the info box, things don't quite add up to me, 4 planned, 0 completed, 4 cancelled, fine, but then 1 scrapped and 3 lost - that's make 8 by my book ? --[[user:leevanjackson|Lee&amp;there4;V]] [[User talk:leevanjackson|&lt;font color=&quot;#a3bfb1&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/leevanjackson|&lt;font color=&quot;#a3bfb1&quot;&gt;contribs)]]&lt;/font&gt; 22:27, 11 December 2009 (UTC)
:This is one of those cases where it's rough to fit things into an infobox in a sensible way.
:*None of the 4 planned ships were completed ''as designed'' (hence &quot;Cancelled: 4&quot;). 
:*&quot;Lost: 1&quot; refers to ''Akagi'', which was converted to an aircraft carrier (ergo not completed as designed) and then sunk at Midway. 
:*&quot;Scrapped: 3&quot; refers to the scrapping of the other 3, never-completed ships: ''Amagi'', ''Takao'' and ''Atago''.
:If you have a better idea how to present this in the limited confines of an infobox, I'm all ears :) [[User:Maralia|Maralia]] ([[User talk:Maralia|talk]]) 22:47, 11 December 2009 (UTC)
::Hi Maralia, fancy bumping into you! Not to worry - I was obviously in a nit-picky mood ! The only thing I could suggest is another statistic, something like 'modified' to indicate a vessel converted to a different final design, or maybe just a simple 'built' indicating how many were finished ? --[[user:leevanjackson|Lee&amp;there4;V]] [[User talk:leevanjackson|&lt;font color=&quot;#a3bfb1&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/leevanjackson|&lt;font color=&quot;#a3bfb1&quot;&gt;contribs)]]&lt;/font&gt; 18:33, 13 December 2009 (UTC)

== Takao, Formosa vs. Mount Takao ==

Conway says that the fourth ship ''Takao'' was to be named after Takao (Kaohsiung), Formosa, but this is pretty implausible.

# Every other Japanese battlecruiser, and virtually all type A cruisers, were named after mountains.
# The Type A cruiser ''Takao'', which re-used the name of the cancelled battleship, is stated to be named after Mount Takao.
# Two previous ''Takao''s ([[Japanese steam warship Takao|1]], [[Japanese cruiser Takao (1888)|2]]) were ''definitely'' named after the mountain, because at that time there ''was'' no town of Takao.
# I've never heard of ''any'' Japanese warship named after a settlement.
# Takao was an obscure colonial town. It would have been like naming four big new RN ships ''Temeraire'', ''Spitfire'', ''Swiftsure'', and ''Goose Bay''. It's ridiculous. (Maybe not [[USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74)|John C. Stennis]] ridiculous, but it's not like the IJN had a Senator from Formosa to pander to...)

:A-ha, I nailed down a citation... okay, I moved the anomalous Conway version to a note, and the main body now states [[Mount Takao]]. [[User:TitaniumCarbide|TiC]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:TitaniumCarbide|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 11:48, 11 June 2012 (UTC)</text>
