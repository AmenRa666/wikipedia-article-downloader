'''Manzanar''' is most widely known as the site of one of ten camps in the [[United States of America]] where over 110,000 [[Japanese American]]s were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly removed (incarcerated)]] during [[World War II]] from December 1942 up to 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;huff2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goyette|first1=Braden|title=What It Was Like To Be A Kid In The Middle Of A Shameful Chapter In American History|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/12/joyce-nakamura-okazaki-manzanar_n_5289723.html|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=Huffington Post|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;huff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goyette|first1=Braden|title=These Haunting Photos Capture The Daily Reality Of A Dark Episode In U.S. History|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/16/ansel-adams-manzanar_n_5155579.html|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=Huffington Post|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at the foot of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]]'s [[Owens Valley]] between the towns of [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]] to the south and [[Independence, California|Independence]] to the north, it is approximately {{convert|230|mi|km}} north of [[Los Angeles]]. Manzanar (which means &quot;apple orchard&quot; in Spanish) was identified by the United States [[National Park Service]] as the best-preserved of the former camp sites, and is now the '''Manzanar National Historic Site''', which preserves and interprets the legacy of Japanese American incarceration in the United States.&lt;ref name = &quot;NPSHistoryCulture&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site: History &amp; Culture (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/index.htm | accessdate = April 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before the first incarcerees arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who mostly lived in villages near several creeks in the area. Ranchers and miners formally established the town of Manzanar in 1910,&lt;ref name = &quot;Chaffey&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site – Orchard Community (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/orchard-community.htm | accessdate = July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but abandoned the town by 1929 after the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]] purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area.&lt;ref name = &quot;NPSHistoryCulture&quot;/&gt; As different as these groups were, their histories displayed a common thread of [[forced relocation]].

Since the last incarcerees left in 1945, former incarcerees and others have worked to protect Manzanar and to establish it as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]] to ensure that the history of the site, along with the stories of those who were unjustly incarcerated there, are remembered by current and future generations. The primary focus is the [[Japanese American internment|Japanese American incarceration]] era,&lt;ref name = &quot;GMP13–16&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | title = Manzanar National Historic Site: General Management Plan and Environmental Statement | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | pages = 13–16 |date=August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; as specified in the legislation that created the Manzanar National Historic Site. The site also interprets the former town of Manzanar, the ranch days, the settlement by the [[Owens Valley Paiute]], and the role that water played in shaping the history of the Owens Valley.&lt;ref name = &quot;Legislation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;GMP13–16&quot;/&gt;

==Terminology==
{{Further information|Japanese American internment#Terminology_debate}}
Since the end of World War II, there has been debate over the terminology used to refer to Manzanar, and the other camps in which [[Japanese Americans|Americans of Japanese ancestry]] and their immigrant parents, were incarcerated by the [[United States Government]] during the war.&lt;ref name = &quot;ManzanarControversy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Manzanar Controversy | url = http://www.pbs.org/weekendexplorer/california/mammoth/manzanar.htm | publisher = Public Broadcasting System | accessdate = July 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;DanielsTerminology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Daniels | first = Roger | title = Incarceration of the Japanese Americans: A Sixty-Year Perspective | journal = The History Teacher | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 4–6 |date=May 2002 | url = http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/35.3/daniels.html| accessdate =  July 18, 2007 | doi = 10.2307/3054440 | jstor = 3054440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ito-MotherJones&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Ito | first = Robert | title = Concentration Camp Or Summer Camp? | publisher = Mother Jones | date = September 15, 1998 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1998/09/concentration-camp-or-summer-camp | accessdate = November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manzanar has been referred to as a &quot;War Relocation Center,&quot; &quot;relocation camp,&quot; &quot;relocation center,&quot; &quot;[[internment camp]]&quot;, and &quot;[[concentration camp]]&quot;, and the controversy over which term is the most accurate and appropriate continues to the present day.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflectionsiii–iv&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | publisher = Manzanar Committee | year = 1998 | pages = iii–iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CLPEF&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=CLPEF Resolution Regarding Terminology | publisher=Civil Liberties Public Education Fund | url=http://www.momomedia.com/CLPEF/backgrnd.html#Link%20to%20terminology | year=1996 | accessdate=July 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;DenshoTerminology&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Densho: Terminology &amp; Glossary: A Note On Terminology | publisher = Densho | url = http://www.densho.org/default.asp?path=/assets/sharedpages/glossary.asp?section=home | year = 1997 | accessdate = July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. James Hirabayashi, Professor Emeritus and former Dean of Ethnic Studies at [[San Francisco State University]], wrote an article in 1994 in which he stated that he wonders why euphemistic terms used to describe camps such as Manzanar are still being used.

{{quote|Let us review the main points of the debate. Over 120,000 residents of the U.S.A., two thirds of whom were American citizens, were incarcerated under armed guard. There were no crimes committed, no trials, and no convictions: the Japanese Americans were political incarcerees. To detain American citizens in a site under armed guard surely constitutes a &quot;concentration camp.&quot; But what were the terms used by the government officials who were involved in the process and who had to justify these actions? Raymond Okamura provides us with a detailed list of terms. Let's consider three such euphemisms: &quot;evacuation,&quot; &quot;relocation,&quot; and &quot;non-aliens.&quot; Earthquake and flood victims are evacuated and relocated. The words refer to moving people in order to rescue and protect them from danger. The official government policy makers consistently used &quot;evacuation&quot; to refer to the forced removal of the Japanese Americans and the sites were called &quot;relocation centers.&quot; These are euphemisms (Webster: &quot;the substitution of an inoffensive term for one considered offensively explicit&quot;) as the terms do not imply forced removal nor incarceration in enclosures patrolled by armed guards. The masking was intentional.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hirabayashi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hirabayashi, Ph.D. | first = James | title = &quot;Concentration Camp&quot; or &quot;Relocation Center&quot; – What's in a Name? | journal =  Japanese American National Museum Quarterly | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | year = 1994 | url = http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2008/4/24/enduring-communities | accessdate = November 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hirabayashi went on to describe the harm done by the use of such euphemisms and also addressed the issue of whether or not only the Nazi camps can be called &quot;concentration camps.&quot;

{{quote|The harm in continuing to use the government's euphemisms is that it disguises or softens the reality which subsequently has been legally recognized as a grave error. The actions abrogated some fundamental principles underlying the Constitution, the very document under which we govern ourselves. This erosion of fundamental rights has consequences for all citizens of our society and we must see that it is never repeated. Some have argued that the Nazi Germany camps during the Holocaust were concentration camps and to refer to the Japanese American camps likewise would be an affront to the Jews. It is certainly true that the Japanese Americans did not suffer the harsh fate of the Jews in the terrible concentration camps or death camps where Nazi Germany practiced a policy of genocide. Although the loss of life was minimal in America's concentration camps, it does not negate the reality of the unconstitutional incarceration of Japanese American citizens. [[Michi Weglyn|Michi]] and Walter Weglyn's research concerning Nazi Germany's euphemisms for their concentration camps revealed such phrases as &quot;protective custody camps,&quot; &quot;reception centers,&quot; and &quot;transit camps.&quot; Ironically, two Nazi euphemisms were identical to our government's usage: &quot;assembly centers&quot; and &quot;relocation centers.&quot; It might be well to point out, also, that the Nazis were not operating under the U.S. Constitution. Comparisons usually neglect to point out that Hitler was operating under the rules of the Third Reich. In America all three branches of the U.S. government, ostensibly operating under the U.S. Constitution, ignored the Bill of Rights in order to incarcerate Japanese Americans.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hirabayashi&quot;/&gt;}}

In 1998, use of the term &quot;concentration camps&quot; gained greater credibility prior to the opening of an exhibit about the American camps at [[Ellis Island]]. Initially, the [[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC) and the National Park Service, which manages Ellis Island, objected to the use of the term in the exhibit.&lt;ref name = &quot;NYTimes-Debate&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Sengupta | first = Somini | title = What Is a Concentration Camp?

{{quote|A concentration camp is a place where people are imprisoned not because of any crimes they have committed, but simply because of who they are. Although many groups have been singled out for such persecution throughout history, the term 'concentration camp' was first used at the turn of the [20th] century in the Spanish American and Boer Wars. During World War II, America's concentration camps were clearly distinguishable from Nazi Germany's. Nazi camps were places of torture, barbarous medical experiments and summary executions; some were extermination centers with gas chambers. Six million Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust. Many others, including Gypsies, Poles, homosexuals and political dissidents were also victims of the Nazi concentration camps. In recent years, concentration camps have existed in the former Soviet Union, Cambodia and Bosnia. Despite differences, all had one thing in common: the people in power removed a minority group from the general population and the rest of society let it happen.&lt;ref name = &quot;JANM-AJC&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title = American Jewish Committee, Japanese American National Museum Issue Joint Statement About Ellis Island Exhibit Set To Open April 3 | publisher = Japanese American National Museum and American Jewish Committee | url = http://www.janm.org/press/release/52 | date = March 13, 1998 | accessdate = December 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NYTAccord&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Sengupta | first = Somini | title = Accord On Term &quot;Concentration Camp&quot; | publisher = New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/10/nyregion/accord-on-term-concentration-camp.html | date = March 10, 1998 | accessdate = June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On July 7, 2012, at their annual convention, the National Council of the [[Japanese American Citizens League]] unanimously ratified the ''Power of Words Handbook,'' calling for the use of  &quot;...truthful and accurate terms, and retiring the misleading euphemisms created by the government to cover up the denial of Constitutional and human rights, the force, oppressive conditions, and racism against 120,000 innocent people of Japanese ancestry locked up in America's World War II concentration camps.&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;PowerOfWords&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Noguchi | first = Andy | title = JACL Ratifies Power Of Words Handbook: What Are The Next Steps? | publisher = Japanese American Citizens League via the Manzanar Committee | url = http://blog.manzanarcommittee.org/2012/07/15/jacl-ratifies-power-of-words-handbook-what-are-the-next-steps | date = 2012-07-15 | accessdate = 2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Power Of Words Handbook'':

{{quote|From government documents and propaganda, to public discourse and newspapers, many euphemisms have been used to describe the experiences of Japanese Americans who were forced from their homes and communities during World War II. Words like ''evacuation'', ''relocation'', and ''assembly centers'' imply that the United States Government was trying to rescue Japanese Americans from a disastrous environment on the West Coast and simply help them move to a new gathering place. These terms strategically mask the fact that thousands of Japanese Americans were denied their rights as US citizens, and forcibly ordered to live in poorly constructed barracks on sites that were surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. Although the use of euphemisms was commonplace during World War II, and in many subsequent years, we realize that the continued use of these inaccurate terms is highly problematic.&lt;ref name = &quot;PowerOfWordsHB&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Power Of Words Handbook | url = http://www.jacl.org/06.18.12%20POW2%20Handbook%20final%20draft.pdf | publisher = Japanese American Citizens League | date = 2012-06-22 | accessdate = 2012-08-19 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Owens Valley had received scant attention from European Americans before the early 1860s, as it was little more than a crossroads of the routes through the area. When gold and silver were discovered in the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo Mountains, the resulting sudden influx of miners, farmers, cattlemen and their hungry herds brought conflict with the Owens Valley Paiute, whose crops were being destroyed.&lt;ref name = &quot;MillitaryMuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = California and the Indian Wars: The Owens Valley Indian War, 1861–1865 | publisher = The California Military Museum | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/OwensValley.html  | year = 1979 | accessdate = April 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Owens Valley Indian War]] of 1861–1863 ensued; at the end, the Owens Valley Paiute, along with other native peoples in the region, were forced at gunpoint by the [[United States Army]] to walk almost {{convert|200|mi|km}} to [[Fort Tejon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;OWPaiute&quot;/&gt; in one of the many forced relocations or &quot;[[Trail of Tears|Trails of Tears]]&quot; inflicted upon Native Americans in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAConsultations3–4&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Van Horn, Lawrence F. | title = Native American Consultations and Ethnographic Assessment: The Paiutes and Shoshones of Owens Valley, California | publisher = Western Archaeological and Conservation Center, National Park Service, US Department of the Interior, Denver Service Center | year = 1995 |pages = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FortTejon&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Fort Tejon, California | publisher = CivilWarAlbum.com | url = http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc/tejon.htm | date=September 9, 2002 | accessdate = April 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately one-third of the Native Americans in the Owens Valley were forcibly relocated to Fort Tejon. After 1863, many returned to their permanent villages that had been established along creeks flowing down from the Sierra Nevada mountains.&lt;ref name = &quot;NAConsultations3–4&quot;/&gt;  In the Manzanar area, the Owens Valley Paiute had established villages along Bairs, Georges, Shepherds, and Symmes creeks.&lt;ref name = &quot;NAConsultations3–4&quot;/&gt; Evidence of Paiute settlement in the area is still present.

===Ranchers===
When European American white settlers first arrived in the Owens Valley in the mid–19th century, they found a number of large Paiute villages in the Manzanar area.&lt;ref name = &quot;ThreeFarewells2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton | title = Three Farewells To Manzanar: The Archeology of Manzanar National Historic Site, California. Part 1: Chapters 1–14 | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Shepherd, one of the first of the new settlers, homesteaded {{convert|160|acre|ha}} of land {{convert|3|mi|0}} north of Georges Creek in 1864. With the help of Owens Valley Paiute field workers and laborers,&lt;ref name = &quot;Shepherd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site – Miners and Homesteaders (U.S. National Park Service) |  url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/miners-and-homesteaders.htm | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | accessdate = July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he expanded his ranch to {{convert|2000|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;ThreeFarewells2–3&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton | title = Three Farewells To Manzanar: The Archeology of Manzanar National Historic Site, California. Part 1: Chapters 1–14 | pages = 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, [[George Chaffey]], an agricultural developer from [[Southern California]], purchased Shepherd's ranch and subdivided it, along with other adjacent ranches. He founded the town of Manzanar in 1910.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chaffey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ThreeFarewells3&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton | title = Three Farewells To Manzanar: The Archeology of Manzanar National Historic Site, California. Part 1: Chapters 1–14 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chaffey's Owens Valley Improvement Company built an irrigation system and planted thousands of fruit trees.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chaffey&quot;/&gt; By 1920, the town had more than twenty-five homes, a two-room school, a town hall, and a general store.&lt;ref name = &quot;ThreeFarewells3&quot;/&gt;  Also at that time, nearly {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} of apple, pear, and peach trees were under cultivation; along with crops of grapes, prunes, potatoes, corn and alfalfa; and large vegetable and flower gardens.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chaffey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;DeBoer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = DeBoer | first = Lucille | title = Following Manzanar: A Life Story | journal = The Album, Times &amp; Tales of Inyo-Mono | publisher = Chalfant Press | year = 1993 | url = http://www.owensvalleyhistory.com/stories2/manzanar_town.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =  July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Manzanar was a very happy place and a pleasant place to live during those years, with its peach, pear, and apple orchards, alfalfa fields, tree-lined country lanes, meadows and corn fields,&quot; said Martha Mills, who lived at Manzanar from 1916 to 1920.&lt;ref name = &quot;ManzanarPeoplePage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site – People (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/people.htm | accessdate = July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early orchards, along with remnants of the town and ranches, are still present at Manzanar today.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThreeFarewells3&quot;/&gt;

===Quenching Los Angeles' thirst===
As early as March 1905, the City of Los Angeles began secretly acquiring [[water rights]] in the Owens Valley.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith192&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Smith, Genny Schumacher | title = Deepest Valley | publisher = Genny Smith Books | origyear = 1969| year = 1978 | isbn = 0-931378-01-X | page = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;TEDCases&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Neal | first = Kevin | title = TED Case Studies: The Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Owens and Mono Lakes (MONO Case) | journal = TED Case Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–6 |date=January 1997 | url = http://www.american.edu/TED/mono.htm | accessdate =  July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, it completed construction of its {{convert|233|mi|km|0|adj=on}} [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]],&lt;ref name = &quot;DWP-AqueductHistFacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = LADWP: Los Angeles Aqueduct Facts | url = http://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/cms/ladwp001006.jsp | publisher = Los Angeles Department of Water and Power | accessdate = November 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But it did not take long for Los Angeles water officials to realize that Owens River water was not enough to supply the rapidly growing metropolis. In 1920, they began to purchase more of the water rights on the Owens Valley floor. As the decade went on, the City of Los Angeles bought out one Owens Valley farmer after another, and extended its reach northward into [[Mono County, California|Mono County]], including Long Valley.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith 195-196&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Smith | title = Deepest Valley  | pages = 195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1933, the City owned 85% of all town property and 95% of all ranch and farm land in the Owens Valley, including Manzanar.&lt;ref name = &quot;ThreeFarewells3&quot;/&gt;

Although some residents sold their land for prices that made them financially independent and relocated, a significant number chose to stay. In dry years, Los Angeles pumped ground water and drained all surface water, diverting all of it into its aqueduct and leaving Owens Valley ranchers without water.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith 196&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Smith | title = Deepest Valley | page = 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without water for irrigation, the holdout ranchers were forced off their ranches and out of their communities; that included the town of Manzanar, which was abandoned by 1929.&lt;ref name = &quot;NPSHistoryCulture&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|'There was so much water during those early years, that when a horse pulled a buggy, the water frequently came up to the horse's knees,' said Lucille DeBoer, who lived on a ranch at Manzanar.  'When this happened, the children took off their shoes and socks to walk home. In the early 1900s the City of Los Angeles started to purchase ranches in the Owens Valley for the sole purpose of supplying water to the people in Los Angeles. People started to sell their land to the City; the City put in wells to drain the water out of the ground; the trees began to die; and the land finally turned to vacant dirt. This ended the Land of the Big Red Apples.'&lt;ref name = &quot;DeBoer&quot;/&gt;}}

Manzanar remained uninhabited until the [[United States Army]] leased {{convert|6200|acre|ha}} from the City of Los Angeles for the Manzanar War Relocation Center.&lt;ref name = &quot;NPSHistoryCulture&quot;/&gt;

After the December 7, 1941, [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States Government swiftly moved to begin solving the &quot;[[Japanese people|Japanese]] Problem&quot; on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the evening hours of that same day, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) arrested selected &quot;enemy&quot; [[alien (law)|aliens]], including 2,192 who were of Japanese descent.&lt;ref name = &quot;DenshoCauses&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Densho: Causes of the Incarceration | publisher = Densho | url = http://www.densho.org/causes/default.asp | accessdate = April 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The California government pressed for action by the national government, as many citizens were alarmed about potential activities by people of Japanese descent.

On February 19, 1942, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] to designate military commanders to prescribe military areas and to exclude &quot;any or all persons&quot; from such areas. The order also authorized the construction of what would later be called &quot;relocation centers&quot; by the [[War Relocation Authority]] (WRA) to house those who were to be excluded.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections3&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This order resulted in the forced relocation of over 120,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of whom were native-born [[United States nationality law|American citizens]]. The rest had been prevented from becoming citizens by federal law.&lt;ref name = &quot;AAPolitics&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Nakanishi, Don T. | title = Asian American Politics | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2003 | pages = 35, 41 | isbn = 0-7425-1850-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AAPacificNorthwest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author =  Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest | title = History of Washington State &amp; The Pacific Northwest: Lesson 22: Asian Americans and the Modern Pacific Northwest | url = http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Pacific%20Northwest%20History/Lessons/Lesson%2022/22.html | publisher = University of Washington |date=July 1998 | accessdate = December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 110,000 were incarcerated in the ten concentration camps located far inland and away from the coast.&lt;ref name = &quot;DenshoCauses&quot;/&gt;

The Owens Valley Reception Center was transferred to the WRA on June 1, 1942, and officially became the &quot;Manzanar War Relocation Center.&quot; The first Japanese American incarcerees to arrive at Manzanar were volunteers who helped build the camp. By mid–April, up to 1,000 Japanese Americans were arriving daily, and by July, the population of the camp neared 10,000.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE162–163&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | pages = 162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 90 percent of the incarcerees were from the Los Angeles area, with the rest coming from [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[California]]; and [[Bainbridge Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE162–163&quot;/&gt;  Many were farmers and fishermen.

The weather at Manzanar caused suffering for the incarcerees, few of whom were accustomed to the extremes of the area's climate. The temporary buildings were not adequate to shield people from the weather. The Owens Valley lies at an elevation of about {{convert|4000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;ManzanarWeather&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site – Weather (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/planyourvisit/weather.htm | date = July 26, 2006 | accessdate = August 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summers on the desert floor of the Owens Valley are generally hot, with temperatures exceeding {{convert|100|°F|°C}} not uncommon.&lt;ref name = &quot;ManzanarWeather&quot;/&gt;  Winters bring occasional snowfall and daytime temperatures that often drop into the {{convert|40|°F|°C}} range.&lt;ref name = &quot;ManzanarWeather&quot;/&gt; At night, temperatures are generally 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;°F (17 to 22&amp;nbsp;°C) lower than the daytime highs, and high winds are common day or night.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE162&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ManzanarWeather&quot;/&gt;  The area's mean annual precipitation is barely five inches (12.7&amp;nbsp;cm). The ever-present dust was a continual problem due to the frequent high winds; so much so that incarcerees usually woke up in the morning covered from head to toe with a fine layer of dust, and they constantly had to sweep dirt out of the barracks.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections8&quot;&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In the summer, the heat was unbearable,&quot; said former Manzanar incarceree Ralph Lazo (''see'' Notable Manzanar incarcerees section, below). &quot;In the winter, the sparsely rationed oil didn't adequately heat the tar paper-covered pine barracks with knotholes in the floor.

===Camp layout and facilities===
The camp site was situated on {{convert|6200|acre|ha}} at Manzanar, leased from the City of Los Angeles,&lt;ref name = &quot;NPSHistoryCulture&quot;/&gt; with the developed portion covering approximately {{convert|540|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE163&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residential area was about one square mile (2.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and consisted of 36 blocks of hastily constructed,&lt;ref name = &quot;JAsAtManzanar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site – Japanese Americans at Manzanar (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior  | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/japanese-americans-at-manzanar.htm | accessdate = November 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} tarpaper barracks, with each incarceree family living in a single {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} &quot;apartment&quot; in the barracks.

&quot;...One of the hardest things to endure was the communal latrines, with no partitions; and showers with no stalls,&quot; said former Manzanar incarceree Rosie Kakuuchi.&lt;ref name=&quot;JAsAtManzanar&quot;/&gt;

Each residential block also had a communal mess hall, a laundry room, a recreation hall, an ironing room, and a heating oil storage tank, although Block 33 lacked a recreation hall.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE167&quot;/&gt;  In addition to the residential blocks, Manzanar had 34 additional blocks that had staff housing, camp administration offices, two warehouses, a garage, a camp hospital, and 24 firebreaks.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE163&quot;/&gt;  The camp also had school facilities, a high school auditorium, staff housing, chicken and hog farms, churches, a cemetery, a post office, a cooperative store, other shops, a camp newspaper, and other necessary amenities that one would expect to find in most American cities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections16&quot;/&gt;

Manzanar also had a camouflage net factory, an experimental plantation for producing [[natural rubber]] from the [[Guayule]] plant, and an orphanage called [[Manzanar Children's Village|Children's Village]], which housed 101 Japanese American orphans.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;DenshoManzanar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Densho: Sites of Shame: Manzanar | publisher = Densho | url = http://www.densho.org/sitesofshame/facilities.xml | accessdate = April 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The camp perimeter had eight watchtowers manned by armed [[Military Police]], and it was enclosed by five-strand barbed wire. There were sentry posts at the main entrance.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE163&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections16&quot;/&gt;

After being uprooted from their homes and communities, the incarcerees found themselves having to endure primitive, sub-standard conditions,&lt;ref name = &quot;JAsAtManzanar&quot;/&gt; and lack of privacy. They had to wait in one line after another for meals, at latrines, and at the laundry room.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections7&quot;&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each camp was intended to be self-sufficient, and Manzanar was no exception.

[[File:Mess Hall Line.jpg|thumb|left|Waiting for lunch outside a mess hall at noon July 7, 1942]]

Food at Manzanar was based on military requirements. Meals usually consisted of hot rice and vegetables, since meat was scarce due to [[rationing]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections7&quot;/&gt;  In early 1944, a chicken ranch began operation, and in late April of the same year, the camp opened a hog farm. Both operations provided welcome meat supplements to the incarcerees' diet.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE171&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most incarcerees were employed at Manzanar to keep the camp running. Unskilled workers earned [[United States dollar|US$]]8 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|8|1942|r=1}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), semi-skilled workers earned $12 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|12|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), skilled workers made $16 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|16|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and professionals earned $19 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|19|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). In addition, all incarcerees received $3.60 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3.6|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) as a clothing allowance.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections7&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ansel Adams, Baseball game at Manzanar, 1943.jpg|thumb|right|A [[baseball]] game at Manzanar, 1943.]]

The incarcerees made Manzanar more livable through recreation. They participated in sports, including [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]], and [[martial arts]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections8&quot;/&gt;  They also personalized and beautified their barren surroundings by building elaborate [[Japanese garden|gardens]], which often included pools, waterfalls, and rock ornaments. There was even a nine-hole golf course.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE168&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Remnants of some of the gardens, pools, and rock ornaments are still present at Manzanar.

===Resistance===
Although most incarcerees quietly accepted their fate during World War II, there was some resistance in the camps.  [[Poston War Relocation Center|Poston]], [[Heart Mountain War Relocation Center|Heart Mountain]], [[Topaz War Relocation Center|Topaz]], and [[Tule Lake War Relocation Center|Tule Lake]] each had civil disturbances about wage differences, [[black market]]ing of sugar, intergenerational friction, rumors of &quot;informers&quot; reporting to the camp administration or the FBI, and other issues.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections8&quot;/&gt; However, the most serious incident occurred at Manzanar on December 5–6, 1942, and became known as the Manzanar Riot.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE172&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months of tension between incarcerees who supported the [[Japanese American Citizens League]] (JACL) and a group of ''[[Kibei]]'' (Japanese Americans educated in Japan), rumors spread that sugar and meat shortages were the result of black marketing by camp administrators.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections8&quot;/&gt;  To make matters worse, incarceree and JACL leader Fred Tayama was beaten by six masked men. Harry Ueno, the leader of the Kitchen Workers Union, was suspected of involvement and was arrested and removed from Manzanar.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE172&quot;/&gt;  Soon after, 3,000 to 4,000 incarcerees gathered and marched to the administration area, protesting Ueno's arrest. After Ueno's supporters negotiated with the camp administration, he was returned to the Manzanar jail.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE172&quot;/&gt;  A crowd of several hundred returned to protest, and when the people surged forward, military police threw [[tear gas]] to disperse them. As people ran to avoid the tear gas, some in the crowd pushed a driverless truck toward the jail. At that moment, the military police fired into the crowd, killing a 17-year–old boy instantly. A 21-year–old man who was shot in the abdomen died days later. Nine other prisoners were wounded, and a military police corporal was wounded by a ricocheting bullet.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE173&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure===
On November 21, 1945, the [[War Relocation Authority|WRA]] closed Manzanar, the sixth camp to be closed. Although the incarcerees had been brought to the Owens Valley by the United States Government, they had to leave the camp and travel to their next destinations on their own.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE172&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections11&quot;&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WRA gave each person $25 (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25|1945|r=0}}}} today), one-way train or bus fare, and meals to those who had less than $600 (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600|1945|r=0}}}} today).&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections11&quot;/&gt;  While many left the camp voluntarily, a significant number refused to leave because they had no place to go after having lost everything when they were forcibly uprooted and removed from their homes. As such, they had to be forcibly removed once again, this time from Manzanar. Indeed, those who refused to leave were generally removed from their barracks, sometimes by force, even if they had no place to go.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections11&quot;/&gt;

146 incarcerees died at Manzanar.&lt;ref name = &quot;IReiTo5&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Jeffery F., Haines, Jeremy D., Farrell, Mary M. | title = I Rei To: Archaeological Investigations at the Manzanar Relocation Center Cemetery, Manzanar National Historic Site, California | publisher = Western Archeological and Conservation Center, National Park Service, US Department of the Interior | year = 2001 | id = Publications in Anthropology 79 | page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fifteen incarcerees were buried there, but only five graves remain, as most were later reburied elsewhere by their families.&lt;ref name = &quot;IReiTo18&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Haines, Farrell | title = I Rei To: Archeological Investigations at the Manzanar Relocation Center Cemetery, Manzanar National Historic Site, California | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manzanar cemetery site is marked by a monument that was built by incarceree stonemason Ryozo Kado in 1943.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections28&quot;&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An inscription in Japanese on the front of the monument reads, {{lang|ja|慰靈塔}} (Soul Consoling Tower).&lt;ref name = &quot;IReiTo5&quot;/&gt; The inscription on the back reads &quot;Erected by the Manzanar Japanese&quot; on the left, and &quot;August 1943&quot; on the right.&lt;ref name = &quot;IReiTo5&quot;/&gt;  Today, the monument is often draped in strings of ''[[origami]]'', and sometimes survivors and other visitors leave offerings of personal items as mementos. The National Park Service periodically collects and catalogues such items.

After the camp was closed, the site eventually returned to its original state. Within a couple of years, all the structures had been removed, with the exception of the two sentry posts at the entrance, the cemetery monument, and the former Manzanar High School auditorium, which was purchased by the [[Inyo County, California|County of Inyo]]. The County leased the auditorium to the Independence [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], who used it as a meeting facility and community theater until 1951. After that, the building was used as a maintenance facility by the Inyo County Road Department.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE172&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections18&quot;&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the site also retains numerous building foundations, portions of the water and sewer systems, the outline of the road grid, remains of the landscaping constructed by incarcerees, and much more.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections18&quot;/&gt;  Despite four years of use by the incarcerees, the site also retains evidence of the ranches and of the town of Manzanar, as well as artifacts from the days of the Owens Valley Paiute settlement.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;CAE173–200&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Site | pages = 173–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It included Asian American activists Bill and [[Yuri Kochiyama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TomFujita&quot;/&gt; Although she was not trained to be an archival researcher, Yoshinaga-Herzig decided to find out what historical documents about her and her family might exist at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].&lt;ref name = &quot;TomFujita&quot;/&gt;
:Herzig-Yoshinaga and her husband, John &quot;Jack&quot; Herzig, pored over mountains of documents from the War Relocation Authority, a task that &quot;was roughly equivalent to indexing all the information in a library, working from a card catalog that only gave a subject description by shelf, without giving individual book titles or authors.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;TomFujita&quot;/&gt;  Their efforts resulted in the discovery of evidence that the US Government perjured itself before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1944 cases ''[[Korematsu v.

It showed the [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the Executive Branch that the US Government would have far greater exposure in the still-pending lawsuit than by legislation under consideration in Congress for reparations. The proposed bill called for $20,000 reparations payments to each former incarceree or their immediate relatives, along with money for a civil liberties education fund (''see'' [[Civil Liberties Act|Civil Liberties Act of 1988]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;RepairingAmerica210&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Hohri | title = Repairing America: An Account of the Movement for Japanese American Redress | page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SacBee&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Magagnini | first = Stephen | title = A Nation's Apology | publisher = Sacramento Bee | date = October 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;HohriObitRafu&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Nakagawa | first = Martha | title = Hohri, 83; Lead Plaintiff in Internees' Lawsuit Against Government | url = http://rafu.com/news/2010/11/william-hohri | publisher = Rafu Shimpo | date = November 16, 2010 | accessdate = November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, camp director Ralph Merritt later allowed Miyatake to photograph freely within the camp, even though he was not allowed to actually press the shutter button, requiring a guard or camp official to perform this simple task.

===California Historical Landmark and Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument===

The Manzanar Committee's efforts resulted in the [[State of California]] naming Manzanar as [[California Historical Landmark]] #850 in 1972, with an historical marker being placed at the sentry post on April 14, 1973.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;OHP&quot;&gt;{{cite ohp|850|Manzanar|2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Historic Landmark and National Historic Site===
The Manzanar Committee also spearheaded efforts for Manzanar to be listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and in February 1985, Manzanar was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NHLSUM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Reflections19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NRHPINV2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Thompson, Irwin H. | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Manzanar War Relocation Center/Manzanar Internment Camp | url = {{NHLS url|id=76000484}} | publisher = U.S. National Park Service | format = PDF | date = August 12, 1984 | accessdate = May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embrey and the Committee also led the effort to have Manzanar designated a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]], and on March 3, 1992, President [[George H.

=== Opposition to the creation of the Manzanar National Historic Site ===
After Congress named Manzanar a National Historic Site and gave the National Park Service the job of restoring the site in 1992, protests against its creation emerged.
