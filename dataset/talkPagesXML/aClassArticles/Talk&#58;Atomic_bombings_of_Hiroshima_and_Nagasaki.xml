__TOC__

== Deaths by day after explosion  ==

I am trying to find the source of the following statement from the intro section of this article, &quot;roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day,&quot; because it seems to conflict with other sources.
This AtomicBombMuseum.org states &quot;Most persons close to ground zero who received high radiation dosages died immediately or during the first day. One-third of all fatalities occurred by the 4th day; two-thirds by the 10th day; and 90% by the end of three weeks.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://atomicbombmuseum.org/3_health.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; , which apprently comes from the book The Impact of the A-Bomb: Hiroshima and Nagasaki&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of the A-Bomb: Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 1945-85. Iwanami Shoten, Publishers, Tokyo, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Neilhalloran|Neilhalloran]] ([[User talk:Neilhalloran#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Neilhalloran|contribs]]) 20:40, 27 September 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Casualty ratio on Okinawa ==

I notice an inconsistency between this article, which says
: Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.
and the [[Battle of Okinawa]] article, which says that Japanese fatalities were
: From 77,166 killed[14] to 110,000 killed (U.S. Estimate)
vs. the American figure of
: 20,195 dead

I presume the figures in this article were meant to show that the Japanese were becoming more effective fighters as American forces approached Japan, which would mean that an American invasion of Japan would result in an exceptionally high number of casualties.

I don't have access to the reference cited in this article for the 2:1 ratio (Giangreco's &quot;Hell to Pay&quot;), but I'd lay odds that it isn't so far off from the sources behind the more specific figures in the Okinawa article. (And also note that the Wright/Shockley estimates suggested a 12.5:1 ratio for the proposed invasion of Japan, so the claimed trend wasn't considered relevant at the time either.) Maybe an explanation lies in the difference between casualties (including injuries) and fatalities, but maybe not.

If someone has that book, please figure out if one or both of these articles needs to be corrected. Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/71.197.166.72|71.197.166.72]] ([[User talk:71.197.166.72|talk]]) 07:38, 13 October 2016 (UTC)

:I don't see any inconsistency. American battle casualties on Okinawa (per Appleman  et al., p. 473) were 49,151 (of whom 12,520 were dead). Japanese losses were estimated at 110,000 dead and 7,400 taken prisoner. That's about 2:1. The high casualties were due to terrain favourable to the defence and well-fortified, and a well-led Japanese force in greater strength than anticipated. Although this wasn't known in August 1945, these factors would have also been true on Kyushu. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 11:07, 13 October 2016 (UTC)

::Well, those numbers are different than the ones in the Okinawa article, so please give some thought to whether you should update that article. But more importantly, interpreting those numbers as showing a 2:1 ratio requires equating Japanese deaths with American injuries, which does not seem legitimate. The Japanese were almost completely wiped out, dying at a rate over 8 times faster (by the Appleman et al. numbers) than American forces.
::This doesn't say to me that the Japanese forces on Okinawa were fighting particularly effectively, or more effectively than Japanese forces elsewhere, which is the apparent intent of the &quot;dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa&quot; line in this article.
::I'd still like to hear from anyone with a copy of Giangreco's book to see if it's really making this claim, or if someone here is just interpreting it that way. [[Special:Contributions/71.197.166.72|71.197.166.72]] ([[User talk:71.197.166.72|talk]]) 16:59, 13 October 2016 (UTC)
:::Giangreco says (p.49): {{quote|The Japanese defenders of Okinawa were inflicting casualties on US combat units at a rate that was both faster and higher than in previous campaigns. The ratios of only 4.6 and 5 Japanese casualties (usually deaths) for every 1 American battle casualty during the recent fighting on Leyte and Luzon respectively were far closer than what had been experienced during earlier Southwest Pacific operations . By Okinawa, the ratio had shrunk to 2 to 1 and an even more appalling 1.25 to 1 during the brutal fighting that had finally sputtered top an end on Iwo Jima.}}
:::American casualty figures in the Battle Okinawa article should be drawn from Appleman et al. Note that Giangreco is explicitly describing the American perspective in June 1945. The actual situation was worse than thought, because there were only 77,000 Japanese defenders on Okinawa. As Appleman et al. point out, the Japanese body count was exaggerated by errors in counting the dead, and miscounting Okinawan civilians as Japanese soldiers.  [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 19:40, 13 October 2016 (UTC)
:::: Okay, at least now I know what Giangreco said. I think he's selectively and misleadingly picking the statistics he quotes because he has an axe to grind, but this article isn't the place for that debate, so I'll leave it alone. :-) [[Special:Contributions/71.197.166.72|71.197.166.72]] ([[User talk:71.197.166.72|talk]]) 03:25, 17 October 2016 (UTC)
