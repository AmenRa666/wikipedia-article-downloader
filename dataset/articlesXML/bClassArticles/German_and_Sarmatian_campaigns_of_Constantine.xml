{{Campaignbox Germanic Wars}}
The '''German and Sarmatian campaigns of Constantine''' were fought by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] against the neighbouring [[Germanic peoples]], including the [[Franks]], [[Alemanni]] and [[Goths]], as well as the  [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] [[Iazyges]], along the [[limes|whole Roman northern defensive system]] to protect the empire's borders, between 306 and 336.

After becoming controller of the western provinces along the Rhine ''limes'' (in 306) following the death of his father [[Constantius Chlorus]] (Augustus of the west) in 306, Constantine initially concentrated his forces on defending this area of the frontier against the Franks and Alemanni, making [[Augusta Treverorum]] his first capital for this purpose. Having defeated the usurper [[Maxentius]] at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312,&lt;ref name=&quot;EutropioX,4&quot;&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''[[Breviarium ab Urbe condita]]'', 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; all [[Italia]] passed under Constantine's control and he thus became the sole Augustus of the West.

In February 313, Constantine (who had spent the winter in [[Rome]]) formed an alliance with the Emperor of the East, [[Licinius]], reinforced by Licinius' marriage to Constantine's sister, [[Flavia Julia Constantia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ZosimoII,17,2&quot;&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'', 2.17.2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this alliance survived for only a few years, before the two Augusti came into conflict in 316. Constantine defeated Licinius, who was forced to cede [[Diocese of Pannonia|Illyricum]] to Constantine,&lt;ref name=&quot;ZosimoII,20,1&quot;/&gt; but not [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ZosimoII,20,1&quot;/&gt; Constantine advanced ever further east with his territorial acquisitions, now having to defend the important strategic region of the ''limes sarmaticus'' (from 317).

In the following years, Constantine mostly occupied himself in the central section of the [[Danubian Limes]], mostly fighting against the Sarmatians in [[Pannonia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CIL8,8412&quot;/&gt; residing at [[Sirmium]] almost continuously until 324 (when he [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy#Wars of Constantine and Licinius|moved against Licinius once more]]), making it his capital&lt;ref name=&quot;MÃ³csy277&quot;/&gt; along with  [[Serdica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Horst214-276&quot;/&gt; At this time Constantine also demonstrated a very active military bent, travelling along the whole of the ''limites'' of his newly acquired territory. From 320 he appointed his eldest son, [[Crispus]], [[Praetorian prefect]], with military command of [[Diocese of Gaul|Gaul]].

When he learnt that an army of [[Goths]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AurVictDeCaes41&quot;/&gt; had crossed the Danube to raid Roman territory in [[Moesia Inferior]] and [[Thrace (Roman province)|Thrace]], which belonged to Emperor Licinius,&lt;ref name=&quot;Valesiani5.21&quot;/&gt; he left his general headquarters in [[Thessalonica]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ZosimoII,22,3&quot;/&gt; and marched against them (323). The fact that he had trespassed into a part of the empire which was not under his control unleashed the final phase of the [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy]], which ended with the complete defeat of Licinius and the consecration of Constantine as the sole Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZosimoII,28,2&quot;/&gt;

The final period of Constantine's reign, until his death (337), saw the Christian Emperor consolidate the entire defensive system on the Rhine and Danube and obtain important military successes which brought &quot;control&quot; of a large part of the territory that the Romans had been abbandoned by [[Gallienus]] and [[Aurelian]]: the [[Agri Decumates]] from the Alemanni, the area south of the [[Tisza]] from the Sarmatians, as well as [[Oltenia]] and [[Wallachia]] from the Goths. Even in this period, Constantine continued to have his preferred Imperial residences at Serdica, Sirmium and Thessalonica, rather than [[Diocletian]]'s [[Nicomedia]].

==Historical context ==
With the death of Emperor [[Numerian]] in November 284 (who had been entrusted with Eastern Roman empire by his father [[Carus]]) and the refusal of the eastern troops to recognise Carus' eldest son [[Carinus]] as his successor, a proven general of [[Illyria]]n origins, [[Diocletian]], was raised to the purple. At the end of the civil war which followed, Diocletian was victorious and in 285 he named [[Maximian]] as his deputy (or [[Caesar (title)#Tetrarchy|Caesar]]) and then a few months later elevated him to the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)#Division of Empire|Augustus]] (1 April 286), thereby forming a [[diarchy]], in which two emperors divided the government of the empire on geographic lines. This also entailed the division of responsibility for the defence of the northern frontier from Germanic and Sarmatian incursions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant265&quot;&gt;Grant, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, p. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the increasing difficulty of containing the internal revolts and those along the borders, a further territorial division was executed in 293 to facilitate military operations: Diocletian named [[Galerius]] as his Caesar in the east, while Maximian chose [[Constantius Chlorus]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this [[tetrarchy]] fell into crisis only a year after the abdication of the two Augusti in 305, beginning a new [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|Civil War]] (306-324), permitting new breaches along the Roman external border, with populations attempting to settle within Roman territory.

It was only with Constantine's accession to the throne, becoming sole Augustus of the West after the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312 and later still defeating Licinius and reuniting the Empire under a single emperor (324) that the northern frontiers were adequately defended once more. It is no coincidence that Constantine is attributed the responsibility for perfecting the military reforms of Diocletian and also for the reconquest or vassalisation of all the territory which [[Trajan]] had controlled.&lt;ref name=&quot;JulDeCaes329c&quot;&gt;[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], ''De Caesaribus'', 329c.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background: the death of Constantius Chlorus===

With the death of [[Constantius Chlorus]] at [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) on 25 July 306,&lt;ref name=&quot;EutropioX,1&quot;&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''[[Breviarium ab Urbe condita]]'', 10.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZosimoII,9,1&quot;&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''Storia nuova'', 2.9.1.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tetrarchy]] entered a crisis: the eldest son of the dead emperor, Constantine was proclaimed Augustus&lt;ref name=&quot;EutropioX,2&quot;&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''[[Breviarium ab Urbe condita]]'', 10.2.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Alemanni general [[Chrocus]] and the army of [[Britannia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Panegyrici latini]], 7.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Orosius]], ''History against the Pagans'', 7.26.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], ''De Caesaribus'', 40.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'', 8.13.14.&lt;/ref&gt; His election was in accordance with a dynastic principle rather than the meritocratic system of the Tetrarchy created by Diocletain. Only [[Lactantius]] maintains that Constantine was named Augustus by his father on his deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''[[De mortibus persecutorum]]'', 24.8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galerius]] was displeased by this act and offered the son of his deceased colleague the title of Caesar, which Constantine accepted, allowing [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Flavius Severus]] to succeed his father Constantius instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', pp. 27â28; Barnes, ''New Empire'', p. 5; Lenski, pp. 61â62; Odahl, pp. 78â79.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, [[Maxentius]] son of the old Augustus [[Maximian]] was acclaimed Emperor by the [[Praetorian guard]] with the support of officials like Marcellianus, Marcellus and Lucianus (but not [[Abellius]], vicar of the [[Praefectus urbi]], who was cilled), reaffirming the dynastic principle. It was in this period that Constantine began to achieve important military successes against the Alemanni and the Franks, along the stretch of the frontier attributed to him, as is recounted by [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EutropioX,3&quot;&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''[[Breviarium ab Urbe condita]]'', 10.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forces in the field ==

===Romans===
Regarding the Roman forces garrisoned along the whole stretch of the northern ''limites'' from [[Britannia]] to [[Moesia]], it is important to note that at this time there was a very important reform of the [[Roman army]], a new [[Deployment of the Roman legions]] along the borders and an increase in the [[size of the Roman army]]. In fact, we know that, with Diocletian's Tetrarchy reforms, the total number of legions was brough to 55 or 56 in the year 300.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. GonzÃ¡lez, ''Historia de las legiones romanas'', pp. 709-710.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's accession to the throne and the return of a dynastic monarchy brought about the final increase of the number of Roman legions to 62 or 64 around the year 330.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. GonzÃ¡lez, ''Historia de las legiones romanas'', pp. 711-712.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barbarians===
{{See also|Germanic peoples|Sarmatians}}

Along the Rhine ''limes'' the [[Franks]] and [[Saxons]] in particular pressed on [[Gaul]] and [[Britannia]]. The [[Alemanni]] also made some incursions in these regions, but the main goal of their attacks at this time was [[Northern Italy]] via [[Pannonia]] (the western part of the [[Danubian Limes]]). The major clashes occurred along the [[Lower Danube]] in the [[Roman province]]s of the [[Balkan]] region, where the [[Marcomanni]], [[Quadi]], [[Sarmatians]] and especially the [[Goths]] (divided into the [[Tervingi]] and the [[Greutungi]]) concentrated their attacks.

;306: The twenty-one-year-old Constantine, unable to get permission to visit his ailing father [[Constantius Chlorus]] (Augustus of the west) from the Augustus of the East, [[Galerius]], in whose court he had lived since the time of Diocletian, decided to escape in the spring of this year. He found his father at Gesoriacum ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]) about to cross the [[English Channel]] to [[Britannia]] and joined him in a successful military campaign against the [[Picts]] and [[Scotti]] to the north of [[Hadrian's wall]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Horst, ''Costantino il grande'', Milano 1987, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; When his father died during the summer, Constantine was proclaimed Augustus of the West by his father's loyal troops at [[Eboracum]] on 25 July.
:The young tetrarch however needed his election to the Imperial office to be recognised, particularly by Galerius, the most senior of the Augusti. Gelerius preferred his friend and [[Sassanid campaign of Galerius|comrade in arms]], [[Licinius]], to Constantine. Confronted with a ''fait accompli'' and in the face of the &quot;secession&quot; of Gaul and Britannia, Galerius appealed to precedent and named the former Caesar, [[Flavius Severus]] as the new Augustus with control over Italy, Africa, and Spain and recognised Constantine only as a Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;E. Horst, ''Costantino il grande'', Milano 1987, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine voluntarily accepted this and in Autumn of the same year he returned to [[Augusta Treverorum]] ([[Trier]]) whence he could more easily monitor the Gallic frontier, which was being menaced by the Franks. He continued to defend this important stretch of the ''limes'' for the next six years, transferring his whole imperial court to Trier and transforming it into his capital (with c.80,000 inhabitants), constructing the imposing [[Aula Palatina]] in 310.&lt;ref&gt;E. Horst, ''Costantino il grande'', Milano 1987, pp. 92-93 e 96.&lt;/ref&gt; During these years, not only did he reinforce the defences of this region against the continued incursions of the barbarians, but he also strengthened the forces under his control,&lt;ref&gt;E. Horst, ''Costantino il grande'', Milano 1987, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; augmenting his forces through the creation of new legions.

;307: At the beginning of spring, Constantine planned a new campaign in [[Germania|German territory]].  He found it necessary to confront the Franks, [[Chamavi]], [[Bructeri]], [[Cherusci]] and Alemanni. The young emperor had been educated in the military training ground of the east by Diocletian and Galerius and, despite his youth, conducted the war with the sort of determination and energy which his father had not been able to muster in the preceding years.&lt;ref&gt;E. Horst, ''Costantino il grande'', Milano 1987, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the military operations, he achieved important successes, managing to heavily wallop the Franks who had invaded the Roman territory east of the Rhine the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''Life of Constantine'', 1.25.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Panegyrici latini]]'', 7.6 [https://archive.org/stream/xiipanegyricila02baehgoog#page/n195/mode/1up QUI].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anselmo Baroni, ''Cronologia della storia romana dal 235 al 476'', p. 1026.&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that, while the Franks were planning to cross the Lower Rhine, Constantine quickly crossed the river in another location and surprised the enemy with an unexpected attack, which prevented a new invasion. Many of the Franks were killed, captured or enslaved - some of these were employed as [[gladiator]]s. All their livestock was  seized and their villages were burnt to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Panegyrici latini]]'', 7.12-13 [https://archive.org/stream/xiipanegyricila02baehgoog#page/n200/mode/1up QUI].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes149-155&quot;/&gt; As a result of these successes, Constantine was awarded the [[List of Roman imperial victory titles|cognomen]] Germanicus Maximus at the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes149-155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIL6,40776&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Le Bohec, ''Armi e guerrieri di Roma antica. Da Diocleziano alla caduta dell'impero'', Roma 2008. pp. 46 &amp; 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of this campaign and those following it, Constantine may have used the [[castra|legionary fortress]] of [[Castra Vetera]] as a base and the valley of the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe]] (as had been done in the time of [[Augustus]] and again fifty years later under [[Emperor Julian|Julian]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''History'', 17.1.11; 17.10.4; 20.10.2.&lt;/ref&gt;) as an invasion route by which to outflank the enemy, who were found to the north of this major river, and catch them from behind after devastating their territory.

;308: Further successes were achieved by Constantine against the [[Bructeri]] over the whole year, for which he received the title of Germanicus Maximus once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes149-155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIL6,40776&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Le Bohec, ''Armi e guerrieri di Roma antica. Da Diocleziano alla caduta dell'impero'', Roma 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the end of this new military campaign against the Franks, Constantine built the important &quot;bridgehead&quot; of [[Divitia]] (modern [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]]) in German territory opposite [[Colonia Agrippina]] ([[Cologne]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|13|8502}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Limes2-it.png|225px|left|thumb|The sector of the ''limes'' in the province of [[Germania II]] along the upper course of the [[Rhine]]]]

;310: Once more Constantine achieved important military successes over the Alemanni and the Franks, whose king he is said to have captured and fed to the beasts in the amphitheatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;EutropioX,3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baroni1027&quot;&gt;Anselmo Baroni, ''Cronologia della storia romana dal 235 al 476'', p. 1027.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of this campaign against the Franks, Constantine added a majestic bridge at Divitia, 420 metres long and 10 metres wide.&lt;ref&gt;E. Horst, ''Costantino il grande'', Milano 1987, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whittaker162&quot;/&gt;
Meanwhile, however, [[Maximian]] had rebelled and Constantine had to cut his campaign against the Franks short, marching rapidly to southern Gaul where he captured Maximian and forced him to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;EutropioX,3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Panegyrici latini]], 7.18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''[[De mortibus persecutorum]]'', 29.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', pp. 34â35; Elliott, p. 43; Lenski, pp. 65â66; Odahl, p. 93; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', p. 17; Potter, p. 352; E. Horst, ''Costantino il grande'', Milano 1987, pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

;311: With the death of [[Galerius]], the Tetrarchy became ever more unstable. Probably as a result of this, no campaigns against the Germans beyond the Rhine seem to have been undertaken this year. On the contrary, Constantine fortified the Rhine ''limes'' ever further with new construction (as at [[Haus BÃ¼rgel]] on the right bank of the river, 30&amp;nbsp;km north of Divitia, or along the roads leading from [[Colonia Agrippina]] (Cologne) to [[Augusta Treverorum]] (Trier)&lt;ref&gt;Hans SchÃ¶nberger, &quot;The roman frontier in Germany: an archaeological survey&quot;, in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 1969, p.180. The fortifications at [[Bitburg]], [[Neumagen]] and [[JÃ¼nkerath]], as well as the fort of [[Pachten]] (152x134 metres).&lt;/ref&gt;) and with the strengthening of preexisting fortifications. Since the auxiliary fortress of [[Noviomagus Batavorum]] ([[Nijmegen]]) had, apparently, been abandoned at the end of the third century, Constantine constructed two new forts in the area: at [[Valkhof]] (on the banks of the river [[Waal (river)|Waal]]) and another along the coast at [[Valkenburg, South Holland|Valkenburg]] (near Hook).&lt;ref name=&quot;Whittaker162&quot;&gt;C.R.Whittaker, ''Frontiers of the Roman empire.

;312: Constantine gathered a massive army, including barbarians from the recent wars (Germanic peoples and [[Celt]]s brought over from Britannia), and led it into Italy, defeating his rival Maxentius at [[Battle of Turin (312)|Turin]], [[Battle of Verona (312)|Verona]], and finally at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge|Milvian Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EutropioX,4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''[[De mortibus persecutorum]]'', 44; [[Zosimus]], ''New History'', 2.16; [[Aurelius Victor]], ''Epitome de Caesaribus'', 40.23; [[Panegyrici latini]], 9.16 ss.

;314-315: Once again, Constantine made Augusta Treverorum (Trier) his general quarters for these two years, in order to stay more in control of the Rhine frontier, once again putting things in order against possible incursions of Franks and Alemanni and continuing his fortification works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horst186&quot;/&gt; In July of 315 he left the frontier in order to travel to Rome and celebrate his triumph for the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;VicTriCostantino&quot;&gt;{{CIL|11|5265}}; {{AE|1903|264}}; {{CIL|3|204}} (p 973); {{CIL|6|1135}} (p 4327); {{CIL|6|1142}} (p 3071, 4329); {{CIL|6|1144}} (p 3071, 3778, 4329); {{CIL|6|1146}} (p 3071, 4329); {{CIL|8|7006}} (p 1847); {{CIL|8|7007}} (p 1847); {{CIL|8|12064}}; {{CIL|11|5265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;317-319: Following the events described above, Constantine fought against the [[Sarmatians]] on the [[Pannonia]]n stretch of the ''limes'', earning the victory title of ''Sarmaticus Maximus'' for the first time, as seems to be demonstrated by an inscription found in [[Mauretania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIL8,8412&quot;&gt;Inscription datable to 319 on which we find several [[Cognomina ex virtute|victory titles]]: {{Quote|''Imperatori Caesari Flavio Constantino Maximo Pio Felici Invicto [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusto]] [[pontifex maximus|pontifici maximo]], Germanico maximo III, Sarmatico maximo Britannico maximo, Arabico maximo, Medico maximo, Armenico maximo, Gothico maximo, [[Tribunician power|tribunicia potestate]] XIIII, [[imperator]]i XIII, [[Roman consul|consuli]] IIII [[pater patriae|patri patriae]], proconsuli, Flavius Terentianus vir perfectissimus praeses provinciae [[Mauretania (provincia romana)|Mauretaniae Sitifensis]] numini maiestatique eius semper dicatissimus''.|CIL VIII, 8412 (p 1916)}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating to MÃ³csy that he remained as [[Sirmium]] almost continuously until 324 (when his armies moved against Licinius), employing it as his capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;MÃ³csy277&quot;&gt;A.MÃ³csy, ''Pannonia and Upper Moesia'', p.277.&lt;/ref&gt; Horst too maintains that his preferred imperial residences in the period between 317 and 323 were [[Serdica]] and Sirmium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horst214-276&quot;&gt;E.Horst, ''Costantino il Grande'', Milano 1987, pp. 214 e 276.&lt;/ref&gt;
: During this year, Constantine again showed an active interest in military activities, since he often travelled along the whole ''limes'' of the territories he had acquired with the peace of Serdica (March 317). He inspected the garrisons of [[Pannonia Inferior]], overseeing their repair and the construction of new bridgeheads towards the plain of the [[Tisza]] River, to face the peril of the barbarians beyond Rome's borders ([[Iazygi]] and [[Goths]]). He strengthened the river fleets of the [[Danube]], [[Sava]], [[Drina]], and [[Morava (river)|Morava]], as well as the maritime fleets of the [[Adriatic]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] Seas, reinforcing the ports of [[Aquileia]], [[Pireus]], and [[Thessalonica]] (formerly Galerius' capital) through the construction of arsenals, shipyards, and the construction of further naval squads.&lt;ref&gt;E.Horst, ''Costantino il Grande'', Milano 1987, pp. 215-219.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clearly these reconstruction and strengthening works could by employed not only against the barbarians, but also, one day, against Licinius.

;320: Constantine's eldest son, [[Crispus]] (now fifteen, and therefore aided by a Prefect), received the military command of Gaul and conducted military campaigns along the Rhine, achieving victories over the Franks and Alemanni within the year.&lt;ref&gt;E.Horst, ''Costantino il Grande'', Milano 1987, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The barbarians had requested peace&lt;ref name=&quot;Valesiani5.21&quot;/&gt; and Constantine had nevertheless led an army into parts of the Empire which were not under his compitency (i.e. Moesia), but that of the other Augustus, Licinius - thereby initiating a new civil war between Constantine and Licinius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baroni1028&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.Horst, ''Costantino il Grande'', Milano 1987, pp. 242-244.&lt;/ref&gt; Coinage continued to celebrate the ''Sarmatia devicta''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes149-155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SarmatiaDevicta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Imperial Coinage]], ''Constantinus I'', VII, 48, 257 e 257v (Arles).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third phase (324-337): the defence of the ''limes gothicus'' and the &quot;reconquest&quot; of Dacia ===
{{see also|Brazda lui Novac}}

In this new phase, Constantine, now sole monarch of the Roman empire, not only managed to coloidate the entire defensive system along the Rhine and Danube, but also obtained important military successes and regained &quot;control&quot; over a good part of the territories which had been abandoned by [[Gallienus]] and [[Aurelian]]. This included the [[Agri decumates]] from the Alemanni, the plain south of the [[Tisza]] ([[Banat]]) from the Sarmatians and [[Oltenia]] &amp; [[Wallachia]] from the Goths. These gains seem to be demonstrated by the coinage of the period and by new defensive constructions ([[Devil's Dykes]] and [[Brazda lui Novac]]).&lt;ref&gt;V.A.

;334:&lt;ref name=&quot;ArdevanZerbini211&quot;&gt;R.Ardevan &amp; L.Zerbini, ''La Dacia romana'', p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the same Sarmatians who had requested the &quot;friendly&quot; intervention of the Romans, created new problems for the Emperor, when they were riven by internal conflict between the Limigantes and the Argaragantes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MÃ³csy279&quot;/&gt; It is said that the slaves ([[Limigantes]]) drove their masters ([[Argaragantes]]) from Banat, forcing Constantine to intervene militarily&lt;ref name=&quot;ArdevanZerbini211&quot;/&gt; in order to settle an enormous mass of &quot;refugees&quot; (allegedly 300,000 people) in [[Scythia Minor]], [[Italia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], Thrace,&lt;ref name=&quot;LeBohecII,52&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baroni1029&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annales Valesiani, VI, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moesia Superior]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MÃ³csy279&quot;/&gt; and [[Pannonia Secunda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MÃ³csy279&quot;/&gt; Some maintain instead that Constantine launched a new military campaign into the plain south of the Tisza to restore order among the warring factions,&lt;ref name=&quot;Whittaker176-178&quot;/&gt; at the end of which Constantine received the victory title of Sarmaticus Maximus for the third time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes149-155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIL2,481&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.Le Bohec, ''Armi e guerrieri di Roma antica. Da Diocleziano alla caduta dell'impero'', Roma, 2008, p.53; C.Scarre, ''Chronicle of the roman emperors'', New York, 1999, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, after all, archaeological hints that Constantine had occupied part of the Banat mountains,&lt;ref name=&quot;ArdevanZerbini211&quot;/&gt; along the &quot;old&quot; Roman roads which led from [[OrÈova|Dierna]] and Lederata to [[CaransebeÈ|Tibiscum]] seventeen years earlier.

;circa 335 circa: [[Jordanes]] recounts an episode datable to this period, in which the [[Vandals]] of [[Visimar]], who inhabited the region between the [[MureÈ River|Marisus]] and Danube rivers (perhaps a little northwest of Banat), clashed with the Goths of [[Geberic]] and were defeated. The survivors asked Constantine to be allowed into Roman territory, got permission and settled in Pannonia Inferior, where they remained in peace for around forty years, &quot;obeying the laws of the Empire like the other inhabitants of the region.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jordanes]], ''[[De origine actibusque Getarum]]'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

;336: Emperor Constantine achieved new successes beyond the Danube in the territories which had once been the Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] (abbandoned by Aurelian), receiving the honorific title &quot;Dacicus Maximus&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes149-155&quot;&gt;T.D. Barnes, &quot;Victories of Constantine&quot;, in ''Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Papyrologie und Epigraphik'', 20 pp. 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIL6,40776&quot;&gt;{{CIL|6|40776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LeBohecII,52&quot;/&gt; It cannot be coincidental that an inscription found near the former legionary fortress of [[Apulum (castra)|Apulum]] (modern [[Alba Iulia]]) mentions a woman named Ulpia Constantia (reflecting connections to [[Trajan]] and Constantine).&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|3|1203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This could give serious support to Emperor Julian's claim that Constantine reconquered all the territories controlled by Trajan - which included Dacia.&lt;ref name=&quot;JulDeCaes329c&quot;/&gt;

The equilibrium along the lower course of the Danube, after all the campaigns of Constantine and his sons, remained almost unchanged until around 375. The focus of the Emperor turned to the east, where a series of preparations were made for an imminent military campaign against the [[Sassanids]], which was never carried out by Constantine on account of his death in May 337. For twenty five years, the Roman armies of [[Constantius II]] and then Julian, fought against the Sassanid armies with varying success (337-363). However the Lower Danube and Eastern borders remained, for almost thirty years, practically unchanged.
