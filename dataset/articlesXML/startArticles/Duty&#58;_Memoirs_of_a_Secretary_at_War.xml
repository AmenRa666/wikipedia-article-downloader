'''''Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War''''' is a nonfiction book written by [[Robert M. Gates]], a former [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]]. It was published in January 2014 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. The time period is from 2006 to 2011, and includes the [[George W. Bush administration]] (2006–2009), the [[Obama administration]] (2009–2011), the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan war]], and the [[Iraq war]].

Narrated in [[first person point of view]], this record of events characterizes Secretary Gates' personal interactions with the [[U.S. Congress]], [[the Pentagon]]'s management structure, some military bureaucrats and the White House staff under President Obama. This memoir is also the first to recount the Obama administration’s policy discussions and debates during [[Presidential cabinet]] meetings.&lt;ref name=Shanker&gt;

==Gates's commentary==
As expressed in the book, disagreements with Obama’s [[White House staff]] and the other aforementioned organizations elicit strong emotions and criticisms from Gates. For example, President Obama's White House staff is seen as an imperious entity, who, as a group, are seen as &quot;micromanagers&quot; that engaged in &quot;operational meddling&quot;. Additionally, Vice President [[Joe Biden]]'s performance is criticized. Yet, at the same time, Biden is personally held in high regard. Former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]'s is held in high regard professionally and personally. She in fact was usually in agreement with Gates on policy issues.

President Obama is judged favorably at first, and not so favorably by 2011. However, towards the end of the book, Mr. Gates states that Mr. Obama's decision to send a [[United States Navy SEALs]] team after [[Osama Bin Laden]] in [[Pakistan]] was &quot;one of the most courageous decisions I had ever witnessed in the White House&quot;. He also states that Obama's policy decisions pertaining to the &quot;overall Afghan strategy&quot; were correct. He also criticizes the [[George W. Bush administration]]'s  Afghan war, Iraq war, and [[Guantanamo Bay]] policies.&lt;ref name=Shanker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chayes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cloud/&gt;

==Gates's background==
Gates came to the Obama Administration as a &quot;respected professional and veteran of decades at the center of American foreign policy&quot;. As a Republican, he also represented President Obama's policy of bipartisanism. Over time, however, his relationship with Obama and his staff devolved. Protracted policy disagreements with Vice President [[Joe Biden]], [[Tom Donilon]] ([[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]), and U.S. Army Lieutenant General [[Douglas E. Lute]] (Afghan policy) are additionally recounted.&lt;ref name=Shanker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chayes/&gt;
