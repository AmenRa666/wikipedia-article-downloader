==Lonely being a hero?==

Acknowledging that alcoholism can be, often is, a progressive disease.  Acknowledging that the baseline for entrepreneurship is not real good, that most new businesses fail, even when it's a business you're very familiar with and even when it's adequately capitalized.

So the question is, Why did Oskar have such a rough go of it after the war?  Fully acknowledging the above two aspects, and more, I still think a big part of it is that it can be very lonely being a hero.  People so much need to see their image of you that they often do not see the real you, and they often do not seem to have the emotional energy for getting to know the real you.  You can't just depend on previous friends.  Part of a normal course of life is also making new friends.  And being a hero can make that difficult. 

== Birthdate ==

The introduction says he was born on the 18th of April. However, section 1 says he was born on the 28th of April. Which is correct?
secton 21

== Irrelevant and ungrammatical sentence ==

&quot;He was born into a wealthy business family, for all of Schindler’s child hood he was spoiled, his parents bought him 
anything he wanted and made sure that he lived a full life.&quot;
I'm deleting this sentence. It should be footnoted or something; plus it is just poorly written, so it's gone.

== Ethnic German? ==

&quot;Ethnic&quot;?  When did academia decide to start this nonsense?  He was German.  Period.  I'd delete it but one of the lurking Aspies would just put it back.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.102.111.186|71.102.111.186]] ([[User talk:71.102.111.186|talk]]) 03:41, 16 January 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
: The term &quot;Ethnic German&quot; is the usual English translation of the German term [[Volksdeutsche]]. --[[User:Honzula|Honzula]] ([[User talk:Honzula|talk]]) 06:35, 12 May 2016 (UTC)

::No. Volksdeutsche means the member of &quot;German nation&quot;, regardless of the state where the person is living or the citizenship which possesses. From historical reasons, in Germany and other countries of Central-East Europe the affiliation to the &quot;nation&quot; is not related to the citizenship but rather to the language and &quot;blood&quot; (let say the &quot;origin&quot; or the race ). Therefore describing somebody as Volksdeutsche makes him part of great German nation no matter where this person is living. In this case, Schindler was born in Austrian, later was citizen of Czechoslovakia, but nobody describes him as Austrian, Czechoslovak or Czech, because he acted as the member of German nation, even before he became citizen of Nazi Germany in late 1938. --[[User:Honzula|Honzula]] ([[User talk:Honzula|talk]]) 14:29, 6 August 2016 (UTC)</text>
