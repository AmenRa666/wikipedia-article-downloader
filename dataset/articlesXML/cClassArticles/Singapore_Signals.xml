The [[Signals (military)|Signal]] Formation of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) is a combat support arm tasked with providing [[military communications|communication]] on multiple platforms and local networking within the battlefield, as well as with supporting the SAF's third generation transformation efforts by developing the capacity for [[network-centric warfare]] in the form of IKC2 (Integrated Knowledge-based Command and Control) and C4 (Command, Control, Communications and Computers) operations.

== History ==
The Singapore Armed Forces Signal Formation can trace its beginnings to 1954, when the Singapore Corps of Signals (Volunteer), established as a volunteer organisation within the framework of the [[Singapore Volunteer Corps]], was reformed into the Independent Brigade Signal Squadron of the Singapore Military Force (SMF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Signals - History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/ourforces/Signals/History.html | publisher = [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)]] | title = The Singapore Army - Signals - History}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Singapore [[Singapore in Malaysia|merged]] with the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1963, the squadron was absorbed into the [[Malaysian Armed Forces]] as the 4th Federal Infantry Brigade Signal Squadron, based at Fort Canning. During the reorganisation of the [[Rejimen Semboyan Diraja|Malaysian Signals]] in 1965, the squadron was renamed the 4th Malaysian Signal Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Royal Corps of Signals: Unit History (1920-2001) and their Antecedents |author= Cliff Lord and Graham Watson |publisher= Helion &amp; Company Ltd |location= Solihull, West Midlands |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-1-874622-07-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial period following the separation of Singapore from Malaysian in August 1965, the 4th Malaysian Infantry Brigade continued to operate in Singapore, and the Singapore elements within the squadron (2 officers and 54 men) continued to serve in the brigade until mustered out on 28 February 1966. With separation, there was an urgent need to build up an indigenous signal corps to support the rapid growth of the armed forces of the independent Republic of Singapore, and on 1 March 1966, 1 SAF Signals Corps was formed at Beach Road Camp from the Singaporean signal contingent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Signalling Success&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.totaldefence.sg/imindef/about_us/history/birth_of_saf/v12n04_history.html | publisher = [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)]] | title = Signalling Success}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Signal Formation was presented with the State Colours and Regimental Colours on 22 January 1977 by [[Benjamin Henry Sheares|President Benjamin Sheares]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Signalling Success&quot; /&gt;

==Structure==

The Signal formation consists of Headquarters Signals and Command Systems, the Signal Institute, and a number of battalions, both active and reserve. Each brigade of the army has a signal company which forms part of the brigade's headquarters. The army's three combined arms divisions (3rd, 6th and 9th) are each served by a respective signal battalion.

===Headquarters Signals and Command Systems (HQ SIG)===
In June 1966, the Communications and Electronics (C&amp;E) Department was set up within the same year of the formation of 1 SAF Signal Corps as part of the General Staff Division of the [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of the Interior and Defence]] (MID), located at Pearl's Hill. The C&amp;E Department was later upgraded to a specialist staff HQ and renamed HQ C&amp;E in August 1970 to cope with the increasing demand for the provision of essential communications in the SAF.  HQ C&amp;E would later be redesignated as HQ Signals on 1 March 1982 and HQ Signals and Command Systems in 2006.

In 1988, HQ Signals moved to its present location at Stagmont Camp.

===Signal Institute (SI)===
The immediate need for institutional signal training for the newly formed Singapore Armed Forces was met with the establishment of the [[SAFTI Military Institute|SAFTI]] Signal Wing on 22 July 1967 at Pasir Laba Camp. As the demand for signal officers and NCOs continued to grow, the Signal Wing was officially recognised as an independent unit in 1968 and renamed the School of Signals. In 1983, the School of Signals and the Reserve Signal Training Centre were relocated to Stagmont camp.

On 31 March 2003, the Signal Institute was formed from an amalgamation of the School of Signals, Signal Training Centre (STC) and the training branch of HQ Signals to enable an integrated approach towards doctrine, training and evaluation.

===1 Signal Battalion (1SIG)===
Shortly after its formation in 1966, personnel from 1 SAF Signal Corps were reconstituted as the MID Signal Battalion (renamed 1 Signal Battalion in 1982) on 6 February 1967, with Captain Winston Choo (later the Singapore Armed Forces' first Chief of Defence Force) as Commanding Officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Signals - History&quot; /&gt; Its task was to provide communications to the Ministry Of Interior and Defence. Following the establishment of [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|MINDEF]], the battalion was renamed the MINDEF Signal Battalion and later 1 Signal Battalion in October 1982. Its motto is ''From Each His Best''.

===10 C4I Battalion (10C4I)===
The Static Radio Relay Unit (SRRU) was formed on 6 April 1970 to provide point-to-point microwave communication and to connect all major SAF camps and installations into a single network. Initially located on Pearl's Hill, the unit shifted to Camp Asker Bujang in 1971 before finally moving to its present location at Stagmont camp in 1976. On 1 October 1984, it was renamed 2 Signal Battalion and subsequently merged with 8 Signal Battalion in 2010 as 10 C4I Battalion (10C4I).

===17 C4I Battalion (17C4I)===
3 Signal Battalion, originally known as Area III Signal Battalion, was formed on 1 September 1972, with 3 officers and 19 other ranks to provide communications for the Area III Command (now the 3rd Singapore Division). From 1 September 1973, the unit was based in Jurong Camp I, with an increased strength in manpower and equipment, the men were housed at Jurong flats (Jalan Bahar). Subsequently on 16 April 1974, the unit was shifted to Slim Barracks at Portsdown Road for less than a year before returning to Jalan Bahar. It eventually shifted to its present location at Jurong Camp I on 26 December 1976. Today, it is responsible for 3rd Division's C4I assets and renamed as 17 C4I Battalion (17C4I). Its motto is ''On Through Strive''.

===6 Signal Battalion (6SIG)===
6 Signal Battalion was inaugurated on 1 February 1977 as a reserve Signal Support Battalion to the 6th Singapore Division. In 1985, the battalion was placed under the Reserve Signals Training Centre before returning to the command of the 6th Division on its conversion to a combined arms division in 1991. It currently resides at Mandai Hill camp with HQ 6DIV, and provides the communication support requirements of the entire division.  Its motto is ''Swift and Effective''.

===9 Signal Battalion (9SIG)===
9 Signal Battalion was formed on 9 October 1978 at Slim Barracks to undertake the responsibility of the proficiency training of the 9th Singapore Division's signal reservists. This responsibility was later transferred to the Reserve Signal Training Centre. In 1987, the battalion shifted from Slim Barracks to Selarang Barracks to co-locate with 9th Division headquarters.
