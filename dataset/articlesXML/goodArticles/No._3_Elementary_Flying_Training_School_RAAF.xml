'''No.&amp;nbsp;3 Elementary Flying Training School''' (No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS) was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) pilot training unit that operated during World War&amp;nbsp;II. It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS was established in January 1940 at [[Essendon Airport|Essendon]], Victoria, and initially included a significant proportion of civilian staff and private aircraft; by mid-year these had been largely integrated into the military. The school was disbanded in May 1942, its aircraft and instructional staff having been transferred to [[No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Elementary Flying School]] at [[Benalla Airport|Benalla]].

==History==
Flying instruction in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS).&lt;ref name=Stephens67&gt;Stephens (2006), pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying), which were used to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including 65 hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.&lt;ref name=Stephens67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), pp. 106–109]&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;3 Elementary Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS) was formed at [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], Victoria, on 2&amp;nbsp;January 1940, and came under the control of [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area Command]].&lt;ref name=Units&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Its inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader [[Elwyn Roy King|Roy King]], a [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] credited with 26 victories in the [[Australian Flying Corps]] during World War&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson (1999), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; [[Essendon Airport|Essendon aerodrome]] had been established in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4659260 |title=Civilian aviation |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=8 September 1921 |accessdate=20 January 2014 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was home to several private aviation clubs and schools including the [[Royal Victorian Aero Club]], [[Ansett Australia|ANA Flying School]], and Victoria &amp; Interstate Airways Ltd. It was the airfield's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in Victoria that led to it becoming the base for the third flying school the RAAF raised during World War&amp;nbsp;II. The same principle was followed in establishing [[No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 EFTS]] at [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]], South Australia, [[No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 EFTS]] at [[RAAF Station Archerfield|Archerfield]], Queensland, and [[No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 EFTS]] at [[RAAF Station Mascot|Mascot]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=Gillison72&gt;[http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.PDF Gillison (1962), p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first training courses at No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS were not conducted by RAAF instructors under the auspices of EATS but by Essendon's civil organisations under government contract.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison72/&gt; The training aircraft were privately owned [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Tiger Moth]]s and [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|Gipsy Moth]]s.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by Squadron Leader King.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison72/&gt; The initial intake of sixteen students arrived on 8&amp;nbsp;January 1940, and received eight weeks of instruction that finished on 4&amp;nbsp;March; all but one of the trainees had prior flying experience, and the course was accident-free. The next student intake at No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS arrived on 5&amp;nbsp;February 1940. The school's inaugural EATS course commenced in May.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Overall student numbers at this time were reported as being 48, while staff totalled 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12455745 |title=Air scheme at Essendon |newspaper=The Argus |location=Melbourne |date=4 May 1940 |accessdate=20 January 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second EATS course began in July.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; By this time, Essendon's civilian presence had effectively been absorbed by the military organisation; privately owned aircraft were taken over by the RAAF, which had also begun employing its own aircraft, the first being a Gipsy Moth that arrived in March.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25815082 |title=Empire air scheme |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart |date=23 July 1940 |accessdate=20 January 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training accidents were frequent, particularly during landings, but did not result in any fatalities.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

[[Clyde Fenton]], known for his exploits as a [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|flying doctor]] in the [[Northern Territory]] before being commissioned as a pilot in the RAAF, served as an instructor at No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS from mid-1940 to early 1942.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=5253548|work=Fenton, C.C.|title=Postings and attachments |date=1939–48|accessdate=20 January 2014|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was posted to command No.&amp;nbsp;5 EFTS at [[RAAF Station Narromine|Narromine]], New South Wales, in December 1940.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; By this time No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS was reported as having graduated 200 pilots in the eight flying training courses it had run since its formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11298335 |title=New RAAF schools |newspaper=The Argus |location=Melbourne |date=11 December 1940 |accessdate=22 January 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its graduates was [[Nicky Barr]], who become a fighter ace in the [[North African Campaign]] with twelve victories to his credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077820.asp |title=Wing Commander Andrew William Barr|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson (1999), pp. 113–115&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS began operating a ground-based [[Link Trainer]] on 17&amp;nbsp;February 1941. The school started flying the recently introduced [[CAC Wackett|CAC Wackett Trainer]] in August 1941, but the type proved troublesome, delaying the training program.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; From September to November 1941, a detachment of personnel from [[No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 EFTS]] also utilised training facilities at Essendon, after their home aerodrome at [[Benalla Airport|Benalla]] had been inundated by heavy rain.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS's instructors, students and Wackett Trainers were transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;11 EFTS during April 1942, and the Essendon school was disbanded on 1&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;
