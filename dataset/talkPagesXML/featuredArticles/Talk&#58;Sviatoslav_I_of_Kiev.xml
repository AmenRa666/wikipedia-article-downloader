==older entries==
Should the name be Sviatoslav or Svyatoslav? Whichever one, it needs to be consistent throughout the article.  Right now they're both used: Sviatoslav in the title and very beginning and Svyatoslav throughout most of the text.
[[User:Billy Shears|Billy Shears]] 19:51, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
:Never mind. Or chose the one you like and unify the spelling. It doesn't make so much difference, really. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirlandajo]] 20:03, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
::What about Světoslav(ŭ?), Svaetoslav(ŭ?), Svætoslav(ŭ?)? Considering his name seems to have actually been Свѣтославъ? As the article says: ''Some scholars speculate that the name of Sviatoslav, composed of the Slavic roots for &quot;holy&quot; and &quot;glory&quot;, was an artificial derivation combining those of his predecessors Oleg and Rurik (they mean &quot;holy&quot; and &quot;glorious&quot; in Old Norse, respectively.[2]'' [[User:Krum Stanoev|Krum Stanoev]] 19:26, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

== Map ==

The map of Sviatoslav's state is a fiction. A self made map of unknown validity. The lands of derevlians on the nothern west from Kiev that were conquered by his mother Olga are not included into red space. They are presented even as the lands on the southern west?!?. On the contrary, the eastern and nothern boders of Rus (red and orange) are unreasonably enlareged (land of Polotsk was taken after his death by Volodymer, the land of Novgorod wasn't so big at that time). The boders signed by orange are nonsense, because nobody can prove that Sviatoslav had left his administartion there. Hazaria and Bulgaria were only plundered by the prince's armies but not conquered. Hazars were unable to stand after his blow but Bulgaria still to exist unntil the middle of 13 c.

Therefore Sviatoslav expeditions should be shown on the map as arrows (directions of his campains) rather than as encircling of paticular areas. It should be deleted as POV or remade. The sourses listed in the image are either unreliable or the author who created the map used wrong data. --[[User:Alex Kov|Alex Kov]] 17:36, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

[[Image:Sviatoslav1.png|thumb|tight|200px|The Kievan Rus at the beginning of Sviatoslav's reign (in red), showing his conquests to 972 (in orange).]]
:OK, since you removed the map from the article again, I will place it here at talk for now, awaiting the response from the author. In the meanwhile, please '''make sure all your edits are done while you are logged in'''. You latest deletion again came from an IP. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 04:41, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

&quot;conquests&quot; do not mean occupation. Sviatoslav's armies moved through the general areas depicted. Historical maps are never intended to draw clear-cut and fully accurate boundaries because such boundaries are impossible to determine even at that time, let alone today. This user appears to object to user-made images for the sake of objecting to them. By the standards he would impose every historical map on Wikipedia should be removed. [[User:Briangotts|Briangotts]] [[User talk:Briangotts|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Briangotts|(Contrib)]] 02:28, 14 October 2006 (UTC)


Selfmade maps should not be removed. I just dont like this paticular map, which is full of factual mistakes . The territory of Rus (red)in the north is unreasonably enlarged, while the southern lands are depicted as a smal area along the Dniper river. The derevlians are not the tribe from steps on the south but woods on the west. Read Tolochko or Rybakov, or any other valuable historiography on the subject to learn the realms of Rus during the reign of Sviatoslav. You'll see that your map is wrong and it should be remade. If you want to show the wars of Sviatoslav on the east do it by arrows (es. in case of Khazaria and Bulgaria). Thats a ussual way of depicting war campaigns of those who invaded but not conquered (occupied) the lands of foes. For example, look at the maps of crusades. The crusaders took several castles and towns in Asia Minor on their way to the Holy Land, but in the cartography these castles and towns are not included (encircled) into the borders of the crusarers' kingdoms.
Please remade your map in accordance to historical facts and rules of cartography. --[[User:Alex Kov|Alex Kov]] 05:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

==Silistria==
I belive that the old name Durostor is more appropiate for accuracy, Silistra is the modern name.[[User:CristianChirita|CristianChirita]] 06:52, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

I think the [[Byzantine Greek]] name was Dorystolon. [[User:Briangotts|Briangotts]] [[User talk:Briangotts|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Briangotts|(Contrib)]] 21:41, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

== Gibbon ==

How do we get the Gibbon text moved to Wikisource where it belongs? [[User:Briangotts|Briangotts]] [[User talk:Briangotts|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Briangotts|(Contrib)]] 02:29, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

==GA review==
First, let me say this is one of the best, most entertaining articles I've read for a GA review. Extremely interesting! The lead is somewhat weaker than the rest, and the Russian phrases could possibly also use a a Latin alphabet transliteration. &quot;Kievan Rus'&quot;  is written both with and without the '.  Some references have odd little underscores, such as &quot;Primary Chronicle _____.&quot; - what do they mean?

Still, none of these seem enough to withold GA. However, this article seems near-FA, so fixing them would probably get it the rest of the way.

:'''[[Wikipedia:Good article nominations|GA]] review''' (see [[Wikipedia:What is a good article?|here]] for criteria)

2a has the weird underscores, so is only a mostly-pass. 6b is a get-out clause if there's no images, so it's not applicable.

Still, it's a pretty clear pass. Great work! [[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:21, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

:The underscored references indicate that the writer of the reference (in this case, me) didn't have access to the actual document in question and couldn't cite to a specific section or page number at the time of writing. The facts referenced do come from the works cited and I am working on fixing them.

== Beit Or's edits ==

I'm a busy editor and have multiple tasks on my hands. I don't have time to analyze irresponsible edits by any stray wikipedian, but I decided to make an exception for Beit Or:

:1. &quot;[[Cyrillic]]: Святослав&quot; changed to &quot;[[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Святослав''&quot; - he was as Russian as he was Ukrainian; his name in all three East Slavic languages spells identically; Cyrillic writing is not italicized per [[WP:RUS]].
:2. &quot;Despite this&quot; before the reference changed to &quot;however&quot;. I'll let Briangotts to judge on the wisdom of changing his wording. Nevertheless, a footnote after the first word in the sentence (&quot;however&quot;) looks lame.
:3. &quot;His &quot;legitimate&quot; (the notion of legitimacy in pagan times was blurred) children included&quot; changed to &quot;by his wives&quot;. Surely, he had children not by husbands? What is disputed in this passage?
:4. Added: &quot;The conflict between Khazaria and Rus began in the early 9th century when the Khazars closed the Volga trade route for the Rus merchants in response to their pillage of [[Muslim]] lands.&quot; This extraordinary assertion needs to be well sourced, with links to primary sources that record &quot;the closing of the Volga trade route for the Rus merchants in response (sic!) to their pillage of [[Muslim]] lands&quot;. [[Original research]] and fringe theories will not be tolerated.
:5. With a remarkable lack of consistency, after adding the above highly speculative passage, Beit Or requested citations for the famous passage from the Primary Chronicle about &quot;Иду на вы!&quot; The chronicle is the foremost source of data about Svyatoslav; it is mentioned in every passage of the article; is it not enough?
:6. &quot;He then turned his attention to the Khazars, who had been until recently the dominant force in the Pontic steppe.&quot; - sentence deleted for reasons unknown.
:7. &quot;Logan, Donald F. (1192). ''The Vikings in History'' 2nd ed. Routledge. ISBN 0-4150-8396-6&quot; added to references, without specification what claim in the article it is to reference.

Unless detailed explanation of every unsubstantiated edit is forthcoming, they will be reverted. --&lt;font color=&quot;FC4339&quot;&gt;[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirla]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;C98726&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Ghirlandajo|-трёп-]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:A point-by-point response:
::1. Svyatoslav was not of Slavic origin; the general rule on Wikipedia is to give the spelling in the original language rather than in an alternative alphabet. Casual observation suggests that the Old East Slavic language is not used in Wikipedia articles on Rus with preference being given to Russian. Even if Svyatoslav is spelled identically in Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian, this name is an exception rather than a rule. For the sake of consistency, it is a good idea to conctinue to stick to Russian.
:::I wish you would have explained it to scores of anonymous editors from Ukraine and Belarus who will instantly add identical transilterations in their native tongues. --&lt;font color=&quot;FC4339&quot;&gt;[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirla]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;C98726&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Ghirlandajo|-трёп-]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:17, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
::2. &quot;Despite this&quot; is unidiomatic in English; &quot;however&quot; or &quot;nevertheless&quot; are preferred.
::3. &quot;By his wives&quot; makes sense because Malusha was not his wife.
:::This claim needs to be sourced. Could you explain who was considered &quot;wife&quot; and who was &quot;concubine&quot; in pagan Russia? --&lt;font color=&quot;FC4339&quot;&gt;[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirla]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;C98726&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Ghirlandajo|-трёп-]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:17, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
::4. This is from the article &quot;Khazars&quot; in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. I'll add the full reference shortly.
:::&quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; is not a primary sources.

''Pace'', gentlemen. Let me see if I can help move things forward.
No. 4: This is actually closer to the account given in [[D.M. Dunlop]]'s work- that the Khazars first permitted the Rus to go down the Volga, then tried to stop them (killing many in 911 or 913). I don't think, however, that any contemporary source definitively linked Sviatoslav's campaign with these earlier events. But if it's in the EOI we could say something like &quot;Such and such scholars promoted the view that Sviatoslav's war against Khazaria was provoked by the Khazar policy of ....&quot; and then cite to the appropriate article's authors.
With regard to #5, I requested a citation for the quote &quot;I am coming for you&quot; (or whatever it was) not because I wanted it removed but because I wanted to know what the source was. If indeed it was from the Primary Chronicle, it should DEFINITELY stay, but it wasn't identified as such and because it was added by an anon, I was a little suspicious. If Ghirla says it comes from the Primary Chronicle, I see no reason why not to add it back in (with the note that the Chronicle reports it).
Re: primary sources/secondary sources... I've seen some discussion about this but never reviewed the actual policy (nor do I know where it's located). I tend to be in favor of quoting primary sources where possible and relying on secondary to interpret. I've seen some users object to this entirely... Usually these are people who want to whitewash elements of [[Muhammad]]'s life by saying you can't quote to this or that primary source reporting some terrible thing he did because you're not &quot;trained in interpretation&quot; or something like that.
With regard to No. 3, I don't know what Malusha's relationship with Sviatoslav was. The [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] article says she was a concubine and Vladimir was illegitimate. How do we know whether she was a wife or concubine? Does the Pr. Ch. say, or some other document (even if they do we should regard that with caution because these are Christian docs and not pagan). In medieval [[Wallachia]], a son was legitimate if he came from &quot;his father's bone.&quot; Was it the same in Russia? If we don't know, maybe (at least for now) the best thing would be to say &quot;wives and concubines&quot;.
No. 6 - I think the modifications to the Khazar campaign section are generally good and help with clarity.
No. 7 the reference to the visitor appears ot have been added so it looks like all is well.
Let's try to keep it civil- through all of our efforts, I think the article is much better now than it was a week ago, and if we can continue to collaborate peacefully I think it will be an FA before long.

== Primary sources ==

The guidance on the usage of primary vs. secondary sources is provided by [[WP:RS]]: &quot;Wikipedia articles may use primary sources only if they have been published by a reliable publisher e.g. trial transcripts published by a court stenographer, and may use them only to make purely descriptive claims... '''In general, Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable secondary sources.'''&quot; [[User:Beit Or|Beit]] [[User talk:Beit Or|Or]] 21:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:Your interpretation of the policy is faulty. The second phrase relates to secondary sources only, that is, to reliable secondary sources as opposed to not-reliable secondary sources. [[WP:RS]] does not state that secondary sources should be preferred to primary sources, because it is too silly. Your implication that the [[Primary Chronicle]] has not been &quot;published by a reliable publisher&quot;, needs good sourcing. As best I know, the science of textology was born from the analysis of the Primary Chronicle. According to [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]], it is the most analyzed text in history, after the [[Bible]]. Overall, I'm disappointed with the level of your replies and intend to adopt a more stern attitude towards your edits. --&lt;font color=&quot;FC4339&quot;&gt;[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirla]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;C98726&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Ghirlandajo|-трёп-]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

::Your response is less a couterargument than a personal attack, one out of many directed against me. The policy is very clear: Wikipedia articles must rely on secondary sources. Instead, you want this article to rely on your preferred primary source, while conclusions of modern scholars must be relegated to footnotes, because the former is &quot;hard eveidence&quot; and thus reliable, while the latter are &quot;speculations&quot; and thus unreliable. In fact, the opposite is the case: medieval chronicles, especially the Primary Chronicle, are fraught with errors and spin, while modern scholars study history on a multidisciplinary basis, by combining all the available documentary evidence with data provided by archeology, geology, climatology etc. So, yes, secondary sources must be preferred to primary sources, and your understanding of the policy is flawed and completely unacceptable.

guys, the &quot;prefer scholarly secondary sources&quot; policy intends to avoid amateurish interpretation of primary sources, which are often less than clear. Of course the PC is crucially important, but we cannot discuss and interpret it in home-grown wikitranslations, we need to base our discussion of primary sources on scholarly discussions of these primary sources. Khazarian correspondence and the PC are ''both'' primary sources, and you should just present both for what they are worth. Conclusions such as the 940s connection are not to be treated as &quot;self-evident&quot; as Beit Or seems to attempt, but, at least if challenged, need to be attributed to some scholar or other. As far I understand, the Encyclopedia of Islam is just the source of the text of these correspondences, and not of the conclusion, or is it? It the Enc. of Islam ''does'' claim the connection, it would then be Ghirla's turn to say &quot;however, according to Dr. Y, this connection is unlikely or overstated&quot; or something.

:Dab, I agree with this interpretation (although nobody questioned the accuracy of translations, in this case). What is objectionable is Beit Or's attempt to represent his favoured interpretation as the ultimate truth (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sviatoslav_I_of_Kiev&amp;diff=82190868&amp;oldid=82189065 this edit]).

I should probably point out here that the primary sources listed: Documents of trials, etc, clearly indicate that a modenrn context is being considered.

E.g., they're meant to avoid people writing on, say, an actress' divorce from running off and getting a copy of the divorce trial, spilling all sorts of new nasty private information onto Wikipedia. Are we seriously trying to say that notable, published historical documents are inappropriate for historical sources? Or, ad absurdum, that an article on, say, [[The Importance of Being Earnest]] must avoid using the play as its source?  No! This is ridiculous, and the guideline is probably being misinterpreted.

:I agree. I've just read the article with great interest and read this talk page afterwards. By chance, I've been following the recent policy discussions about reliable sources, attribution etc. quite closely, and, as someone mainly involved in history articles and with a history degree, I've come to the conclusion that the deprecation of primary sources in favour of secondary ones does not, on the whole, apply to history articles; that deprecation is really to prevent pseudoscientific and political blogs and websites being used as references in articles instead of published sources. As far as history articles are concerned, a published primary source is as valid as a secondary source, since it has undergone an editing process and has been published in print. Of course, wikipedia editors may not subject primary sources to their own original interpretation, which is where secondary sources come in. [[User:Qp10qp|qp10qp]] 23:52, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

Should there be a separate succession box for prince of Novgorod, khan (claimant) to Bulgaria, etc.? Also, are there any indications that Sviatoslav used the title [[Rus' Khaganate|Khagan Rus']]?

The Russian Wikipedia claims that Svyatoslav's conquests are comparable (by area) to those of [[Alexander the Great]].

:I don't think they are comparable. Alexander's empire was about 2.1 million sq. miles. The entire [[Russian Federation]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] together come to about 7? So the Russian wiki claim would mean that Sviatoslav's territory covered 30% of this area.
:I think the way the claim originated is the fact that Sviatoslav's power was primarily concentrated in what is now the [[Northwestern Federal District]] and the [[Central Federal District]], which are together about 1.3 million sq. mi. Adding the Ukraine and Belarus to this brings the total area up to about the same as Alexander's empire. Of course, this assumes that Sviatoslav controlled these regions in their entirety, which is not a true assumption (he had no control, to my knowledge in [[Karelia]], [[Permia]], [[Kola Peninsula]], western Belarus or the Ukraine west of the [[Dnepr]].

So called &quot;Varangians&quot; as is believed weren't  Swedish Vikings. But Vikings and Variags were not one and the same in reality, because Variags were elite Venedic (old Slavic) military units, trained since their childhood, which were mentioned also by gothic historian Adam von Bremen, where he described this military slavic tribe called Vagri, Vagrians. Their capital city was called Stargrad (&quot;old city&quot;)and after that they became rulers over Rus (old Venetic Slavic) tribe. Their capital city was brought to Novgorod (&quot;new city&quot;). Rus derived from territorial place of Rasenia (in latin sources as &quot;Ruthenia&quot;- as occult perversion), which means &quot;dispersion&quot; (rassenia, rassenit; to disperse). Besides there remained 0 of so called &quot;germanic&quot; words in Russian, Ukrainian vocabulary, it was in reality opposite. That Swedish (old vendic origin) people remained more Slavic words than Russians germanic words.
Here i read attempts that &quot;Sviatoslav&quot; might be germanic king, transliterated in Slavic. 
Swiatoslav as his ancestors were all of Slavic origin. So again, don't mix Vikings with Variags. Vikings were from Jarl Swedish tribes, when Variags were from Venetic slavic tribes, elite units, trained since their childhood. And then invited into Veche (a popular slavic assembly), like was also &quot;1.&quot; Russian Khan (&quot;great one&quot;)- general (when civilian ruler was Kniaz or Knez) Riurik.</text>
