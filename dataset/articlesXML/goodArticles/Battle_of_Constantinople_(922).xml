{{Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars}}
The '''Battle of Constantinople''' was fought in June 922 at the outskirts of the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Constantinople]], between the forces of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and the Byzantines during the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927]]. In the summer the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] sent troops under the commander [[Saktikios]] to repel another Bulgarian raid at the outskirts of the Byzantine capital. The Byzantines stormed the Bulgarian camp but were defeated when they confronted the main Bulgarian forces. During his flight from the battlefield Saktikios was mortally wounded and died the following night. 

The Bulgarians, who by 922 were in control of most of the [[Balkans]], continued to ravage the Byzantine countryside virtually unopposed. However, they lacked the maritime power to conduct a successful siege of Constantinople. The subsequent attempts to negotiate a Bulgarian–Arab alliance for a joint assault of Constantinople were discovered by the Byzantines and successfully countered. The strategic situation in the Balkans remained unchanged until both sides signed a [[Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 927|peace treaty in 927]], which recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] as an [[autocephalous]] [[Patriarchate]].

The primary sources for the battle are the continuation of [[George Hamartolos]]' ''Chronicle'' and [[John Skylitzes]]' ''Synopsis of Histories''.

== Background ==
{{main|Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927}}
During his short reign the Byzantine emperor [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]] (r. 912–913) provoked a conflict with the Bulgarian monarch [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] (r. 893–927). Simeon I, who had long harboured ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself, took the opportunity to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Byzantine Empire in disarray following Alexander's death in June 913, the Bulgarians reached Constantinople unopposed and forced the regency of the infant [[Constantine VII]] (r. 913–959) to recognize Simeon I as emperor (in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], ''[[Tsar]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=145–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a palace coup in 914, the new Byzantine regency revoked the concessions to the Bulgarians and summoned the whole army, including the troops in [[Asia Minor]], to deal with the Bulgarian threat once and all. In the decisive [[Battle of Achelous (917)|battle of Achelous]] in 917 the Byzantine forces were completely annihilated, leaving the Bulgarians in charge of the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their annual campaigns reached the [[walls of Constantinople]] and the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. All subsequent attempts to confront the Bulgarian army at [[Battle of Katasyrtai|Katasyrtai]], [[Aquae Calidae]] and [[Battle of Pegae|Pegae]] ended in defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|pp=382, 408–410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his military supremacy over land, Simeon I was aware that he needed naval assistance in order to seize Constantinople. In 922 he clandestinely sent envoys to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah]] in [[Mahdia]] to negotiate the assistance of the powerful [[Arabs|Arab]] navy. Simeon I proposed to divide equally all spoils; the Bulgarians were to keep Constantinople and the Fatimids would gain the Byzantine territories in [[Sicily]] and [[South Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The battle ==
[[File:61-manasses-chronicle.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=A page from a medieval manuscript|The Bulgarians burn a church at the outskirts of Constantinople, ''[[Constantine Manasses|Manasses Chronicle]]''.]]
To distract the Byzantine attention from the secret negotiations with the Arabs, in the summer of 922 the Bulgarians launched a campaign in [[Eastern Thrace]]. They captured and garrisoned a number of fortified towns in the region, including [[Vize|Bizye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|pp=419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June they reached the outskirts of Constantinople and burned the Palace of Theodora, situated on the shores of the [[Golden Horn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zlatarski421&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response, emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920–944) summoned the commanders of the ''[[Tagma (military)|tagma]]ta'' on a feast and urged them to confront the Bulgarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;zlatarski421&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;continuatus146&quot;&gt;&quot;Continuation of the Chronicle of George Hamartolos&quot; in GIBI, vol. VI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/6/gal/6_146.html p. 146]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;skylitzes252&quot;&gt;&quot;Synopsis of Histories by John Skylitzes&quot; in GIBI, vol. VI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/6/gal/6_252.html p. 252]&lt;/ref&gt; The following day one of them, Saktikios, led the assault against the Bulgarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;continuatus146&quot;/&gt; While most of the Bulgarian soldiers were dispersed to loot the countryside, the Byzantines attacked the Bulgarian camp and slaughtered the few defenders left there.&lt;ref name=&quot;zlatarski421&quot;/&gt; When the main Bulgarian forces were informed about the attack, they headed back to the camp to engage the opponents. In the ensuing heavy struggle the Bulgarians prevailed and forced the Byzantines to flee despite the personal courage of Saktikios, who the Byzantine chroniclers claim to have &quot;killed many&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;continuatus146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;skylitzes252&quot;/&gt; During the flight, the horse of Saktikios got stuck in the mud of a river and the Byzantine commander was wounded in the seat and the thigh.&lt;ref name=&quot;continuatus146&quot;/&gt; His soldiers managed to free the horse from the mud and to bring him to the [[Blachernae]] alive. Saktikios was laid in the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]], where he died the following night.&lt;ref name=&quot;continuatus146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Synopsis of Histories by John Skylitzes&quot; in GIBI, vol. VI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/6/gal/6_253.html p. 253]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Byzantine Constantinople-en.png|right|thumb|300px|alt=A city map|A map of Constantinople with the [[Golden Horn]] visible to the north and the [[Blachernae]] to the north-west.]]
After the victory Simeon I sent letters to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] [[Nicholas Mystikos]] and Romanos' co-emperor [[Constantine VII]]{{cref|a}} to propose peace negotiations. However, his intention was to prolong the negotiations until the return of his envoys to the Fatimids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|pp=420–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Simeon I and Nicholas Mystikos exchanged letters the military actions continued. In a few weeks the Bulgarian army captured [[Adrianople]], the most important city in Byzantine Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of Adrianople raised fears in Constantinople that a Bulgarian assault of the city was imminent. The Byzantines tried to intimidate Simeon I by threatening to incite the [[Magyars]], the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Kievan Rus']] to attack Bulgaria from the north-east, as they had done in the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896|war of 894–896]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simeon I knew that these were empty words because the Byzantine Empire was in no position to carry out these threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the meantime, the Bulgarian envoys received a warm welcome by al-Mahdi. The Fatimid caliph accepted the Bulgarian terms and sent his own emissaries to Simeon I. However, on the way back their ship was captured by the Byzantines, who managed to outbid the Bulgarians and distract a Fatimid attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|pp=433–434}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarians remained in control of most of the Balkans, [[Bulgarian–Serbian wars of 917–924|annexing Byzantium's ally Serbia]] in 924, but without naval support were unable to launch a decisive attack on Constantinople. The war continued until the death of Simeon I in 927, when his son [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] (r. 927–969) concluded a peace treaty with the Byzantines, who recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] as an [[autocephalous]] [[Patriarchate]] in return for most of Simeon I's conquests in Thrace after 917.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
