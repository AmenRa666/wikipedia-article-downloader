'''HMS ''Hesper''''' was a [[Royal Navy]] 18-gun [[sloop-of-war|ship-sloop]] of the [[Cormorant class ship-sloop|''Cormorant'' class]], launched in 1809 at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt; Her original builder, Benjamin Tanner, became bankrupt during her construction, so John Cock completed her. In 1810 she was reclassed as a 20-gun [[sixth rate]] ship (but without being re-armed); in 1817 she was again re-rated, this time as 26 guns. She served primarily in the Indian Ocean. In 1810 she participated in the [[Invasion of Isle de France]]. The next year ''Hesper'' participated in the capture of Java, which she followed in 1812 by capturing [[Timor]]. She was sold in 1817.

==Service==
G. Aklom apparently commissioned ''Hesper'' in March 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-368527&quot;/&gt; However, ''Hesper'' was not launched until 1809 and did not actually enter service until 1809. Captain George Hoare was appointed to ''Hesper'' in 1809,&lt;ref name=NC22/&gt; commissioned her in August and sailed for the [[Indian Ocean]] on 9 October.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[National Maritime Museum]] database has Edward Wallis Hoare commissioning ''Hesper'' and W. Buchanan sailing her to the East Indies, but that information applies to {{HMS|Hecate|1809|2}} and also appears on her record.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1810 Commander David Paterson took command.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

''Hesper'' captured [[Mouche No. 2-class schooner-avisos#Mouche No. 28|''Mouche No.28'']]  on 15 November 1810 near Île Bonaparte (Réunion) as she was carrying dispatches to the Île de France. A boarding party in ''Hesper''{{'}}s cutter suffered three men wounded while boarding ''Mouche''; French casualties were two men killed and five wounded, one of whom was ''Mouche No.28''{{'}}s commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=12 February 1811|issue=16455|startpage=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British recommissioned her for the attack on Île de France.&lt;ref name=WR&gt;Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hesper'' was detailed for service with the squadron under Admiral [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]] engaged in the [[invasion of Isle de France]] ([[Mauritius]]). Bertie set ''Hesper'' and {{HMS|Cornelia|1808|2}} to join the squadron blockading [[Port Louis]]. While she was there, she and the government armed ship ''Emma'', Lieutenant B. Street commanding, performed a useful reconnaissance taking soundings at night of the anchorage on the coast, a service for which Bertie commended them.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 25, pp.164-170.&lt;/ref&gt; They identified a place in a narrow strait between an islet called the Gunner's Coin and the coast where the fleet could anchor and where boats could land through an opening in the reef.&lt;ref&gt;''Asiatic journal and monthly miscellany for British and foreign India, China, Australasia'' (1836), Vol 36, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The island surrendered on 3 December. In September 1814 prize money was paid to the officers and crews of the vessels that had been present at the capture of [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]].{{#tag:ref|A first-class share was worth [[£sd|£]]278 19[[shilling|s]] 5¾[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth £3 7s 6¼d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1923|issue=16938|date=24 September 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth and final payment was made in July 1828. A first-class share was worth £29 19s 5¼d; a sixth-class share was worth 8s 2½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1376|endpage=1377|issue=18487|date=15 July 1828}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Following the successful invasion, ''Hesper'' was at the centre of a dispute between Admiral Bertie and Admiral [[William O'Bryen Drury]] whose commands overlapped. Bertie appointed Lieutenant Edward Lloyd to command ''Hesper'' and he sailed her back to Bombay with Major-General [[John Abercromby (British Army officer)|John Abercrombie]] and his staff as passengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's magazine'', Vol. 44, p.316.&lt;/ref&gt; There Lloyd found out that Drury had appointed [[Barrington Reynolds]] to command her. Although Drury died before the dispute was settled, Reynolds was confirmed in command.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.306-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 1811, ''Hesper'' was one of six ships that shared in the capture of ''Mouche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1988|issue=16942|date=4 October 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; French records report that ''Mouche No.27'' was captured on 12 January at the entrance to Port Napoléon (Port Louis, Île de France) by a British frigate flying the French flag.&lt;ref name=WR/&gt;

Later in 1811, ''Hesper'' was attached to the squadron of Admiral [[Robert Stopford (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Stopford]] that [[Invasion of Java (1811)|captured Java]].

On 31 August the frigates [[HMS Nisus (1810)|''Nisus'']], [[French frigate Président|''President'']], and [[HMS Phoebe (1795)|''Phoebe'']], and ''Hesper'' were detached to take the seaport of [[Cheribon]].&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), vol.VI, pp.38-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds received a promotion to [[Post-captain]], confirmed the next year, for his role. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Java&quot; to all remaining survivors of the campaign.

In February 1812 command passed to Charles Thomas Thurston, who was blown by a storm to [[Timor]], which had been out on contact with Europe for two years. Thurston was able to persuade the Dutch garrison there to surrender and captured the island without fighting.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' Vol. III, June 1818, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONa1O52XhmMC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=%22HMS+Hesper%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22HMS%20Hesper%22&amp;f=false article] on pages 306-312, '''''The Taking of the Island of Timor by the H.M.S. Hesper in 1811'''''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=2118|issue=16660|date=20 October 1812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurston was later invalided home. Lieutenant Henry Theodosius Browne Collier took command on 30 June 1812, but he too was invalided home before the confirmation of his promotion to Commander on 24 October 1812.&lt;ref&gt;O'Byrne (1849), p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Command then passed to Commander Joseph Prior.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; As a lieutenant he had transferred to ''Hesper'' in 1809.&lt;ref name=NC22&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 22, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[William Bland]] was ''Hesper''{{'}}s surgeon while she was at Bombay, India. He became involved in a wardroom argument with Robert Case the purser. In the duel, which took place on 7 April 1813, Bland killed Case.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October ''Hesper'' was in the [[Persian Gulf]], delivering despatches to [[Bushire]] for the British ambassador at [[Teheran]]. She then visited [[Abu Dhabi]]. Captain Charles Biddulph replaced Prior in August 1812 and served until 22 April 1815 when he died. Before he died 22 May 1815, aged 29,&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's magazine'', Vol. 118, p.634.&lt;/ref&gt; he charted the four Biddulph's Islands (or Biddulph Group), which lie on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf.{{#tag:ref|The four islands consist of sand banks and rocks barely elevated above sea level and are home to birds and turtles.&lt;ref&gt;''A Gazetteer of the world: or, Dictionary of geographical knowledge ...'', (By Royal Geographical Society; 1856), Vol. 5, p.735.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}
  
''Hesper'' was without a captain for a while and then on 20 September 1815 Michael Matthews was made Commander on ''Hesper''.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, p.401.&lt;/ref&gt;  Commander Robert Campbell (acting) was his replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-368527&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_i.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 368527|work=Warship Histories, vol i|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{#tag:ref|Captain Robert Campbell was also the &quot;dear cousin&quot; to the poet [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]].[https://books.google.com/books?id=d0y5YDw8Tl4C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=%22Captain+Robert+Campbell%22+Hesper&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Captain%20Robert%20Campbell%22%20Hesper&amp;f=false]|group=Note}} In 1816 Commander William Everard (acting) replaced Campbell.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-368527&quot;/&gt;

==Fate==
''Hesper'' was sold in 1817.
