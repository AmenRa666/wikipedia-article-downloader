'''SMS ''Königsberg''''' (&quot;His Majesty's Ship ''Königsberg''{{-&quot;}}) was the [[lead ship]] of [[Königsberg-class cruiser (1905)|her class]] of [[light cruiser]]s built by the German ''[[Imperial German Navy|Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy).&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;SMS&quot; stands for &quot;''[[Seiner Majestät Schiff]]''&quot; ({{lang-de|link=no|His Majesty's Ship}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Named after [[Königsberg]], the capital of East Prussia, she was laid down in January 1905, launched in December of that year and completed by June 1906.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[ship class|class]] included three other ships: {{SMS|Stettin||2}}, {{SMS|Stuttgart||2}}, and {{SMS|Nürnberg|1906|2}}. ''Königsberg'' was armed with a main battery of ten {{convert|10.5|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns and had a top speed of {{convert|24.1|kn}}.

After her commissioning, ''Königsberg'' served with the [[High Seas Fleet]]'s reconnaissance force. During this period, she frequently escorted [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s yacht on visits to foreign countries. In April 1914, the ship was sent on what was to have been a two-year deployment to [[German East Africa]], but this was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August of that year. ''Königsberg'' initially attempted to raid British and French commercial traffic in the region, but only destroyed one merchant ship in the course of her career. Coal shortages hampered her ability to attack shipping. On 20 September 1914, she surprised and sank the British [[protected cruiser]] {{HMS|Pegasus|1897|6}} in the [[Battle of Zanzibar]].

''Königsberg'' then retreated into the [[Rufiji River]] to repair her engines. Before the repairs could be completed, British cruisers located ''Königsberg'', and, unable to steam into the river to destroy her, set up a blockade. After several attempts to sink the ship during the [[Battle of Rufiji Delta]], the British sent two [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], {{HMS|Mersey|1914|2}} and {{HMS|Severn|1914|2}}, to destroy the German cruiser. On 11 July 1915, the two monitors got close enough to severely damage ''Königsberg'', forcing her crew to scuttle the ship. The surviving crew salvaged all ten of her main guns and joined Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]]'s guerrilla [[East African Campaign (World War I)|campaign in East Africa]]. ''Königsberg'' was partially broken up in 1963–65 for scrap, and the remains sank into the riverbed.

==Design==
[[File:Königsberg class cruiser diagrams Janes 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of the ''Königsberg'' class&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The diagram mistakenly refers to the class as the ''Stettin'' class and does not include ''Königsberg''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Königsberg-class cruiser (1905)}}

''Königsberg'' and her [[sister ship|sisters]] were designed to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in [[German colonial empire|Germany's colonial empire]]. This was a result of budgetary constraints that prevented the ''Kaiserliche Marine'' from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, pp. 142, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

''Königsberg''  was {{convert|115.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.29|m|ftin|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|3814|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] powered by eleven coal-fired [[water-tube boiler]]s rated at {{convert|9,709|kW|ihp|lk=in|order=flip}}. These provided a top speed of {{convert|24.1|kn|lk=in}} and a range of approximately {{convert|5,750|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. ''Königsberg'' had a crew of 14&amp;nbsp;officers and 308&amp;nbsp;enlisted men.&lt;ref name=&quot;G104&quot;&gt;Gröner, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with ten [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. There were two side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], six [[amidships]], three on either side, and two side by side aft.&lt;ref name=&quot;C157&quot;&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The guns had a maximum elevation of 30&amp;nbsp;degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to {{convert|12,700|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;G104&quot; /&gt; ''Königsberg'' also carried ten [[5.2 cm SK L/55 naval gun|{{convert|5.2|cm|abbr=on}} SK guns]] in single mounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS138&quot;/&gt; She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]]. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. The [[conning tower]] sides were {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=&quot;G104&quot; /&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Königsberg German cruiser.jpg|thumb|Pre-war photo of ''Königsberg'']]

''Königsberg'' was ordered under the contract name &quot;''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Meteor||2}}&quot; and was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Kiel]] on 12 January 1905.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;German warships were ordered under provisional names. For new additions to the fleet, they were given a single letter; for those ships intended to replace older or lost vessels, they were ordered as &quot;''Ersatz'' (name of the ship to be replaced)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 12 December 1905, when the ''[[Lord Mayor|Oberbürgermeister]]'' of [[Königsberg]], [[Siegfried Körte]], christened the ship, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] for [[sea trials]] on 6 April 1907. Her trials were interrupted at the beginning of June when she was tasked with escorting [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s yacht {{ship|SMY|Hohenzollern||2}} during three sailing [[regatta]]s including [[Kiel Week]]. The two ships then cruised the [[North Sea]] and stopped at [[Nordkapp]], where from 3 to 6 August, Wilhelm II met Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]]. After returning to Germany, ''Königsberg'' resumed her sea trials, which lasted from 9 August to 9 September. She visited her namesake city from 21 to 23 September and was later assigned to the fleet scouting forces to replace the cruiser {{SMS|Medusa||2}} on 5 November. At this time, ''Königsberg'' was again used to escort Wilhelm II's yacht, this time in company with the new [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and the dispatch boat {{SMS|Sleipner||2}} on a visit to Britain. The ships stopped in [[Portsmouth]] and the [[Thames]], and were visited by Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December, ''Königsberg'' was tasked with another goodwill visit, this time escorting the Kaiser's brother, [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Heinrich]], and a delegation of naval officers to [[Malmö]], Sweden to meet King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]]. The visit lasted until 20 December. ''Königsberg'' participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual and squadron training for 1908 without incident. The year ended with a major training cruise, first in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and North Sea and later into the Atlantic, that ended in early December. The ship then went into drydock over the winter of 1908–09 for periodic maintenance, emerging for service again in early February 1909. A typical training routine followed for the next two years, interrupted only by a collision with the new cruiser {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}} on 16 February 1910 in the [[Kiel Bay]], and two trips escorting the Kaiser in 1910; the first to [[Helgoland]] on 9–13 March and the second to Britain from 8 to 27 May. The collision with ''Dresden'' caused significant damage to both ships, though no one on either vessel was injured. Both ships were repaired in Kiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cruisers in Collision|author= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9504E1DE1430E233A25754C1A9649C946196D6CF |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=17 February 1910 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dresden'' also won the Kaiser's ''Schießpreis'' (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the reconnaissance force during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS139&quot;&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1909 to September 1910, ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]'' (Frigate Captain) [[Adolf von Trotha]] served as the ship's commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS138&quot;&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

From 8 March to 22 May 1911, ''Königsberg'' cruised in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with Wilhelm II aboard ''Hohenzollern''. On 10 June, ''Königsberg'' was replaced in the reconnaissance force by the new cruiser {{SMS|Kolberg||2}}; ''Königsberg'' was transferred to [[Danzig]], where she was placed out of service on 14 June for modernization work. On 22 January 1913, the ship was recommissioned for service with the fleet, to replace the cruiser {{SMS|Mainz||2}} which was also being modernized. This service lasted until 19 June, when ''Königsberg'' was again placed in reserve in Kiel. During this period of active service, she was assigned to the training squadron from 1 to 18 April. In early 1914, the high command decided to send ''Königsberg'' to [[German East Africa]], where she would replace the current station ship, the old [[unprotected cruiser]] {{SMS|Geier||2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS139&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3001, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Kreuzer Königsberg.jpg|thumb|left|SMS ''Königsberg'' at Bagamoyo, June 1914]]

On 1 April 1914, ''Fregattenkapitän'' [[Max Looff]] took command of the ship. ''Königsberg'' left Kiel on 25 April, stopped in [[Wilhelmshaven]], and then left three days later for a two-year deployment to German East Africa. She steamed into the Mediterranean Sea and stopped in Spanish and Italian ports before entering the [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS139&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; After passing through the canal, she stopped briefly in [[Aden]] before arriving in [[Dar es Salaam]], the capital of German East Africa, on 5 June. Two days later, the ''[[Schutztruppe]]'' (Protection Force) celebrated their 25th anniversary in the colony; the deputy commander of the ''Schutztruppe'' presented Looff with a model of the cruiser {{SMS|Schwalbe||2}}, which had been the longest serving warship with the unit. ''Königsberg'' surveyed the harbor at [[Bagamoyo]] later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; The African colonial subjects considered the ship to be quite impressive, particularly her three funnels, which were assumed to signify a warship more powerful than one with only two funnels. The ship acquired the nickname ''Manowari na bomba tatu'', or &quot;the man of war with three pipes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Patience 2001, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

As tensions in Europe rose in the aftermath of the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the ''[[Admiralstab]]'' (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS140&quot;&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the cruisers of the British [[Cape of Good Hope Station|Cape Squadron]], {{HMS|Astraea|1893|6}}, {{HMS|Hyacinth|1898|2}}, and {{HMS|Pegasus|1897|2}}, arrived with the intention of bottling up ''Königsberg'' at the colony's capital Dar es Salaam. Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; ''Königsberg'' steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

===World War I===
At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''Königsberg'' was ordered to attack British commerce around the entrance to the [[Red Sea]]. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier ''Koenig'' from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Portuguese East Africa]] to deny it to ''Königsberg''.&lt;ref name=&quot;H77&quot;&gt;Halpern, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Looff then radioed the German steamer [[SS Zieten|''Zieten'']] to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. ''Königsberg'' chased after the German freighter [[SS Goldenfels|''Goldenfels'']], whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. ''Königsberg'' was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of ''Goldenfels'' to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS141&quot;&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August, ''Königsberg'' found a British ship off the coast of [[Oman]], the freighter ''City of Winchester''. A [[prize crew]] took the ship along with ''Königsberg'', and the two vessels met ''Zieten'' four days later in the [[Khuriya Muriya Islands]], where coal from ''City of Winchester'' was transferred to ''Königsberg''. The freighter was thereafter sunk. The British crew was taken aboard ''Zieten'', which departed the following day and stopped in [[Mozambique]]. Meanwhile, the steamer ''Somali'', under the command of ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' (Corvette Captain) Zimmer, had left Dar es Salaam with a cargo of {{convert|1200|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} of coal on the night of 3–4 August to resupply ''Königsberg''; the two ships met ten days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS141&quot; /&gt; By the time Looff rendezvoused with ''Somali'', his ship was down to a mere {{convert|14|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} of coal. ''Somali'' transferred some {{convert|850|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} of coal to the cruiser, which permitted a sweep to Madagascar. No British or French ships were found, however, and so ''Königsberg'' met ''Somali'' again on 23 August and took on coal for four days of cruising.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, British warships bombarded Dar es Salaam and destroyed the German wireless station there.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, ''Königsberg''{{'}}s engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff needed to find a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the [[Rufiji River|Rufiji]] Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the [[survey ship]] ''Möwe''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS141&quot; /&gt; On 3 September 1914 at high tide, ''Königsberg'' passed over the [[Shoal|bar]] at the mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed at the mouth of the river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply ''Königsberg'', observed a British cruiser—''Pegasus''—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at [[Zanzibar]] on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the [[Congo Act of 1885]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot;&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3035, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Unterstand.jpg|thumb|One of ''Königsberg''{{'}}s guns emplaced in the delta]]

On 19 September, ''Königsberg'' left the Rufiji and arrived off Zanzibar the following morning. She opened fire at a range of about {{convert|7000|m|sp=us}} at 05:10, starting the [[Battle of Zanzibar]]; within 45 minutes, ''Pegasus'' caught fire, rolled over to port, and sank. Crewmen aboard ''Pegasus'' had raised a [[white flag]], but it could not be seen aboard ''Königsberg'' due to the heavy smoke. ''Pegasus''{{'}}s crew suffered 38 dead and 55 wounded, while ''Königsberg'' was undamaged and had no casualties. After sinking ''Pegasus'', ''Königsberg'' bombarded the wireless station and dumped barrels filled with sand into the harbor entrance to simulate [[naval mine|mines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt; While leaving the harbor, ''Königsberg'' spotted the picket ship ''Helmut'' and sank her with three shells.&lt;ref name=&quot;F133&quot;&gt;Farwell, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the article on the battle says the Helmut was damaged, but survived--&gt;

The cruiser then returned to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt; While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;F133&quot; /&gt; An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;B133&quot;&gt;Bennett, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned with the threat ''Königsberg'' posed to troop transports from India,&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt; the British reinforced the flotilla tasked with tracking down the elusive German raider, and placed the ships under the command of Captain [[Sidney R. Drury-Lowe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H78&quot; /&gt; The sinking of ''Pegasus'' convinced the British that ''Königsberg'' must still be in German East Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt; On 19 October, the cruiser {{HMS|Chatham|1911|2}} found the German East Africa Line ship ''Präsident'' at [[Lindi]]. A boarding party searched the ship and discovered documents indicating she had supplied ''Königsberg'' with coal in the Rufiji the previous month. On 30 October, the cruiser {{HMS|Dartmouth|1911|2}} located ''Königsberg'' and ''Somali'' in the delta.&lt;ref name=&quot;H78&quot;&gt;Halpern, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The cruisers ''Chatham'', ''Dartmouth'', and {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|2}} blockaded the Rufiji Delta to ensure ''Königsberg'' could not escape.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Rufiji Delta====
{{main|Battle of Rufiji Delta}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3009, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Kreuzer Königsberg.jpg|thumb|right|The battered ''Königsberg'' after she was scuttled]]

On 3 November, the British began a bombardment in an attempt to destroy or neutralize ''Königsberg'' and ''Somali''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt; ''Königsberg'' was protected by the thick [[mangrove]] swamps, which concealed the ship and offered a degree of cover from British shellfire, especially while the British ships remained outside the river. A collier, ''Newbridge'', was converted into a [[blockship]] to be sunk in the main channel of the delta to prevent ''Königsberg''{{'}}s escape. Despite heavy German fire from both sides of the river, the British successfully sank ''Newbridge'' across one of the delta mouths on 10 November, though the German raider could still put to sea via other channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B133&quot; /&gt; Looff decided to move his ship further upriver, to make it more difficult for the British to destroy her. In doing so, his ship would occupy a disproportionate number of British vessels that could otherwise have been employed elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;B133&quot; /&gt; In the course of the campaign, the British reinforced the squadron blockading the Rufiji with additional cruisers, including {{HMS|Pyramus|1897|2}} and the Australian {{HMAS|Pioneer}}.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

A civilian pilot, Denis Cutler of [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], was commissioned into the Royal Marines and persuaded to make his private [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] [[seaplane]] available for the British Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;T3940&quot;&gt;Turner, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy requisitioned the passenger ship {{SS|Kinfauns Castle||2}} to serve as a makeshift [[Seaplane tender|tender]] for Cutler's aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;P70&quot;&gt;Patience 2011, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; On his first attempt to locate the cruiser, Cutler, who did not have a compass, got lost and was forced to land on a desert island. On his second flight, he successfully located ''Königsberg'', and a third flight with a Royal Navy observer confirmed his observations. His aircraft's radiator was damaged on the flight and he was grounded until replacement parts could be brought from Mombasa. A pair of [[Royal Naval Air Service]] [[Sopwith Aviation Company|Sopwiths]] were brought up with the intention of scouting and even bombing the ship. They soon fell apart in the tropical conditions. A trio of [[Short Brothers|Short]] seaplanes fared a little better, though they too were quickly disabled by the conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;P70&quot; /&gt;

Also in November, the British sought to use the {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns of the old battleship {{HMS|Goliath|1898|2}} to sink the cruiser. The attempt was unsuccessful, once again because the shallow waters prevented the battleship from getting within range.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In December, ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel) [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]] requested as many crew members from the ship as possible for the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East Africa Campaign]] against the British; a total of 220 men were left aboard to keep the ship in fighting condition. This was not enough, however, to permit the ship to go to sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;B133&quot; /&gt; ''Königsberg'' moved further up the river on 18 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt; On 23 December, the British used a pair of shallow-draft ships to sail up the delta. They hit ''Somali'' once before German defensive fire forced them to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, conditions were deteriorating on ''Königsberg''. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although safe from the British, the crew was ravaged by [[malaria]] and other tropical ailments. Generally cut off from the outside world, the morale of the sailors fell.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, ''Rubens'', was renamed ''Kronborg''. It was given a [[Denmark|Danish]] flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak [[Danish language|Danish]]. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, ''Königsberg'' prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, ''Königsberg'' was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. ''Hyacinth'' intercepted ''Kronborg'' as she approached, and chased her to [[Manza Bay]]. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, pp. 139–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in April 1915, the British [[Admiralty]] agreed to a plan submitted by Drury-Lowe the previous November, which envisioned attacking the German cruiser with shallow-draft [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], capable of navigating the Rufiji River. Two of the warships, {{HMS|Mersey|1913|2}} and {{HMS|Severn|1913|2}}, armed with a pair of {{convert|6|in|abbr=on|0}} guns each, were brought from Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;B134&quot; /&gt; ''Königsberg'' had in the meantime been moved a third time, even further upriver.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRS142&quot; /&gt; On 6 July 1915, the two monitors crossed the outer sandbar and steamed up the river, despite heavy fire from German positions on the river banks. They stopped at a point they thought to be {{convert|10000|yd|abbr=on}} from ''Königsberg'', which would be in range of their own guns but farther than the smaller German guns could reply. Aircraft were used to spot the fall of shot. The monitors' navigation was faulty, however, and after opening fire, they found themselves to be within range of ''Königsberg''{{'}}s guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;B134&quot;&gt;Bennett, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; She hit ''Mersey'' twice in the engagement; one shell disabled the forward 6-inch gun, and another holed the ship below the waterline.&lt;ref&gt;Patience 2001, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; ''Königsberg'' was hit four times in return, one shell striking beneath the waterline and causing some flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Patience 2001, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In the span of three hours, ''Königsberg'' forced both British ships to withdraw.&lt;ref name=&quot;B134&quot;/&gt;

They returned again on 11 July, after having repaired the damage sustained in the first attempt. The two monitors conducted a five-hour bombardment.&lt;ref name=&quot;B134&quot; /&gt; ''Königsberg'' opened fire at 12:12, initially with four guns, but only three guns remained in action after 12:42, two guns after 12:44, and one gun after 12:53. The two monitors did not respond until 12:31, once they had been anchored into their firing positions,&lt;ref&gt;Patience 2001, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; and scored several serious hits that caused a major fire at the ship's stern and inflicted heavy casualties. By 13:40, ''Königsberg'' had run low on ammunition and her gun crews had suffered very heavy casualties, and so Looff ordered the crew to abandon ship and to drop the [[breech block]]s for the guns overboard to disable them. Two torpedo warheads were detonated in the ship's bow to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] her; the ship rolled over slightly to starboard and sank up to the upper deck with her flags still flying. Nineteen men had been killed in the battle, with another forty-five wounded, including Looff.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, the crew returned to haul down the ship's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Patience 2001, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; together with the ship's crew, they went on to see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow-Vorbeck.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry [[MV Liemba|''Götzen'']] of the inland [[Lake Tanganyika]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Patience, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving sailors, organized as the ''Königsberg-Abteilung'' (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, John Ingle, the former captain of ''Pegasus'', was tasked with clearing wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, he bought the salvage rights to ''Königsberg'' for the price of £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm guns are preserved, one in [[Pretoria]], South Africa, one in [[Jinja, Uganda]], and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from ''Pegasus''.&lt;ref&gt;Patience 2011, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
