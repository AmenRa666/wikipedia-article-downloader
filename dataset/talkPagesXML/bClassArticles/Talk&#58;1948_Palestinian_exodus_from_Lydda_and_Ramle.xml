==Picture chosen==
Hmm lets see &quot;1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle&quot;, full of death and destruction. Can someone tell me why exactly are we depicting a conflict that was highly tense, as a friendly one?!?  [[User:Makeandtoss|Makeandtoss]] ([[User talk:Makeandtoss|talk]]) 17:53, 23 March 2016 (UTC)
:The current image is a very famous iconic image. I don't think it portrays the conflict as a friendly one. [[User:No More Mr Nice Guy|No More Mr Nice Guy]] ([[User talk:No More Mr Nice Guy|talk]]) 19:23, 23 March 2016 (UTC)
::Can't see how famous and iconic gives it a place in infobox , especially when it is largely irrelevant to article (exodus) . [[User:Makeandtoss|Makeandtoss]] ([[User talk:Makeandtoss|talk]]) 19:39, 23 March 2016 (UTC)
::: It should be replaced by an image that actually depicts the topic of the article. This image is misleading as well as irrelevant. [[User:Zero0000|Zero]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Zero0000|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:55, 23 March 2016 (UTC)
::::How is this image misleading? [[User:No More Mr Nice Guy|No More Mr Nice Guy]] ([[User talk:No More Mr Nice Guy|talk]]) 18:04, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::It makes it appear that an assault in which up to 400 some odd people died and up to 70,000 people were forced from their homes had a bit more camaraderie than it did. [[:File:RuinsOfLydda.png]], or [[:File:RefugeesEscortedFromRamlaOperationDanny.jpg]] or [[:File:Ismail Shammout's Where to ....JPG]] would be less misleading and would have the added advantage of actually representing the topic of the article. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:Nableezy|&lt;font color=&quot;#C11B17&quot;&gt;nableezy&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - 18:19, 24 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
::::::This picture has been in the infobox since at least 2010. You guys just noticed it's &quot;misleading&quot;? I disagree with your interpreation, so we'll just have to see what consensus forms.

:::::::No, I certainly havenÂ´t &quot;just noticed&quot;. This picture is wrong in ''so'' many ways. (But then, so much is, on Wikipedia...)  Just a thing like that scantily dressed female soldier....many observers during 1930-40s noted that the Zionist often dressed scantily, as a way to be  provokative towards the local Arab population. (I cannot recall seeing pictures of Israeli soldiers being so scantily dressed today?) This is a context which is totally missing from the picture.  And the caption &quot;accepts a cigarette from a Palestinian resident&quot;...when there are countless histories of how Israeli soldiers robbed the Palestinian residents? How much of a choice did the Palestinian have? I would prefer either https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RuinsOfLydda.png  or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RefugeesEscortedFromRamlaOperationDanny.jpg [[User:Huldra|Huldra]] ([[User talk:Huldra|talk]]) 20:22, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::::: I would vote for the ruins of Lydda pic. The current pic being placed in infobox is plain hilarious. When I see it I can only imagine this convo &quot;Oh hello fellow European immigrant, you did a wonderful job in ethnically cleansing this long established Arab town. Here have a cig!&quot; [[User:Makeandtoss|Makeandtoss]] ([[User talk:Makeandtoss|talk]]) 20:53, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::{{u|Huldra}} clearly didn't follow [http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/female-israeli-defense-force-members-pose-in-lingerie-for-ra#.rqmv71y8b this] a few years ago. Seriously: guys, try to stick to the matter of choosing a picture for the box rather than straight-up Israel-bashing, calling them thieves or &quot;European immigrants&quot; doesn't help matters and might give people the wrong idea. I do agree the image of the cigarette handover is rather weak, no matter how iconic it's supposed to be (I've only ever seen it on this page, but it might be more famous in Israel, I don't know). I'd say go with [[:File:RefugeesEscortedFromRamlaOperationDanny.jpg]] in the box since it has people in it, and put the one of the ruins further down somewhere. Hope this helps. Cheers, â&lt;span style=&quot;border:solid 0px;color:#fff;background:darkgreen;box-shadow:darkgray 0px 0px 3px&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Cliftonian|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff&quot;&gt;Cliftonian&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Cliftonian|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 22:56, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::[[User:Cliftonian]]: How Israeli soldiers behave/dress  off-duty is not what we are talking about, we are talking about what they wear on-duty (which the cigarette-picture clearly is). I can accept either one of the two I mentioned earlier; I have no strong preference there. (Possibly the one with people in it is better?) [[User:Huldra|Huldra]] ([[User talk:Huldra|talk]]) 23:11, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::Huldra, that was actually a joke to try to lighten the mood, I'm sorry not to have made that clearer. Anyway, glad we agree about which picture would be best.

Thats, if I can see correctly, myself, Huldra and Cliftonian agreeing that specifically [[:File:RefugeesEscortedFromRamlaOperationDanny.jpg]] would be more appropriate in the infobox, Makeandtoss saying go with [[:File:RuinsOfLydda.png]], and Zero saying whats currently there is misleading and doesnt represent the topic of the article. {{ping|Zero0000}} what are your thoughts on replacing the current infobox image with [[:File:RefugeesEscortedFromRamlaOperationDanny.jpg]]? &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:Nableezy|&lt;font color=&quot;#C11B17&quot;&gt;nableezy&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - 23:33, 24 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

That belongs as an alternate name, we went through this in the past. Here are reliable source attesting to this event being known as the Lydda Death March:

:::Thanks Nish, was going to address the incredibly spurious &quot;two sources&quot;, even though more isnt required for a non-contested statement of fact published by top qualitty sources, sources that have already been found reliable for the statement at RS/N the last time somebody tried to relegate the alternative name to outside of the first paragraph. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:Nableezy|&lt;font color=&quot;#C11B17&quot;&gt;nableezy&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - 15:33, 25 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
::::What &quot;isn't required for an uncontested statement of fact&quot;? As far as I understand it, an alternative name requires significant usage. Most of the sources above call the incident a &quot;death march&quot; (in quotes) not the &quot;Lydda Death March&quot; as a noun like Nishidani put in the article while discussion is ongoing. That's not exactly the same. If you want the lead to say that the Palestinians call it a &quot;death march&quot;, I think the sources support that. I do not think the sources support &quot;Lydda Death March&quot; as a significant alternative name for the first line of the lead.

[[User:TrickyH|TrickyH]] ([[User talk:TrickyH|talk]]) 14:24, 30 March 2016 (UTC)
*'''Yes''' - The question is not to decide of the title of the article but to give (one of) the alternative name(s) that is also used to refer to these events. The fact is that '''Lydda Death March''' is also a name that was given to these events. There are 10/11 WP:RS sources that are given here above to prove this. Note that even without these source, the fact this name is used by the Palestinians to refer to these events is enough to add the name in the lead (in bold). Per [[WP:NPoV]] we have to give all the names under which an event is known.&lt;br/&gt;We have exactly the same case on the article [[Qibya massacre]] and there the name under which the Israeli government refer to the event was given in bold too. That's the right way to proceed and it follows the same principle. Our rules are perfectly applied: per WP:NPoV, we give all the different points of view and the name under which an event is reminded follows the same rule.

::There aren't &quot;10/11 WP:RS sources that are given here above to prove this&quot;, there are 3. And NPOV is not the relevant policy here since we're not supposed to list every single name, we are supposed to list ''significant'' alternative names per ALTNAME.

*'''Yes''', since it's a reliably sourced alternative name.  People need to know they're at the right article when redirected there.

*'''Yes''': There have been plenty of RS presented above for the term &quot;Lydda Death March&quot; presented [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:1948_Palestinian_exodus_from_Lydda_and_Ramle&amp;oldid=713589538#death_march here]. The relevant policy is [[WP:ALTNAME]], which states {{tq|When this title is a name, significant alternative names for the topic should be mentioned in the article, usually in the first sentence or paragraph. These may include alternative spellings, longer or shorter forms, historical names, and significant names in other languages.}} One can also simply call it a &quot;death march&quot;, instead of &quot;Lydda death march&quot;, if required, though this is just nitpicking.

::The term they want to put in the article is Lydda Death March (a noun).
