The '''Special Air Service Regiment''', officially abbreviated '''SASR''' though commonly known as the '''SAS''', is a [[special forces]] unit of the [[Australian Army]]. Formed in 1957, it was originally modelled on the [[Special Air Service|British SAS]] sharing the motto, &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;. The regiment is based at [[Campbell Barracks (Australia)|Campbell Barracks]], in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]], a suburb of [[Perth, Western Australia]], and is a direct command unit of the [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]]. It has taken part in operations in [[Military history of Australia during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation|Borneo]], [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Operation Solace|Somalia]], [[International Force East Timor|East Timor]], [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Operation Slipper|Afghanistan]], as well as many other peacekeeping missions. The SASR also provides a counter-terrorist capability, and has been involved in a number of domestic security operations.

==Role==

===Tasks and capabilities===
A direct command unit of [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]],{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=338}} the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) is a special forces unit of the [[Australian Army]] and &quot;is tasked to provide special-operations capabilities in support of the Australian Defence Force. This includes providing unique capabilities to support sensitive strategic operations, special recovery operations, advisory and training assistance, special reconnaissance, precision strike and direct action&quot;.&lt;ref name=AustArmy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Who-we-are/Divisions-and-Brigades/Special-Operations-Command/Special-Air-Service-Regiment |title=Special Air Service Regiment |publisher=Australian Army |work=Who We Are: Divisions and Brigades – Special Operations Command |accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SASR is primarily structured to conduct covert long-range reconnaissance and surveillance in small teams in enemy-controlled territory, while commando units are utilised to conduct raids in larger groups.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=197}}{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=432}} In addition to warfighting during conventional conflicts, the regiment is also tasked with maintaining a specialist counter-terrorist capability.&lt;ref name=AustArmy/&gt; Other capabilities include training local or indigenous forces, recovery of Australian citizens and humanitarian assistance.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=197}} The SASR is also trained in [[counter-insurgency]] operations.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=13}}

===Warfighting and special reconnaissance===
In the long-range [[reconnaissance]] role, the SASR typically operates in small [[patrol]]s of between five and six operators with the task of infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] on enemy activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including [[air support|air strikes]] to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, standard [[parachute]] or [[High-altitude military parachuting|HALO]]), land (on foot or by vehicle) or sea (including by [[submarine]], small boats, canoes or closed-circuit breathing apparatus) and have proven capable of covering large distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=197}}{{sfn|Micheletti|2003|p=133}} SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=13}}

===Counter-terrorism and special recovery===
One of the primary roles of the regiment is to provide a counter-terrorist capability,{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=507}} with an element of the SASR designated as the [[Tactical Assault Group|Tactical Assault Group (West)]] to respond to domestic incidents on the west coast of Australia and also for international operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=Brigadier Mike Hannan|title=Media Briefing Australia's Commitment to the International Coalition Against Terrorism (MECC 668/02)|url=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20150625102229/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=2096|publisher=Department of Defence|date=21 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first=Robert|url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/HillSpeechTpl.cfm?CurrentId=3845|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315195834/http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/HillSpeechtpl.cfm?CurrentId=3845|title=Australia's Response to Terrorism|publisher=Department of Defence|date=25 May 2004|archivedate=15 March 2011|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAG (West) maintains a short-notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of state/territory and federal [[Police tactical group|Police Tactical Groups]]. Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=12}} A capability to board ships whilst underway and off-shore oil platforms is also maintained.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=429}} TAG (West) is kept at high readiness for a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=433}} The [[2nd Commando Regiment (Australia)|2nd Commando Regiment]] provides Tactical Assault Group (East) to respond to domestic incidents on the east coast of Australia.{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=175}}

==History==
[[File:Qld SASR Association 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the Queensland branch of the Australian Special Air Service association during the 2007 ANZAC Day march in Brisbane]]

===Early years===
The SASR draws on the experiences of [[Z Special Unit]], [[M Special Unit]], the [[Australian commandos|Independent Companies]] and the [[Coastwatchers]] which operated in the [[South West Pacific Area]] against the Japanese during [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=19–35}} These units had been disbanded soon after the war as part of the [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation of the Australian military]];{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=27}} however, after observing the operations of the British [[Special Air Service]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] in the 1950s the Australian Army decided to raise its own SAS unit.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=23}} The 1st Special Air Service Company was established on 25 July 1957 at [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]], a suburb of [[Perth, Western Australia]], with a strength of 16 officers and 144 other ranks.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=36–40}} In 1960, the company became part of the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] (RAR) and was given the responsibility for [[commando]] and [[special forces]] operations.{{sfn|Shortt|McBride|1981|p=22}} As part of the [[Pentropic organisation|pentropic]] organisation adopted by the Australian Army at the time, the regiment's primary wartime role was divisional-level reconnaissance.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=506}} On 20 August 1964, the SAS gained regimental status and was expanded to two [[sabre squadron]]s and a headquarters, severing the link with the RAR.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=70}} The raising of a third squadron was approved on 30 April 1965 as part of an overall expansion of the Australian Army.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=140}}

===Borneo===
{{See also|Military history of Australia during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation}}
The SASR first saw action in 1965 as part of the British Commonwealth force stationed in north [[Borneo]] during the [[Indonesian Confrontation]]. The SASR [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]]s operated alongside their British and [[New Zealand Special Air Service|New Zealand]] counterparts in operations aimed at stopping Indonesian infiltration into [[Malaysia]], taking part in [[Operation Claret]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=78–83}} 1 Squadron conducted reconnaissance patrols in Sarawak from February to July 1965, and cross-border operations between May and July.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=46–82}} They suffered their first fatality on 2 June when a soldier was gored by an elephant.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=68–71}} 1 Squadron completed operations on 1 August and returned to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21856indonesian_confrontation.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718205405/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21856indonesian_confrontation.asp|title=1st Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment|work=Confrontation, 1963–1966 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Borneo) units |publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=16 May 2014|archivedate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 Squadron arrived in Borneo in January 1966 for a four-month deployment, and despite the suspension of Claret operations it also conducted reconnaissance patrols and cross-border operations, undertaking a total of 45 patrols on both sides of the border.{{sfn|Dennis|Grey|1996|p=307}} On 19 March two soldiers drowned during a river crossing.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=158}} On 21 July, 2 Squadron was relieved by a British SAS squadron and returned to Australia in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21858indonesian_confrontation.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060629/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21858indonesian_confrontation.asp|title=2nd Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment|work=Confrontation, 1963–1966 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Borneo) units |publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=16 May 2014|archivedate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite often being deployed in the reconnaissance role, the SASR killed at least 20 Indonesian soldiers in a series of ambushes and contacts. Three SASR soldiers were killed.{{sfn|Horner|1989|pp=60–169}} These operations mostly occurred in secret, and were never admitted during the war.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=154}}

===Vietnam===

[[File:Australian SAS patrol Operation Coburg SVN 1968 (AWM P01979010).jpg|thumb|200px|right|An SASR patrol during [[Operation Coburg]], South Vietnam 1968.]]
Based in [[Nui Dat]] the SASR was responsible for providing intelligence to both the [[1st Australian Task Force]] (1 ATF) and US forces, operating throughout [[Phuoc Tuy Province]] as well as [[Bien Hoa Province|Bien Hoa]], [[Long Khanh Province|Long Khanh]] and [[Binh Tuy Province|Binh Tuy]] provinces. From 1966 SASR squadrons rotated through Vietnam on year-long deployments, with each of the three Sabre Squadrons completing two tours before the last squadron was withdrawn in 1971. Missions included medium range reconnaissance patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21856vietnam.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203061450/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21856vietnam.asp|title=1st Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment|work=Vietnam War, 1962–1972 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=3 May 2014|archivedate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21858vietnam.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503121607/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21858vietnam.asp|title=2nd Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment|work=Vietnam War, 1962–1972 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=3 May 2014|archivedate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21859vietnam.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503121701/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_21859vietnam.asp|title=3rd Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment|work=Vietnam War, 1962–1972 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=3 May 2014|archivedate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=348}} Operating in small groups of four to six men they moved slower than conventional infantry through jungle or bushland and were heavily armed, employing a high rate of fire to simulate a larger force on contact and to support their withdrawal. The primary method of deployment was by helicopter,{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=348}} with the SASR working closely with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF]] which regularly provided rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree top height.{{sfn|Stephens|2001|pp=265–268}} On occasion SASR patrols would also be deployed by [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M-113]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carriers]] (APCs) with a method devised to deceive the Viet Cong as to their insertion and the location of their drop-off point despite the noise they made moving through the jungle.{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=131}} An operational parachute jump was also undertaken.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=343–344}}{{refn|3 Squadron made an operational parachute jump {{convert|5|km|mi}} north west of [[Xuyen Moc]] on {{nowrap|15–16 December 1969}}, codenamed Operation Stirling.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=343–344}}|group=Note}}

A fourth squadron was raised in mid-1966, but was later disbanded in April 1967.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=140 and 227}} The SASR operated closely with the New Zealand SAS, with a [[troop]] being attached to each Australian squadron from late 1968.{{sfn|Crosby|2009|p=195}} Completing its final tour in October 1971, 2 Squadron was disbanded on return to Australia, with Training Squadron raised in its place.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=24}} During its time in Vietnam the SASR proved highly successful, with members of the regiment known to the [[Viet Cong]] as ''Ma Rung'' or &quot;phantoms of the jungle&quot; due to their stealth.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=234}} In a six-year period the Australian and New Zealand SAS in Vietnam conducted nearly 1,200 patrols{{sfn|Walters|2006|p=11}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Viet Cong, including 492 killed, 106 possibly killed, 47 wounded, 10 possibly wounded and 11 prisoners captured. Their own losses totalled one killed in action, one died of wounds, three accidentally killed, one missing and one death from illness. Twenty-eight men were wounded. During the period of its deployment 580 men served in the SASR in Vietnam.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=390–391}} The remains of the last Australian soldier who went missing in action in 1969 after falling into the jungle during a suspended rope extraction were found in August 2008.{{sfn|Nicholson|2008|p=5}} Australian SASR personnel also worked with [[US Army Special Forces]] in Vietnam, and provided instructors to the MACV Recondo School, and then to the [[LRRP]] Training Wing at the [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam|AATTV]]-operated Van Kiep Training Centre from 1967.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=23}} Some members of the regiment also served with [[MACV-SOG]] units, with soldiers often serving on exchange with American Special Forces.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=399}}

===Defence of Australia and counter-terrorism===
The Australian withdrawal from Vietnam brought to an end the doctrine of 'forward defence' through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military's new focus was on the [[Defence of Australia Policy|defence of continental Australia]] against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR took the lead in developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in [[Northern Australia]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=393}} It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three [[Regional Force Surveillance Units]] in the early 1980s trained by the SASR.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=415–417}} In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north [[Irian Jaya]] with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the [[Free Papua Movement|OPM independence movement]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=413–414}} During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from [[Subic Bay]] on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, as well as a number of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=417}} Meanwhile, following the [[Sydney Hilton bombing]] in February 1978, the SASR was given responsibility for providing Australia's military counter-terrorism response force,{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=423}} for which 2 Squadron was raised again in 1982.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=24}} In addition to being able to respond to terrorist attacks in Australian cities, the SASR counter-terrorism unit was required to develop a capability to board ships underway and off-shore oil platforms.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=429}} In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of [[Operation Morris Dance]], but did not leave Australia.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|p=286}} The regiment was not involved in operations during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice,{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=453}} while other elements remained on high alert to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.{{sfn|Horner|1992|p=175}}

===Peacekeeping===
The first SASR units to deploy on active service after the [[Vietnam War]] did so as part of Australian [[peacekeeping]] deployments. Small numbers of SASR personnel were involved in [[Operation Habitat]] in Turkey and Northern Iraq as medics to assist Kurdish refugees between May and June 1991.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=455}} Personnel were also provided by the regiment as part of the Australian contribution to the UN Special Commission established to oversee the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction between 1991 and 2000. SASR medics deployed with some of the weapons inspection teams, and at times were also employed as drivers and for &quot;personal protection&quot; tasks.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=455}}{{sfn|Horner|Connor|2014|pp=485–499}} Several SASR signallers from 152 Signal Squadron also deployed to the [[Western Sahara]] between September 1991 and May 1994 as part of the Australian contingent there.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=455}} Contrary to some reports, the SASR did not provide a security team for service in Cambodia although some SASR-qualified signals sergeants from 152 Signal Squadron were deployed as part of the Australian military contribution to the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) and [[FCU UNTAC|Force Communications Unit]] between 1991 and 1993.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=456}} A small number of members of the regiment served on exchange with the British SAS and [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS) in Bosnia in the early 1990s, including a sergeant who commanded an SBS detachment in April 1993.{{sfn|Horner|Connor|2014|p=367}}

In April 1994, a 10-man SASR team from J Troop was attached to Australian forces in [[Operation Solace|Somalia]] to provide an elite response, VIP protection and force protection to the Australian Service Contingent in [[Mogadishu]]. Known as &quot;the Gerbils&quot;, the small team operated from Toyota Landcruisers and Datsun utility vehicles and two M-113 APCs. They were subsequently involved in a number of actions, including an incident on 21 May when they were flown to the scene of a downed Canadian civilian helicopter {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Mogadishu to protect the crew, and another on 16 August when they were involved in a skirmish during a convoy which resulted in two Somalis being killed after one of them aimed an AK-47 at the Australians. They returned to Australia in November 1994.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=456–462}} SASR-qualified medical sergeants were also deployed as part of the contribution to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]], some of whom were present during the [[Kibeho Massacre]] in April 1995, for which one SASR soldier and two other Australians were awarded the [[Medal of Gallantry]] for their actions.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=463}} In addition, individual members of the SASR have been attached to a wide range of Australian peacekeeping deployments as observers, including in Kashmir, Lebanon and in the [[Multinational Force and Observers|Sinai]].{{sfn|Wright|2003|p=25}}

===Black Hawk accident===
Deaths during training accidents make up the majority of the SASR's fatalities. The worst accident in the regiment's history occurred on the evening of 12 June 1996 when two [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|S-70-A9 Black Hawk]] [[helicopter]]s from the [[5th Aviation Regiment (Australia)|5th Aviation Regiment]] carrying SASR troopers collided during a live-fire counter-terrorism/special-recovery operation exercise at [[Fire support base|Fire Support Base]] Barbara in the High Range Training Area near [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|author1=Jackson, Liz (Reporter)|author2=Janine Cohen (Producer)|author3=Jacquelyn Hole (Researcher)|date=24 March 1997|title=Where Does the Buck Stop?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/s72779.htm|medium=Television production|work=Four Corners|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity was part of Exercise Day Rotor 96 and took place on the second day of the exercise, sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use [[night vision goggles]].{{sfn|McLucas|2003|p=43}} Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the [[landing zone]], one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the [[tail rotor]] of another helicopter. One Black Hawk crashed immediately killing 12 personnel on board, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames, killing six. Crash survivors, soldiers from the other helicopters and exercise staff risked the flames and exploding ammunition to rescue their comrades and retrieve the bodies of the dead.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=468}} Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment lost their lives in the accident. Fourteen personnel were later officially recognised for their part in the rescue and evacuation operation.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=468–469}}

===Cambodia and Bougainville===
In July 1997 an eight-man SASR team deployed at short notice to [[RMAF Butterworth|Butterworth]] in Malaysia to provide close protection and communications to the Australian ambassador and embassy staff in Cambodia if required, in preparation for the evacuation of Australian nationals in the wake of civil unrest which occurred following a [[1997 clashes in Cambodia|coup]] in that country. The evacuation operation was subsequently completed successfully, with RAAF C-130s supported by [[Airfield Defence Guards]] and other military personnel evacuating 455 Australians and other nationals from Cambodia as part of Operation Vista.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=474}}{{sfn|Horner|Connor|2014|pp=254–258}} Later, following the agreement of a truce in October 1997 which ended the conflict in [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], Australian personnel were deployed as part of the New Zealand-led Truce Monitoring Group, with an SASR officer being included in the reconnaissance party and later serving on its headquarters. In April 1998, Australia took over leadership of the mission, which was renamed the Peace Monitoring Group. Numerous SASR personnel served in Bougainville over a four-year period as part of [[Operation Bel Isi]], both in headquarters positions and as part of the monitoring teams.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=474}}

===Kuwait===
In 1998, the SASR made its first squadron-strength deployment since Vietnam when 1 Squadron, with an attached New Zealand SAS troop, was deployed to [[Kuwait]] in February as part of the American-led [[Operation Desert Thunder]]. The force, known as Anzac Special Operations Force (ANZAC SOF), was fully integrated, with the New Zealanders providing the squadron's third troop. While the crisis was resolved peacefully, if military action had been taken the SASR would have been used in the [[Combat Search and Rescue]] (CSAR) role to recover aircrew shot down by Iraqi air defences. The force returned to Australia in June 1998. Regardless, the operation represented the first time that SASR tactical headquarters had been deployed outside of Australia.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=474–477}}

===East Timor===
The SASR played a key role in the Australian-led [[INTERFET|international peacekeeping force]] (INTERFET) in [[East Timor]] between September 1999 and February 2000.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=483}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11952.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023064748/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11952.asp|title=Special Air Service Regiment|work=Australian Military Units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=24 May 2014|archivedate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially involved in the RAAF evacuation of Australian, UN personnel and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|voted for independence]] from Indonesia,{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=483–489}} the SASR was reported to have subsequently been involved in intelligence gathering tasks prior to the landings,{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|pp=24–25}} and provided the initial forces to secure the point of entry at the [[Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport|airport]] and seaport in [[Dili]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=492–493}} 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, then made up INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR).{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=490}} The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days of the intervention in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and ears of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|pp=24–25}} During operations in East Timor the SASR was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at [[Battle of Aidabasalala|Aidabasalala]] on 16 October 1999.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|pp=295–296}} Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=25}} 3 Squadron was later awarded a [[Meritorious Unit Citation]] on 25 March 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1131101&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|title=MUC – 3SQN SASR|accessdate=7 June 2010|work=It's an Honour|publisher=Australian Government|date=25 March 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraqhonour&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au:80/Hilltpl.cfm?CurrentId=3897|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20040906184631/http://www.minister.defence.gov.au:80/Hilltpl.cfm?CurrentId=3897|title=Special Forces receive Iraq Honours (MIN108/04)|author=Senator Robert Hill, Minister of Defence|publisher=Department of Defence|date=9 June 2004|archivedate=7 September 2004|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=510–511}}

===Domestic security and controversy===
The regiment formed a key element of [[Joint Task Force Gold|the security force]] in place for the [[Sydney Olympic Games]] in 2000, and in the lead-up to the event the regiment underwent a period of modernisation, acquiring new equipment and capabilities, including the ability to respond to chemical, biological and radiological threats, as well as developing techniques for the clandestine boarding of moving ships at night. During the Games two SASR squadrons were available for counter-terrorist operations, with one designated to respond to incidents in Sydney and Canberra, while the other was on standby for incidents elsewhere.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=513–514}} The domestic security role increased in prominence after the terrorist attacks in the United States on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], and the SASR has since formed part of the security force for events such as the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games]], and other international events.{{sfn|Head|2009|pp=11–12}} The SASR maintains TAG (West) to respond to incidents on the west coast of Australia.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

In April 2001 the fishing vessel ''[[Geraldton#Scuba Diving and Snorkelling|South Tomi]]'' was detected poaching [[Patagonian toothfish]] near [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard and McDonald Islands]] in the [[Southern Ocean]]. Following a {{convert|6,100|km|mi|adj=on}} pursuit, the Togo-flagged vessel was boarded by an SASR troop off the southern tip of Africa.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=122}} In August 2001, the SASR was involved in the [[Tampa affair]] when its counter-terrorist squadron was ordered to [[Christmas Island]] and to board the [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']] once it illegally entered Australian waters. While the members of the SASR involved did what they could to improve conditions on the ''Tampa'', the use of an elite military unit to prevent asylum seekers landing in Australia was not supported by all members of the regiment and remains controversial.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=139}} Less controversial was the SASR's involvement in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the [[Pong Su|MV ''Pong Su'']]—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 April 2003 .{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=118 and 122}}{{sfn|Mickelburough|2003|p=1}}{{refn|Commanded by CO 4 RAR (Cdo), the operation involved members of TAG (West), TAG (East) and the Incident Response Regiment.{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=287}}|group=Note}}

===Afghanistan===
{{main article|Operation Slipper}}
In October 2001, the Australian government announced that it was sending a special forces task group built around an SASR squadron to participate in the campaign against [[al-Qaeda]] and the Taliban in Afghanistan designated [[Operation Slipper]]. After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=145–152}} The SASR's main role in Afghanistan was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance of al-Qaeda and [[Taliban]] positions, activities and capabilities. SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=x–xi}} After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around [[Kandahar]] and into the [[Helmand River|Helmand Valley]] near the Iranian-border.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=153–158}} On 16 February 2002 Sergeant [[Andrew Russell (Australian soldier)|Andrew Russell]] was killed when the [[Long Range Patrol Vehicle]] (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a [[land mine]] during an operation in the Helmand Valley. Two other soldiers were wounded in the incident.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=181–182}} Later the SASR operated under command of Task Force 64.{{sfn|Neville|2008|p=30}}

The SASR then moved to eastern Afghanistan where it played a key role in [[Operation Anaconda]] in March 2002.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=196}} During the operation SASR teams were to provide on-location, in-depth operational intelligence and reconnaissance after they infiltrated the Shahi-Kot Valley ten days prior to the operation, and also saved the lives of 24 soldiers of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|US 75th Ranger Regiment]] after their helicopter was shot down, by providing sniper overwatch and guiding in precise air strikes to end the enemy advance as they attempted to overrun the isolated Americans. Up to 300 al Qaeda fighters were later estimated to have been killed as a result of the airstrikes they called-in.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=202}} Two SASR advisory and liaison officers were attached with the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|US 10th Mountain Division]] to help plan the division's air assault operations, and were subsequently involved in heavy fighting after the unit they were with became pinned down and took a number of casualties. Supported by heavy close air support they were evacuated by helicopter that evening.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=196–202}}

Four days into the operation, SASR elements identified a potential escape route for the al-Qaeda leadership. Other coalition special forces had attempted to establish observation posts, but had quickly been discovered by shepherds or villagers. The Australians inserted a patrol undetected to monitor the escape route. From more than {{convert|1,200|m|yd}} high on a mountain, the patrol spotted a group of al-Qaeda figures dressed in Russian camouflage and wearing black balaclavas. They carried more advanced weapons than normal insurgents, and appeared to be guarding a white-robed older man with a cane as they fled the battlefield. US intelligence at first believed it was [[Osama bin Laden]] but later revised the identification to his second-in-command, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]]. An airstrike was called in; however, there was later doubt about whether it was successful.{{sfn|Callinan|2005|p=}} Australian forces later uncovered a number of arms caches and destroyed an anti-aircraft piece, while other elements were tasked with screening possible escape routes to the south and killed a number of fighters as they attempted to withdraw.{{sfn|Callinan|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Pugliese|2003|p=92}} The initial task group was replaced by another squadron in March and April 2002, while a third squadron rotated into Afghanistan in August 2002.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|p=xi}} The SASR withdrew from Afghanistan in November 2002 after all three sabre squadrons had served in the country.{{sfn|Neville|2008|pp=29–30}}

A Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was deployed to Afghanistan in August or September 2005, operating in the southern province of [[Uruzgan Province|Uruzgan]]. The SFTG consisted of elements from the SASR, [[4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|4 RAR (Commando)]], the [[Incident Response Regiment]] (IRR) and logistic support personnel.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=337}} Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were deployed to Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=9}} A forward operating base was subsequently established at [[Tarin Kowt]].{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=337}} This task group was withdrawn in September 2006, after a year of operations working closely with special forces from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days, involved in 139 contacts, and sustained 11 soldiers wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author1=Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Chief of Defence Force|author2=Major General Michael Hindmarsh|title=SOCAUST Media Briefing Post OP Slipper Transcript (MECC 60927/06)|url=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20140802172804/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/speechtpl.cfm?CurrentId=6033|publisher=Department of Defence|date=27 September 2006|archivedate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Walters|2006|p=11}}{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=338}} The SFTG was replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=9}}

===Iraq===
{{main article|Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq}}
The SASR provided the majority of the ground-force element of the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, known as [[Operation Falconer]], moving in quickly and successfully, thus enhancing Australia's standing amongst its allies.{{sfn|Sheridan|2007|p=19}} The Australian Special Forces Task Group was built around 1 Squadron, with a platoon from the 4 RAR (Commando) and a troop from the IRR available to support the SASR. 1 Squadron operated in western Iraq where it was successful in securing its area of operations.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=250–325}} Elements of the SAS Squadron crossed the Iraqi border on the night of 19 March by vehicle, penetrating {{convert|30|km|mi}} before being engaged in one of the first actions of the war. Other patrols were inserted by helicopter more {{convert|600|km|mi}} from their staging areas and subsequently fought a number of actions over the following month. Australian patrols were the closest coalition elements to Baghdad for a number of days, observing key roads and facilities. Towards the conclusion of the 42-day campaign the SAS secured the huge but undefended [[Al Asad|Al Asad air base]], approximately {{convert|200|km|mi}} west of Baghdad, capturing more than 50 aircraft.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=xi–xii}}{{sfn|Department of Defence|2004|pp=21–26}} 1 Squadron was withdrawn from Iraq without replacement shortly after the end of the war,{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|p=xii}} and was subsequently awarded a [[Unit Citation for Gallantry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraqhonour&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=507}}

In March 2012, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that the fourth sabre squadron had been reraised in 2005 and that for many years it had been carrying out special recovery planning, gathering intelligence in Africa, specifically [[Zimbabwe]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Kenya]], to develop plans in case Australian civilians needed to be rescued from a hostile environment.{{sfn|Epstein|Welch|2012|p=1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inquiry into recogition of Australian Defence Force Service for Special Air Service Counter Terrorist and Special Recovery Duties|journal=Defence Honours &amp; Awards Tribunal|date=22 December 2009|page=12|url=https://defence-honours-tribunal.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/SASR-Final-Report-Public-Release.pdf|accessdate=16 August 2016|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Squadron was reported to be working closely with the [[Swan Island (Victoria)|Swan Island]] based ASIS.

Each sabre squadron is approximately 90-strong,{{sfn|Micheletti|2003|p=133}} and is divided into three troops (Water Troop, Free-Fall Troop and Land Troop).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janes.ihs.com|title=Jane's Amphibious and Special Forces – Australia Special Forces (Land)|date=22 April 2014|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A troop comprises four patrols with five or six operators in each patrol,{{sfn|Lee|2007|p=95}} and is commanded by a [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] with each patrol commanded by a [[sergeant]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=402–403}} For surveillance operations the SASR usually operates in patrols; however, for CT operations it usually employs larger force elements.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=486}} Support personnel include signallers, mechanics and technicians, medical staff, storemen, drivers, caterers and various specialists.{{sfn|Micheletti|2003|p=133}} It was reported in 2012 that six female soldiers were being trained in the United States.{{sfn|Epstein|Welch|2012|p=1}} As of 2003, 152 Signal Squadron comprised four troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=The Honorable Fran Bailey, MP Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence|title=More Than $14 Million Defence Funding for Western Australia in 2003–04 Budget|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/minister/14tpl.cfm?CurrentId=2740|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=12 June 2014|date=13 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dogs in warfare|Military dogs]], designated Special Operations Military Working Dog (SOMWD), have been members of the SASR since 2005, seeing service in Afghanistan and have their own memorial.{{sfn|Army: The Soldier's Newspaper|2015|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two brave best friends will be missed|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/defencenews/stories/2012/aug/0828a.htm|website=Defence News|publisher=28 August 2012|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Army: The Soldier's Newspaper|2013|p=4}}

While the SASR is a regular army unit, it also has a pool of [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] personnel. These soldiers are former regular Army members of the SASR or specialists.{{sfn|Australian Army|2014|p=37}}

==Uniform and equipment==
The standard dress of the regiment is the new [[Australian Multicam Camouflage Uniform|Multicam]]-design camouflage which became standard issue to special forces troops in 2012, and is now being introduced to all other Australian Army soldiers in Afghanistan and will eventually become the standard Operational Combat Uniform (OCU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Defence|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/defencenews/stories/2010/Nov/1119.htm|title=New Combat Uniform Makes Troops Job Easier|work=Defence News|date=19 November 2010|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although SASR parade, working and field uniforms are generally the same as those used by the rest of the Australian Army, special uniforms—including black coveralls—are used depending on the tactical situation.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=13}} Qualified SASR members wear a sandy-coloured [[beret]] with a metal, gold and silver badge, depicting the sword [[Excalibur]], with flames issuing upwards from below the hilt, with a scroll across the front of blade inscribed with the regimental motto &quot;[[Who Dares Wins]]&quot;, on a black shield.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=133}}{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=23}}{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=134}}{{refn|The sandy-beret was adopted by the regiment in 1965, while prior to this the maroon airborne forces beret and badge of the Royal Australian Regiment was worn.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=134}}{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=260}}|group=Note}} This differs from the British Special Air Service, which wears a woven cloth cap badge of the same design.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=23}} SAS 'Ibis'-style [[Parachutist Badge (United Kingdom)#Special Forces|parachute wings]] (rounded at the bottom and straight on top) are worn on the right shoulder on general duty, ceremonial and mess dress uniforms only.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Davis|1983|p=67}}{{sfn|Jobson|2009|pp=182 and 186}}{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=260}} A garter blue [[lanyard]] is worn.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=199}} Members of the regiment often dispense with rank, use first names, and wear long hair and beards on operations or when in the field.{{sfn|Horsfield|2000|}}

Soldiers are armed with a variety of weapons systems depending on what the mission dictates. These include the [[M4 carbine|M4A1 carbine]] (designated as the M4A5 in Australia), which is used as their primary weapon.{{sfn|Masters|2012|p=3}} The shortened version of the M4, known as the [[Close Quarters Battle Receiver|Mk 18 CQBR]], is also used.{{sfn|Australian Defence Magazine|2009|p=}} The Heckler and Koch [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|MP5 submachine gun]] is used in the counter-terrorist role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.army.gov.au/Our-work/Equipment-and-clothing/Small-Arms/MP5 |title= MP5 9 millimetre |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Neville|2016|p=63 and 74}} Primary weapons are complemented with the two issued sidearms, the [[USP Tactical]] and the [[Glock|Glock 19]].{{sfn|Fennell|2009|p=137}} For medium to long range engagements the [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK417]],{{sfn|Farrell|2011|p=9}} [[SR-25]] marksman rifle,{{sfn|Farrell|2011|p=8}} and [[Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle]]{{sfn|Butterly|2011|}} are also used.

==Selection and training==
The SASR regiment has high personnel standards, and selection into the regiment is considered the most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army.{{sfn|Dodd|2007|p=21}} Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected for their ability to work in this environment, rather than as individuals.{{sfn|Walters|2006|p=11}} Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview.{{sfn|Army: The Soldier's Newspaper|2011|p=23}}{{sfn|MacKenzie|2006|p=}} About 64 percent of applicants pass this test.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2006|p=}} Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams.{{sfn|Heyer|Platz|2010|pp=18–19}}{{sfn|MacKenzie|2006|p=}} The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the [[Bindoon, Western Australia|Bindoon]] Training Centre.{{sfn|Heyer|Platz|2010|pp=18–19}} The third and fourth phases are conducted in the [[Stirling Range|Stirling Ranges]] with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food.{{sfn|Heyer|Platz|2010|pp=18–19}} Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection.{{sfn|Heyer|Platz|2010|pp=18–19}} These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle,{{sfn|Heyer|Platz|2010|pp=18–19}} during which they will complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret.{{sfn|Smith|2003|}} Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=17–18}} Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers.{{sfn|Walters|2006|p=11}} In 2010, a two-hour documentary ''SAS: The Search for Warriors'' was produced on the selection course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAS: The Search for Warriors|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/sas--the-search-for-the-warriors-2010/29896?stxt=|website=Screen Australia|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 1985, the documentary ''Battle for the Golden Road'', had also been produced on the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAS Australia [videorecording]: battle for the golden road / Guy Baskin. 1985, English, Video edition|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/29152737?selectedversion=NBD24989019|work=National Library of Australia|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Special Air Service Regiment Memorial in Canberra.jpg|thumb|The Special Air Service Regiment Memorial in Canberra commemorates the members of the unit killed in combat and training exercises]]

All members of the SASR are parachute qualified, and each member of a patrol has at least one specialisation, including medic, signaller, explosive expert or linguist.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=197}}{{sfn|Boer|2008|p=3}} Counter terrorist training includes close quarters battle (CQB), explosive entry, tubular assault (in vehicles such as in buses, trains and aircraft) and in high rise buildings, as well as room and building clearance.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=13}} This training is conducted in a range of advanced facilities, including electronic indoor and outdoor CQB ranges, outdoor sniper range, and urban training facilities at Swanbourne. Additional facilities include a special urban complex, vertical plunging range, method of entry house, and simulated oil rig and aircraft mock-ups in order to provide realistic training environments for potential operational scenarios.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=198–199}} SASR personnel also provide training in weapons handling to ASIS operatives at Swan Island in Victoria.{{sfn|Uhlmann|2014|}}{{sfn|Nicholson|2007|p=2}} Despite a possible [[reduction in rank]], SASR operators receive significant allowances, which make them among the highest-paid soldiers in the Australian Defence Force, with a trooper (equivalent to a [[Private (rank)|private]]) reportedly earning about $100,000 per annum in 2006.{{sfn|Walters|2006|p=11}}

The SASR maintains close links with special forces from the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansard&quot; /&gt; regularly participating in joint exercises and individual personnel exchange programs with the British SAS and SBS, as well as the New Zealand SAS, [[US Navy SEALs]] and [[United States Special Forces]]. The regiment also regularly conducts exercises with and trains soldiers from South East Asian nations, and participates in exercises with regional special forces.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|p=25}} From 1992 this has included close links with the Indonesian [[Kopassus]], a relationship which has at times been politically controversial.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=13}} Since its formation the SASR has lost more men in training than in combat, due to the nature of the training regime.{{sfn|Walters|2006|p=11}} In 2014, the regiment celebrated its 50th anniversary. During this period 48 soldiers have been killed during operations or in training accidents, while another 20 died in &quot;other circumstances&quot;. More than 200 have been wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-work/News-and-media/SASR-pays-tribute-to-barracks-namesake|title=SASR Pays Tribute To Barracks' Namesake|year=2014|publisher=Australian Army|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of those killed are recorded on a plaque on a memorial made of a large piece of granite outside the SASR headquarters at Campbell Barracks, known as &quot;The Rock&quot;.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=192}}
