==Untitled==
There is some doubt amongst Hungarian historians and genealogists as to who the two wives were.
Some research I have done strongly points to one of them being Helena de Hautville-Guiscard, who had been engaged to marry a King of the Greeks, but due to political expediency was declined and sent home to Sicily. The Pope was very annoyed at this behaviour, and when approached by Hungarian dukes concerned that Stephen seemed not to be interested in marrying and continuing his dynasty, he suggested a suitable wife for Stephen. However, the link between this and Helena seems to have no documentary proof.

==Ruler of Slavonia?==
According to Zsoldos' archontology (p. 41.), Stephen ruled [[Slavonia]] at the end of the reign of his father, King Coloman (presumably in 1114). [[User:Borsoka|Borsoka]], do you know any detailed data about this information? --[[User:Norden1990|Norden1990]] ([[User talk:Norden1990|talk]]) 11:45, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

:::Jé, tényleg. Köszönet. It is interesting. Zsoldos always sticks to the facts. I think this fact should be mentioned. I will cheque Zsoldos's reference (Diplomata Hungariae antiquissima....). [[User:Borsoka|Borsoka]] ([[User talk:Borsoka|talk]]) 14:12, 6 January 2014 (UTC)
::::::I guess that Zsoldos refers to the same document which is mentioned in the article, but in the article it is dated to 1105. I am not sure, but for the time being it is the only logical approach (for me :) ). [[User:Borsoka|Borsoka]] ([[User talk:Borsoka|talk]]) 14:17, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

==Wives==
I read in László Markó's work (2006 edition, I know it's not exactly the best source for that), Stephen II married the daughter of [[Robert I of Capua]], however her first name is unknown. So, the name [[Cristiana of Capua|Cristiana]] might be a fiction (unreferenced article). And what about Stephen's alleged second wife? Is [[Adelaide of Riedenburg|she]] really a [[hoax]]? --[[User:Norden1990|Norden1990]] ([[User talk:Norden1990|talk]]) 11:45, 6 January 2014 (UTC)
:::I agree that her name is only an invention. I am sure that the second wife is only a hoax (Hungarian chronicles emphasize that Stephen did not want to marry), but this is my own view. [[User:Borsoka|Borsoka]] ([[User talk:Borsoka|talk]]) 14:15, 6 January 2014 (UTC)
::::Hi.  I reverted the edit by [[User:Borsoka|Borsoka]] regarding the wife being named Cristiana, solely on the basis that the edit included the link to Cristiana's wikipage.  Either we know the name was Cristiana, in which case the current verbiage should stand, or we don't, in which case her name (and the link to the wikipage) should both be removed.  [[User:Onel5969|Onel5969]] ([[User talk:Onel5969|talk]]) 12:31, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::::I opted for deleting the wikilink, since the article [[Cristiana of Capua]] is obviously OR. Her name is unknown. [[User:Borsoka|Borsoka]] ([[User talk:Borsoka|talk]]) 14:02, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

See [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cristiana of Capua and Adelaide of Riedenburg]].
::{{U|Kmicic}}, the only source of Stephen's marriage, the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', identifies his wife as a daughter of [[Robert Guiscard]] of Apulia. Modern historians say that the author of the chronicle was wrong, because her father was an other Norman ruler of South Italy, Robert of Capua. Why does Dworzaczek think that Stephen's wife was not a Southern Italian princess, but a German lady? In works dedicated especially to Stephen II or his age, there is no reference to this alternative view. Why do you think that it represents a significant POV?

::: I will answered in few days. [[User:Kmicic|Kmicic]] ([[User talk:Kmicic|talk]]) 20:56, 28 February 2016 (UTC)</text>
