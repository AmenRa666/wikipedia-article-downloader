== &quot;Bigotry&quot; section ==

I have some serious doubts as to the notability of this newly-added section, especially without citation.  He was (as far as I know) not known for being a bigot, so I really don't think that the fact that he happened to be a racist is of enough significance to warrant mention, let alone a whole section. -[[User:Elmer Clark|Elmer Clark]] 08:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
:Ok, as no one else has left any input, I'm going to go ahead and remove the section.  If anyone feels it should be reinserted, please leave your reasons here. -[[User:Elmer Clark|Elmer Clark]] 01:26, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

He's a notable person, let's include information that enlarges our picture of him. Should we also delete the years he attended school in Hawaii because it's not significant enough to warrant mention?
It would be worth including in an article about a famous president{{citation needed}}, for example, so I think it follows that it's worth including in this article. Regards,[[User:Richard L. Peterson|Rich]] 04:35, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

:OK, it definitely should not be there.  It claims his son was &quot;transformed into a hater of Jews and a Holocaust denier&quot; - [[Hiram Bingham IV]] famously helped Jews escape the Nazis.  This, plus the edits this guy made to Hiram IV's page, do not seem to be in good faith.  In fact, '''all''' his edits reference one website, he clearly has an agenda.  Besides the fact that simply &quot;being racist&quot; was a trait shared by many in his time period, and clearly had virtually no influence on his life, I have serious doubts as to whether it's true. -[[User:Elmer Clark|Elmer Clark]] 05:35, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

Elmer Clark is correct about someone having an agenda.  The owner of Webville.org is the owner of iSurvived.org, and from all the edits, presumably the user Webville.  The editor of iSurvived.org (Kalman Brattman) is presently the subject of a significant news story which outlines how the editor of the site (with his disturbing arrest record) has attempted to destroy the reputation of various Holocaust survivors.  

http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/tilove072006.html

the user Webville (who studied astronomy and doesn't seem qualified as a historian) whose only contributions to Wikipedia seem to be adding links to his site, which makes personal attacks on several survivors of the Holocaust.  He has a personal agenda, and apparently has been in some legal soup as a result.  The man can only cite his website as a source, all of the links he has been spamming wikipedia with should be removed considering his entire site is in question by professional historians and journalists.

: During his term as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories, Bingham was involved in a controversy regarding an alleged rape in Hawaii, in which he expressed some sentiments that would certainly be considered objectionable by modern standards.  See [[Thalia_Fortescue_Massie]] which discusses the episode though not mentioning Bingham's comments.  I wouldn't regard this episode as a major notable event in Bingham's life, but if we had to determine whether Bingham was a &quot;bigot&quot; or not one might want to take it into consideration.  On the whole, Bingham was considered a progressive, reasonable figure, at least within the continental United States. [[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] 01:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

== References section ==

Looks as though the formatting needs to be cleaned up; also, the end of reference no. 4 doesn't seem to make sense. (&quot;pages 34-35. and is known for discovering macu pichu&quot;)

== Archaeology section ==

In the last paragraph, concerning the artefacts agreement between Yale and Peru there are some discrepancies. It starts by saying the estimate is 40,000. Later is says the estimate was revised from 4,000 to 40,000 which may well be true but is awkwardly put. If the old estimate was 4,000, would not the agreement be for the 4,000 artefacts, not the 40,000? ([[User:Lcohalan|Lcohalan]] ([[User talk:Lcohalan|talk]]) 20:38, 12 November 2009 (UTC))

== Edit request from Kpaint, 27 April 2011 ==

{{edit semi-protected|answered=yes}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;Under the Hiram Bingham III header &quot;Marriage and family&quot; add the following paragraph:

In 2009 grandson Robert Kim Bingham, Sr. published a book titled ''COURAGEOUS DISSENT: How Harry Bingham Defied His Government to Save Lives,'' about WWII rescuer Hiram Bingham IV, son of Hiram Bingham III, in Marseille during 1940-1941. Ref. http://pages.cthome.net/WWIIHERO/


&lt;!-- End request --&gt;

:[[File:Red information icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] '''Not done:'''&lt;!-- Template:ESp --&gt; that book is about a [[Hiram Bingham IV|different Bingham]]. â€” [[User:Bility|Bility]] ([[User talk:Bility|talk]]) 17:23, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

== Inconsistencies need special attention ==

Your article opens up with saying he was an academic, explorer, treasure hunter and politician from the United States.   As ambiguous as it sounds, for an article that should be providing information and not more confusion, it needs to be worded to say that he was an explorer, treasure hunter, etc.   And then you can explain from where he got his education, because in the next paragraph it talks about him being born in Honolulu.  So if he was born in the Kingdom of Hawai'i, and was educated there by a top school, and then mentioned that he went to the United States at a later age, how can he be from a place that he went to from another place?  Do we have kids writing these articles? [[User:Mamoahina|Mamoahina]] ([[User talk:Mamoahina|talk]]) 12:01, 4 February 2012 (UTC)

:Your last sentence is disrespectful. Please avoid such statements in future. Respect is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia. Hiram Bingham is notable for being &quot;an academic, explorer, treasure hunter, and politician from the United States&quot;, he is not notable for being educated in Hawai'i. The article does mention his birth and early education there but his fame comes from his work after living in Hawai'i. Note, that his higher degrees and employment was '''from''' &quot;America&quot; universites, particularly Yale.  [[User:Dger|Dger]] ([[User talk:Dger|talk]]) 19:50, 17 January 2014 (UTC)

== Brief involvement in Bonus Army incident ==
During the Bonus Army incident in Washington DC, Hiram Bingham was among a crowd of civil service employees trampled by cavalry. (See, e.g. William Manchester's The Glory and the Dream [http://books.google.com/books?id=1TYVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24&amp;lpg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Among+those+trampled+was+Senator+Hiram+Bingham+of+Connecticut%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2x4LhzheE-&amp;sig=ALpHKbR7tpvQz0zqgaArKNmBi90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LMY9U9foE5GM7AbpyYGYCA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Maybe add a brief sentence on it?) [[Special:Contributions/140.180.244.165|140.180.244.165]] ([[User talk:140.180.244.165|talk]]) 20:45, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

But better add the whole story: 
In accordance with the UNSAAC-Yale agreement, Yale began shipping its collection of artifacts from Machu Picchu in March 2011. The remaining artifacts were transported to Peru in December 2011 and November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yale.edu/2015/06/04/peru-yale-partnership-future-machu-picchu-artifacts]
