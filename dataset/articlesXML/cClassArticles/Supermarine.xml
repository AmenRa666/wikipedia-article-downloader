'''Supermarine''' was a British aircraft manufacturer that produced, among the others, a range of seaplanes and the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter.

==History==
[[Noel Pemberton Billing]] set up a company, '''Pemberton-Billing Ltd''', in 1913 to produce sea-going aircraft. Its [[Telegraphy|telegraphic]] address, used for sending telegrams and cables to the company, was; ''Supermarine, Southampton''. It produced a couple of prototypes using quadruplane designs to shoot down [[zeppelin]]s, the Supermarine P.B.29 and the [[Supermarine Nighthawk]]. The aircraft were fitted with the [[recoilless rifle|recoilless]] Davis gun and the Nighthawk had a separate powerplant to power a [[searchlight]].&lt;ref name=worstaircraft&gt;The World's Worst Aircraft James Gilbert ISBN 0-340-21824-X&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon election as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1916 Pemberton-Billing sold the company to his factory manager and longtime associate [[Hubert Scott-Paine]] who renamed the company '''Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd'''. The company became famous for its successes in the [[Schneider Trophy]] for seaplanes, especially the three wins in a row of 1927, 1929 and 1931.

In 1928 [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] took over Supermarine as '''Supermarine Aviation Works (Vickers) Ltd''' and in 1938 all Vickers-Armstrongs aviation interests were reorganised to become '''Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd''', although Supermarine continued to design, build and trade under its own name. The phrase '''Vickers Supermarine''' was applied to the aircraft.
 
The first Supermarine landplane design to go into production was the famous and successful [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]. The earlier [[Hawker Hurricane]] and the Spitfire were the mainstay of [[RAF Fighter Command]] fighter aircraft which fought off the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing raids with fighter escorts during the [[Battle of Britain]] in the summer of 1940. While the Hurricane was available in larger numbers and consequently played a larger role, the new Spitfire caught the popular imagination and became the aircraft associated with the battle. It went on to play a major part in the remainder of the war, in a number of variants and marks, and it was the only allied fighter aircraft to be in production through the entirety of World War Two.

Other planes from World War II include the [[Supermarine Seafire|Seafire]] (a naval version of the Spitfire). Supermarine also developed the [[Supermarine Spiteful|Spiteful]] and [[Supermarine Seafang|Seafang]], the successors of the Spitfire and Seafire, respectively, and the [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] flying boat.

The Supermarine main works was in [[Woolston, Southampton]] which led to the city being heavily bombed in 1940. This curtailed work on their first heavy bomber design, the [[Supermarine B.12/36]] which was replaced by the [[Short Stirling]].

After the end of World War Two, the Supermarine division built the [[Royal Navy]]'s first jet fighter, the [[Supermarine Attacker|Attacker]], developed from the final Spitfire type. It served front line squadrons aboard aircraft carriers and RNVR squadrons at shore bases. The Attacker was followed by the more advanced [[Supermarine Swift|Swift]] which served in the fighter and photo-reconnaissance roles. 
The last of the Supermarine aircraft was the [[Supermarine Scimitar|Scimitar]].

In the shakeup of British aircraft manufacturing, Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) became a part of the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] and the individual manufacturing heritage names were lost. [[Northshore Marine Motor Yachts]] now builds a range of [[motorboat]]s under the Supermarine name in [[Chichester]], [[Portsmouth]], England.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The name is also used for Spitfire replicas made by an Australian company in Cisco, Texas.
