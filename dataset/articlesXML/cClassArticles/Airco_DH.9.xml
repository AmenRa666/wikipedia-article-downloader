The '''Airco DH.9''' (from [[Geoffrey de Havilland|de Havilland]] 9) - also known after 1920 as the '''de Havilland DH.9''' - was a [[United Kingdom|British]] bomber used in the [[World War I|First World War]].  A single-engined [[biplane]], it was a development of [[Airco]]'s earlier, highly successful [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]] and was ordered in very large numbers for Britain's [[Royal Flying Corps]] and [[Royal Air Force]].

Its engine was unreliable, and failed to provide the expected power, giving the DH.9 poorer performance than the aircraft it was meant to replace, resulting in heavy losses, particularly over the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. The subsequently-developed [[Airco DH.9A|DH.9A]] had a more powerful and reliable American [[Liberty L-12]] engine.

==Design and development==
The DH.9 was designed by [[Geoffrey de Havilland|de Havilland]] for the [[Airco|Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] in 1916 as a successor to the [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]]. It used the wings and [[Empennage|tail unit]] of the DH.4 but had a new [[fuselage]]. This enabled the [[Aviator|pilot]] to sit closer to the [[Air gunner|gunner/observer]] and away from the [[Piston engine|engine]] and fuel tank. The other major change from the DH.4 was the choice of the promising new [[Beardmore Halford Pullinger|BHP/Galloway]] ''Adriatic'' engine, which was predicted to produce 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW) and so give the new aircraft adequate performance to match enemy fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson DHp97&quot;/&gt;

By this time, as a result of attacks by German bombers on London, the decision was made to almost double the size of the [[Royal Flying Corps]], with most of the new squadrons planned to be equipped with [[bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce pt I p387&quot;&gt;Bruce 2 April 1956, p.387.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the performance estimates for the DH.9 (which were expected to surpass those of the DH.4), and the similarity to the DH.4, which meant that it would be easy to convert production over to the new aircraft, massive orders (4,630 aircraft) were placed.

The prototype (a converted DH.4) first flew at [[Hendon]] in July 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson DHp97&quot;&gt;Jackson 1987, p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the [[Beardmore Halford Pullinger|BHP]] engine proved unable to reliably deliver its expected power, with the engine being derated to 230&amp;nbsp;hp (186&amp;nbsp;kW) in order to improve reliability. This had a drastic effect on the aircraft's performance, especially at high altitude, with it being inferior to that of the DH.4 it was supposed to replace. This meant that the DH.9 would have to fight its way through enemy fighters, which could easily catch the DH.9 where the DH.4 could avoid many of these attacks.

While attempts were made to provide the DH.9 with an adequate engine, with aircraft being fitted with the [[Siddeley Puma]], a lightened and supposedly more powerful version of the BHP, with the Fiat A12 engine and with a 430&amp;nbsp;hp (321&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Napier Lion]] engine, these were generally unsuccessful (although the Lion-engined aircraft did set a [[Flight altitude record|World Altitude Record]] of 30,500&amp;nbsp;ft (13,900&amp;nbsp;m) on 2 January 1919&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson DHp100&quot;&gt;Jackson 1987, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;) and it required redesign into the DH.9A to transform the aircraft.

==Operational history==
To boost the rate of production, quantity orders for the DH.9 were also placed with Alliance, G &amp; J.Weir, Short Brothers, Vulcan, [[Waring &amp; Gillow]] and National Aircraft Factories No. 1 and No. 2.

The first deliveries were made in November 1917 to [[No. 108 Squadron RAF|108 Squadron]] [[Royal Flying Corps|RFC]] and it first went into combat over France in March 1918 with [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|6 Squadron]], and by July 1918 nine squadrons operational over the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] were using the type.

The DH.9's performance in action over the Western Front was a disaster, with heavy losses incurred, both due to its poor performance and to engine failures, despite the prior derating of its engine.  Between May and November 1918, two squadrons on the Western Front (Nos. [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|99]] and [[No. 104 Squadron RAF|104]]) lost 54 shot down, and another 94 written off in accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masonp85&quot;&gt;Mason 1994, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on 23 August 1918 a DH9 flown by Lieutenant [[Arthur Spurling|Arthur Rowe Spurling]] of 49 Squadron, with his observer, [[Frank Bell (aviator)|Sergeant Frank Bell]], single-handedly attacked thirty [[Fokker D.VII]] fighters, downing five of them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Captain [[John Stevenson Stubbs]] managed 11 aerial victories in a DH9, including the highly unusual feat of [[balloon buster|balloon busting]] with one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/stubbs2.php Retrieved 1 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DH.9 was also more successful against the Turkish forces in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], where they faced less opposition, and it was used extensively for coastal patrols, to try to deter the operations of [[U-boats]].

Following the end of the First World War, DH.9s operated by [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47 Squadron]] and [[No. 221 Squadron RAF|221 Squadron]] were sent to southern [[Russia]] in 1919 in support of the [[White movement|White Russian]] Army of [[Anton Ivanovich Denikin|General Denikin]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce ptII p424&quot;/&gt; The last combat use by the RAF was in support of the [[1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes|final campaign]] against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (known by the British as the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;) in [[Somalia]] during January—February 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce ptII p424&quot;&gt;Bruce 13 April 1956, p.424.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, production was allowed to continue after the end of the war into 1919, with the DH.9 finally going out of service with the [[RAF]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;masonp86&quot;/&gt;

Following the end of the First World War, large numbers of surplus DH.9s became available at low prices and the type was widely exported (including aircraft donated to [[Commonwealth]] nations as part of the [[Imperial Gift]] programme).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson DHp100&quot;/&gt;

The [[South African Air Force]] received 48 DH.9s, and used them extensively, using them against the [[Rand Revolt]] in 1922. Several South African aircraft were re-engined with [[Bristol Jupiter]] radial engines as the M'pala, serving until 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson DHp102&quot;&gt;Jackson 1987, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian use==
[[File:G-AUED.jpg|thumb|DH-9 G-AUED modified with a cabin for use as an airliner]]
Because of the large number of surplus DH.9s available after the war many were used by air transport companies. They provided a useful load carrying capability and were inexpensive. Early air services between [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Amsterdam]] were operated by DH.9s owned by [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]]. A number of different conversions for civil use were carried out, both by Airco and its successor, the [[de Havilland|de Havilland Aircraft Company]], and by other companies such as the [[ADC Aircraft|Aircraft Disposal Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson civilp50-52&quot;&gt;Jackson 1973, p.50-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Some radial powered DH.9Js continued in use until 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson civilp56&quot;&gt;Jackson 1973, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
*'''DH.9''' - Revised version of the [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]] with the pilot and observer/gunner placed closer together (3,024 production aircraft built with others built in Belgium and Spain).
*'''[[Airco DH.9A|DH.9A]]''' - (also referred to as the '''Nine-Ack''') was designed for [[Airco]] by [[Westland Aircraft]] to take advantage of the 400&amp;nbsp;hp (298&amp;nbsp;kW) American [[Liberty L-12]] engine. Apart from the new engine and slightly larger wings it was identical to the DH.9. Initially it was hoped to quickly replace the DH.9 with the new version, but the shortage of Liberty engines available to the RAF limited the new type's service in the First World War, and it is best known as a standard type in the postwar RAF, serving as a general purpose aircraft for several years. 2,300 DH.9As were built by ten different British companies.
*'''DH.9B''' - Conversions for civilian use as three-seaters (one pilot and two passengers)
*'''[[Airco DH.9C|DH.9C]]''' - Conversions for civilian use as four-seaters (one pilot and three passengers)
*'''DH.9J''' - Modernised and re-engined conversions using the 385&amp;nbsp;hp (287&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar]] III [[radial engine]]. Used by the De Havilland School of Flying.
[[File:HP 17.png|thumb|Handley Page H.P. 17 showing slots]]
*'''DH.9J M'pala I''' - Re-engined conversions carried out by the [[South African Air Force]]. Powered by a 450&amp;nbsp;hp (336&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Bristol Jupiter]] VI radial piston engine.
*'''M'pala II''' - Re-engined conversions carried out by the South African Air Force, powered by a 480&amp;nbsp;hp (358&amp;nbsp;kW) Bristol Jupiter VIII radial piston engine.
*'''Mantis''' - Re-engined conversions carried out by the South African Air Force, powered by a 200&amp;nbsp;hp (149&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Wolseley Viper]] piston engine.
*'''Handley Page HP.17''' - A DH.9 experimentally fitted with slotted wings, tested 1920-1. &lt;ref name= &quot;Barnes Handleyp211-213&quot;&gt;Barnes 1976, p.211-213.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''USD-9/9A''' - DH.9s manufactured in the United States by the [[US Army]]'s [[Engineering Division]] and [[Dayton-Wright Airplane Co|Dayton-Wright]].
