'''Abu Kamil Nasr ibn Salih ibn Mirdas''' (d. 22 May 1038),{{#tag:ref|Full name and [[genealogy]]: ''Abū Kāmil Naṣr ibn Ṣāliḥ ibn Mirdās ibn Idrīs ibn Nāṣir ibn Ḥumayd ibn Mudrik ibn Shaddād ibn ʿUbayd ibn Qays ibn Rabīʿa ibn Kaʿb ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Abū Bakr ibn [[Banu Kilab|Kilāb]] ibn Rabīʿa ibn [[Banu 'Amir|ʿĀmir]] ibn Ṣaʿṣaʿ ibn Muʿāwiyah ibn Bakr ibn [[Hawazin|Hawāzin]] ibn Manṣūr ibn ʿIkrima ibn Khaṣafa ibn [[Qays|Qays ʿAylān]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ibn Khallikan|editor1-last=De Slane|editor1-first=Mac Guckin|title=Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, Volume 1|date=1842|publisher=Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland|location=Paris|page=631|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA631}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genealogy is cited by the medieval Syria-based historians [[Ibn al-Adim]] (d. 1262) and [[Ibn Khallikan]] (d. 1282).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar87&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} also known by his ''[[laqab]]'' (honorific epithet) of '''Shibl al-Dawla''' (&quot;[[Lion cub]] of the Dynasty&quot;), was the second [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasid]] emir of [[Aleppo]], ruling between 1029/30 until his death. He was the eldest son of [[Salih ibn Mirdas]], founder of the Mirdasid dynasty. Nasr fought alongside his father in the battle of al-Uqhuwanah, where Salih was killed by a [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] army. Afterward, Nasr ruled the emirate jointly with his brother [[Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal|Thimal]]. The young emirs soon faced a large scale [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] offensive led by Emperor [[Romanos III]]. Commanding a much smaller force of [[Bedouin]] horsemen, Nasr routed the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Azaz (1030)|Battle of Azaz]].

Following his victory, he ousted Thimal from Aleppo and entered into Byzantine vassalage, while attempting to maintain ties with the Fatimids. He nominally recognized Fatimid suzerainty in 1037 and was concurrently given control of [[Homs|Hims]], which the Mirdasids lost several years prior. The Fatimid governor of Syria, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]], whose forces killed Salih in 1029, objected to Nasr's acquisition of Hims; in 1038, his forces marched against Nasr and killed him during a battle in [[Hama]]'s environs. Thimal succeeded Nasr, but Aleppo fell to al-Dizbari weeks later. Mirdasid rule was restored and continued with some interruption until 1080.

Nasr renovated the [[Citadel of Aleppo|Aleppo Citadel]] and made it his seat of power. Under the direction of his local Christian vizier, Aleppo was expanded and urbanized to accommodate an influx of Muslims from the countryside. Nasr's rule was limited to the northern Syrian portion of the emirate, while the Mirdasids' [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n fortresses were controlled by Thimal. Though relations with his [[Banu Kilab]] tribe were strained at times, Nasr secured strong ties with the [[Numayrid dynasty|Banu Numayr]] by marrying the Numayri princess al-Sayyida Alawiyya. With her, he had his only known son, [[Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud|Mahmud]], who later ruled Aleppo.

==Early life and career==
Nasr was was the eldest son of [[Salih ibn Mirdas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar105&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawford91&quot;&gt;Crawford, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; the supreme [[emir]] of the [[Banu Kilab]] tribe and founder of the [[Mirdasid dynasty]]. By 1025, Salih's [[Aleppo]]-based Mirdasid emirate covered much of northern Syria, western [[Upper Mesopotamia]] and the central Syrian towns of [[Sidon]], [[Baalbek|Ba'albak]] and [[Homs|Hims]]. Though he ruled independently, Salih nominally recognized [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] suzerainty over his emirate. However, in 1029, he supported his ally, [[Hassan ibn Mufarrij]], the [[Jarrahids|Jarrahid]] emir of the [[Tayy|Banu Tayy]], against a Fatimid army led by [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar100-01&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1029, the two sides fought at the battle of al-Uqhuwanah near [[Lake Tiberias]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar100-01&quot;/&gt; which ended in a rout for the Bedouin allies, the deaths of Salih and his youngest son, and the subsequent loss of the Mirdasids' central Syrian possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar100-01&quot;/&gt; 

Nasr fought alongside his father,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar100-01&quot;/&gt;  but escaped al-Uqhuwanah and returned to Aleppo, where his younger brother, [[Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal|Thimal]], had been left to administer affairs in his father's absence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar105&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawford92&quot;&gt;Crawford, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It is evidenced by the two surviving coins minted during Salih's reign that Thimal had been designated as Salih's ''walī al-ʿahd'' (chosen successor) as late as 1028/29, the year before Salih's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar105&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawford92&quot;/&gt; However, in the aftermath of al-Uqhuwanah, Nasr and Thimal apparently ruled Aleppo jointly, with Nasr based in the city and Thimal in the [[Citadel of Aleppo|citadel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis117&quot;&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of their defeat at al-Uqhuwanah, the Mirdasids lost Sidon, Baalbek, Hims, Hisn Ibn Akkar and Rafaniyya, and concentrated their forces in [[Jund Qinnasrin]] and western [[Diyar Mudar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis117&quot;/&gt;

==Conflict with the Byzantines==
{{main|Battle of Azaz (1030)}}
[[File:The Arabs drive the Byzantines to flight at Azazion.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Battle of Azaz, miniature from the ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]'']]

The youth and inexperience of Nasr and Thimal was viewed by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ''[[katepano]]'' of [[Antioch]], [[Michael Spondyles]], as an opportunity to establish a protectorate over the Mirdasids' domains and prevent the reestablishment of Fatimid rule in the wake of Salih's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar109&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Spondyles sent an expedition against Aleppo; however, Nasr and Thimal, leading their Kilabi tribesmen,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar109&quot;/&gt; ambushed and routed the Byzantine force at Qaybar (in Aleppo's western countryside) in July 1029.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar109&quot;/&gt; In the aftermath,  Spondyles was dismissed by Emperor [[Romanos III]], who resolved to avenge the Byzantine loss,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar109&quot;/&gt; install his ally [[Mansur ibn Lu'lu']] in place of the Mirdasids,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar111&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the process, achieve a glorious military victory over the Arabs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar110&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanos III arrived at Antioch with a 20,000-strong army, composed mostly of mercenaries,&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; on 20 July 1030,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar112&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; and sent a messenger to Nasr and Thimal demanding they cede Aleppo to him.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr rejected the demand, detained the envoy and sent his own diplomatic mission, led by his cousin [[Muqallid ibn Kamil]], to persuade Romanos to desist from attacking Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar112&quot;/&gt; Nasr's envoys told Romanos that the Mirdasids had not given the Byzantines any pretext for war and maintained the Byzantine protectorate and alliance per the treaty of 969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar112&quot;/&gt; They also related that they were prepared for war should Romanos continue his offensive against Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar112&quot;/&gt; Nasr's envoys were detained and Romanos continued his march,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar112&quot;/&gt; setting up camp outside [[Azaz]], to the northwest of Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar113&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr and Thimal, meanwhile, evacuated their families from the city, and mobilized the Kilab, the [[Numayrid dynasty|Banu Numayr]] and other Bedouin tribes, as well as local Muslims from Aleppo and its hinterland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar113&quot;/&gt; The bulk of the Mirdasid force remained with Thimal to defend Aleppo and its citadel,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar113&quot;/&gt; while Nasr and some 700–900 Bedouin horsemen left to confront the Byzantines.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanos, whose army was encamped in a barren plain during the summer heat, sent a force to survey the fortress of Azaz, but these troops were all killed or captured by the Mirdasids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar116&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Romanos subsequently decided to withdraw toward Byzantine territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar116&quot;/&gt; Disorder soon spread throughout the Byzantine camp, with Armenian mercenaries looting the camp's market and trench guards fleeing for safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar116&quot;/&gt; Nasr and his Kilabi warriors used this opportunity to launch a surprise sortie against the retreating Byzantine troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar116&quot;/&gt; The latter were decisively defeated and chaotically dispersed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar116&quot;/&gt; According to the contemporary Byzantine historian [[Michael Psellus]], Romanos &quot;himself was almost captured and made prisoner by the enemy [Mirdasids]&quot;, who, &quot;as if amazed at the sight of the Romans [Byzantines] routed and fleeing for no reason, merely stood and watched this outstanding triumph&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emir of Aleppo==
===Seizure of power===
[[File:Citadelle d'Alep.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Nasr seized the [[Citadel of Aleppo|Aleppo Citadel]] from his brother [[Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal|Thimal]] in 1030, and became sole ruler of [[Aleppo]]. He added numerous living quarters and reception halls to the citadel and made it his residence and seat of power.]]

Nasr opposed Thimal's appointment and sought to take sole control of Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar105106&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two accounts about Nasr's seizure of power, both agreeing that Nasr took the Aleppo citadel while Thimal was away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar105106&quot;/&gt; In the first account by Ibn al-Adim, Nasr and his men seized the citadel by force when Thimal was in the Kilabi tribal camps in Aleppo's outskirts attempting to persuade his estranged wife to return to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar106&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, Thimal mobilized his Kilabi loyalists with the goal of retaking Aleppo by force, but the arrival of Romanos's forces spurred the Kilabi chieftains to mediate the dispute between Nasr and Thimal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar107&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing agreement, Nasr would control the Syrian portion of the emirate from Aleppo, while Thimal would rule the Mesopotamian portion from [[al-Rahba]] on the [[Euphrates River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar107&quot;/&gt; 

The second account by Yahya of Antioch, and also cited by Ibn al-'Adim, holds that Nasr's coup took place after the Battle of Azaz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar107&quot;/&gt; Accordingly, when Thimal left Aleppo to bring back his family to the city after Nasr's victory over the Byzantines, Nasr took control of the citadel in his absence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar107&quot;/&gt; Historian Suhayl Zakkar asserts that this account was the more likely scenario,&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since Nasr immediately appealed for Byzantine forgiveness and protection, offering an annual tribute of 500,000 [[dirham]]s, despite his decisive victory over Romanos at Azaz;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar108&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Zakkar explains that Nasr's spontaneous offer to the Byzantines must have come as a result of Kilabi dissent or threats toward his rule organized by Thimal in response to the latter's ouster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar108&quot;/&gt;

===Byzantine vassalage and Fatimid relations===
Romanos accepted Nasr's offer and declared the Emirate of Aleppo as a [[vassal]] of the empire, obliging the Byzantines to back and protect Nasr in case of aggression. Nasr's vassalage with the Byzantines became the principal sticking point in Byzantine–Fatimid peace negotiations, which commenced in 1031.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; While Romanos adamantly sought to include Nasr's emirate in the proposed treaty, he died in 1034 and was replaced by Emperor [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian|Michael IV]], who was more conciliatory toward Fatimid concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus when negotiations concluded in 1036 with a ten-year truce (''[[hudna]]''), the issue of Aleppo was excluded entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar120&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zakkar, &quot;It would appear that Byzantium, which by this Treaty, had solved most of its problems with the Fatimid Caliphate, lost interest in Aleppo, or at least no longer deemed it to be of the same political importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar120&quot;/&gt; 

The Byzantine–Fatimid treaty weakened Nasr's strategic position and pressured him to improve relations with the Fatimids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar120&quot;/&gt; As early as 1030, following the Battle of Azaz, Nasr sought Fatimid approval of his rule and dispatched an envoy carrying a large amount of war booty to Caliph az-Zahir; the latter, in turn, accepted Nasr's authority in Aleppo, at least for the time being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar108&quot;/&gt; However, there is no indication that Nasr paid the Fatimids any tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar121&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr's envoy remained in Cairo for several years and likely did not return to Aleppo until after the succession of Caliph [[al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar121&quot;/&gt; Zakkar speculates that this indicated discord between Aleppo and Cairo either due to Nasr's payment of tribute to Byzantium instead of to the Fatimids or Fatimid hesitation at Nasr's request for the governorship of [[Homs|Hims]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar121&quot;/&gt; 

Following the 1036 treaty, Emperor Michael IV mediated between Nasr and al-Mustansir by advising the former to accept the Fatimids' conditions, which are not known;&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, the contemporary chroniclers provided scant information about Nasr's relations with the Fatimids between 1030 and 1036.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar122&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The chroniclers do mention that Nasr's envoy returned to Aleppo in 1037 bearing a diploma giving Nasr the governorship of Hims, as well as gifts and robes of honor from al-Mustansir,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar122&quot;/&gt; whose suzerainty was nominally acknowledged by Nasr.&lt;ref&gt;Amabe 2016, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mustansir also bestowed on Nasr the noble titles of ''mukhtaṣ al-umara'', ''khāṣtuʾl-imām'', ''shams al-dawla wa majdihā'' and ''dhuʾl-azīmatayn'', in addition to his previous title of ''shibl al-dawla''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar122&quot;/&gt;

===Fortifications===
Nasr moved the seat of the emirate to the Aleppo Citadel, marking a change from previous tradition whereby Aleppo's rulers were based in a palace in the city or its outskirts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar106&quot;/&gt; This &quot;brought about the erection of magnificent apartments and reception halls&quot; in the citadel, which thenceforth became the residence of Nasr and later rulers of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To make up for the loss of [[Gibelacar|Hisn Ibn Akkar]] to the Fatimid governor of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in 1033, Nasr strengthened Hisn al-Safh on the northern end of the [[Homs Gap|Hims Gap]], opposite of Hisn Ibn Akkar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salibi108&quot;&gt;Salibi 1977, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He garrisoned the fortress with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribal auxiliaries, hence its name &quot;''Hisn al-Akrad''&quot; (the future [[Krak des Chevaliers]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Salibi108&quot;/&gt;

===Domestic affairs===
Upon seizing power, Nasr, like his father, appointed an Aleppine Christian, al-Mu'ammal al-Shammas, as ''wazir'' ([[vizier]]) to administer civilian and military affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis117&quot;&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabe66&quot;&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; During Mirdasid rule, a large influx of peasants and nomads from the countryside moved to the city of Aleppo, resulting in the establishment of crowded quarters and suburbs within and outside the city's walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabe66&quot;/&gt; Al-Mu'ammal, aided by his brother, oversaw the urbanization of these suburbs and the construction of [[mosque]]s and ''[[Turkish bath|hammam]]s'' (bathhouses) to accommodate the new arrivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabe66&quot;/&gt;

Nasr consecrated ties with the [[Numayrid dynasty|Numayrids]] by marrying al-Sayyida Alawiyya, sister of [[Numayrid dynasty#Reign of Shabib|Shabib ibn Waththab]], the Numayrid emir of [[Harran]]; the Numayrids were distant kinsmen and traditional allies of the Banu Kilab and the Mirdasids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt;

As a result of his vassalage to the Byzantines, Nasr provoked the opposition of [[Salim ibn al-Mustafad]], Aleppo's municipal chief and leader of the ''[[ahdath]]'' (urban paramilitaries), appointed during Salih ibn Mirdas's reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy260&quot;&gt;Kennedy 2004, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Mustafad stirred a rebellion among the ''ahdath'' and the lower and middle class residents of the Zajjajin quarter in protest at the alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabe66&quot;&gt;Amabe 2016, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the Byzantine governor of Antioch to request Nasr kill Ibn al-Mustafad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabe66&quot;/&gt; Accordingly, Nasr had Ibn al-Mustafad arrested and executed in 1034.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amabe66&quot;/&gt;

===Downfall and death===
Nasr's acquisition of Hims in 1037 came at the expense of its Fatimid-appointed, [[Kutama|Berber]] governor, Ja'far ibn Kulayd al-Kutami, who was concurrently dismissed from the governorship.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Kulayd appealed for the assistance of the [[Damascus]]-based, Fatimid governor of Syria, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt; The latter was already perturbed by the expansion of the Mirdasid realm to Hims, which would give the Byzantine-backed Mirdasid–Numayrid alliance full control of the lowland regions and routes between the Iraqi frontier and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt; Al-Dizbari relayed his concerns to the Fatimid court, which was effectively run by [[Ali ibn Ahmad al-Jarjara'i|Ali al-Jarjara'i]], who was the power behind the throne; al-Jarjara'i had granted Nasr the governorship of Hims partly to check al-Dizbari's power and territorial ambitions in Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt; Al-Dizbari did not await Cairo's response and he and Ibn Kulayd mobilized their forces to assert direct Fatimid rule over northern Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt; Al-Dizbari's army was bolstered by troops from the [[Banu Kalb]] and Banu Tayy, as well as a dissident faction of the Banu Kilab.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar124&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, al-Dizbari gained Byzantine permission to take Aleppo provided he maintain Nasr's annual tribute to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar124&quot;/&gt;

Upon hearing of al-Dizbari's campaign against him, Nasr mobilized his local and Kilabi forces, including Thimal and his loyalists, and set out to confront the Fatimid coalition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar124&quot;/&gt; Nasr's force was defeated in a battle just west of [[al-Salamiyah]], and withdrew toward [[Hama]] to regroup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar124&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, al-Dizbari's troops attacked and plundered Hama and moved against Nasr's camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar124&quot;/&gt; On 22 May 1038, the two sides fought at Tell Fas, a site immediately west of [[Latmin]] in Hama's northwestern countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar124125&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing battle, Thimal and his men abandoned Nasr and his core loyalists, who were left to face the much larger Fatimid coalition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar124125&quot;/&gt; Thimal's reason for fleeing is not definitively known, though he likely used it as an opportunity to wrest back control of Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar125&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr, meanwhile, was &quot;killed fighting bravely&quot;, according to historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy260&quot;/&gt; his head was given to al-Dizbari and his body was displayed on the gate of the [[Hama Castle|Hama Citadel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar125&quot;/&gt;

Thimal succeeded Nasr as emir of Aleppo, but, fearing al-Dizbari's northward advance, left the city shortly after in the company of Nasr's children, Shabib ibn Waththab and Nasr's widow al-Sayyid Alawiyya, who Thimal later married.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt; Thimal entrusted governance of the city and citadel to his kinsmen, Khalifa ibn Jabir al-Kilabi and Muqallid ibn Kamil, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar132&quot;&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; These governors surrendered the city to al-Dizbari's forces in June 1038, following a siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakkar132&quot;/&gt; With this, al-Dizbari brought all of Syria under direct Fatimid administration for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Mirdasid soldiers and officials were consequently expelled from Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1042, al-Dizbari died and Thimal restored Mirdasid rule over the city with al-Jarjara'i's backing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianquis118&quot;/&gt;
