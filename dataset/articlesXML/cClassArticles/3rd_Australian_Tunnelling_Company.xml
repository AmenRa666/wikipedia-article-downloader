The '''3rd Australian Tunnelling Company''' was one of the [[Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers|tunnelling companies]] of the [[Royal Australian Engineers]] during [[World War I]]. The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of [[Mining (military)|mines]] under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of [[Dugout (shelter)#World War I|deep dugouts]] for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.&lt;ref name=tunnelcoyre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm |title=The Tunnelling Companies RE |work=The Long, Long Trail |accessdate=25 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510184955/http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers}}
By January 1915 it had become evident to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] that the Germans were [[Mining (military)|mining]] to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter-tactics or underground  listening devices before the war, field marshals [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|French]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] agreed to investigate the suitability of forming  British mining units.&lt;ref name=REMJNG/&gt; Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]], Brigadier [[George Henry Fowke|George Fowke]], and the mining specialist [[Sir John Norton-Griffiths, 1st Baronet|John Norton-Griffiths]], the [[War Office]] formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915.&lt;ref name=REMJNG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remuseum.org.uk/biography/rem_bio_Norton-Griffiths.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501120136/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/biography/rem_bio_Norton-Griffiths.htm|title=Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Norton-Griffiths (1871–1930)|publisher=Royal Engineers Museum|accessdate=21 June 2010|archivedate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the [[Ypres Salient]] at [[Hooge in World War I|Hooge]], [[Hill 60 (Ypres)|Hill 60]], [[RE Grave, Railway Wood|Railway Wood]], [[Sanctuary Wood Cemetery|Sanctuary Wood]], [[St. Eloi (Ypres)|St Eloi]] and [[The Bluff (Ypres)|The Bluff]] which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.{{sfn|Barton|Doyle|Vandewalle|2005|p=165}} To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers.&lt;ref name=REMJNG/&gt;  The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the  Engineer-in-Chief's office under [[Spring R. Rice|Major-General S.R. Rice]], and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ [[Saint-Omer]] office of the Engineer-in-Chief.&lt;ref name=REMJNG/&gt; A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from [[Wales|Welsh]] miners from the [[List of battalions of the South Wales Borderers#First World War|1st and 3rd Battalions]] of the [[Monmouthshire Regiment]], who were attached to the [[List of units of the British Army Territorial Force 1908#Royal Engineers|1st Northumberland Field Company]] of the Royal Engineers, which was a [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial]] unit.&lt;ref name=REMpt14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part14.htm#westernfront|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704085530/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part14.htm#westernfront|title=Corps History – Part 14: The Corps and the First World War (1914–18)|publisher=Royal Engineers Museum|accessdate=21 June 2010|archivedate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front.{{sfn|Barton|Doyle|Vandewalle|2005|p=165}} Most British tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916.&lt;ref name=tunnelcoyre /&gt;

On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] to raise tunnelling companies in the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]]. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The [[New Zealand Tunnelling Company]] arrived at [[Plymouth]] on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.&lt;ref name=nztunnellerschronology&gt;{{cite web|last=Byledbal |first=Anthony |title=New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology |url=http://www.nztunnellers.com/history/chronology.html |accessdate=5 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706180059/http://www.nztunnellers.com/history/chronology.html |archivedate=6 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Australian Engineers]] formed four mining units – initially grouped into the [[Australian Mining Corps]] – for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], all of which were operational by March 1916. Three were specialist companies of tunnellers ([[1st Australian Tunnelling Company|1st]], [[2nd Australian Tunnelling Company|2nd]], 3rd), while the [[Australian Electrical Mechanical Boring and Mining Company]] was tasked with carrying out related repairs. A [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] tunnelling unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies being available by the summer of 1916.&lt;ref name=tunnelcoyre /&gt;

==Unit history==
===Formation===
In early 1915, while the [[Royal Australian Engineers]] were deployed in Egypt, the [[battalion]]-sized &quot;Australian Mining Corps&quot; was assembled from men with a background in civilian mining. The intention was to employ this unit, which was at that time about 1,000 strong, with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]] at Gallipoli, but instead it was moved to France in May 1916, where it also appeared as the &quot;Australian Mining Battalion&quot;. Soon after arriving in western Europe in May 1916, the battalion was split into three tunnelling and one repairs company, and the corps headquarters dissolved.&lt;ref name=tunnelcoyre /&gt;&lt;ref name=1stAust&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plugstreet-archaeology.com/1stAustTunnellingCoy.php |work=The Plugstreet Archaeological Project |title=1st Australian Tunnelling Company| accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its formation, the 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company relieved the [[255th Tunnelling Company]] in May 1916 in the [[Laventie]]/Fauquissart sector in northern [[France]].&lt;ref name=tunnelcoyre /&gt;

===Loos===
In April 1917, the 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company moved to northern France where it took over the Hill 70 – Copse – Double Crassier area of [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]], together with Hulluch to the north, and relieved the [[173rd Tunnelling Company|173rd ]] and [[258th Tunnelling Company|258th]] Tunnelling Companies, which had been waging war underground on three levels (&quot;Main&quot;, &quot;Deep&quot;, &quot;Deep Deep&quot;) there. By the time 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company took over the Loos-Hulluch sector, the enemy mining threat had ceased completely and the front was relatively quiet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Durand Group|title=Loos-Copse Project|url=http://www.durandgroup.org.uk/copse_project.html|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 7th February 1918, the 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company was engaged in trench shelter and tunnel construction in a quarry near Loos, between Loos Crassier and the Lens-Bethune road, and on  17th February 1918, a trench excavated by the 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company was photographed near Loos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/library/finding-aids/guide-world-war-1914-1918-photograph-collection|title=Guide to World War 1914–1918 photograph collection – Academy Library – UNSW Canberra|work=adfa.edu.au|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spring Offensive===
{{main|Spring Offensive|Battle of the Lys (1918)}}
In April 1918, the 3rd Australian and several other tunnelling companies ([[171st Tunnelling Company|171st]], [[173rd Tunnelling Company|173rd]], [[183rd Tunnelling Company|183rd]], [[184th Tunnelling Company|184th]], [[255th Tunnelling Company|255th]] and [[258th Tunnelling Company|258th]]) were forced to move from their camps at [[Boeschepe]], when the enemy broke through the [[Leie|Lys]] positions during the [[Spring Offensive]]. These units were then put on duties that included digging and wiring trenches over a long distance from [[Reningelst]] to near [[Saint-Omer]].&lt;ref name=tunnelcoyre /&gt; The operation to construct these fortifications between Reningelst and Saint-Omer was carried out jointly by the British [[171st Tunnelling Company|171st]], [[173rd Tunnelling Company|173rd]], [[183rd Tunnelling Company|183rd]], [[184th Tunnelling Company|184th]], [[255th Tunnelling Company|255th]], [[258th Tunnelling Company|258th]], [[3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company|3rd Canadian]] and 3rd Australian Tunnelling Companies.

During the great advance to victory in Autumn 1918, the 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company constructed a road bridge at Moudit under shell fire.&lt;ref name=tunnelcoyre /&gt;
