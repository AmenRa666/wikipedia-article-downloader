The '''Battle of Karameh''' ({{lang-ar|معركة الكرامة}}) was a 15-hour military engagement between the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) and combined forces of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the [[Jordanian Armed Forces]] (JAF) in the [[Jordan]]ian town of [[Karameh]] on 21 March 1968, during the [[War of Attrition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tuckerS&quot; /&gt; It was planned by [[Israel]] as one of two concurrent raids on PLO camps, one in Karameh and one in the distant village of Safi—codenamed '''Operation Inferno''' ({{lang-he|מבצע תופת}}) and '''Operation Asuta''' (מבצע אסותא), respectively—but the former turned into a full-scale battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;inferno&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ben-Tzedef|first=Eviatar|title=Inferno at Karameh|work=nfc|accessdate=3 September 2008|date=24 March 2008|url=http://www.nfc.co.il/Archive/003-D-28622-00.html?tag=10-27-34|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921135837/http://www.nfc.co.il/Archive/003-D-28622-00.html?tag=10-27-34|archivedate=21 September 2008 | deadurl= no|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, the [[PLO]] and [[Fatah]] stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel from Jordanian soil, using the border town of Karameh as their headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuckerS&quot; /&gt; Though the Israeli invasion, whose purpose was to destroy the Palestinian militant camps at Karameh and capture [[Yasser Arafat]], was primarily motivated as a reprisal for these new attacks, the two operations had been prepared a year earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debacle in the desert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.jo/books?id=hI844N9leNUC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=karameh+battle|pages=45–47|title=The Arab-Israeli Conflict|author=Cath Senker

Both sides declared victory. On a tactical level, the battle went in Israel's favor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeev Maoz page 246&quot;&gt;Zeev Maoz, ''Defending the Holy Land, A Critical Analysis of Israel's Security and Foreign Policy,'' University of Michigan Press, 2006, pages 244–246&lt;/ref&gt; and the aim of destroying the Karameh camp was achieved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herzog, The Arab-Israeli Wars page 205&quot;&gt;Herzog, ''The Arab-Israeli Wars,'' p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and stunned the Israelis.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuckerS&quot; /&gt; On a rare occasion, Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks, later paraded in [[Amman]] by the Jordanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secret Soldier&quot;/&gt; Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein let them take credit.&lt;ref name=&quot;assessment&quot;&gt;{{cite news|issn=0040-781X|title=The Israeli Assessment|work =Time|accessdate=3 September 2008|date=13 December 1968|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839651,00.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Palestinians used the battle's wide acclaim and recognition in the Arab world to establish their national claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;neff&quot; /&gt; After the battle, [[King Hussein]] proclaimed, &quot;I think we may reach a position where we are all [[fedayeen]]&quot;. As the PLO's strength began to grow in the aftermath of the battle, Fedayeen began to speak openly of taking over Jordan, and the ensuing tensions eventually precipitated in [[Black September]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot; /&gt;

==Background==
[[File:South jordan valley.png|thumb|left|Bridges over the [[Jordan River]]]]
Palestinian groups used to initiate few attacks on Israeli targets from both the West Bank and Jordan before the [[Six-Day War]], some of which caused Israel to retaliate which became known as the [[Reprisal operations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=ntLdA8QIgXIC&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Britain and the Conflict in the Middle East, 1964-1967: The Coming of the Six-Day War|accessdate=8 April 2016|author=Moshe Gat|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the seizure of the [[West Bank]] from Jordan in the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group [[Fatah]] networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuckerS&quot; /&gt;
On 14–15 February, Jordanian mortars hit several Israeli settlements in the [[Beit Shean Valley]] and [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Israeli artillery and air forces retaliated against Jordanian bases and artillery batteries, as well as the American-financed East Ghor Canal (now known as the [[King Abdullah Canal]]).  As a result, thousands of Jordanian farmers fled eastwards, and fedayeen (agents  willing to sacrifice themselves for the Palestinian cause) moved into the valley.  An American-sponsored ceasefire was arranged, and King Hussein declared he would prevent these groups from using Jordan as a base for attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris367-368&quot;&gt;Morris (1999), pp. 367–368&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, King Hussein sent twenty carloads of troops and police to order a Fatah unit to leave the town of Karameh. When it arrived, the column found itself surrounded by men wielding machine guns; their commander said &quot;You have three minutes to decide whether you leave or die&quot;. They withdrew.&lt;ref name=brotherhood/&gt; By March, several hundred civilians lived in the camp, along with about 900 guerrillas, mostly from Fatah, and PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]], who had his headquarters there.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris368&quot;&gt;Morris (1999), p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, Chief of the [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Military Intelligence Directorate]] [[Aharon Yariv]] stated that a raid would damage Fatah's prestige. On the other hand, [[Israeli Foreign Minister]] [[Abba Eban]] and his chief of bureau Gideon Rafael — mindful of an adverse American reaction due to the good relationship between Jordan and the US — worried a raid could result in innocent civilian deaths and be a political disservice to Israel. [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of Staff]] [[Haim Bar-Lev]] promised a &quot;clean action&quot;. [[Israeli Defense Minister]] [[Moshe Dayan]] asked for a &quot;principal approval&quot; for a raid, but this was denied by the cabinet. On 13 December, Operation Karameh was scheduled for the next night, it was placed in the hands of both Brigade 35 of the Paratroop Corps and the Sayeret Matkal special-operations force. The operation was called off, rescheduled for 12 March and then called off again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debacle in the desert&quot; /&gt; Dayan warned the other ministers that a bus might strike a mine.&lt;ref name=&quot;segev&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The U.S. tried to prevent it by forwarding Israel a message from King Hussein. [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Levi Eshkol]] called in the cabinet for further counseling; only the [[National Religious Party]] leader [[Haim-Moshe Shapira]] vocally opposed the attack, while [[Israeli Education Minister|Education Minister]] [[Zalman Aran]] opposed it too but remained silent.&lt;ref name=&quot;segev&quot; /&gt;
There was an intelligence informant who was a former Fatah member, code-named &quot;Grotius&quot; who was said to be familiar with the base in Karameh and its surroundings. Grotius is said to have arrived in Jordan as a member of the 421st Commando Battalion of the Palestine Liberation Army, on the eve of the Six-Day War. After deserting his battalion, he trained in Syria at the Hama camp and later slipped into the West Bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debacle in the desert&quot; /&gt; Israel assumed that the Jordanians would ignore the invasion, however, the Israelis were met with heavy resistance from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot; /&gt;

==Prelude==
[[File:גשר אדם.JPG|thumb|right|View of Damia Bridge]]
On 4 March, [[Dairat al-Mukhabarat al-Ammah|Jordanian intelligence]]  began to detect Israeli activity near the border, as IDF troops began to concentrate near the [[Allenby Bridge]] (known now as King Hussein Bridge) and [[Damia Bridge]] (known now as Adam Bridge). Jordan ordered the 1st Infantry Division to take up positions near those bridges and around Karameh.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack331-332&quot;&gt;Pollack (2002), pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March, Dayan warned that the fedayeen were preparing for a &quot;new wave of terror,&quot; which Israel would take steps to contain if King Hussein of Jordan could not. Eshkol repeated that message to the [[Knesset]], and on the same day, Israeli Ambassador Yosef Tekoah filed two complaints with the [[United Nations]] against what he termed &quot;the Arabs' repeated acts of aggression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;foray&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

By 20 March, Jordan had identified parts of the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade, 60th Armored Brigade, 35th Paratroop Brigade, 80th Infantry Brigade, a combat engineer battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia bridges. The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a drive on [[Amman]], and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th Armored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of its armored car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division. The total firepower was 105 [[Patton tank]]s and 88 artillery pieces. The infantry divisions were deployed near the bridges, each with a tank company. The artillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking Karameh for topological advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack331-332&quot; /&gt;

The Israeli forces amounted to less than a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at [[King Abdullah Bridge]] to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack331-332&quot; /&gt;

Prior to the attack, the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) dropped leaflets telling the Jordanian army that Israel had no intention to hurt them, and that they should not intervene;&lt;ref name=&quot;iaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] reported the fedayeen had been warned in advance by Egyptian intelligence, and most of the 2,000 Arab commandos who used Karameh as a training base had pulled back into the surrounding hills to snipe at the Israelis. Some 200 guerrillas stayed inside to defend the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;foray&quot;/&gt;  Later, Arafat's deputy, [[Abu Iyad]], claimed in his memoirs that he and Arafat had been tipped off about the Israeli attack by Jordanian officers, who learned it from the [[CIA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;morris368-369&quot;&gt;Morris (1999), pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt;

At 5:30&amp;nbsp;AM on 21 March, the Israeli forces attacked simultaneously on the three bridges.&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy352&quot;&gt;Dupuy (2002), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Combat engineers built a [[pontoon bridge]] in the north and the troops crossed the river.

At 6:30&amp;nbsp;AM, Israeli helicopters started landing the bulk of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh.&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy353&quot;&gt;Dupuy (2002), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town; however, due to difficult weather conditions, the helicopters flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with resistance by Fatah commandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery, the paratroopers suffered heavy losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloody battle at Karameh|work=Sayeret Zanhanim|accessdate=3 September 2008|url=http://www.gal-ed.co.il/zanchanim-palsar/show_item.asp?itemId=55&amp;levelId=59462&amp;itemType=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921173127/http://www.gal-ed.co.il/zanchanim-palsar/show_item.asp?itemId=55&amp;levelId=59462&amp;itemType=0| archivedate= 21 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}{{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a Jordanian infantry brigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug-in Jordanians. Fighting from their entrenched positions, the Jordanians repelled several Israeli assaults.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack332-333&quot; /&gt;

In the south, Jordanian artillery shelling prevented the Israelis from erecting another pontoon bridge on the site of the Abdullah bridge, halting the Israeli advance there.&lt;ref name=&quot;carta-1961&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia= Carta's Atlas of Israel|year=1980|publisher=[[Carta (publisher)|Carta]]|location=[[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]|editor=Evyatar Nur|author=Wallach, Jeuda|author2=Ayalon, Avraham|author3= Yitzhaki, Aryeh|title=Operation Inferno|volume= Volume 2 — The Second Decade 1961–1971|pages=122|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; After crossing the Allenby Bridge, the 7th Armored Brigade spread in three directions from Shuna: One or more companies drove north to Karameh. An infantry battalion and a tank battalion moved east to block the Salt road. And another infantry battalion moved south to assist the force trying to break across the Abdullah Bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack333&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, the force that crossed the Damia Bridge established itself on the east bank. Engineers began constructing a new bridge, and the force advanced east to the Musri junction. After taking Musri, their intended advance south to Karameh was repulsed by the northern brigade of the Jordanian 1st Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack333&quot;/&gt;

The force driving on Karameh via the Allenby bridge broke through and proceeded to the town, arriving shortly before 7:00.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris369&quot;&gt;Morris(1999), p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;  By 8:00 the Israeli forces had taken control of the town, which turned out to be a bigger PLO base than the Israelis expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;herzog205&quot;&gt;Herzog (1982), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;  Combined with the paratroopers, this Israeli force engaged in heavy fighting against the central brigade of the 1st division and a number of Fatah fighters.  Some of the paratroopers and armor drove north to operate in the Fatah camp.  The paratroopers destroyed most of the camp; many of the Palestinians, including Arafat, fled eastward.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack333&quot;/&gt; The rest of the Allenby Bridge force was blocked to the east and south of Shuna, by elements of the 1st Division's central and southern brigades, and by a tank battalion from Salt.&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy353&quot; /&gt; A small force of Israeli infantry and armor, on the right flank of Israeli forces invading from the south, tried to protect the allenby bridge force from attacks by the Jordanian forces deployed near the King Abdullah bridge. The Jordanians attacked with some armor, but the Israelis put up resistance, and the battle turned into a stalemate.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris369&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Karama Battle 4.jpg|thumb|right|Jordanian artillery battery at Karameh, 21 March 1968]]

A large force of Israeli infantry and armor went east to block the road from [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]] to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris369&quot; /&gt; The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions, but was unable to stop the firing.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack333&quot;/&gt; Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy354&quot;&gt;Dupuy (2002), p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 175 houses were blown up.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris369&quot; /&gt;

Meanwhile, Operation Asuta was mounted against a few smaller guerrilla bases south of the [[Dead Sea]], near Safi, where the school bus had struck the mine. The bases were raided by Israeli ground forces with close air support. About 20 Jordanian soldiers and policemen and 20 Fatah fighters were killed, and 27 were taken prisoner. The Israelis suffered no casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris369&quot; /&gt; Frustrated in their hope to entrap the entire PLO force, the Israelis soon pulled out, but had to fight their way back to Israeli territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;foray&quot;/&gt; At 11:00 the Israelis began to withdraw, with [[Sikorsky H-34]] helicopters evacuating the troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;iaf&quot;/&gt; Because orders came down to recover as many vehicles as possible, they only completed their withdrawal by 20:40.&lt;ref name=&quot;carta-1961&quot; /&gt; They had planned a rescue for its two tanks which were left in Jordan, but later withdrew the plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debacle in the desert&quot; /&gt;

Israel accomplished its objective of destroying the Fatah camp,&lt;ref name=&quot;herzog205&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= Rothrock&gt;James Rothrock, Live by the sword: Israel's struggle for existence in the Holy Land, WestBow Press (2011) p.53&lt;/ref&gt; and on a tactical level, the battle did indeed end in Israel's favor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeev Maoz page 246&quot;/&gt; &quot;The Karama operation exposed the vulnerability of PLO units deployed along the Jordan River and so they moved their concentrations up into the mountains. This imposed additional strains on them and made their operations into the West Bank even more involved and difficult than they had been hitherto.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herzog, The Arab-Israeli Wars page 205&quot;/&gt; Politically however, Israel was heavily condemned by the world opinion. [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassador to the UN]], [[Arthur Goldberg]], said &quot;We believe that the military counteractions such as those which have just taken place, on a scale out of proportion to the acts of violence that preceded it, are greatly to be deplored.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;foray&quot;/&gt; US Ambassador to Israel, [[Walworth Barbour]], said that in twenty years time, a historian would write that day down as the beginning of the destruction of Israel. Eban reported the Ambassabor's statement to the cabinet, and [[Menachem Begin]] said such an utterance must not be cited in a cabinet meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;segev&quot;/&gt;

The relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the IDF and was stunning to the Israelis.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuckerS&quot; /&gt; Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own, King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit.&lt;ref name=&quot;assessment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviation&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.jo/books?id=-bXMBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Israel+assumed+that+the+Jordanian+Army+would+ignore+the+invasion|page=79|title=Aviation and Airport Security: Terrorism and Safety Concerns, Second Edition|author=Kathleen Sweet|publisher=CRC Press|date=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the battle of Karameh provided Fatah with a propaganda boost.&lt;ref name=&quot;segev&quot;/&gt; The chief of bureau of the then Israeli Foreign ministry [[Gideon Rafael]] later said that &quot;The operation gave an enormous lift to Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization and irrevocably implanted the Palestine problem onto the international agenda, no longer as a humanitarian issue of homeless refugees, but as a claim to Palestinian statehood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;neff&quot;/&gt; [[Uzi Narkis]], who commanded the operation, resigned as chief of the [[Central Command (Israel)|Central Command]] for a position in the [[Jewish Agency]] shortly after the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;inferno&quot;/&gt;

Jordan claimed to have won the battle and stopped an Israeli drive on [[Balqa Governorate]] in intentions of occupying it and turning into a security buffer zone, which was supposed to serve as a punishment, due to the Jordanian support to the PLO.

Iraq and Syria offered training programs for several thousand guerrillas. The [[Persian Gulf states]], led by [[Kuwait]], raised money for them through a 5% tax on the salaries of their tens of thousands of resident Palestinian workers, and a fund drive in [[Lebanon]] raised $500,000 from [[Beirut]] alone.

Later, the United Nations Security Council issued resolution 248 which condemned the Israeli raid on Jordanian territory and the violation of the cease-fire line, it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged Israel to ensure the safety of civilians in military areas. The resolution affirmed that reprisals were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSC&quot;/&gt;

The battle was the first engagement between the Israelis and Palestinians, in which the latter used suicide bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tass&quot;/&gt;

In a 2011 report by [[Haaretz]], files released by the IDF had contradicted the official Israeli story that claimed that the operation was a retaliatory for the bus incident. The files revealed that the IDF had plans for the two operations, prepared in 1967, one year before the bus incident. Files also revealed that the IDF had practiced crossing the [[Jordan River]] in 1966 during the [[Jordanian occupation of the West Bank]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Debacle in the desert&quot; /&gt;

==Historiography==

===Israeli historiography===
Israel maintains that it had performed a coordinated withdrawal after achieving its goal of destroying the Karameh camp. However, few Israeli military personnel who participated in Karameh agree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debacle in the desert&quot;/&gt;
According to Lt. Col. Arik Regev, chief of Central Command's operations branch, {{cquote|We didn't expect the Jordanian army to fight the way it did. I don't believe that the commander of the 7th Brigade thought that so many of his tanks would be hit. I'm sure that no one thought that the enemy would respond with artillery fire. You're allowed to make a mistake in assessing a situation but, it seems to me, there was a moment when the assessment could have been altered – when we saw that things weren't turning out as we had thought and that the Jordanians weren't fleeing to Amman. Had we thought that the Jordanian army would act as it did, I'm convinced the air force would have struck first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debacle in the desert&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Debacle in the desert|work=Haaretz|accessdate = 13 May 2011|date=29 March 1968|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/debacle-in-the-desert-1.361453}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moshe Brblt, a sergeant in the [[Armored Corps (Israel)|Israeli Armored Corps]] later talked about his participation in Karameh &quot;Everything was burning around me, and whenever I tried I could not get up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gvura.org/a345443-%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%91%D7%99%D7%91%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A8-%D7%95%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%9C-%D7%A4%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%90-%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%99 |title=מסביבי הכל בער ובכל פעם שניסיתי לקום לא הצלחתי|language=he |publisher=Gvura.org |date= |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Asher Porat stated &quot;lessons of the operation became clear that it was a mistake to fight the Jordanian army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeldefense.co.il/he/content/%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%AA |title=תופת |language=he |publisher=Israel Defense |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muki Betser, a commander in the [[Sayeret Matkal]] unit of the Israel Defense Forces wrote in his book, {{cquote|Both military and political decision makers responsible for the operation worked to make sure the public never knew of the debacle. Instead, in newspaper interviews and speeches, the politicians and generals made Karameh sound like a smashing success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secret Soldier&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.jo/books?id=qvfrqsUyHYgC&amp;pg=PT23&amp;dq=%22both+military+and+political+decision+makers+responsible+for+the+operation+worked+to+make+sure+that+the%22|page=200|date=22 June 2011|author=Muki Betser|title=Secret Soldier|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Jordanian and Palestinian historiography===
Arab history of the war mentions that Israel had entered the Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had defeated the Arabs in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern plateau of the Jordan River basin, namely [[Balqa Governorate]], in order to create a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ammon&quot;/&gt;

The Battle of Karameh was the subject of many artworks, stamps and posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineposterproject.org/special-collection/battle-of-al-karameh|title=Battle of Al Karameh|work=palestineposterproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
