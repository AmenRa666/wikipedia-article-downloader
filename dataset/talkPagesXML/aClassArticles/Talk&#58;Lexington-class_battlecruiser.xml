== 2008 found... ==

...me asking this question. :) Minor technicality, but what is with starting so many sentences with &quot;1917 found the ships...&quot; &quot;1918 found...&quot; etc.?

Another question (Conversion section): &quot;While the conversion would have better anti-torpedo protection, larger magazines for aircraft bombs ''than a keel-up carrier'' and a longer landing space&quot; - needs clarification. Why would a dedicated design be in any part worse than an adhoc conversion? I presume the text refers to a specific carrier proposal, but what was it?

== &quot;Sunk after the Battle of Coral Sea&quot; ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Both saw extensive action in the Second World War, with ''Lexington'' conducting many raids before being sunk after the [[Battle of Coral Sea]] and ''Saratoga'' involved in battles around the Pacific and the Far East.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minor question here, but did it sink ''after'' the battle, or ''during'' it.

== Lexington painting size issue ==

I'm not familiar enough with image processing on Wikipedia to tackle this myself, so...

The small image titled &quot;A painting of the Lexington class' original planned configuration&quot; in the section &quot;Original and subsequent redesigns&quot; is actually linking to a 7MB GIF.  This is slightly excessive for the 120x72 image being displayed, and considerable slows the loading of the page.  That this article is linked for the Wiki-En homepage today doesn't help either.

Anyway, http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Lexington_original_configuration_edited.gif should be processed into a smaller file, and that linked, or if that's not possible, the image should probably be replaced or removed (which would be unfortunate, but I don't think it's reasonable to have a 7MB image in the article).

== Other Battlecruiser Class ==

There was an ''Alaska'' class battlecruiser (CB) class produced during WWII, and therefore the ''Lexingtons'' were not the only battlecruisers ever ordered by the US. 
Despite the official discouragement against referring to them as battlecruisers, and their designation as &quot;large cruisers&quot;, they were designated as '''CB'''. These ships were of about 34,000 tons full load with 9x 12 inch guns, so any other designation seems to be an exercise in semantics.

== Oh no an error! ==

The lead section reads: ''Six—given names from the American Revolutionary War'' &amp; etc. During the ARW there were no Continental Navy ships named ''Constitution'', ''Constellation'' or ''United States''. Those names originate from the first [[Original six frigates of the United States Navy|six frigates]] of 1794... not that I'd know anything about those. Ed needs a trout slap. --[[User:Brad101|Brad]] ([[User talk:Brad101|talk]]) 03:39, 17 March 2010 (UTC)

:::Something you can expand on in this article. The names ''Constitution'' and ''Constellation'' were still being used by {{USS|Constitution}} and {{USS|Constellation|1854}} respectively. In order to use the names for this class the other ships were renamed [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c13/constitution.htm ''Old Constitution''] and [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c13/constellation-ii.htm ''Old Constellation''] respectively. In fact ''Constitution'' was the original intended name for this class. DANFS covers the information and there are further refs to this in the ''Constitution'' article.

Thanks Brad.

Ok a bit at a time and I'm paraphrasing:
* In October 1915 a tentative 5 year program called for 10 battleships, 6 battle cruisers and 10 destroyers to be completed by 1922. In the first year 3 battle cruisers were to be built. Plans called for a parity with Great Britain by 1925. Program submitted to Congress in December 1915 with strong support from President Woodrow Wilson. 2 June 1916 the House passes a compromise bill replacing 5 battleships with five battle cruisers as first reports from the battle of Jutland(p. 71) suggested that battle cruisers had been overvalued. The Senate restored the original 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers and 10 scouts and placed it into a 3 year time frame, fiscal years 1917–1919. This act passed on 29 August 1916.(p. 72) --[[User:Brad101|Brad]] ([[User talk:Brad101|talk]]) 20:34, 27 March 2010 (UTC)
*The six ''Constellation''-class battlecruisers (first time I've ever seen them called such) were paid for in FY 17 for CC's 1–4; FY 18 for CC-5 and FY 19 for CC-6 (p.72) --[[User:Brad101|Brad]] ([[User talk:Brad101|talk]]) 21:19, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

*ten destroyers or scout cruisers?
::He is referring to the [[Omaha class cruiser]].
**&quot; first reports from the battle of Jutland(p. 71) suggested that battle cruisers had been overvalued.&quot; -- why would battlecruisers be replacing battleships then?
::Doesn't make sense to me either but dat what the book says.

== Queen Mary vs Lexington armour comparison  ==

The 3&quot; dimension for Lexington's turret ''roof'' plate is compared to the 9&quot; turret ''face'' on the Lion Class, the article states as a result of this comparison that Lexington et al were to carry only 1/3 the armour of the already lightly protected Lions. 

This is misleading as the turret's face is typically 3-4 times heavier than the roof. Though the fate of Queen Mary is telling to the weakness the Lexington Class' protection scheme, the weight of armour carried by each class is broadly similar, rather than grossly in favour of either vessel.

== Were &quot;The Lexington-class battlecruisers ... the only class of battlecruiser to ever be ordered by the United States Navy&quot;? ==

Referencing Wikipedia's excerpt on the Alaska Class &quot;[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_class|Alaska Class]]&quot; ships of late WWII, I question the validity of the above claim. Apparently, the US Navy classified them as Large Cruisers (CB). Yet, the claim of the Lexington Class as the only US battlecruiser class ever ordered by the US Navy should, I think, be notated with a reference to the Alaska Class. I am not familiar with the reasoning of the Navy when determining the Alaska class classification but, by design, it's difficult to recognize the Alaska class as a cruiser and to see it, legitimately, as anything other than a battlecruiser.
