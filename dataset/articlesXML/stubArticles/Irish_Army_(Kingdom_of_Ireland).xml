      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4761">The '''Irish Army''' was the [[standing army]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] which existed between 1541 and 1801. It was amalgamated into the [[British Army]] following the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]], although some roles continued to exist separately.

==Origins==
The origins of the Irish Army were in the traditional royal garrisons of the old [[Lordship of Ireland]]. Numbers were low during peacetime, and during the sixteenth century the force would be supplemented by assembling [[militia]] in [[The Pale]] and the raising of troops by loyal [[Gaelic Irish|Gaelic]] chieftains during emergencies. It was financed by votes in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], although this was sometimes supplemented by subsidies sent over from London. The principal task of the Army was to defend Ireland from internal disorder and invasion by foreign powers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Irish security situation had come under strain during the rebellion of [[Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare]] in the 1530s.&lt;ref&gt;A Military History of Ireland p.116-135&lt;/ref&gt; The Fitzgerald family had traditionally been the leading Anglo-Irish lords in the country, serving as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]]s. Their rebellion exposed the weakness of [[Henry VIII]]'s forces in the Lordship of Ireland, with the rebels securing large gains and launching a [[Siege of Dublin]].

==War of the Three Kingdoms==
During the [[Bishop's War|Scottish Crisis]] of the early 1640s, a separate force known as the [[New Irish Army]] was formed which dwarfed the &quot;old&quot; Irish Army in size. Mainly drawn from the Catholic Gaelic inhabitants of Ulster, it was rumoured that Charles I planned to lead the New Irish Army against his enemies in the English Parliament in the months before the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]]. When the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out, the Irish Army was too small in size to cope. Many soldiers of the New Irish Army had joined the rebels, who were able to seize large swathes of Ireland.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Large numbers of reinforcements were shipped over from England, while Scotland despatched a [[Covenanter Army in Ireland|separate force]] to [[Ulster]]. Irish Protestants in counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Donegal|Donegal]] raised their own force known as the [[Lagan Army]], which was nominally under the command of the Crown, but largely acted independently. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the [[Irish Confederacy]] continued to insist upon their loyalty to the Crown, and hinted that [[Charles I of Ireland|Charles]] had [[Proclamation of Dungannon|endorsed the rebellion]].

==Williamite War==
Following the accession of [[James II of England|James II]] in the 1680s, the [[Viceroy of Ireland|Viceroy]] [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Tyrconnell]] conducted a purge of Protestant officers of the Army, replacing them with Catholics who had previously been generally excluded because of the [[Penal Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs 1980, pp. 56-79&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the Irish Army fought on both sides during the [[Williamite War]] that followed. Irish Protestants unhappy with the rule of King James launched a rebellion, forming the [[Army of the North (Ireland)|Army of the North]] and declaring [[William III of Ireland|William III]] to be King. The Catholic regiments went into exile following their defeat and served in Continental European Armies as &quot;[[Wild Geese (soldiers)|Wild Geese]]‚Äù. They continued to wear the [[Red coat (Irish army)|red coat]] of the Irish Army.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

William reformed the Irish Army, using it as a source of recruits for his international coalition during the [[Nine Years War]], and deploying it across Ireland as a garrison to prevent any potential Jacobite rising. Following the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], William planned to maintain a much larger standing army in Ireland but he was forced by Parliamentary pressure to reduce this to 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;Childs 1987, p.194-202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amalgamation==
The Irish Army was amalgamated into the British Army following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], although some roles continued to exist separately.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
