Colonel '''Marie Augstin Gaston Cros''' (known as '''Gaston Cros''') (6 October 1861&amp;nbsp;– 10 May 1915) was a French army officer and archaeologist.  He was born in [[Alsace]] and was displaced when that territory was incorporated into the [[German Empire]].  He joined the [[French Army]] as a [[lieutenant]] and saw action in [[Tonkin]] before spending several years surveying in [[Tunisia]], receiving the honours of membership of Vietnamese and Tunisian orders and appointment as a chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]].  In 1901 Cros was appointed head of the French archaeological expedition to [[Girsu]], [[Iraq]] to continue the work of [[Ernest de Sarzec]].  His work over the next five years included the  tracing of the {{convert|32.5|ft}} thick city wall and for his work there received a letter of commendation from [[Gaston Doumergue]], the Minister of Fine Arts, and the award of the Golden Palms of the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]].  Promoted to [[lieutenant-colonel]], Cros served in the [[French protectorate of Morocco]] from 1913, seeing action in the [[Zaian War]].

Upon the outbreak of the [[First World War]] Cros was recalled to metropolitan France and fought in defence of [[Paris]] at the [[First Battle of the Marne]], leading an [[ad hoc]] unit of [[zouave]]s and [[tirailleur]]s.  He was wounded and spent two days directing his troops from a horse-drawn carriage before he was forced to leave his command.  On 15 September 1914 he was promoted to [[colonel]] and subsequently received command of the 2nd Moroccan Brigade which he led at the [[Battle of the Yser]] and the [[Second Battle of Artois]]. It was at Artois that he was killed in a German counter-attack.  Cros' name is recorded alongside that of [[Colonel Pein]], who commanded the 1st Moroccan Brigade at Artois, on the [[Moroccan Division Memorial]] at [[Vimy]].

== Early life ==
Marie Augstin Gaston Cros was born at 2.00am on 6 October 1861 to Hippolyte Cros, a lawyer, and Marie Petronille Reine Scherb at [[Saverne]], [[Bas-Rhin]] in the [[Alsace]] region.&lt;ref name=boy/&gt;&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;  After Alsace was incorporated into the [[German Empire]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871 Cros' family chose to retain their French nationality and moved to [[Lunéville]] in [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]].&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;record14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Legion of Honour records - page 14|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH048/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0634013v014.htm|work=Base Léonore|publisher=Ministère de la Culture|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cros volunteered for a five-year commission with the [[French Army]] on 25 October 1881 at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]].&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;  Four days later he was enrolled into the [[Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr]] as a cadet, from which he graduated on 1 October 1883, ranked 261 out of 342 in his class.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;&lt;ref name=record14/&gt; Cros was commissioned into the [[128th Infantry Regiment (France)|128th Infantry Regiment]] as a [[sub-lieutenant]] and attended the L'Ecole du Tir (marksmanship school) in 1885 where he ranked 25th out of 76 participants.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;

Cros transferred to the 4th [[Tonkinese Rifles]] on 3 June 1887 and saw active service in [[Tonkin]] (northern Vietnam) from 19 June 1887 to 14 September 1888, joining the [[105th Infantry Regiment (France)|105th Infantry Regiment]] as a [[lieutenant]] on 5 October 1887.&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;record15&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Legion of Honour records - page 15|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH048/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0634013v015.htm|work=Base Léonore|publisher=Ministère de la Culture|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was awarded the [[Tonkin Expedition commemorative medal]] for his work in the country.&lt;ref name=record15/&gt;

On 25 January 1889 Cros transferred to the 4th [[Zouave]] Regiment and was on active service in [[Tunisia]] from 11 March 1889 to 27 April 1898.&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;&lt;ref name=record15/&gt;  He was attached to the Army Geographic Service from 1891 to 1893, and made several topographical surveys of the Sahara desert.&lt;ref name=king/&gt;  Cros was appointed a knight of the [[Order of the Dragon of Annam]] and a member of the Tunisian [[Order of Glory (Tunisia)|Order of Glory]] on 10 October 1889 in recognition of his service in Tonkin and Tunisia.&lt;ref name=&quot;record14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Legion of Honour records - page 21|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH048/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0634013v021.htm|work=Base Léonore|publisher=Ministère de la Culture|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] on 10 July 1894 and became a chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]] on 29 December 1896.&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legion of Honour records - page 17|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH048/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0634013v017.htm|work=Base Léonore|publisher=Ministère de la Culture|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cros transferred to the [[39th Infantry Regiment (France)|39th Infantry Regiment]] on 5 April 1898 and served with them in [[Algeria]] from 11 November 1899 to 1 June 1900.&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;&lt;ref name=record15/&gt;

== Archaeological work at Tello ==
[[File:Votive dog Louvre AO4349 n2.jpg|thumb|A [[votive]] dog excavated by Cros from Tello in 1904]]
From December 1901 Cros was placed in charge of the French-led Tello Expedition to the archaeological site of [[Girsu]] in [[Iraq]].  He replaced the late [[Ernest de Sarzec]], the French consul of [[Basra]], who died in 1901 and had been excavating Tello since 1877, having initiated the rediscovery of the [[Sumer]]ian civilization.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;&lt;ref name=caubet/&gt;   The appointment of a military man to this position might have been influenced by the revolt of the [[Muntafiq]] Arabs against the [[Ottoman Empire]] which created a hostile environment for the archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Potts| first = D.T.

[[File:Issue of barley rations.JPG|thumb|right|One of the [[Cuneiform]] Tello tablets]]
Cros undertook numerous excavations at Tello producing significant numbers of artefacts, some dating from the earliest periods of Sumerian civilization.&lt;ref name=king/&gt;  One of his achievements, considered his most important at Tello, was the tracing of the great city wall which was {{convert|32.5|ft|m}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baikie|first=James|title=Glamour of the Near East Excavation 1927|publisher=Kessinger|location=2003|page=233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FrtAuLgnuYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baikie|first=James|title=The Life of the Ancient East: Being Some Chapters of the Romance of Modern Excavation 1923|year=2004|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMfnjAft5PQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903 he discovered a doorway in the vicinity of de Sarzac's famous cuniform tablets that provided evidence that the tablets were stored as part of a state administrative archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Jerold S.|last2=Schwartz|first2=Glenn M.|title=The Study of the Ancient Near East in the Twenty-first Century|date=1996|publisher=Eisenbrauns|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hc1Yp0VcjoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Tello he remained nominally with the 39th Infantry Regiment, transferring to the [[80th Infantry Regiment (France)|80th Infantry Regiment]] on 17 February 1903.&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;  His archaeological work was recognised by promotion to [[chef de bataillon]] (roughly equivalent to major), in the [[116th Infantry Regiment (France)|116th Infantry Regiment]], on 24 June 1905 and by appointment as an officer of the Legion of Honour on 12 March 1906.&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legion of Honour records - page 1|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH048/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0634013v001.htm|work=Base Léonore|publisher=Ministère de la Culture|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cros transferred to the [[33rd Infantry Regiment (France)|33rd Infantry Regiment]] on 25 May 1906 and to the [[5th Infantry Regiment (France)|5th Infantry Regiment]] on 22 December of that year.&lt;ref name=record14/&gt;  He left Tello after his posting to the 5th Regiment but returned in 1909 to conclude his research, for which he was commended by [[Gaston Doumergue]], the Minister of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;  His research, published in the book ''Nouvelles Fouilles de Tello'' (New Excavations at Tello) in 1911, was welcomed by the British [[Royal Asiatic Society]] as some of the most important on the subject of ancient Sumeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinches|first=T.G.|title=Notices of Books|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]] | series =  (New Series)|date=July 1912|volume=44|issue=3|pages=829–831|doi=10.1017/S0035869X00147598|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5702040|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Cros left Tello in 1909 the French government was unable to find a suitable successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Potts| first = D.T.| title = A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East  (Google eBook)| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=12hCMwEACAAJ| year = 2012| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| location = Chichester, UK| isbn = 978-1-4051-8988-0| pages = 58–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cros received the Golden Palms of the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] for his academic work.&lt;ref name=boy/&gt;  A replacement was eventually found in 1914 but the outbreak of war prevented his assuming the post and the next chief of the French mission wasn't appointed until 1928.&lt;ref name=caubet/&gt;

Cros was later promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] of the 1st Algerian [[Tirailleurs]].  In April 1913 he transferred to the 5th Algerian Tirailleurs and undertook expeditions in Western Morocco from May to August 1913 for which he was commended.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;  He subsequently participated in the [[Zaian War]] under General [[Hubert Lyautey]], leading a column from [[Rabat]] to capture [[Khénifra]].&lt;ref name=hois/&gt;  Other columns were led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Henri Claudel]] from [[Meknes]] and Colonel [[Noël Garnier-Duplessix]] from [[Kasbah Tadla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hois&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoisington| first = William A| title = Lyautey and the French Conquest of Morocco| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iBn1PHEGGokC| year = 1995| publisher = Macmillan:St Martin's Press| isbn = 0-312-12529-1| page = 66| place = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lyautey| first = Louis Hubert Gonzalve| title = Lyautey l'africain: textes et lettres du maréchal Lyautey, Volume 2| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaxyAAAAMAAJ| year = 1954| publisher = Plon| language = French| pages = 187 &amp; 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September Cros received temporary promotion to colonel and on 20 October was given command of the 2nd Moroccan Brigade at the [[Battle of the Yser]].&lt;ref name=boy/&gt;  His promotion was confirmed as permanent on 1 November 1914 and he became a commander of the Legion of Honour on 10 April 1915.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;  He also received a further mention in dispatches as &quot;a brave soldier, an experienced great leader, wise, prudent, with natural authority&quot; and was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] with palm.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;  In the spring he wrote to an archaeological colleague, [[Léon Heuzey]], telling him that &quot;I continue with my work as an archaeologist.  As at Tello I record earthworks, but instead of artefacts of [[Gudea]] I find German shells, it is not without excitement&quot;.&lt;ref name=huezey/&gt;  Cros was appointed a commander of the Legion of Honour on 10 April 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legion of Honour records - page 3|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH048/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0634013v003.htm|work=Base Léonore|publisher=Ministère de la Culture|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vimy Ridge - Moroccan Division Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|The Vimy Ridge Moroccan Division Memorial bearing Cros' name]]
Later that year Cros led his brigade, as part of the [[1st Moroccan Infantry Division]], at the [[Second Battle of Artois]] - an allied attempt to capture [[Vimy Ridge]] with an assault on a {{convert|13|mi|km}} wide stretch of the front.&lt;ref name=&quot;ffl&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Geraghty| first = Tony| title = March Or Die: France and the Foreign Legion| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n5kyh80JjcgC| year = 2001| publisher = Harper Collins| location = London| isbn = 0-00-653174-1| pages = 161–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cros took particular care to inspire a keen [[esprit de corps]] in his men and on the eve of the attack told them: &quot;I am your father and you know that I love you as my children, if you want to show me that you love me in return, fight and kill lots of Boche&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Meynier| first = Gilbert| title = L'Algérie révélée: La guerre de 1914–1918 et le premier quart du XXe siècle| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Us_7F_9JfhcC| year = 1981| publisher = Librairie Droz| location = Geneva| language = French| isbn = 978-2-600-04098-3| page = 440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a [[French Foreign Legion]] unit led by [[Colonel Pein]].&lt;ref name=ffl/&gt;  The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, {{convert|3|mi|km}} distant.&lt;ref name=ffl/&gt;  However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of [[Vimy]] and [[Givenchy-en-Gohelle]].&lt;ref name=ffl/&gt;  The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed.&lt;ref name=charvat/&gt;  Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division killed in that action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.&lt;ref name=ffl/&gt;

Cros' colleague Huezey described him later as &quot;a trainer of men and a keen naturalist whose integrity was matched by his intelligence and bravery.&lt;ref name=huezey/&gt;  His medals and uniform are held in the collection of the [[Musée zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg]] and he is remembered in the inscription on the [[Moroccan Division Memorial]] at Vimy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chromamix I|url=http://www.musees-strasbourg.org/sites_expos/CHROMAMIX1/RESOURCES_CRHO/visuels_chroma.pdf|publisher=Musée Zoologique de la Ville de Strasbourg|accessdate=29 December 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;
