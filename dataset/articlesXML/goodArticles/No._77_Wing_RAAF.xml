'''No. 77 Wing''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] of World War II. It formed part of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (later the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]]) at its establishment in November 1943, when it comprised three [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s equipped with [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] dive bombers. No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing commenced operations in early 1944, flying out of [[Nadzab]], Papua New Guinea. Soon afterwards, however, the Vengeance units were withdrawn from combat and replaced with squadrons flying [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Bostons]], [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[Bristol Beaufort]]s. The wing saw action in the assaults on [[Battle of Noemfoor|Noemfoor]], [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Tarakan]], and [[Battle of North Borneo|North Borneo]], by which time it was an all-Beaufighter formation made up of [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;22]], [[No. 30 Squadron RAAF|30]] and [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF|31 Squadrons]]. It was to have taken part in the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Battle of Balikpapan]] in June 1945, but unsuitable landing grounds meant that the Beaufighter units were withdrawn to [[Morotai]], sitting out the remainder of the war before returning to Australia, where they disbanded, along with the wing headquarters, in 1946.

==History==
[[File:OG0680Vengeance1944.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Vengeance dive bombers of No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron at Nadzab, Papua New Guinea, in February 1944]]
No. 77 Wing formed the [[Close air support|attack]] component of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (No.&amp;nbsp;10 OG), which was established on 13&amp;nbsp;November 1943. The group was to act as a mobile strike force capable of supporting Allied ground and naval units while they advanced against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]] (SWPA), as distinct from the RAAF's [[RAAF area commands|area commands]] in Northern Australia, which had a geographically based static defence function.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.182–183,198–200]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.168-170&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.168–170&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] E.G. Fyfe, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing consisted of three flying squadrons operating [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] dive bombers, and various ancillary units. The Vengeances, which had only recently been acquired by Australia, equipped [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp; 21]], [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|23]] and [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|24 Squadrons]]. They were to be protected on their attack missions by No.&amp;nbsp;10 OG's [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] component, [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]], operating [[Curtis P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss Kittyhawks]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered at [[Nadzab]], Papua New Guinea, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing only became fully operational on 18&amp;nbsp;February 1944, following the arrival of Nos.&amp;nbsp;21 and 23 Squadrons from [[Lowood, Queensland|Lowood]], Queensland. However No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron, which was already based in the theatre of operations, was able to carry out its first sortie on 17&amp;nbsp;January, bombing targets along [[Shaggy Ridge]] in support of the [[Australian 7th Division]]. Throughout February the Vengeances, escorted by No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing Kittyhawks, concentrated on harassing the retreating [[20th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 20th Division]], and attacking enemy airfields in the [[Madang Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.188–192&lt;/ref&gt; In March, a decision was made to withdraw the dive bombers from operations due to their inferiority to newer equipment.  Three RAAF squadrons—[[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22]] flying [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Bostons]], [[No. 30 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30]] flying [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s, and one other from [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]] flying [[Bristol Beaufort]]s—were assigned to the wing as replacements.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.196–198&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:22 Sqn (AWM OG1732).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boston of No.&amp;nbsp;22 Squadron being prepared for a sortie at Noemfoor in October 1944]]
Operating with its new squadrons and aircraft, No.&amp;nbsp; 77 Wing took part in the [[Battle of Noemfoor]], commencing in June 1944. Wing headquarters relocated to [[Noemfoor Island]] in July, followed by Nos.&amp;nbsp;22 and 30 Squadrons the next month.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/15.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.237–242]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', p.377&lt;/ref&gt; This was No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing's composition on 25&amp;nbsp;October 1944, when No.&amp;nbsp;10 OG's name was changed to the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]], ostensibly to emphasise &quot;the formation's impressive size and ambitious purpose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.168-170&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.297-299&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.297–299]&lt;/ref&gt; That month, the wing's aircraft were credited with sinking 24 enemy transport ships and barges in support of the Allied landings during the [[Battle of Leyte]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.302–303&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the wing advanced to the island of [[Morotai]], where it attacked Japanese airfields, shipping, and infrastructure on [[Sulawesi|Celebes]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/18.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.309]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] had taken over command of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p.647n]&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation's complement had been augmented by [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;31 Squadron]], a Beaufighter unit previously based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, as part of [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.297-299&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/23.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.379]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;22 Squadron was withdrawn to Noemfoor in December to re-equip with Beaufighters; upon its return No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing became an all-Beaufighter formation, operating three squadrons of the type.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.311–312&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first week of January 1945, No. &amp;nbsp;77 Wing's aircraft undertook 142 missions against targets in [[Halmahera]], Celebes, and Morotai.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.384&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the Beaufighters provided air cover during Operation Oboe One, the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Battle of Tarakan]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.453–459]&lt;/ref&gt; In the days leading up to  Operation Oboe Six, the [[Battle of North Borneo]], No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing surgically attacked enemy targets at [[Labuan]], sometimes within only 100&amp;nbsp;metres of Allied demolition teams laying charges to breach obstacles on the beach prior to the landings. Read personally led No.&amp;nbsp;31 Squadron into action during the battle on 10&amp;nbsp;June 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.469–471]&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first RAAF pilot to land at the newly operational [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] airfield on 28&amp;nbsp;June. The following month, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing was to have taken part in the final Allied offensive of the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]], Operation Oboe Two, the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Battle of Balikpapan]]. However Tarakan proved to be unsuitable for the Beaufighters to operate from, and they were withdrawn to Morotai, where they largely sat out the rest of the Pacific War.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/29.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.482–483]&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing headquarters transferred to [[Deniliquin Airport|Deniliquin]], New South Wales, in December 1945,&lt;ref name=DVA&gt;[http://clik.dva.gov.au/history-library/part-3-order-battle/ch-2-order-battle-air-force/s-2-headquarters Order of Battle&amp;nbsp;– Air Force&amp;nbsp;– Headquarters] at [[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]]. Retrieved on 12 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and was joined there by Nos.&amp;nbsp;22 and 30 Squadrons, both of which disbanded in August 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11057.asp 22 Squadron RAAF] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

Retrieved on 12 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing headquarters disbanded at Deniliquin in November.&lt;ref name=DVA/&gt;
