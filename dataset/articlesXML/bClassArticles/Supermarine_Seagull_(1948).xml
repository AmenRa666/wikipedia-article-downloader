The '''Supermarine Seagull''' was a British [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]], military [[flying boat]] and the last to be built by the [[Supermarine]] company. Design started during the [[World War II|Second World War]] but it did not fly until three years after the war had ended and the project was cancelled without it being adopted for service.

==Development==
In October 1940, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification S.12/40]] to Supermarine and [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] for a catapult-launched, [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibian]], reconnaissance and spotter aircraft to replace the [[Supermarine Walrus]] and [[Supermarine Sea Otter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;london230&quot;&gt;London 2003, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; An order for three prototypes of Supermarine's aircraft was issued in March 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;london230&quot; /&gt;

There was an interruption in design due to the necessity of moving the Supermarine design office, after the bombing of the facility at [[Woolston, Hampshire|Woolston]]. Further delays were caused by the extensive wind tunnel testing that was needed and the change from a [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] to the more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]]. Also, the design specification was changed in 1944 to a new requirement, S.14/44 (later S.14/44/2&lt;ref name=&quot;london230&quot; /&gt;) - the role of the aircraft being changed from ship-based reconnaissance and gunnery spotting to land-based [[Air-sea rescue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aer p620-1&quot;&gt;Gunston 1976, pp. 620–621.&lt;/ref&gt; This change removed the four-gun turret the design had featured.&lt;ref name=&quot;And p170&quot;&gt;Andrews and Morgan 1981, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prototype - Seagull [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial]] ''PA143'' - first took off on 14 July 1948 from [[Southampton Water]], flown by test pilot [[Mike Lithgow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;london231&quot; /&gt; The second aircraft - PA147 - flew in September 1949, and was used for [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] trials on {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} later in that year,&lt;ref name=&quot;london231&quot; /&gt; during which it demonstrated the capability to carry five passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;braas&quot; /&gt; Experiments were also carried out with [[JATO|rocket assisted]] take-offs.&lt;ref name=&quot;London 2003, p. 232&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1950s, helicopters were taking over the air-sea rescue role. In 1952, the two completed prototypes and the partially built third aircraft, PA152, were scrapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;London 2003, p. 232&quot;&gt;London 2003, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Seagull had an all-metal construction with a two spar [[parasol wing]] mounted on a pylon connecting it to the fuselage. The single engine, a [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]] drove [[contra-rotating propellers]]; radiators were mounted below the engine in the pylon. The rear of the pylon accommodated an observer's position with two windows. An eye bolt was fitted on the wing, behind the engine, so the aircraft could be easily lifted from the water by crane.

The wings were fitted with [[Flap (aircraft)|slotted flaps]] and full length [[leading edge slats]] and could be folded for compact, ship-board stowage. They also had a variable [[Angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]], pivoting at the front [[Spar (aviation)|spar]] and actuated by an electrically driven [[jackscrew]] attached to the rear spar. This arrangement reduced stalling speed and increased lift, allowing the aircraft to use a smaller wing – compactness being an important feature for a ship-borne aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;london230&quot; /&gt;

Supermarine had tested this arrangement in the [[Supermarine Type 322|Type 322]] and its capability was demonstrated when test pilot Mike Lithgow flew a Seagull at only {{convert|35|mph}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;london231&quot;&gt;London 2003, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1950, a Seagull, flown by [[Les Colquhoun]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Here and There |magazine=Flight |volume= LVIII|issue= 2172 |date=10 August 1950 |page=104 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1950/1950%20-%201488.html |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; competing in the [[Air League]] Cup Race gained the air-speed record for amphibian aircraft over a {{convert|100|km|adj=on|0}} course, by flying at an average speed of {{convert|241.9|mph}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;London 2003, p. 232&quot;/&gt;

The hull was a normal frame and [[longeron]] design with [[Chine (boating)|chine]]s. The [[tailplane]], carried on top of the [[fin]], had a very large [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], with smaller fins mounted on its tips perpendicular to its surface. A third fin was later added to the centre after testing of the first prototype had revealed an instability in yaw. This was added to the second prototype while it was still being constructed.

The [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] retracted into bays on either side of the fuselage and could be easily removed, saving {{convert|180|kg|lb}} of weight when the aircraft was operating as a pure flying-boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;braas&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The Seagull was also fitted with an [[Tailhook|arrestor hook]] for carrier landings; mounting points for [[JATO]] rockets were located just above the wheel wells.

The crew normally consisted of three.&lt;ref name=&quot;london230&quot; /&gt;  During air-sea rescue work, a Seagull would be able to accommodate a pilot, navigator and medic, plus up to seven survivors.&lt;ref name=&quot;braas&quot; /&gt;
