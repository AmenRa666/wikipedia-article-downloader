[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (28 February 1724{{snd}}14 September 1807), known as '''The Viscount Townshend''' from 1764 to 1787, was a [[Great Britain|British]] soldier and [[politician]]. After serving at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and the [[Battle of Culloden]] during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising]], Townshend took command of the British forces for the closing stages of the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. He went on to be [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] or Viceroy where he introduced measures aimed at increasing the size of Irish regiments, reducing corruption in Ireland and improving the Irish economy. In cooperation with Prime Minister North in London he imposed much greater British control over Ireland. He also served as [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], first in the [[North Ministry]] and then in the [[Fox–North Coalition]].

==Military career==

===Early years===
Born the son of [[Charles Townshend, 3rd Viscount Townshend]] and Audrey Ethelreda Townshend (née Harrison),&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27624?docPos=2|title=George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townshend was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TWNT740G|name=Townshend, George}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the army as a volunteer in Summer 1743 and first saw action at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] in June 1743 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name=dcb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=2692|title=George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[7th Queen's Own Hussars|7th Regiment of Dragoons]] in April 1745&lt;ref name=heath277&gt;Heathcote, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and saw action in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Townshend, George Townshend, 1st Marquess |volume=27 |pages=112-113}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fought at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in April 1746 during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising]], and having been appointed an [[aide-de-Camp]] to the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] and having transferred to the [[Lancashire Fusiliers|20th Regiment of Foot]] in February 1747, he took part in the [[Battle of Lauffeld]] in July 1747 during the later stages of the War of the Austrian Succession.&lt;ref name=heath277/&gt;

While serving in Belgium, Townshend was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|Norfolk]] unopposed in 1747.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He became a captain in the [[Grenadier Guards|1st Regiment of Footguards]] and lieutenant colonel in the Army on 25 February 1748.&lt;ref name=heath277/&gt; In 1751 he wrote a pamphlet which was deeply critical of Cumberland's military skills.&lt;ref name=heath277/&gt; Meanwhile, he argued in parliament that [[Court-martial|courts martial]] rather than commanding officers should be responsible for discipline in the Army, pressed for a larger [[militia]] and smaller standing army and was personally responsible for ensuring that the Militia Act of 1757 reached the statute book.&lt;ref name=heath278&gt;Heathcote, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to the rank of [[colonel]] on 6 May 1758, he became [[colonel]] of the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot|64th Regiment of Foot]] in June 1759.&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt;

===Seven Years' War===
Townshend was given command of a brigade in [[Quebec]] under General [[James Wolfe]]; when the latter died on 13 September 1759, and his second-in-command ([[Robert Monckton]]) was wounded, Townshend took command of the British forces during [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt; He received [[Quebec City]]'s surrender on 18 September 1759.&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt; However, he held General Wolfe in much contempt (drawing Wolfe in caricature he created Canada's first cartoon&lt;ref&gt;Mosher, Terry. &quot;Drawn and Quartered.&quot; Leader and Dreamers Commemorative Issue. Maclean's. 2004: 171. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;), and was harshly criticized upon his return to Great Britain for that reason (Wolfe was a popular hero throughout the country).&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt; Nevertheless, he became colonel of the [[28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot|28th Regiment of Foot]] in October 1759, was promoted to [[major general]] on 6 March 1761 and fought at the [[Battle of Villinghausen]] in July 1761.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt; In May 1762 he took command of a division of the Anglo-Portuguese army, with the local rank of [[lieutenant-general]], to protect [[Portugal]] during the [[Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)|Spanish invasion of Portugal]].&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

===Post-war===
[[File:Site of Fort Townshend August 2012 St. John's 01.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Site of Fort Townshend in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]]]
Townshend became [[Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance]] in the [[Grenville Ministry]] in March 1763 and succeeded his father as [[Marquess Townshend|Viscount Townshend]] in March 1764.&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt;

==Viceroy of Ireland==
He went on to be [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in the [[Chatham Ministry]] in August 1767 and introduced measures aimed at increasing the size of Irish regiments, reducing corruption in Ireland and improving the Irish economy.&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt; After the [[Parliament of Ireland]] rejected his money bill, Townshend [[Legislative session|prorogue]]d parliament in November 1767, making himself very unpopular in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Most important, he collaborated with Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] in London in imposing much greater British control over Ireland.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Later life==
Promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 30 April 1770, he was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in September 1772.&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt;

Townshend returned to office as [[Master-General of the Ordnance]] in the [[North Ministry]] in October 1772.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=11292|date=13 October 1772|startpage=1|supp=|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of his unpopular tour in Ireland, he found himself fighting a duel with [[Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont]], an Irish Peer, on 2 February 1773, badly wounding the Earl with a bullet in the groin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gilchrist |first=James P  |title=A brief display of the origin and history of ordeals: trials by battle; courts of chivalry or honour; and the decision of private quarrels by single combat: also, a chronological register of the principal duels fought from the accession of His late Majesty to the present time |publisher=James P Gilchrist |year=1821 |location=London |pages=105–106 |url=https://archive.org/stream/abriefdisplayor00gilcgoog#page/n159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Townshend became colonel of the [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)|2nd Dragoon Guards]] in July 1773.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=11374|date=27 July 1773|startpage=2|supp=|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1779 [[Richard Edwards (c. 1715–1795)|Richard Edwards]], [[List of lieutenant governors of Newfoundland and Labrador|Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador]], began work on Fort Townshend, a fortification in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], naming it after Lord Townshend.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, vol. 2, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Townshend stood down as Master-General of the Ordnance in March 1782 when the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]] came to power but, having been promoted to full [[general]] on 26 November 1782,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=12391|date=23 September 1782|startpage=1|supp=|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was restored to the post of Master-General of the Ordnance in the [[Fox–North Coalition]] in April 1783.&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt; He retired from that office when [[William Pitt the Younger]] came to power in January 1784.&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt;

Created '''Marquess Townshend''' on 27 October 1787,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=12932|date=23 October 1787|startpage=499|supp=|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townshend became [[Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk]] in February 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=13389|date=14 February 1792|startpage=109|supp=|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became [[List of Governors of Kingston-upon-Hull|Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull]] in 1794 and [[Governor]] of the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] in July 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=13796|date=14 July 1795|startpage=747|supp=|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar tragedy befell Townshend in May 1796: his son, Lord Charles, had just been elected MP for [[Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Yarmouth]], and he took a carriage to London with his brother, Rev. Lord Frederick, the Rector of Stiffkey. During the journey, Lord Frederick inexplicably killed his brother with a pistol shot to the head, and was ultimately adjudged insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.worldonline.co.za/~townshend/index.html|title=Lord Charles Townshend, 1768–1796 and Lord Rev. Frederick Townshend, 1767–1836|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 30 July 1796,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=13918|date=2 August 1796|startpage=743|supp=|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townshend died at his family home, [[Raynham Hall]] in [[Norfolk]] on 14 September 1807 and was buried in the family vault there.&lt;ref name=heath279&gt;Heathcote, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
On 19 December 1751, Townshend had married [[Charlotte Townshend, Viscountess Townshend|Charlotte Compton, 15th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley]] (d. 1770), daughter of [[James Compton, 5th Earl of Northampton]]. They had eight children:&lt;ref name=heath278/&gt;
