The '''Medal for the Best Shot in the British Army, Infantry''', was instituted by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1869 and was awarded annually from 1870 to 1882 to the best shot of the Infantry of the British Army, including the Royal Engineers and the Colonial Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo495&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayo|first=John Horsley|title=Medals and Decorations of the British Army and Navy, Vol. II, 1897 (No. 217. Best Shot.)|url=https://archive.org/stream/medalsdecoration02mayouoft#page/484/mode/2up|year=1897|publisher=A. Constable|page=484|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the medal was re-introduced by [[George V|King George V]] and designated the '''King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces'''. It could now be awarded to the champions of Army marksmanship competitions, held under battle conditions at annual central meetings in the United Kingdom, the British Dominions, Colonies and India. Early participating countries were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenConcise&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/history.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - A Concise History of the Queen's/King's Medal] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette33554&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33554|date=22 November 1929|startpage=7530|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette39294&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39294|date=27 July 1951|startpage=4035|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of countries which awarded the King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces grew to twelve by the mid-20th century, but as some countries gained independence from the United Kingdom or instituted their own equivalent awards, that number dwindled to the present three: the United Kingdom, Jamaica and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenConcise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenIndex&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/index.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Home Page] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

An Air Force version of the medal, the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces, was instituted in 1953. This was followed by the institution of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Naval Forces in 1958 and the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenAir&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/awards_to_airforce.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - The Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenNavy&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/awards_to_navy.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Naval Awards] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette40204&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40204|date=15 June 1954|startpage=3539|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette42338&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=42338|date=28 April 1961|startpage=3149|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette49522&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49522|date=28 October 1983|startpage=14201|supp=y|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institution==
[[Queen Victoria]] authorised the creation of the '''Medal for the Best Shot in the British Army, Infantry''', by Royal Warrant dated 30 April 1869. The medal, initially struck in bronze and from 1872 in silver, was inscribed with the year in which won and the winner's name, number and regiment. It became the winner's property and could be worn by him during the whole of his service. From 1870, the medal was awarded annually, along with a £20 Prize for Skill at Arms, to the best shot of the Infantry of the British Army, including the [[Royal Engineers]] and the Colonial Corps. With only thirteen medals won, award of the medal and the £20 prize ceased after 1882. A £5 prize and a crowned badge of crossed carbines or rifles, worked in gold and worn upon the left arm, was approved to replace it on 10 June 1884.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo495&quot;/&gt;

After a 41-year lapse, the medal was re-introduced by King George V in 1923 and designated the '''King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces'''. The medal could now be awarded to the champions of Army marksmanship competitions, held under battle firing conditions at annual central meetings in the United Kingdom, India, the British Dominions and the Colony of Southern Rhodesia. Early participating countries were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenConcise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette33554&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette39294&quot;/&gt;

A date clasp was also introduced in 1923, for award with the medal to first recipients as well as, without a medal, to champions who had already been awarded the medal. The clasp is inscribed with the year of the award and is designed to be attached to the medal's suspension bar. The institution of the clasp was followed in 1926 with the provision that a rosette may be worn on the ribbon bar to indicate the award of each subsequent clasp.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenConcise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/description.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Army Medals] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRules&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/revised_rules.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Revised Rules] (Accessed 8 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New ZealandQueen&quot;&gt;[http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/f/f7.html New Zealand Defence Force - Other New Zealand Medals and Awards - The Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Military Forces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124180132/http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/f/f7.html |date=24 January 2016 }} (Accessed 2 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award criteria==
All medal contenders have to be actual serving members of the Regular Army, Army Emergency Reserve, Territorial Army, or Local Militia and Volunteer Forces in the countries concerned. Members of independent Naval and Air Forces, while not excluded from the competition, could therefore not be awarded the medal even though they won the championship. This regulation had consequences on two occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRules&quot;/&gt;

* The 1938 competition in Canada was won by Leading Aircraftman T.W. Gregory, who had won the medal in 1935 as a Sergeant in the Canadian Regular Army. In 1938, since he was a member of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] by then, he was ineligible to be awarded the clasp and the medal was awarded to the runner-up. An Air Force version of the medal, the [[Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces]], was instituted by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. In 1955, Gregory won this new medal and became the only person to have won Queen's Medals in two different Arms of the Service.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenAir&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette40204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenGregory&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/gregory.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Flight Lieutenant Thomas William Gregory CD] (Accessed 8 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRCAF&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/royal_canadian_airforce.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Royal Canadian Air Force] (Accessed 8 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The 1962 competition in Rhodesia was won by Corporal Technician B.T. Gilpin, a member of the [[Rhodesian Air Force|Royal Rhodesian Air Force]]. Despite protests from the Army commanders, the Minister of Defence presented Gilpin with the Army medal. As a result of the controversy, Rhodesia sought and was granted the Crown's permission to introduce the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces. The first Rhodesian Air Force award was backdated to 1962 and the first two medals were presented in December 1963, one to Gilpin and the other to the Air Force champion for 1963. Gilpin's 1962 Army medal was returned and the 1962 Army runner-up, Inspector D. Hollingworth, was awarded a second clasp to his existing medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRhodesia&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/rhodesia.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Southern Rhodesia] (Accessed 8 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRRAF&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/RRAF.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Royal Rhodesian Air Force] (Accessed 8 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces was followed by the institution of the [[Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Naval Forces]] in 1958 and the [[Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenNavy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette40204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette42338&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette49522&quot;/&gt;

==Order of wear==
In the order of wear prescribed by the British [[Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood]], the Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces takes precedence after the [[Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Naval Forces]] and before the [[Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette56878&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=56878|supp=y|startpage=3353|date=17 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating countries==
In the United Kingdom, the medal is at present awarded annually to the winner of the Regular Army championship, the [[Army Operational Shooting Competition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRules&quot;/&gt;

From 1935, a second medal could be awarded annually in the United Kingdom, to the champion shot of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. In order to also be eligible for the medal, members of the Supplementary Reserve were included in the competition's definition of the Territorial Army from 1936. The competition to determine the annual medal winner for the part-time forces is held during the annual [[Bisley, Surrey|Bisley Meeting]] of the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenConcise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRules&quot;/&gt;

Outside the United Kingdom, the number of British Commonwealth countries which awarded the medal grew to eleven by the mid-20th century. This number decreased over the ensuing years, however, since some countries became republics and stopped awarding the medal, while others replaced the medal with new domestic versions. The tables below list the recipients of the medal in the respective countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenConcise&quot;/&gt;

===Australia===
The first King's Medal Competition in the Dominion of Australia was held in 1924 and the first medal to an Australian was won by Temporary Quartermaster and Honorary Captain W.C.G. Ruddock of the [[Australian Instructional Corps]]. In 1988, the [[Champion Shots Medal (Australia)|Champion Shots Medal]] was instituted in Australia and the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces ceased to be awarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenAustralia&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/australian_army.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - The Australian Army - Australian Winners of the King's/Queen's Medal] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Australia&quot;&gt;[https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/medals/champion_shots_medal.cfm Australian Government - It's an Honour - Champion Shots Medal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413144604/https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/medals/champion_shots_medal.cfm |date=13 April 2015 }} (Accessed 9 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The first King's Medal Competition in Canada was held for the Canadian Regular Force in 1923 and the first medal to a Canadian was won by Warrant Officer Class 1 F.J. Goodhouse of the [[Royal Canadian Army Service Corps]]. From 1963, two Queen's Medals for Champion Shots in the Military Forces were awarded annually in Canada, the second to a member of either the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] or the Canadian Reserve Force. The first of these was won by Lance Sergeant T.A.P. Richardson of the [[Victoria Rifles of Canada]]. On 28 August 1991 the [[Queen's Medal for Champion Shot]] ({{lang-fr|Médaille de la Reine pour tireur d'élite}}), a distinct Canadian version of the medal, was instituted and from 1992 the British version of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces ceased to be awarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenCanadaReg&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/canada_regular.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Canada - Regular Forces] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenCanadaRCMP&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/canada_reserve.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - Canada - Militia/Reserve/RCMP] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canada1992&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/images/canada_medal.jpg Canadian Medals for Champion Shots - Queen's Medal for Champion Shot (Canada) 1992] (Accessed 7 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick1&quot;&gt;[http://www.blatherwick.net/documents/009%20-%20Queen's%20Medal%20Champion%20Shot%20MID%20etc.pdf Canadian Medals for Champion Shots - King's/Queen's Medal for the Champion Shot of the Canadian Army (1923 to 1991) - Document dated 18 September 2014, created by Surgeon Captain John Blatherwick, pp. 5-7]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Accessed 9 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick2&quot;&gt;[http://www.blatherwick.net/documents/current%20canadian%20honours/14%20Queen's%20Medal%20For%20Champion%20Shot%20Canadian%20Forces.pdf King's/Queen's Medal For The Champion Shot - Document created by Surgeon Captain John Blatherwick CM OBC CD MD FRCPC LLD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622043927/http://www.blatherwick.net/documents/current%20canadian%20honours/14%20Queen's%20Medal%20For%20Champion%20Shot%20Canadian%20Forces.pdf |date=22 June 2016 }} (Accessed 8 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regiment&quot;&gt;[http://thercr.ca/main/index.php/17-rhq-general/regimental-honours-awards/427-king-s-and-queen-s-medals-for-champion-shot The Royal Canadian Regiment - King's and Queen's Medals for Champion Shot] (Accessed 8 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhodesia===

The first King's Medal Competition in Southern Rhodesia was held in 1926 and the first medal to a Rhodesian was won by Sergeant F.G. Elliott of the [[British South Africa Police]]. From 1940 to 1947 the competition was interrupted by the Second World War. After [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] on 11 November 1965, the competition and the award of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces continued for another four years, until Rhodesia severed its ties with the British Crown on 2 March 1970 and, in that same year, instituted the President's Medal for Shooting of the Security Forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenConcise&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenRhodesia&quot;/&gt;

===South Africa===
The first King's Medal Competition in the Union of South Africa was held in 1924 and the first medal to a South African was won by G.W. Church of the [[Kimberley Regiment|7th Infantry (Kimberley Regiment)]]. The competition did not take place in 1926 and was interrupted from 1940 to 1947 by the Second World War. The last medal was awarded in 1961, the year that South Africa became a republic. From 1962, the British medal was replaced by the [[Commandant General's Medal]] ({{lang-af|Kommandant-Generaalsmedalje}}), which could be awarded to champions from any of the three Arms of the Service.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenSouthAfrica&quot;&gt;[http://www.queensmedal.net/files/south_africa.htm The Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots - South Africa - Union Defence Forces and South African Defence Force] (Accessed 11 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SADF 1952-1975&quot;&gt;[http://hwmw.net46.net/samw/mil52.htm South African Medal Website - SA Defence Force : 1952-1975] (Accessed 3 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The first few medals of the original Queen Victoria version were struck in bronze, but in 1872 it was ordained that it should be of silver. It is a disk, {{convert|36|mm|2|abbr=off}} in diameter, with a raised rim on each side and suspended from a straight silver bar, swivelling on some versions. On the Queen Victoria version, the suspender is affixed to the medal by means of a double-toe claw and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. On the Kings' versions and the first Queen Elizabeth II version, the attachment is by a single-toe claw. On the second Queen Elizabeth II version, the suspension is either riveted or welded to the top of the medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo495&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Queen's Medal for Champion Shots Army (Elizabeth II) v1.jpg|thumb|First Queen Elizabeth II version]]
[[File:Queen's Medal for Champion Shots Army (Elizabeth II) v2.jpg|thumb|Second Queen Elizabeth II version]]
;Obverse
The obverse bears the effigy of the reigning monarch. Seven versions of the medal have been awarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo495&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick1&quot;/&gt;

* The original Queen Victoria version of 1869 has her diademed and veiled effigy, facing left, and is circumscribed &quot;VICTORIA REGINA&quot;. It was designed by British medallist [[Leonard Charles Wyon|L.C. Wyon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo495&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;
* The first [[George V|King George V]] version of 1923 shows him in Field Marshal's uniform, facing left, and is circumscribed &quot;GEOGIVS V BRITT: OMN: REX ET IND: IMP:&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick1&quot;/&gt;
* The second King George V version was awarded from 1933 to 1936 and shows him crowned and in coronation robes, facing left. It is circumscribed &quot;GEORGIVS•V•D•G•BRITT•OMN•REX•ET•INDIÆ•IMP•&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick1&quot;/&gt;
* The first [[George VI|King George VI]] version was introduced after his succession to the throne in 1936 and has his effigy in coronation robes, facing left and circumscribed &quot;GEORGIVS•VI•D•G•BR•OMN•REX•ET•INDIÆ•IMP•&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick1&quot;/&gt;
* The second King George VI version was introduced after 1947, when his title &quot;[[Emperor of India]]&quot; was abandoned and the reference to India was omitted from the medal inscription. The effigy on the obverse remained the same, but the circumscription was changed to &quot;GEORGIVS VI DEI GRA BRITT: OMN: REX FID: DEF:&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick1&quot;/&gt;
*  The first [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] version was introduced after her succession to the throne in 1952. It has her crowned effigy, facing right, and is circumscribed &quot;ELIZABETH II D: G: BR: OMN: REGINA F: D:&quot;, reading around from the top. The effigy was designed by sculptor Cecil Thomas [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] and was used on a number of medals.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorabilia&quot;&gt;[http://www.milimem.com/product_info.php?products_id=3346 Military Memorabilia Ltd Miniature NZ Army Champion Shots Medal, EIIR Type 1] (Accessed 9 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second Queen Elizabeth II version was introduced after her coronation in 1953. This version has the same effigy as the first, but is circumscribed &quot;ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA F. D.&quot;, reading around from the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatherwick1&quot;/&gt;

;Reverse
The reverse shows the winged mythological goddess [[Pheme]], with a trumpet in her left hand and rising from her throne to crown a warrior with a laurel wreath. At left is the naked and cloaked warrior, with his left foot on the throne dais, a bow and a quiver of arrows in his right hand and supporting a target with three arrows through its centre on his left knee. The design was by [[Edward Poynter|Sir Edward John Poynter, 1st Baronet]] [[List of officers of the Royal Academy of Arts#Presidents (PRA)|PRA]], and the original die was engraved by L.C. Wyon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo495&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;

;Clasp
The medal can be won multiple times. Each subsequent award is indicated by the award of another clasp, which displays the year of the subsequent award. The clasps are designed to be attached to the suspender and to each other with rivets, in [[roller chain]] fashion. When medals are not worn, the award of second and subsequent clasps are denoted by silver rosettes on the ribbon bar. Since it is impossible to sew more than four rosettes onto a single ribbon bar and since several champions have won the award more than five times, gold rosettes were introduced to cover situations where more than five championships have been won.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;

;Ribbon	
The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and dark crimson, with a 3 millimetres wide black band, a 3 millimetres wide beige band and a 3 millimetres wide black band on each edge.&lt;ref name=&quot;QueenArmy&quot;/&gt;
