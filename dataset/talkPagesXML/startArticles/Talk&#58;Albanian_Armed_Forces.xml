==Sources==
Lately, several changes have been made regarding the defense budget and the manpower figures. Can people provide some sources for these changes? Right now, the differences between the fluctuating versions are quite notable for a country like Albania (one said around $200 million for 2007, now it says something like $500 million). I am almost positive that the $500 million figure is dead wrong. That would imply that Albania spends something like 6% of its GDP on defense, which is ludicrous. Anyway, some transparency would really help.[[User:UberCryxic|UberCryxic]] 06:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

i think it has something to do with people estimating the budget based on gdp and gdp (ppp). thats why you get two very different answers. for the defense budget you have to calculate based on gdp (non PPP)

Even leaving aside the percentage estimate from the GDP, the $500 million figure is still bogus as it would represent something like 1/3 of Albania's state budget, which hovers around $1.5 to $2 billion annually.[[User:UberCryxic|UberCryxic]] 04:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

500 million is very bogus and way off taking any factual statistic into account. btw the budget is 3 billion this year not 2 billion. also the ministry of defense had a 180 million budget last year. albanias gdp (non PPP) in 2007 is about $10.053 billion. if the defense budget is 2% (NATO requirement and the most it will ever be) then the most optimistic assumption about the defense budget in 07 is $201 million. anything substantially higher than that can't be taken seriously.

'''News as of last week is that the MoD has decided to raise the military Expenditures from 1.49% to 2% by end of 2007 mainly because Albania is trying to enter NATO and because of Albania’s missions in Afghanistan, Iraq &amp; Lebanon.'''
'''Also 92 was bogus its not anymore the figure has raised to 210 million Albania’s GDP is $21 billion (Albania also has a lager gray economy which is worth at least 50% on top of the official) the that is brining the total to at least $31 billion but either way Albania new military Expenditures is over $200 million with its official economy it would be around $250 million including its gray economy its would be over $500 million''' [[User:Gon4z|Gon4z]] 14:09, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

How can you edit teh infromation in the side Box somethings there can be extended and other are wrong and need to be changed thanx in advance
  
THE inventory of Albanian army MBTs must be removed at all. cant shown a inventory of 2030 tanks. very few in fact exist. must make a new inventory to be correct

== Tank Inventory ==
I've updated the Tank inventory and ship inventory. I took the information from the 2006 edition of the The World Defence Almanac.[[User:Noclador|noclador]] 13:25, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

Another source for you to look at (from 2004): http://www.csees.net/?page=country_section&amp;country_id=1&amp;sec=8


:exactly its says Albania operates 373 tanks not 79 as you stated even your source speaks agaisnt you

== [[Template:Infobox National Military Albania]] ==
I also updated the Albanian Military [[Template:Infobox National Military Albania|template]], but I'm unable to remove the today irrelevant entries i.e. &quot;Available for
military service&quot; or &quot;Fit for military service&quot; if anyone knows hoe to edit these things away- plese do so.

== Taulant23 ==
You inserted the following numbers into the article:
* Active personnel: 622,850 (Ranked 15)
:622,850 active personnel? that is impossible! that is twice the number of the French Armed Forces!
* Military age population: males age 20–49: 16,756,323 (2005 est.)
:Military age population: 16,756,323??? Albania has 3,6 million inhabitants and 16 million reserves????
* Total fit for service: males age 20-49: 13,905,901 (2005 est.)
:Total fit for service: 13,905,901??? see above!
* Annual spending: $10.936 billion (2006 est.)[1] (Ranked 25th)
:$10.936 billion spending??? that is the Albanian GDP!
* Percent of GDP spent on military: 3.0% (2006 est.)[2]
:3% of GDP... so the Albanian GDP is $364,533 billions? more than Poland???

and the document you give as source: http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2006/p06-159.pdf does NOT even mention Albania! --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] 08:12, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

I know for sure its not 13.000 but I will find more source for this page, still working on it.Thank you --[[User:Taulant23|Taulant23]] 19:26, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

==Fair use rationale for Image:Al T 59.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Al T 59.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Al T 59.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].

Does anyone know what kind of weapons Albania has been buying (if any) lately? I know it's not planes or tanks, but probably light infantry weapons.

== Continuous vandalism ==

I have noted the unconstructive edits, made on the page by [[User:Gerd 72]]. The user continuously removes the &quot;Equipment&quot; section which, in my opinion, is obligatory for an article of this size and importance. I am dispatching towards the user with a request to discontinue with the vandalism-like edits [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_of_Albania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=270496538 ][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_of_Albania&amp;diff=270669818&amp;oldid=270593666 ][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_of_Albania&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=270496272 ] and the unfounded deletion of information. - [[Image:Biohazard orange.svg|17px]] [[User:Tourbillon|Tourbillon]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tourbillon|A ?]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 14 February 2009 (UTC)

The result of the move request was: '''page moved''' per request. Since we only had an uncertainty, and no actual opposition, I'm giving the requester the benefit of the doubt in this case.

[[Military of Albania]] → {{no redirect|1=Albanian Armed Forces}} – I think the page needs to be renamed (moved) from [[Military of Albania]] to [[Albanian Armed Forces]]. This is the actual name of the organisation and this fits with almost all other country military articles on Wikipedia. I've tried moving the page, but it won't let me because it says &quot;Albanian Armed Forces&quot; already exists, but clearly it's only a redirect. I'm not sure how to move it. So I've put in this request. --[[User:Hibernian|Hibernian]] ([[User talk:Hibernian|talk]]) 04:19, 27 June 2011 (UTC)

* '''Unsure'''. See [[List of militaries by country]], many countries are represented by ''XXXian Armed Forces'' but others by ''Military of XXX''. The [[WP:official name|official name]] isn't all that relevant according to [[WP:AT]], and it doesn't seem to be the pattern either. Evidence that it's the ''actual name of the organisation''?
