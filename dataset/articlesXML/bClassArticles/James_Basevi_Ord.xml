Ord received an appointment from California to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], which he entered on  12 June 1911.{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=1756}} The class he joined would become famous as the [[class the stars fell on]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MOAH&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_6b.html |title=The Class the Stars Fell On |publisher=National Museum of American History |accessdate=23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 164 graduates that year, 59 would wear the stars of a general officer, the most of any class in the history of the Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;West Point Fact Sheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/publicaffairs/press_kit_files/SelectedNoteworthyGrads.htm |accessdate=19 December 2010 |publisher=United States Military Academy |title=West Point Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320064244/http://www.usma.edu/PublicAffairs/Press_Kit_files/SelectedNoteworthyGrads.htm |archivedate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classmates included [[Omar Bradley]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]].{{sfn|Haskew|2014|p=12}}

He was sent to Camp Cotton, in [[El Paso, Texas]], where he joined the [[13th Cavalry Regiment|13th Cavalry]] as an interpreter with the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]]. He was wounded in the [[Battle of Parral]] on 12 April 1916, and was recommended for the [[Medal of Honor]], but instead received the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]].{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=1756}} His citation read:{{quote|for exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility, as follows: While serving as second lieutenant, 6th Infantry, attached to the 13th Cavalry, in action at Parral, Mexico, April 12, 1916, after being himself wounded, he dismounted from his horse under heavy fire, placed a wounded man on a horse, and assisted him from the field.{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=1756}} }}

Ord was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] with the [[5th Cavalry Regiment|5th Cavalry]] on 1 July 1916. He was attached the headquarters of the Punitive Expedition until it was disbanded on 10 February 1917. He was placed in charge of a refugee camp in [[Columbus, New Mexico]], which subsequently moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He was then posted to the [[54th Infantry Regiment (United States)|54th Infantry]] at Chickamauga Park, Georgia, on 24 June 1917. On 16 July 1917, he joined the staff of the Reserve Officer's Training Camp at [[Fort Oglethorpe (Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia)|Fort Oglethorpe]], Georgia. Then, on 15 September 1917, he returned to West Point, initially as an instructor in modern languages, and then, from 20 September 1917, in tactics. From 18 May to 25 November 1918, he was an intelligence officer and Assistant Military Attaché in [[The Hague]].{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=1756}} He was awarded the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]].{{sfn|Cullum|1930|pp=1078–1079}}

==Between the wars==
Promoted to major on 17 June 1918, Ord reverted to the grade of captain on 30 June 1920, only to return to being a major two days later. He attended the ''[[Ecole Supérieure de Guerre]]'' in Paris. Returning to the United States in July 1924. He reverted to captain again on 4 November 1922, but then was promoted to major again on 20 September 1924. From June 1925 to June 1926 he was a student at the [[Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas. After graduation, he was posted to the Philippines, as commander of the 3rd Battalion, [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry]], and then, in May 1928, to the American Embassy in Paris as Assistant Military Attaché.{{sfn|Cullum|1930|pp=1078–1079}} He was technical adviser at the Army General Disarmament Conference, in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, from 2 February to 19 June 1932.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=295}}

Ord attended the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] from 1932 to 1933, and then was an instructor in [[military intelligence]] there from 1933 to 1935.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=295}} That year, the outgoing [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], Major General [[Douglas MacArthur]], was appointed [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government (Philippines)|Military Advisor]] to the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. MacArthur was permitted to select his own staff, so as his chief of staff, he chose Dwight Eisenhower, who had been his assistant for the previous two and a half years. In turn, Eisenhower was permitted to choose his own assistant, and he chose Ord for his staff skills and his knowledge of Spanish.{{sfn|James|1970|pp=484–486}} MacArthur had previously been acquainted with Ord in Paris when MacArthur was Chief of Staff.{{sfn|James|1970|p=372}}

==Death==
Ord was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1936.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=295}} His main responsibility was to draw up a military budget for the Philippines. A realistic one proved difficult to create, as the United States government would not supply the funding for the equipment that MacArthur and Eisenhower believed that the Philippines would require in order to resist a Japanese invasion.{{sfn|James|1970|p=517}} A key part of this was the fledgling Philippine Air Corps.{{sfn|James|1970|p=532}} On 30 January 1938, Ord took off on a flight to [[Baguio City]] with a Filipino student pilot at the controls. As the plane approached its destination, Ord had the pilot flew low over a friend's house so he could drop a note announcing his arrival tied to a rock. The inexperienced pilot stalled the plane and it crashed, killing Ord.{{sfn|Haskew|2014|p=102}} President [[Manuel Quezon]] awarded Ord the [[Distinguished Service Star]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ph/1938/02/03/general-order-no-2-s-1938/  |title=General Order No. 2, s. 1938 |publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His citation read:{{quote|As one of the principal assistants of the Military Adviser Colonel Ord continuously, from the inauguration of the Commonwealth to the moment of his untimely death, devoted his exceptional talents to the development of adequate security forces for the Philippines. Through his professional attainments, his breadth of understanding, his zeal and his magnetic leadership he was directly responsible for notable progress in the Philippine Army. Through his outstanding achievements, in the service of the Philippine Government, to which service he gave his life, he increased the brilliance of his already enviable military reputation, became an inspiration to the officers and enlisted men of the Army, and earned the gratitude and affection of the Philippine Government and of the Filipino people.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSS&quot;/&gt;}}

Upon his death, Ord was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel [[Richard K. Sutherland]].{{sfn|James|1970|p=565}} Ord was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], not far from his father and other members of his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jamesbav.htm |title=James Basevi Ord, Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]] |accessdate=5 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, Emily Collier Howell, and his two children, James Basevi Ord, Jr., and Letitia Howell Ord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/col-james-ord_20869058 |title=Col James Ord 1890–1938 |publisher=Ancestry.com |accessdate=5 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Jr. subsequently became a colonel in the [[United States Marine Corps]].
