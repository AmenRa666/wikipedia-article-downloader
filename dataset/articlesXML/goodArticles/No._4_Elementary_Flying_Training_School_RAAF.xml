'''No.&amp;nbsp;4 Elementary Flying Training School''' (No.&amp;nbsp;4 EFTS) was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) pilot training unit that operated during World War&amp;nbsp;II. It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. No.&amp;nbsp;4 EFTS was established in January 1940 at [[RAAF Station Mascot|Mascot]], New South Wales, and initially operated in conjunction with civilian flying organisations based at Mascot and [[Newcastle Airport|Newcastle]]. The school was disbanded in April 1942, and its operations transferred to [[No. 6 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 Elementary Flying School]] at [[Tamworth Airport|Tamworth]].

==History==
Flying instruction in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS).&lt;ref name=Stephens67&gt;Stephens (2006), pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.&lt;ref name=Stephens67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), pp. 106–109]&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;4 Elementary Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;4 EFTS) was formed at [[Sydney Airport|Kingsford Smith Aerodrome]], [[RAAF Station Mascot|Mascot]], New South Wales, on 2&amp;nbsp;January 1940, and came under the control of [[No. 2 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Group]].&lt;ref name=Units&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAF349&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; Its inaugural commanding officer was [[Squadron Leader]] A.W.L. Ellis.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Mascot had been [[Sydney]]'s civil airport since 1920, and was home to several private aviation organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/bases/mascot.htm |title=Mascot|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison72&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.pdf Gillison (1962), pp. 72–73]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the airfield's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in New South Wales that led to it becoming the base for the fourth flying school the RAAF raised during World War&amp;nbsp;II. The same principle was followed in basing [[No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 EFTS]] at [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]], South Australia, [[No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 EFTS]] at [[RAAF Station Archerfield|Archerfield]], Queensland, and [[No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 EFTS]] at [[Essendon Airport|Essendon]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=Gillison72/&gt;

The first training courses at No.&amp;nbsp;4 EFTS were not conducted under the auspices of EATS but by civil organisations under government contract.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison72/&gt; The instructors from these organisations were commissioned as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] in the RAAF. The flying school was divided into four [[Flight (military unit)|flights]]: &quot;A&quot; (training conducted by the Royal Aero Club of New South Wales), &quot;B&quot; (conducted by Kingsford Smith Air Services Pty Ltd), &quot;C&quot; (conducted by Airflite Pty Ltd), and &quot;D&quot; (conducted at [[Newcastle Airport|Newcastle]] by the Newcastle Aero Club).&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAF349/&gt; The training aircraft were [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Tiger Moth]]s and [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|Gipsy Moth]]s.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by the commanding officer.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison72/&gt; The initial intake of twenty-four students arrived on 8&amp;nbsp;January 1940.&lt;ref name=RAAF349/&gt; Accommodation was severely limited at the new flying school: No.&amp;nbsp;4 EFTS headquarters was housed in the clubhouse of the Royal Aero Club, the base sick quarters utilised the [[Department of Civil Aviation (Australia)|Department of Civil Aviation]]'s casualty room, and cadets had to pay for their own rooms at the nearby [[Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales|Brighton-Le-Sands Hotel]].&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;4 EFTS's strength as at 1&amp;nbsp;February 1940 was four officers, twenty-one [[airman|airmen]], one civilian, and twenty-four cadets. The second intake of twenty-four cadets arrived four days later.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; The school's inaugural EATS course commenced on 29&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17668697 |title=Empire air scheme |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=29 April 1940 |accessdate=9 January 2016 |page=11 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The government's contracts with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; On 18&amp;nbsp;November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]] street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; neither he nor his student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17715776 |title=Fall from plane |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney |date=19 November 1940 |accessdate=9 January 2016 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27&amp;nbsp;December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (1939–45), p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17700928 |title=Three planes damaged |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney |date=28 December 1940 |accessdate=9 January 2016 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
