'''HMS ''Falmouth''''' was a {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser (1910)|0}} [[light cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the 1910s. She was one of four ships of the ''Weymouth'' [[ship class|sub-class]]. The ship was initially assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] upon completion in 1911, but was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in mid-1913. When the First World War began in 1914, ''Falmouth'' was transferred to the [[1st Light Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Light Cruiser Squadron]] (LCS) of the [[Grand Fleet]] and then the [[3rd Light Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Light Cruiser Squadron]] at the end of the year. The ship participated in most of the early fleet actions, including the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battles of Heligoland Bight]], [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]], and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]], but was only seriously engaged in the latter. She was torpedoed and sunk off [[Flamborough Head]], Yorkshire by German [[submarines]] during the [[Action of 19 August 1916]].

==Design and description==
The ''Weymouth'' sub-class were slightly larger and improved versions of the preceding ''Bristol'' sub-class with a more powerful armament.&lt;ref name=&quot;conways06 p51&quot;&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; They were {{convert|453|ft|m|1}} [[overall length|long overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|47|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|1}}. [[Displacement (ship)|Displacement]] was {{convert|5275|LT|t|lk=on}} normal&lt;ref name=f3&gt;Friedman, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|5800|LT|t}} at full load. Twelve [[Yarrow boiler]]s fed ''Falmouth''{{'}}s [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;conways06 p51&quot;/&gt; driving two [[propeller shaft]]s, that were rated at {{convert|22000|shp|lk=in}} for a design speed of {{convert|25|kn}}. The ship reached {{convert|26.62|kn}} during her [[sea trials]] from {{convert|27900|shp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Part 2, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; The boilers used both [[fuel oil]] and coal, with {{convert|1290|LT|t|0}} of coal and {{convert|269|LT|t|0}} tons of oil carried, which gave a range of {{convert|5610|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=f3&gt;Friedman, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Weymouth''s exchanged the ten {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} guns of the ''Bristol'' sub-class for six additional [[BL 6 inch Mk XI naval gun|BL 6-inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk XI guns]]. Two of these guns were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the [[superstructure]] and two more were mounted on the [[forecastle]] deck abreast the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. The remaining four guns were positioned on the upper deck in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with [[gun shield]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;conways06 p51&quot;/&gt; Four [[Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers|Vickers 3-pounder (47&amp;nbsp;mm)]] [[saluting gun]]s were also fitted. Their armament was completed by two submerged [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (533&amp;nbsp;mm)]] [[torpedo tubes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Part 2, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Weymouth''-class ships were considered [[protected cruiser]]s, with an armoured [[deck (ship)|deck]] providing protection for the ships' vitals. The armoured deck was {{convert|2|in|mm}} thick over the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and machinery, {{convert|1|in|mm}} over the steering gear and {{convert|0.75|in|mm|0}} elsewhere. The [[conning tower]] was protected by 4 inches of armour, with the gun shields having {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} armour, as did the ammunition hoists.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Part 2, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; As the protective deck was at the [[waterline]], the ships were given a large [[metacentric height]] so that they would remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships [[Ship motions#Rotation motions|rolling]] badly making them poor gun platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown p63&quot;&gt;Brown, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; One problem with the armour of the ''Weymouth''s which was shared with the other Town-class ships was the sizeable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap, and made the guns' crews vulnerable to leg injuries in combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;warv1n2 p57&quot;&gt;Lyon, Part 2, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Falmouth'' was the ninth ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the [[Falmouth, Cornwall|eponymous port]].&lt;ref name=c2&gt;Colledge, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was laid down on 21 February 1910 by [[William Beardmore and Company]] at their [[Dalmuir]] shipyard and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 20 September. Upon completion in September 1911, ''Falmouth'' was assigned to the [[2nd Battle Squadron]] of the Atlantic Fleet&lt;ref name=&quot;conways06 p51&quot;/&gt; and was transferred to the [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] [[2nd Light Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[Second Fleet (United Kingdom)|Second Fleet]] at [[The Nore]] on 30 June 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Monthly Navy List|url=https://archive.org/details/navylistoct1913grea|website=National Library of Scotland|date=October 1913|publisher=[[His Majesty's Stationery Office]]|location=London|accessdate=8 August 2016|pages=269b, 270, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the ship had been transferred to the [[5th Cruiser Squadron]], also of the Second Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Monthly Navy List|url=https://archive.org/details/navylistjan1914grea|website=National Library of Scotland|date=18 December 1913|publisher=[[His Majesty's Stationery Office]]|location=London|accessdate=8 August 2016|page=269b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, she was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. On 28 August 1914 she was present, but played no significant role, in the Battle of Heligoland Bight,&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, I, pp. 101–19&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, the Germans [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] on 16 December and the 1st LCS was escorting [[Vice-Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]]'s [[battlecruiser]]s in response when it encountered a German light cruiser and a half-[[flotilla]] of torpedo boats. ''Falmouth'' was not in range to engage before the [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] turned away to follow the battlecruisers.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 333–52&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December, the ship was transferred to the 3rd LCS and became the flagship of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Trevylyan Napier]], the squadron commander. During the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] on 24 January 1915, the squadron escorted the Grand Fleet, but was not engaged. After the battle was over, the squadron escorted the battlecruisers on their way back to [[Cromarty]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;Transcript&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Jutland===
[[File:Map of the Battle of Jutland, 1916.svg|thumb|400px|Maps showing the manoeuvres of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1916|alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast]]
{{main|Battle of Jutland}}
Almost a year later, ''Falmouth'' participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916. As the battle began, the 3rd LCS was screening Beatty's battlecruisers as they searched for the German fleet and moved to support the 1st LCS after they had spotted the German ships. This put them out of position when Beatty turned south to pursue the German battlecruisers. After he turned north on encountering the main body of the German [[High Seas Fleet]], ''Falmouth'' and her squadron were the first to encounter the screen of the Grand Fleet at 17:33. As Beatty turned east to rendezvous with them, the cruiser engaged several German ships at ranges below {{convert|7000|yd}} and in poor visibility. ''Falmouth'' opened fire on the disabled light cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden}} beginning at about 18:15 and also fired a torpedo at her that missed around 18:21. She then briefly engaged two destroyers and then switched to the battlecruisers {{SMS|Lützow}} and {{SMS|Derfflinger}}, hitting both ships, also firing a torpedo that she mistakenly claimed to have hit around 18:25. In return, the ship was only hit once by a {{convert|15|cm|adj=on}} shell on the foremast that cut the [[voice tube]]s to the [[Top (sailing ship)|spotting top]]. By 18:40, the squadron was in position to escort the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 22, 31–33, 118, 150–51, 161, 196, 390&lt;/ref&gt;  

By 20:10, Beatty's ships were in front of the Grand Fleet and the 3rd LCS was screening them when ''Falmouth'' spotted five cruisers of the 4th Scouting Group and the squadron closed to engage at full speed. The British ships were not spotted in return until 20:17 and ''Falmouth'' opened fire a minute later at a range of {{convert|9600|yd}}. Despite poor visibility, she hit the light cruiser {{SMS|München}} twice, one of which damaged her aft boilers and impaired her ability to keep steam up. By 20:38, the British lost sight of the Germans and turned away to assume their position at the head of Beatty's battlecruisers. The cruiser fired a total of 175 shells during the battle, the most of any British light cruiser.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 250–52, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action of 19 August 1916===
{{main|Action of 19 August 1916}}
On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by [[Room 40]] that indicated that the High Seas Fleet would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] the following day, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by [[Zeppelin]]s and submarines. Part of the German plan was to draw the British ships through a series of submarine ambushes and ''Falmouth'' fell victim to one of the awaiting U-boats, {{SMU|U-66||2}}, about 16:05 the following afternoon after the Grand Fleet was headed for home. Two torpedoes only badly damaged the cruiser, but follow-on attacks were unsuccessful due to the presence of the escorting destroyers. Shortly after she was struck, the [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Cooksin'' went along side and took off all of the men not required to work the ship. ''Falmouth'' was able to steam through the night under her own power at a speed of {{conv|2|kn}}, although a pair of [[tugboat]]s came out the following morning and took her in tow. Her course took her right past {{SMU|U-63|Germany|2}}, which put another pair of torpedoes into her around noon, despite eight escorting destroyers. The cruiser remained afloat for another eight hours before sinking off [[Flamborough Head]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;Newbolt, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; No one was killed in the attacks, but one man later died of his injuries. She sits in {{convert|16|m}} of water at {{coord|53|58.93|N|0|4.50|W|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HMS Falmouth|url=http://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?536|website=wrecksite.eu|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
