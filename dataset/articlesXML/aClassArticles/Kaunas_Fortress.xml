'''Kaunas Fortress''' ({{lang-lt|Kauno tvirtovė}}, {{lang-ru|Кοвенская крепость}}) is the remains of a [[fortress]] complex in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]. It was constructed and renovated between 1882 and 1915 to protect the [[Russian Empire]]'s western borders, and was designated a &quot;first-class&quot; fortress in 1887. During [[World War I]], the complex was the largest defensive structure in the entire state, occupying {{convert|65|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=KTL/&gt;

The fortress was battle-tested in 1915 when Germany attacked the Russian Empire, and withstood eleven days of assault before capture. After World War I, the fortress' military importance declined as advances in weaponry rendered it increasingly obsolete. It was used by various civil institutions and as a [[garrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orlov|2007|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], parts of the fortress complex were used by the [[Nazi Germany]] for detention, interrogation, and execution. About 50,000 people were executed there, including more than 30,000 victims of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museums of Lithuania|url=http://muziejai.mch.mii.lt/Kaunas/forto_muziejus.en.htm|work=Kaunas' 9th Fort Museum|publisher=Association of Lithuanian Museums|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sections have since been restored; the [[Ninth Fort]] houses a museum and memorial devoted to the victims of wartime mass executions. The complex is the most complete remaining example of a Russian Empire fortress.&lt;ref name=Orlov18/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Tsar Alexander II -6.jpg|thumb|An 1879 edict issued by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] ordered the construction of Kaunas Fortress]] 
The city of Kaunas is located at the [[confluence]] of two rivers, the [[Neman River|Neman]] and [[Neris]], which link Lithuania's interior and its capital, [[Vilnius]], to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Baltic peoples]] had created significant domains by the 1st century, and came into conflict with the [[Scandinavia]]ns and the [[Slav]]s; the [[Teutonic Order]] began targeting Lithuanian lands at the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2005|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Lithuania was [[geography of Lithuania|heavily wooded]] and its lands were often impassable, its interior was most approachable along its rivers when frozen and during the short dry harvest season in late summer.&lt;ref name=rowell&gt;{{Harvnb|Rowell|1994|pp=49&amp;ndash;54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this vulnerability, defensive structures, including a [[Kaunas Castle|brick castle]] in Kaunas, were in place at various points on the Nemunas River by the 14th century.&lt;ref name=rowell/&gt;&lt;ref name=cityofkaunas&gt;{{citation|title=Kaunas: An Historical Overview|publisher=City of Kaunas|url=http://www.kaunas.lt/go.php/eng/Kaunas_history/531|year=2007|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1361; it received [[Magdeburg rights]], regulating its autonomy and establishing trade protocols, from [[Vytautas the Great]] in 1408. An outpost of the [[Hanseatic League]] was created there in 1441. By the end of the 16th century Kaunas had become a major regional trade center, but plagues, fires, and wars adversely affected the country and city during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=KTL/&gt;&lt;ref name=cityofkaunas/&gt; Following the [[partitions of Poland|partitions]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at the end of the 18th century, Lithuania was incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]]. Two major 19th century projects contributed to the city's revival. The [[Augustów Canal]], completed in 1832, linked the Neman to the [[Black Sea]], and a [[Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway|rail line linking Saint Petersburg, Warsaw, and Germany]] via Kaunas was completed in 1862; it was part of a limited network of western Russian railways.&lt;ref name=cityofkaunas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| script-title=ru:Дорога САНКТ - ПЕТЕРБУРГ - ЛУГА - ПСКОВ - РЕЗЕКНЕ - ВИЛЬНЮС – ВАРШАВА|url=http://www.pskovrail.narod.ru/main11history.html|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-21|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mearsheimer|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's western borders needed support, and fortresses existed or were being built in [[Latvia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Belarus]]. The concept of building a fortress in Lithuania was discussed without result in 1796,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orlov|2007|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became a critical concern after the [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|French invasion of Russia in 1812]] led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{Harvnb|Pociūnas|2008|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grande Armée]] managed to cross the Nemunas near Kaunas on its drive towards [[Moscow]] without major difficulties.&lt;ref name=Kamane&gt;{{citation|author=Nijolė Steponaitytė|title=Kauno tvirtovė|url=http://www.kamane.lt/lt/atgarsiai/architektura/architekatgarsis110|year=2007|accessdate=2008-05-21|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly unified Germany troubled the Empire during the second half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Millett|1987|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fortress in Kaunas would present an obstacle to attacks from the west, preventing further incursions towards [[Riga]] and [[Vilnius]]. In order to control the region, attackers would need to first neutralize Kaunas. Facing this possibility and evaluating the natural advantages of the city, Russian officials decided to construct a fortress there. After several delays, on July 7, 1879 [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] issued an edict ordering its construction.&lt;ref name=KTL&gt;{{citation |title=Kauno tvirtovės istorija |publisher=Gintaras Česonis |url=http://tvirtove.kaunas.lt/|year=2004| accessdate= 2008-06-12|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kauno soboras.St. Michael the Archangel's Church.Kaunas.jpg|thumb|left|[[St. Michael the Archangel Church, Kaunas|The Garrison Church]] was constructed for the fortress garrison]]
The first design was overseen by Generals Nikolay Obruchev, Konstantin Zverev, and Ivan Volberg.&lt;ref name=Orlov&gt;{{Harvnb|Orlov|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As originally planned, the fortress encompassed a huge site, consisting of seven forts and nine defensive batteries arranged in [[concentric]] loops. The plan included support buildings and infrastructures, such as barracks, new roads, and an ammunition depot. Construction began in 1882;&lt;ref name=LT&gt;{{citation|title=Iš Kauno tvirtovės fortų istorijos| publisher=Fortai|url= http://www.fortai.projektas.in/print.php?type=A&amp;item_id=9|accessdate= 2008-06-12|format= &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AI%C5%A1+Kauno+tvirtov%C4%97s+fort%C5%B3+istorijos&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050022/http://www.fortai.projektas.in/print.php?type=A&amp;item_id=9 |archivedate = September 27, 2007|language=lt}} {{dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 4,000 workers were mustered for the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;/&gt; The principal structures were concentrated in [[Freda (Kaunas)|Freda]], [[Panemunė(neighbourhood)|Panemunė]], [[Aleksotas]], and the new section of the city. The project significantly affected the daily life of Kaunas residents, and there were plans to detach the fortress into an independent administrative unit governed by a military board; its commandant wrote that &quot;There is no city of Kaunas, there is only the Fortress of Kaunas.&quot;&lt;ref name=interwar/&gt;&lt;ref name=jarma&gt;{{citation|title=The Fortress of Kaunas: History Present Situation and Conversion Challenges |journal=Environmental Security and Public Safety|series=NATO Security through Science Series|year=2007|first=Jarmalavičiutė|last=Neringa|coauthors=Rimvydas Strazdas|volume=|issue=|pages=127&amp;ndash;145|id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/e5717724144tn055/|format=|accessdate=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first forts were built using bricks reinforced with thick ramparts of earth, which were incorporated into the surrounding relief, making them harder to breach.&lt;ref name=Kamane/&gt; They were [[symmetry|symmetrical]], usually having five faces, with positions for [[infantry]] and [[artillery]]. These forts were built according to the standard Russian brick fort design of the time. Therefore, the first seven forts were very similar; they differed only in the layout of their interiors, their integration into the surrounding relief, and in some construction details. They would also be renovated in slightly different ways.&lt;ref name=Orlov/&gt; Batteries were built between adjacent forts; these were fortifications containing various types of artillery, located along the fortress' outer lines and usually erected on the hills.&lt;ref name=Orlov/&gt; The first construction phase was completed in 1887.&lt;ref name=LT/&gt;&lt;ref name=LTE&gt;{{Harvnb|Zinkus|1979|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress was designated first-class in that year, marking its importance and defensive capabilities, and Otto Klem was named its first commandant.&lt;ref name=LTE/&gt; At the same time, administrative rules were established to manage the fortress' impact on the city and its surrounding areas; the height of the fortress' civil buildings was restricted.&lt;ref name=ML/&gt; 
[[File:IX Fort (2008-09-20)13.jpg|thumb|One of the longest tunnels in the [[Ninth Fort]]]]
During 1890 work began on an eighth fort, known as Linkuva; new construction techniques were introduced, particularly [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref name=Kamane/&gt; The Linkuva fort became the most modern entrenchment, equipped with electricity, sewerage, and [[casemate]]s for a garrison of 1,000 personnel.&lt;ref name=Orlov/&gt; At the same time, massive groundworks were laid along with additional defensive structures, effecting the complete enclosure of the city center between the Rivers [[Nemunas]] and [[Neris]]. By 1890, seven forts had been completed, supporting roads had been constructed, and a railroad bridge over the Nemunas had been adapted for military transport. By now, expenditures on the fortress had amounted to over nine million [[ruble]]s.&lt;ref name=LT/&gt; The first bricks for a [[St. Michael the Archangel Church, Kaunas|church that would serve]] the garrison were laid in 1891; it was completed in 1893. The following year construction began on a dedicated [[narrow gauge railway]].&lt;ref name=Orlov50&gt;{{Harvnb|Orlov|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Fort, begun in 1903, was the first of its kind in the Empire. The structure was a [[trapezoid]], encompassing one infantry rampart, and was equipped with two armored watchtowers, electricity, and ventilation. The walls of its cannon casemates were covered with cork to reduce firing noise.&lt;ref name=Orlov/&gt; The cost of this single fort was 850,000 rubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlov52&quot;/&gt;
[[File:IX Fort (2008-09-20)12.jpg|thumb|left|Shooting embrasure for cannons]]
The complex of forts and defensive structures was divided into four sectors. The first followed the left bank of the Nemunas to its confluence with the Jiesia River and included the three earliest forts. The second sector extended from the Jiesia to [[Pažaislis monastery]] and included two forts. The third extended from the right to the left bank of the Nemunas; this sector also contained two forts. The fourth and last sector stretched from the right bank of the Neris to the left bank of the Nemunas, comprising two forts, including the newest &amp;ndash; the Ninth Fort.&lt;ref name=LT/&gt;

As new building and weapons technologies developed, the fortress was repeatedly renovated in order to maintain its military effectiveness. In 1912 an expansion and reconstruction initiative was launched.&lt;ref name=LTE/&gt; This project called for twelve new forts along with batteries, support buildings, and defensive structures. Its completion was scheduled for 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pociūnas|2008|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older forts were to be completely encircled by the new construction, which was meant to employ the newest military technologies.&lt;ref name=KTL/&gt; During the early realization of the plan, new defensive entrenchments were built and the old forts were strengthened with concrete. However, when action began on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War I]], work on the fortress was halted.&lt;ref name=Kamane/&gt; In 1915 only one fort, the Ninth, conformed with the new technological criteria, while the Tenth Fort was only partially built. The complex then covered about {{convert|65|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and contained a {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} internal railway, power plant, water supply system, mill, bakery, brewery, food bank, and telegraph. Despite the fact that the fortress' renovations and new construction had not been finished, it presented a formidable challenge to its attackers.&lt;ref name=KTL/&gt;&lt;ref name=jarma/&gt;

==World War I==
[[File:II Kauno fortas.The second fort of Kaunas.jpg|thumb|The Second Fort after German bombardment]][[File:42 cm Gamma Mörser AWM A02560.jpeg|thumb|The German [[Gamma-Gerät]] gun. German artillery played the key role in the offensive.]]
In 1915, [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[Central Powers]] began an offensive against Russia and advanced towards Lithuania and Kaunas. The German army reached Kaunas Fortress in July 1915. At that time, about 90,000 soldiers, commanded by [[Vladimir Grigoriev]] ({{lang-ru|Владимир Григорьев}}), manned the fortress.&lt;ref name=GRI&gt;{{citation| script-title=ru:БИОГРАФИЧЕСКИЙ УКАЗАТЕЛЬ|url=http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/bio_g/grigorev_vn.html|publisher=ХРОНОС|accessdate=2008-06-12|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; To attack the fortress, the Germans brought four [[division (military)|divisions]] to the operation, which were placed under the command of [[Karl Litzmann]].&lt;ref name=ML&gt;{{Harvnb|Kviklys|1991|pp=242&amp;ndash;243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To support this attack, the Germans constructed a railroad to transport their {{convert|42|cm|in|adj=on}} [[Gamma-Gerät]] [[howitzer]]. The howitzer's shell weighed about 1 ton with a range of {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orlov|2007|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days into the siege more guns of various calibers were deployed.

The German army concentrated its attack on the First, Second and Third Forts, which were the complex's oldest structures. The army did not surround the entire fortress, and its defense was able to regroup and resupply. On August 8, the Germans intensified their bombardment, but the fortress garrison withstood several attempts to breach the defensive perimeter. Several days afterward, the bombardment of the fortress reached its peak; its defenders sustained heavy casualty rates of 50% to 75%.&lt;ref name=LT/&gt; On August 14, over 1,000 defending troops were killed,&lt;ref name=LT/&gt; but the Germans were unable to completely overcome the fortress' defenses. However, on the next day, Gamma-Gerät shells destroyed the First Fort and the Germans transferred their attentions to the Second Fort. The fight was now within the confines of the greater fortress complex.

At the cost of many casualties, the Third Fort's defenders delayed the advance of the Germans, but were forced to evacuate and retreat later the same day. The next day the Fourth Fort was abandoned and the Fifth Fort was conquered soon afterwards. In a chain reaction, the other forts began capitulating. Commander Grigoriev abandoned his post and escaped to [[Žiežmariai]].&lt;ref name=LTE/&gt; When the Germans crossed the Nemunas river they captured the Sixth and [[Seventh Fort]]s. The remaining two forts were captured soon afterwards. After eleven days of fighting, the fortress had been taken.&lt;ref name=KTL/&gt;
[[File:Kauno tvirtovė I fortas 1.jpg|thumb|left|Remaining parts of the First Fort]]
The defensive forces sustained 20,000 casualties, and about 1,300&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cornish|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; weapons were captured by the Germans.&lt;ref name=GRI/&gt; Grigoriev was arrested by Russian authorities, tried, and sentenced to fifteen years in prison for failure to properly perform his duties. He also suffered the revocation of all his awards, military degrees, and honors. The Germans used materials from the fortress elsewhere during their war against Russia.&lt;ref name=ML/&gt;

Researchers have identified factors contributing to the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced;&lt;ref name=AP121&gt;{{Harvnb|Pociūnas|2008|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crew had been frequently rotated, and had not been able to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress.&lt;ref name=AP121/&gt; Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground.&lt;ref name=AP121/&gt; When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts.&lt;ref name=AP121/&gt; The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.&lt;ref name=AP121/&gt;

==Interwar==
[[File:Kaunas Fortress.Ninth Fort.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Ninth Fort]]
Lithuania regained [[Council of Lithuania|its independence]] on February 16, 1918 and the old fortress was placed under engineering staff supervision. Those materials that had not been taken by the Germans were used to resupply Lithuanian military needs, and for the construction of the armored train ''Gediminas'', named after the 14th century [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Gediminas]]. In 1920, the Kaunas Fortress Board was formed and charged with the task of administering the fortress. Due to the development of new military technologies, its reconstruction was seen as a vast and inappropriate expense. The fortress' armament was dismantled and the trenches were filled with scrap iron.&lt;ref name=interwar&gt;{{citation|title=Brief Historical Overview of Kaunas Fortress|url=http://www.fortresses.eu/en/f_kaunas_i.html|publisher=INTERREG-project BFR|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections of the fortress were given to various civil institutions, while the army occupied the barracks of the former 28th Division. The Sixth and Ninth forts were used as prisons and the Central Archive was located in the [[Seventh Fort]];&lt;ref name=LT/&gt;&lt;ref name=interwar/&gt;  the Republic's official radio station was based in the fortress; a [[gas chamber]] was installed in the gunpowder depot of the First Fort and used to execute condemned prisoners.&lt;ref name=interwar/&gt; Some sections were used as housing for the poor. As the city of Kaunas expanded near the complex, its roads became public streets. The structures and layouts of the new sections were influenced by the presence of the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Kauno tvirtovė 2007 01 08|publisher= Nijolė Steponaitytė|url=http://www.kamane.lt/lt/atgarsiai/architektura/architekatgarsis110|accessdate= 2008-05-20|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjustments to the secret protocols of the 1939 [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] assigned Lithuania to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sphere of influence, and [[Occupation of the Baltic states|it was occupied]]  by the [[USSR]] in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anušauskas|2007|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress was then used to conduct interrogations and house political prisoners. The pact was broken when [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded USSR]] on June 22, 1941. Nazi forces entered Kaunas on June 24.&lt;ref name=ushm&gt;{{citation|title=1940&amp;ndash;1944 Timeline&amp;ndash;Kovno|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/media_cm.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005174&amp;MediaId=2404|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Museum]]|accessdate=2008-05-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622152414/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/media_cm.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005174&amp;MediaId=2404 |archivedate = June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Fort became a [[POW]] camp for [[Red Army]] soldiers.&lt;ref name=TIC&gt;{{citation|title=Kauno tvirtovė|publisher=Tvirtovių istorijos centras|url=http://www.fortresses.eu/lt/f_kaunas_i.html| accessdate= 2008-05-20|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaunas's Jewish population numbered between 35,000 and 40,000; few would survive the [[Holocaust in Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holocaust Encyclopedia - Kovno|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Museum]]|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005174|date=2008-05-20|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis, aided by [[Collaboration during World War II#Lithuania|Lithuanian auxiliaries]], began massacring the Jewish population. On July 6, acting under orders of the [[SS]], Lithuanian auxiliary police units shot nearly 3,000 Jews at the Seventh Fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gitelman|1997|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, in what came to be known as the &quot;intellectuals action&quot;, over 1,800 Jews were shot at the Fourth Fort. On October 28, the &quot;Great Action&quot; took place&amp;mdash;the residents of the [[Kaunas Ghetto]] were summoned, and over 9,000 men, women and children were taken to the Ninth Fort and executed. During the later course of the occupation, over 5,000 Jewish deportees from [[Central Europe]] would be executed at this fort. About 60 escaped in December 1943; they had been assigned to excavate and burn the bodies of earlier victims, as part of [[Aktion 1005]]. Thirteen of these escapees were able to document the Aktion's attempt to hide the evidence of the mass murders.&lt;ref name=ushm/&gt;

When Germany began losing the war and the battlefront approached Lithuania, the German defense began attempts to prepare a defensive in Kaunas, including the use of the fortress. The [[Nemunas|Nemunas River]] was labelled &quot;the line of catastrophe&quot;, and [[Adolf Hitler]] called for its defense at any price.&lt;ref name=TIC/&gt; On August 1, 1944 Kaunas was captured by the Red Army. The remaining fortress structures were used for military needs and several of the original structures were demolished or redeveloped.&lt;ref name=TIC/&gt;

The number of deaths at the fortress during World War II vary by source; the [[United States Holocaust Museum]] gives detailed descriptions of the deaths of about 18,500 Holocaust victims.&lt;ref name=ushm/&gt; Other sources mention 30,000 Jewish deaths,&lt;ref name=muz&gt;{{citation|title=Kaunas' Ninth Fort Museum| url=http://muziejai.mch.mii.lt/Kaunas/forto_muziejus.en.htm |publisher=Museums of Lithuania|date=2006-12-19|accessdate=2008-05-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225203945/http://muziejai.mch.mii.lt/Kaunas/forto_muziejus.en.htm |archivedate = 2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with total number 50,000.&lt;ref name=interwar/&gt;

[[File:Kauno tvirtove 2007-08-10.jpg|thumb|The Headquarters of the Fortress' commandant, currently housing the Headquarters of [[Lithuanian Air Force]]]]
Lithuania remained a [[Soviet Socialist Republic]] until 1990. In 1948, the headquarters of the [[7th Guards Cherkassy Airborne Division]] was established in the fortress' commandant's headquarters. The barracks were used by the 108th paratroopers regiment and the Fifth Fort served the air defense regiment. Most of the forts, however, served as depots or housed farming organizations.&lt;ref name=TIC/&gt;&lt;ref name=muz/&gt; During the postwar expansion and development of the city, parts of the fortress were dismantled; as part of the construction of [[Kaunas Polytechnic Institute]] the ground-level entrenchments of one defensive sector were destroyed.&lt;ref name=TIC/&gt;

In 1958, the [[Ninth Fort]] was dedicated as a museum.&lt;ref name=MUZ&gt;{{citation| title=Kauno IX forto muziejus|url=http://www.muziejai.lt/Kaunas/forto_muziejus.htm#Naujienos|publisher=Lietuvos muziejai|year=2008|accessdate= 2008-05-15|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1959, its first exhibition was opened, memorializing the crimes that had taken place there.&lt;ref name=MUZ/&gt; The museum later expanded its scope to cover the fortress' entire history. A {{convert|32|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}}&amp;nbsp; tall memorial to the victims was constructed there in 1984. However, the [[Soviet military]] occupied most of the fortress until [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Lithuania re-established its independence]].&lt;ref name=jarma/&gt; After the withdrawal of Soviet forces, completed in 1993, Lithuanian military bases were established at several forts.&lt;ref name=jarma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2005|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:IX Fort (2008-09-20)10.jpg|thumb|left|Museum in the Ninth Fort]]  
As of early 2007, only the Ninth Fort had been partly renovated. It is now devoted to the Holocaust and Lithuania's occupations by the Nazis and the Soviets.&lt;ref name=MUZ/&gt; The museum, which holds over 65,000 artefacts, is sponsored by the [[Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Lithuania|Lithuanian Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name=MUZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=taskforce&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Report on Holocaust Education in Task Force Member Countries - Lithuania - 2006|publisher=The Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research|url=http://www.holocausttaskforce.org/teachers/educational_reports/country/lithuania.php|accessdate=2008-09-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080502151231/http://www.holocausttaskforce.org/teachers/educational_reports/country/lithuania.php |archivedate = May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the early 2000s, it has received about 100,000 visitors per year and hosted Holocaust education seminars and workshops.&lt;ref name=taskforce/&gt; In 2005, the international project &quot;Baltic Culture and Tourism Route Fortresses&quot; was launched, with support from the [[European Union]]. Its goal is the promotion of transnational scientific cooperation in monument protection, along with the creation of strategies to reconstruct and manage fortresses in the region. Kaunas Fortress is a part of this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Baltic Culture and Tourism Route Fortresses|publisher=BSR INTERREG III B programme| url=http://www.bsrinterreg.net/programm/project.php?id=10465&amp;start=0|date=2008-05-10|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Kaunas fortress Seventh fort|Seventh fort]] was sold, new owners started the restoration process, since 2009 [[Kaunas fortress Seventh fort|Seventh fort]] is open as a fortification and military museum and is the only brick fort in Kaunas suitable for safe visiting.  In the 2000s, a variety of entities owned parts of the complex: the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the State Property Fund, and the City of Kaunas. The site still contains unexploded ordnance, although a 1995 project removed about 1.9 tonnes of explosives.&lt;ref name=jarma/&gt; Other restoration issues include uncovered wells, poor drainage and ventilation, erosion, possible chemical contaminants, vegetative overgrowth, and the presence of a protected bat colony.&lt;ref name=jarma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.1998.00025.x|title=Bats of Lithuania: distribution, status and protection|journal=Mammal Review|year=2002|first=D.H.|last=Pauza|pages=53–68|coauthors=N.Pauziene|volume=28|issue=2|issn=0305-1838 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119121554/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|format=|accessdate=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the damage that it has sustained, the Kaunas Fortress complex is the most complete of the surviving Russian Empire fortresses.&lt;ref name=Orlov18&gt;{{Harvnb|Orlov|2007|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
