== Addition/Change to &quot;physical decline&quot; section.==

New research on the impact of repeated concussions on Henry's behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-02-henry-viii-brain-injury-nfl.html |title=Did Henry VIII suffers the same brain injury as NFL players? |publisher=Physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Special:Contributions/86.2.12.245|86.2.12.245]] ([[User talk:86.2.12.245|talk]]) 10:11, 4 February 2016 (UTC)

== Something's wrong but I don't know what's right ==

In the section on Ireland the text reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;However, upon the death of the 8th Earl of Kildare, governor of Ireland, fractional Irish politics combined with a more ambitious Henry to cause trouble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I don't understand &quot;fractional&quot; here.  It's probably meant to be either &quot;factional&quot; or &quot;fractious&quot; (though not much difference between those two).  If there is such a thing as fractional politics, it should be explained. [[User:JamesMLane|JamesMLane]]&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:JamesMLane|t]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JamesMLane|c]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:27, 27 March 2016 (UTC)

:I think that &quot;fractious&quot; is meant, as it has the sense of &quot;Refractory, unruly... (OED, 1st ed.), where &quot;factional&quot; merely means &quot;Of or belonging to a faction or factions...&quot;. [[User:Dhtwiki|Dhtwiki]] ([[User talk:Dhtwiki|talk]]) 21:02, 28 March 2016 (UTC)

== How many Henrys (sons)? ==

The Issue section lists three Henrys, Duke of Cornwall born to Catherine of Aragon, but the [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]] page only lists two. Catherine's page doesn't give a name for the third, stillborn boy. So should the list on this page be corrected?  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/93.191.204.101|93.191.204.101]] ([[User talk:93.191.204.101|talk]]) 21:56, 22 April 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
* There were three Henrys.  See [[Children of Henry VIII]].  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 00:55, 26 April 2016 (UTC)
: Someone seems to have removed some information on the third Henry, possibly on the basis that he was still born and that recording stillbirths is a bias.  I put it back at [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry%2C_Duke_of_Cornwall&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=717149030&amp;oldid=715772873].  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 01:04, 26 April 2016 (UTC)

== This article is terrible ==

This is one of the worst articles, very hard to navigate and find basic info. I still havent find who was his first wife whose marriage annulement ie divorce caused break with the Pope. This reads like a boring history text, no easy parsing for info, not even the name of that woman and link in the intro. Division of article is completely arbitrary. Plus article is edit protected. HORRIBLE. HOW IS THIS A GOOD ARTICLE? Wiki used to be good for easy lookup but this is just useles.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/94.189.146.188|94.189.146.188]] ([[User talk:94.189.146.188|talk]]) 23:58, 25 April 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Ok there is an infobox, but it should really be in the intro ALSO. Plus, you cant NOT put a name and link to his first wife in the first sentence in chapter about annullment. IT MUST BE there. What is frustrating is that you put link to some other Catherine in the beginning of that chapter, VERY CONFUSING AND FRUSTRATING. Such poor writing. This site is supposed to be EASY to find information on. YOU EDIT-PROTECTED THIS and disallow easy fix. WIKIPEDIA IS THE WORST!!!!  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/94.189.146.188|94.189.146.188]] ([[User talk:94.189.146.188|talk]]) 00:03, 26 April 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Ok I will try to fix it. BTW people should not remove comments from talk pages [[User:Kiliopa|Kiliopa]] ([[User talk:Kiliopa|talk]]) 00:40, 26 April 2016 (UTC)

Thanks!

::actually it is fine to remove nonconstructive comments from talk pages. And I think when you look at the article you will see that there are no substantial problems. [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] ([[User talk:Jytdog|talk]]) 01:21, 26 April 2016 (UTC)

:Not for you to decide - restored.

:::No it isn't fine.  &quot;The basic rule—with some specific exceptions outlined below—is that you should not edit or delete the comments of other editors without their permission&quot;.

== Numbering monarchs ==

It's been the practice on Wikipedia to ''not'' number monarchs. Let's stop including the line ''&quot;second monarch of the Tudor dynasty&quot;'', please. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 14:45, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

For example: We don't have ''&quot;fourth monarch of the Windsor dynasty&quot;'' in the intro at [[Elizabeth II]], or ''&quot;sixth monarch of the Hannover dynasty&quot;'' in the intro at [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]. -- [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 14:52, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
:Well, the difference is that you will find plenty of references describing Henry VIII as the second Tudor king. I doubt you will find any referring to Victoria as the sixth Hanoverian monarch. [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 15:07, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
::I don't question that he is the second Tudor to be English monarch. It's just not necessary to mention it in the intro. It's not the practice on Wikipedia to number monarchs. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 15:16, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
:::Wiki practice is to mention whatever reputable sources deem fit to be mentioned, isn't it? [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 15:21, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
::::We don't number monarchs like we do presidents, prime ministers etc, you know that. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 15:25, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
:::::We normally don't. But we do say that [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]] was the first King of Portugal and that [[Tvrtko I]] was the first King of Bosnia. We also say that [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] was the last Emperor of Austria. You are constantly trying to enforce a template of some sort, as if articles about all kings, popes, princesses, etc, have to follow the same pattern. That is simply not achievable. In some cases, it is not even helpful. Henry VIII is commonly called the second Tudor king, possibly because the [[Tudor period]] is well known as such. The fact that Victoria is not known as the sixth Hanoverian monarch is no reason for us to ignore the fact that Henry VIII ''is'' known as the second Tudor monarch. [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 20:13, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

::::::Actually, in many of the articles for English and British monarchs, there are references to their position in their dynasty.  Here's what I've collected:

:::::::[[William the Conqueror]]:  &quot;William I (Old Norman: Williame I; Old English: Willelm I; c. 1028[1] – 9 September 1087), usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard,[2][a] was the '''first''' Norman King of England, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087.&quot;

:::::::[[Henry IV of England]]:  &quot;Henry's mother was Blanche, heiress to the considerable Lancaster estates, and thus he became the '''first''' King of England from the Lancaster branch of the Plantagenets.&quot;

:::::::[[Henry V of England]]:   &quot;He was the '''second''' English monarch who came from the House of Lancaster.&quot;

:::::::[[Edward IV of England]]:  &quot;He was the '''first''' Yorkist King of England.&quot;

:::::::[[Richard III of England]]:  &quot;He was the '''last''' king of the House of York and the '''last''' of the Plantagenet dynasty.&quot;

:::::::[[Henry VII of England]]:  &quot;Henry VII, known before accession as Henry Tudor, 2nd Earl of Richmond (Welsh: Harri Tudur; 28 January 1457 – 21 April 1509), was King of England after seizing the crown on 22 August 1485 until his death, the '''first''' monarch of the House of Tudor. &quot;

:::::::[[Elizabeth I of England]]:  &quot;Sometimes called The Virgin Queen, Gloriana or Good Queen Bess, the childless Elizabeth was the '''last''' monarch of the Tudor dynasty.''

:::::::[[James II of England]]:  &quot;He was the '''last''' Roman Catholic monarch to reign over the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland.&quot;

:::::::[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]]: &quot;Despite seventeen pregnancies by her husband, Prince George of Denmark, she died without any surviving children and was the '''last''' monarch of the House of Stuart.&quot;

:::::::[[George I of Great Britain]]:  &quot;At the age of 54, after the death of Queen Anne of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as the '''first''' monarch of the House of Hanover.&quot;

:::::::[[George III of the United Kingdom]]:  &quot;He was the '''third''' British monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two predecessors he was born in Britain, spoke English as his first language,[1] and never visited Hanover.&quot;

:::::::[[William IV of the United Kingdom]]:  &quot;The third son of George III and younger brother and successor to George IV, he was the '''last king and penultimate''' monarch of Britain's House of Hanover.&quot;

:::::::[[Queen Victoria]]:  &quot;She was the '''last''' British monarch of the House of Hanover.&quot;

:::::::[[George V]]:  &quot;In 1917, George became the '''first''' monarch of the House of Windsor, which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment.&quot;

:::::::[[George VI]]:  &quot;Edward abdicated in order to marry, and George ascended the throne as the '''third''' monarch of the House of Windsor.&quot;

::::::Seems to me that where it is appropriate to make those references, there is no problem with including them.  [[User:Mr Serjeant Buzfuz|Mr Serjeant Buzfuz]] ([[User talk:Mr Serjeant Buzfuz|talk]]) 20:51, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
:::::::Using ''&quot;first&quot;'' or ''&quot;last&quot;'' is acceptable. But, anything/everything in between, not so. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 22:32, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
::::::::Why? [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 22:36, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::Because monarchs are generally not numbered, where's presidents &amp; prime ministers are. Anyways, I'm out numbered here (no pun intended), so there's little point in re-establishing my edits. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 22:40, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::Evidence seems to suggest otherwise, though. [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 22:46, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::GoodDay, you've several times said it's not the practice on Wikipedia to mention the position of a monarch in his/her dynasty.  Is there any previous discussion on this issue that you could point me to?  I've not come across it before? [[User:Mr Serjeant Buzfuz|Mr Serjeant Buzfuz]] ([[User talk:Mr Serjeant Buzfuz|talk]]) 06:10, 31 October 2016 (UTC)
As ever, we should follow the practice used in reliable, high-quality secondary sources; if they mention this as a prominent fact, so should we - if not, we shouldn't. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 21:03, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

:That's fair.  And I would suggest that there is a good reason to point out Henry's status as the second Tudor, because he was the first adult king in almost a century to succeed his father peacefully to the throne, and only the second in almost two centuries.  Henry VIII succeeded Henry VII in 1509. The last time an adult son had peacefully succeeded his father was Henry V in 1413.  Before that, the last time had been when  Edward II peacefully succeeded his father in 1327.  The pattern of an adult son peacefully succeeding his father was an important sign of dynastic stability, compared to the successions that did not fit that pattern over the past two centuries.  Dynastic stability, or lack thereof, was an important part of medieval politics.  This point is therefore worth including in the lead, in my opinion.[[User:Mr Serjeant Buzfuz|Mr Serjeant Buzfuz]] ([[User talk:Mr Serjeant Buzfuz|talk]]) 22:39, 30 October 2016 (UTC)</text>
