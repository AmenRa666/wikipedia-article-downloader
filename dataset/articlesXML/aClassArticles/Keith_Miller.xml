'''Keith Ross Miller''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM|MBE}} (28 November 1919 – 11 October 2004) was an Australian test [[cricket]]er and a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] pilot during [[World War II]]. Miller is widely regarded as Australia's greatest ever [[all-rounder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/australia/3733322.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|first=Oliver|last=Brett| title=Australia's greatest all-rounder|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his ability, irreverent manner and good looks he was a crowd favourite.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of a hero|first=Greg|last=Baum|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/11/1097406502446.html|work=[[The Age]]|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; English journalist [[Ian Wooldridge]] called Miller &quot;the golden boy&quot; of cricket, leading to his being nicknamed &quot;[[Gold nugget|Nugget]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNicoll&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/fiftyaustralians/32.asp |title=Keith Ross Miller, MBE (1919–2004) |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He &quot;was more than a cricketer&amp;nbsp;... he embodied the idea that there was more to life than cricket&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6612.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |title=Players and Officials – Keith Miller |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the record-breaking ''[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Invincibles]]'', at the time of his retirement from [[Test cricket]] in 1956, Miller had the best statistics of any all-rounder in cricket history.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCObit2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/australia/3733322.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|first=Oliver|last=Brett| title=Australia's greatest all-rounder|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=2 February 2009|quote=By the time Miller had retired after 55 tests, he had the finest all-round record in cricket history, with statistics that were only beaten in later eras. The second man, Wilfred Rhodes, was 663 runs and 43 wickets behind him}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often batted high in the [[Batting order (cricket)|order]], sometimes as high as number three. He was a powerful striker of the ball, and one straight [[six (cricket)|six]] that he hit at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] was still rising when it hit the upper deck of the grandstand. Miller was famous for varying his [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]]  to bemuse batsmen: he made sparing use of slower deliveries and would often adjust his run-up, surprisingly bowling his fastest deliveries from a short run. He was also a fine [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]] and an especially acrobatic catcher in the [[slips (cricket)|slips]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt;

Away from cricket, Miller was also a successful [[Australian rules football]]er. He played for [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and was selected to represent the [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|Victorian state team]]. He played 50 games for St Kilda, for whom he kicked eight [[Laws of Australian football#Scoring|goal]]s in one game against North Melbourne, during 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;argus1941&quot;&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/8200431 ''The Argus'' 25.08.1941 p8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's personality — love of the contest, rather than victory, and his larger-than-life rebelliousness and carousing — helped both shape and limit his cricketing career, as he espoused the opposite of the more puritanical values of [[Donald Bradman]], his captain and later national selector. [[Neville Cardus]] referred to Miller as &quot;the Australian in excelsis&quot;; ''[[Daily Mail]]'' sportswriter [[Ian Wooldridge]]'s response was &quot;By God he was right&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt; This status was reflected when Miller was made one of the ten inaugural members of the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]].

==Early years==
{{main|Early life of Keith Miller}}
[[File:Woodfull stance.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Australian cricket captain [[Bill Woodfull]] was Miller's high school mathematics teacher.]]
Born in the western [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Sunshine, Victoria|Sunshine]], Miller was the youngest of Leslie and Edith Miller's four children.&lt;ref name=&quot;p10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w42&gt;Whitington, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers [[Keith Macpherson Smith|Keith]] and [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Ross Smith]],&lt;ref name=w42/&gt;&lt;ref name=m61&gt;Mallett, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; who were half-way through their historic [[England to Australia flight|flight from England to Australia]] at the time Miller was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|last=Pollard

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
The three Miller boys played [[Australian rules football]] in winter and cricket in summer. Their father had been a successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique,&lt;ref name=&quot;p11&quot;/&gt; relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of [[Bill Ponsford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p12&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], in Melbourne's south east.&lt;ref name=&quot;p12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w43&gt;Whitington, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;p13&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w45&gt;Whitington, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 12, he was selected for an under-15 Victorian schoolboys cricket team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;/&gt; At the time, he stood only {{convert|150|cm|ft|1}} tall and wielded a sawn-off bat.&lt;ref name=&quot;p15&quot;/&gt; He lacked power, but impressed with his footwork and style.&lt;ref name=&quot;p15&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p16&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Miller reasoned that, as he appeared destined to be short, a career as a jockey was more likely than one as a cricketer or footballer.&lt;ref name=&quot;p17&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m64&gt;Mallett, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w47&gt;Whitington, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller attended the selective [[Melbourne High School]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p17&quot;/&gt; where [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] [[Test cricket|test]] captain [[Bill Woodfull]] was his mathematics teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;&gt;Coleman, pp. 473–478.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was a mediocre student,&lt;ref name=&quot;p18&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; which disappointed Woodfull;&lt;ref name=&quot;p18&quot;/&gt; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;p19&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 14, Miller was selected for the school's [[first XI]], scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him ''The Unbowlable''—Woodfull's own nickname.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to [[Bowled]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p20&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, and was forced to repeat the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;p21&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p22&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Truscott]], Miller's school cricket captain took him to a trial with local club side [[St Kilda Cricket Club|St Kilda]] at the start of the 1934–35 season, but Miller could not find a place in any of its five teams.&lt;ref name=w47/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p21&quot;/&gt; Joining the local [[Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association|sub-district]] cricket club [[Elsternwick]] instead, he did not get to bat or bowl in his first match, and was dropped to the second XI for his poor fielding.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w48&gt;Whitington, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his team-mate, former [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] state player [[Hughie Carroll]], spotted Miller's talent and lured him to the rival [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne]] club.&lt;ref name=&quot;p22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w48/&gt; Miller began playing for South Melbourne the following season.&lt;ref name=&quot;p22&quot;/&gt; It was at South Melbourne that Miller met [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Lindsay Hassett]], his future Australia captains. Miller scored 12 not out on debut, but observers felt he would succeed with a stronger physique;&lt;ref name=&quot;p23&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodfull wrote in the 1936 school magazine, &quot;Miller has Test possibilities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p25&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1936, Miller played for South Melbourne against [[Carlton Cricket Club|Carlton]], captained by Woodfull. Miller came to the crease at 6/32.&lt;ref name=&quot;p25&quot;/&gt; He guided his team to 141, putting on a stand of 65 with the last man and finishing with 61.&lt;ref name=&quot;p26&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w49&gt;Whitington, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd gave Miller a standing ovation, and newspapers him compared him to Ponsford and [[Alan Kippax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p27&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carlton team presented him with a silver eggcup, &quot;for sterling performance&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;FabFarewell&quot;&gt;{{cite news

During 1936, Miller underwent a sudden growth spurt,&lt;ref name=&quot;p25&quot;/&gt; of {{convert|28|cm|in|1}} in the year,&lt;ref name=&quot;p29&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; reaching {{convert|185|cm|ft|1}} in height. This thwarted his career as a jockey.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;&lt;ref name=m64/&gt;&lt;ref name=w49/&gt; With his increased height and weight, he began to play football with more physical aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;p28&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1936, he completed year 10 and quit high school, taking a position as a clerk.&lt;ref name=&quot;p30&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1937–38 cricket season, Miller transferred to the [[VCA Colts cricket team|VCA Colts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p29&quot;/&gt; where he won the team's batting trophy for having the best average.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p30&quot;/&gt; At this stage, his method of playing was slow and steady accumulation of runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;p31&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the summer, he made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for Victoria and hit 181 against [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].&lt;ref name=w49/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16497.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |title=Victoria v Tasmania 1937–38 |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938–39, he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs at an average of 25.00. However, he was yet to play in the [[Sheffield Shield]] competition, having appeared only in one-off matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;p33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/741/f_Batting_by_Season.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |title=First-class batting and fielding in each season by KR Miller |accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Miller achieved more success as a footballer, following his brothers in joining the [[Brighton Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) in 1937.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; A defender, Miller initially played on the [[Australian rules football positions#Half-Back Flank|half-back flank]] before moving to [[Fullback (Australian rules football)|full back]] during his third season, in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;p33&quot;/&gt; At this stage, he lacked the strength to [[hip and shoulder]] his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.&lt;ref name=&quot;p33&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller finally made his breakthrough in cricket in 1939–40, when he was selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut, against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p35&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He managed just four and seven, batting at number five in the order.&lt;ref name=w49/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p37&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; When Victoria fielded, Miller [[run out|ran out]] his future ''[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Invincibles]]'' captain [[Don Bradman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p36&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w50&gt;Whitington, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Miller's teammates was [[Percy Beames]], who was also his manager at [[Vacuum Oil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p38&quot;/&gt; Miller scored 41 and 47 not out in his second match to hold his place. However, against [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]], Miller made a pair of 14s, having difficulties against [[leg spin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p38&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the return match against South Australia, Miller took the initiative against leg-spinner [[Clarrie Grimmett]], aggressively advancing down the pitch and [[List of cricket terms#D|driving]]. Miller reached 108, his first [[Century (cricket)|century]] in Shield competition.&lt;ref name=w50/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p39&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p40&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the century, Miller had a moderate season, ending with 298 runs at 29.80.&lt;ref name=&quot;p43&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian winter of 1940, Miller started his fourth season in the VFA. In a match against [[Coburg Tigers|Coburg]], he was assigned to [[fullback (Australian rules football)|nullify]] &lt;!-- this wikilink is too obscure for the term --&gt; the greatest forward of the era, [[Bob Pratt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p44&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller restricted Pratt to just one goal for the match and was named [[man of the match|best on ground]].&lt;ref&gt;Pratt had scored 678 goals in ten seasons for [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), the top tier of football, see Perry, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scouts from top-tier [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) club [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] signed Miller on the spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;p46&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In a match for St Kilda against [[Carlton Blues|Carlton]], Miller was [[wikt:king hit|king hit]] by his opponent [[Ron Cooper (Australian footballer)|Ron Cooper]] at the start of the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;p47&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Main&quot;&gt;Main, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; When the teams next met, Miller [[hip and shoulder|shoulder bumped]] Cooper in the first minute, forcing him to leave the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;p48&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; St Kilda finished second-last that season.&lt;ref name=&quot;p49&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War service==
{{main|Military career of Keith Miller}}
Miller's sporting career was interrupted by World War II. On 20 August 1940, he joined the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] (army reserve), and was assigned to the 4th Reserve Motor Transport Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;p49&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ww2nom1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A non-conformist, he had the first of many clashes with authority in November, when he was fined for &quot;using insulting language to a superior officer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p49&quot;/&gt; Miller soon lived up to the traditional nickname of ''Dusty'', for anyone called Miller, with his tendency to be involved in fist fights and his rambunctious persona.&lt;ref name=&quot;p50&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1940–41, Miller was granted leave so that he could play interstate &lt;!-- rm specify. They only had one-offs that season --&gt; cricket. In a war-shortened season, Miller scored 140 runs at 28.00 and took his maiden first-class wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;p50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=hr384&gt;Harte, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c432&gt;Coleman, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w53&gt;Whitington, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1941 VFL season also went ahead. Miller played in defence and attack, depending on match conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;p51&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 16 games, he kicked 28 goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.afl.com.au/public/statistics/playerseasonlist/12/1941/playerseasonlist_12_1941.shtml?club_idIndex=13&amp;season_idIndex=66 |publisher=[[Australian Football League]] |title=AFL statistics for St Kilda FC, season 1941 |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including eight in one match.&lt;ref name=&quot;p51&quot;/&gt; He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation, striking his boss Beames—who played for [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]]—with a raised elbow at the start of a match. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;p52&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's season ended early when he was recalled to duty. However, he had continued disciplinary problems,&lt;ref name=&quot;p52&quot;/&gt; and left the Militia on 8 November 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww2nom1&quot;/&gt; Miller and a friend then attempted to join the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. When the navy rejected his friend, Miller tore up his own paperwork, left the recruiting office, and walked around the corner to the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) recruiting office, where he enlisted.&lt;ref name=p52/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w52&gt;Whitington, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than two months after the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Miller was called to active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww2nom2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:RAAF cricket team 1943.jpg|thumb|left|The team for the first RAAF match. Miller is standing sixth from left.]]
Miller was invited to join a [[Royal Australian Air Force cricket team|RAAF team]] in London.&lt;ref name=p62/&gt; The team was officially formed in preparation for the 1943 season and Miller's selection let to the first of many brushes with death: in April, while away with the team, some of his comrades were killed in a German air strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;crossfire39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p62&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p64&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m63&gt;Mallett, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h2&gt;Haigh (1997), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller played his first match at [[Lord's]] against [[Plum Warner|Warner's XI]], a team that featured past, current and future [[England national cricket team|England]] players, including [[Bob Wyatt]], [[Gubby Allen]], [[Trevor Bailey]] and [[Alec Bedser]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p65&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p66&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/136/136523.html |title=Scorecard: Sir PF Warner's XI v Royal Australian Air Force|publisher=Cricket Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller top-scored in the first innings with 45 and added 21 not out, with two sixes, in the second innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p67&quot;/&gt; The RAAF played eight matches that season and Miller's top score was 141 against [[Public School Wanderers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p67&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to play for [[Dominions cricket team|Dominions]] against Warner's XI in August, scoring 32 and two.&lt;ref name=&quot;p68&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The match marked the first meeting between Miller and his good friend, England batsman [[Denis Compton]] and his bowling began to attract media attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;p69&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final match of the season at Lord's between the RAAF and the [[Royal Air Force]], Miller took 3/23 and scored 91.&lt;ref name=&quot;p70&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of RAAF and Dominions that season, especially the attractive batting by Miller and [[Keith Carmody]],&lt;ref name=hr385&gt;Harte, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; prompted Warner to begin planning for a &quot;Test&quot; series between the respective armed services of England and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w66&gt;Whitington, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1943, Miller was based in [[Gloucestershire]]. One night, he threatened to punch his commanding officer, resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;p71&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-November, he was posted to [[Ouston, Stamfordham|Ouston]] near [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] where he trained in the used of [[radar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p72&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay there, Miller sustained a back injury during a wrestling match: the injury was to cause him recurring and enduring problems, particularly diminishing his ability to bowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;p74&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p78&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Miller was again selected for the RAAF team. In a match against the British Civil Defence Services at Lord's in July, Miller reached his century just as a [[V-1 flying bomb]] landed nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;w66&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p79&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In a match against an [[wiktionary:Scratch team|England XI]], Miller scored 85 in 100 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p80&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; He then took match figures of 6/28 against the West of England at [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p81&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:De Havilland Mosquito-DK338-1942.jpg|thumb|right|A Mosquito, the type of aircraft piloted by Miller during World War II.]]
After ten months of training, Miller was offered a commission as a [[pilot officer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p81&quot;/&gt; and was posted to 12 Advanced Flying Unit in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]] on 15 August 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;p82&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; then moving on to [[Cranfield]], [[Bedfordshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p83&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;  On a trip back to Ouston to visit former comrades, a night of drunken revelry saw Miller charged with eight offences and facing possible [[dishonourable discharge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p83&quot;/&gt; Luckily for Miller, his new Commanding Officer (CO) was his old CO from Ouston; Miller escaped with a fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;p84&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

While training, Miller flew [[Bristol Beaufort|Beauforts]], [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighters]] and [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquitos]]. He had another near death experience: mechanical problems forced him to make an emergency landing of his Beaufighter. The plane was repaired for use by others, but, on its next flight, the pilot was killed when the problem recurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;p85&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w56&gt;Whitington, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Miller avoided colliding with a hangar by centimetres.&lt;ref name=w56/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p86&quot;/&gt; He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment; a [[V1 Flying Bomb|V1 bomb]] hit the venue and killed many of the patrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;p86&quot;/&gt; In October, he went [[AWOL|AWL]] to watch a concert and was summarily discharged, but the CO revoked his decision after Miller agreed to play for his cricket team.&lt;ref name=&quot;p86&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his officer training, Miller was sent aboard a [[Royal Navy]] destroyer as part of an exchange program between the forces. During a mission to [[Belgium]], the vessel fought a German [[U-boat]], which was sunk. Upon his return to England, Miller was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 4 November 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;p89&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1945, Miller was deployed to the RAF station at [[Great Massingham]] in [[Norfolk]], [[East Anglia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p93&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to [[No. 169 Squadron RAF|169 Squadron]], flying Mosquito [[fighter-bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;p94&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's squadron took part in missions against targets on mainland Europe in April and May 1945. They attacked V-1 and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] production and test launch sites on the island of [[Peenemünde]] in the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p95&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m62&gt;Mallett, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w58&gt;Whitington, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April, Miller took part in an attack on a German installation at [[Flensburg]] in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p96&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, his squadron was deployed in [[Operation Fire Bash]], to attack [[Westerland Airfield]] on the island of [[Sylt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p96&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p97&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Miller's bombs failed to release and the load dangled from a wing. Miller was obliged to land the plane with the bomb still attached.&lt;ref name=c478/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w58&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p99&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's next mission was delayed by poor weather, by which time Germany had surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; His commanding officer ordered him to fly air force personnel over Germany to view the results of Allied bombing. On one flight, Miller broke away from the flying formation and returned to base late because he wanted to fly over [[Bonn]], the birthplace of [[Beethoven]].&lt;ref name=c478/&gt;&lt;ref name=m62/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p102&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's wartime exploits were to give him a greater sense of perspective when he returned to the sports field. When asked many years later by [[Michael Parkinson]], about pressure in cricket, Miller responded with the famous quote:&lt;ref name=p129/&gt;&lt;ref name=730report/&gt; &quot;Pressure is a [[Messerschmitt Bf-109|Messerschmitt]] up your arse, playing cricket is not&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p129&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;730report&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Victory Tests===
{{see also|Victory Tests}}

The end of the war prompted the belated start of the [[1945 English cricket season|1945 cricket season]]. Miller returned to Lord's and scored 50 for the RAAF against a British Empire XI.&lt;ref name=&quot;p102&quot; /&gt; Warner had organised a celebratory series of matches between England and Australian servicemen, known as the [[Victory Tests]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p103&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Australian cricket administrators would not accredit the three-day matches as Tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;p103&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p104&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po366&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w65&gt;Whitington, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; England was close to full strength, so the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] and the RAAF teams merged to form the [[Australian Services cricket team]] under the leadership of [[Warrant Officer]] Hassett.&lt;ref name=&quot;p104&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w65/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p105&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po362&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; The First Victory Test was at Lord's and was expected to usher in a new post-war era, which cricket watchers hoped would be more attractive to watch.&lt;ref name=&quot;p105&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po360&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; England batted first and Miller bowled his Great Massingham colleague [[Bill Edrich]] to end with 1/11 and precipitate an English collapse.&lt;ref name=po362/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p106&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w72&gt;Whitington, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller came to the crease at and helped Australia take the lead, before cutting loose, eventually finishing with 105 in 210 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p107&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1988), pp. 362–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' opined that his innings was &quot;as good a century as has been seen at Lord's in many a long day&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p108&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia went on to win by six wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;p110&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h386&gt;Harte, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po363&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h387&gt;Harte, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w73&gt;Whitington, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller warmed up for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] and the RAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;p111&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Test, played at [[Bramall Lane]], Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p112&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w76&gt;Whitington, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po364&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell,&lt;ref name=h387/&gt; hitting Test world record holder [[Len Hutton]] and [[Cyril Washbrook]] on the arm and head respectively, provoking an angry crowd reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;po364&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p113&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m73&gt;Mallett, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him to start taking it seriously, instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;m73&quot;/&gt; Despite this, Australia lost the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;m73&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p114&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w77&gt;Whitington, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Miller earned the further ire of his CO by flying unauthorised leisure flights. Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the CO ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire. With one functional engine, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;w58&quot;/&gt; The plane broke apart and caught fire, but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later.&lt;ref name=&quot;w58&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m65&gt;Mallett, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miller bowls Hutton.jpg|thumb|[[Len Hutton]]'s off stump has just been knocked out by Miller during the Third Victory Test.]]
The next day, Miller headed to Lord's to play for the RAAF against the South of England. Chasing 208, Miller scored an unbeaten 78 in 95 minutes, but rain washed out the match.&lt;ref name=h387/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p120&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first innings of Third Victory Test at Lord's,&lt;ref name=&quot;p121&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; when finally called upon to bowl, Miller measured out a run-up&lt;ref name=po365&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitington, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and removed [[John Dewes]], [[Donald Carr]] and Hutton, all bowled. He ended with 3/44.&lt;ref name=po365/&gt;&lt;ref name=w78/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was rewarded with the new ball in the second innings. He removed Dewes, Edrich and [[Dick Pollard]] to end with 3/42.&lt;ref name=&quot;p124&quot;/&gt; This left Australia a target of 225. Miller saw Australia to the target, unbeaten on 71.&lt;ref name=&quot;m73&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po365/&gt;&lt;ref name=w78/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p124&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p125&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Fourth Test, again at Lord's, Miller scored 118 in the first innings,&lt;ref name=po365/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p126&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h388&gt;Harte, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w79&gt;Whitington, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; before an unbeaten 25 in the second innings ensured a draw.&lt;ref name=po365/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p127&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The tremendous public reception of the Victory Tests resulted in a fifth match being added to the schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;p128&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime Japan had surrendered, and No. 169 Squadron was disbanded. Miller had spent around 550 hours in the air with the RAF, to which his RAAF unit had been seconded. He was awarded the [[1939-1945 Star|1939–45 Star]], [[France and Germany Star]], [[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]], [[War Medal 1939–1945]] and [[Australia Service Medal 1939-45|Australia Service Medal 1939–45]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p128&quot;/&gt;

In the Fifth Victory Test, under overcast conditions against a swinging and seaming ball, Miller struck 14 from his first over and finished 77 not out, in a display that featured strong cutting and driving.&lt;ref name=po366/&gt;&lt;ref name=h388/&gt;&lt;ref name=w79/&gt; Australia could manage only 173, and England were on top.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller took one wicket with the ball but managed only four in the second innings as England won, to square the series 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Hassett wrote at the end of the series that &quot;This is cricket as it should be... let's have no more talk of &quot;war&quot; in cricket&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p132&quot;/&gt; Miller topped the batting averages for the series, with 443 runs at 63.28. His aggregate exceeded those of Hammond and Hutton, and he also took 10 wickets at 27.70.&lt;ref name=&quot;p132&quot;/&gt; Of Miller's batting, Hassett said that &quot;as a strokeplayer he is second to none&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;p132&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m74&gt;Mallett, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po367/&gt; and his performance earned comparisons to [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]], who had a similar breakthrough after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=w79/&gt;

The last big match of the season was a one-off match at Lord's between England and &quot;Dominions&quot;, a [[scratch team]] of players from the British Commonwealth. Miller managed 26 in the Dominions' first innings of 307,&lt;ref name=&quot;p1323&quot;&gt;Perry, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; before cutting loose in the second innings. After settling in, he hit [[Eric Hollies]] for two sixes, including one that hit the top of the roof.&lt;ref name=m64/&gt;&lt;ref name=po367/&gt;&lt;ref name=w81&gt;Whitington, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, he registered his century in 115 minutes, clouting another five balls over the boundary in the morning session. In one 35-minute passage of play, he and [[Learie Constantine]] added 91 runs, before Miller departed for 185, made in just 165 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p1323&quot;/&gt; The Dominions went on to win by 45 runs in a match described by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' as &quot;one of the finest ever seen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p135&quot;/&gt; Commenting on Miller' innings, [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow|Robertson-Glasgow]] said &quot;From the moment he takes guard he plays each ball just that much below its supposed merits that scratches a bowler's pride&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p134&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller had enjoyed his visit to the home of cricket. In eight innings at Lord's for the season, he had scored 568 runs at 94.68, with three centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;p135&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The season ended with a few more matches against English counties.

Miller, the vice-captain, almost missed the trip to India after turning up late for the voyage.&lt;ref name=&quot;p139&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival in India, Miller scored 46 in a draw against [[North Zone cricket team|North Zone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p141&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 86–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller then captained the Australians in a match against [[West Zone cricket team|West Zone]] in [[Bombay]], top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;p142&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po368&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; In a match against [[India national cricket team|India]], Miller took two wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;p143&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, with most of the team suffering from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to travel by air,&lt;ref name=&quot;w94&quot;/&gt; some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy, with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him.&lt;ref name=w94&gt;Whitington, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po369&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;w94&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=po369/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p146&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second match against India, Services were 2/250 in response to India's 386 when Miller came in and scored 82, including four sixes in five balls.&lt;ref name=&quot;p149&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p150&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w97&gt;Whitington, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h390&gt;Harte, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended in a draw and Miller aggravating an injury.&lt;ref name=w97/&gt;&lt;ref name=po370&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller took 3/19 against [[South Zone cricket team|South Zone]] in [[Chennai|Madras]], the Australians' only win in India. He failed with the bat in the third and final match against India, scoring two and seven, but he took 2/60 in the first innings as India took the series 1–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;p151&quot;/&gt; Overall, Miller had a disappointing series in the international matches, with 107 runs at 26.25 and four wickets at 40.50.&lt;ref name=&quot;p151&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's final match was in [[Colombo]] against an All Ceylon team.

===Services in Australia===
[[File:Miller and Pepper.jpg|thumb|upright|Miller walks out to bat with Services teammate [[Cec Pepper]].]]
Upon returning to Australia, Hassett's men were assigned to play a further six first-class matches against the state teams. The fixtures were meant to revive cricket and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to [[New Zealand]] in March 1946.&lt;ref name=po369/&gt;&lt;ref name=h391/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p157&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller started his campaign with 80 against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p157&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po371&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; He finally returned to Melbourne in January, before taking on Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;p160&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 in an innings defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;p161&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w104&gt;Whitington, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po372&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller had another difficult time against [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]], as the state side made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless.&lt;ref name=&quot;p161&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po372/&gt; When the servicemen batted, they faced an attack featuring leading leg spinner [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] and paceman [[Ray Lindwall]], the fastest in Australia.&lt;ref name=po372/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p162&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w101&gt;Whitington, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was on 74 as Services limped to 9/171. With only one partner left, Miller attacked, scoring 31 of the last 33 runs to end unbeaten on 105, and earning plaudits among cricket pundits on Australian soil.&lt;ref name=h391/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p162&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w105&gt;Whitington, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Former leading Test batsman [[Alan Kippax]] opined that &quot;Australia has unearthed a new champion&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;p163&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; while O'Reilly said that Miller's century was &quot;one of the best hundreds ever got against me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p163&quot;/&gt; Miller compiled 46 in the second innings as the Servicemen fell to another innings defeat. Miller finished the season with 4/49 against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] and a pair of fifties against Tasmania.&lt;ref name=&quot;p163&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w106&gt;Whitington, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test career==

===Test debut===

At the end of the season, Miller was selected for the New Zealand tour, under the captaincy of Queensland's [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p166&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h393&gt;Harte, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller started the tour well, top-scoring with 139 against [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]].&lt;ref name=h393/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p167&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with seven other debutants,&lt;ref name=&quot;onetest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62661.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=28 November 2007|title=Only Test: New Zealand vs Australia at Wellington, March&amp;nbsp;29–30, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller made his test debut in the match against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]], a match that was retrospectively accorded Test status in 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;p168&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[sticky wicket]], New Zealand won the toss and batted. Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings as O'Reilly and [[Ernie Toshack]] skittled the home side for just 42.&lt;ref name=&quot;p168&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; Australia made 8/199 with Miller scoring 30. He was allowed to take the new ball in the second innings,&lt;ref name=&quot;p169&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; taking 2/6 in six overs before a flare-up of his back injury forced him to be removed from the attack. Australia bowled their hosts out for 54, securing an innings victory.&lt;ref name=h393/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p170&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the scare over his back complaint, Miller returned from New Zealand to play in the 1946 season, which turned out to be his last season in the VFL; St Kilda's finished second-last.&lt;ref name=&quot;p174&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller played with more aggression than during his pre-war years and his high leaping [[Mark (Australian rules football)|marks]] were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia.&lt;ref name=p175/&gt; Miller thus became one of the few players to play at the highest levels of both cricket and Australian rules football.&lt;ref name=&quot;p175&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miller V.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Miller sporting a cut nose during a football match]]
Miller was discharged from the RAAF on 26 June 1946,&lt;ref name=&quot;p175&quot;/&gt; and returned to his job at Vacuum Oil. Miller resented the fact that many of his colleagues had avoided the hazards of war and moved steadily up the ladder and regarded his job as demeaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;p176&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w108&gt;Whitington, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Under such circumstances, Miller contemplated quitting Australian cricket and accepting a professional contract with [[Rawtenstall Cricket Club|Rawtenstall]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]], valued at £1,000 per year,&lt;ref name=w110&gt;Whitington, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; for three seasons. With advertising and commercial commitments likely to triple this figure, playing in England would have been approximately ten times more lucrative than continuing in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;p176&quot;/&gt; However, Miller was worried that his impulsive style would be curtailed by the pressures of professionalism. At that time, the Board of Control's policy stipulated that any player that signed with a professional league in England could not represent Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;p180&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's contract would see him in England until he was 30, effectively ending his career for Australia. Furthermore, it would have prevented him from playing Australian football during the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;p177&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Miller weighed it up and opted to sign the contract that tied him to Rawtenstall, with his duties to start with the onset of the English season in April 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;p178&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Miller had the upcoming Test series against England in 1946–47 to look forward to. He therefore approached his employers for two months leave so that he could travel to the United States to marry Wagner, which would allow him time to return in preparation for the international series. Vacuum Oil refused, so, with the comfort of job security in England, Miller resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;p178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w109&gt;Whitington, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller left Australia at the end of the football season in late August, amid press speculation that he might not return.&lt;ref name=&quot;p179&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reunited in Boston with Wagner after more than three years of separation and they married on 21 September 1946. Miller and his new bride returned to Australia in November.&lt;ref name=p180/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w109&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, his contract with Rawtenstall became public knowledge and he was threatened with his Test career being terminated if he began playing for the English team.&lt;ref name=p180/&gt;

===First Ashes series===
{{main|Keith Miller in the 1946-47 Australian cricket season}}
Miller's season started amid ongoing speculation about whether he would fulfil his contract with Rawtenstall. Miller remained silent.&lt;ref name=&quot;p182&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Shield match in front of Bradman at the [[Adelaide Oval]], Miller struck form with 188 and 2/32 with the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;w109&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p184&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sc1&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[CricketArchive]]|accessdate=12 December 2008|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17890.html|title=South Australia v Victoria Sheffield Shield 1946/47}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' said Miller's innings was &quot;one of the finest batting displays ever seen at Adelaide&quot;.&lt;ref name=a115&gt;Armstrong, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman saw Miller as a top-order batsman and as the new ball partner for Lindwall. Although Miller was a reluctant bowler, Bradman felt that he was crucial to his strategy of attacking England's strong batting line-up with express pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;p185&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- controversy over his contract - what happened? --&gt;

Miller made his Ashes debut in the [[1946-47 Ashes series#First Test – Brisbane|First Test in Brisbane]]. Bradman opted for six front-line bowlers, with Miller as high as number five in the batting order.&lt;ref name=&quot;p186&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia batted first, with Miller coming in at 3/322.&lt;ref name=po381&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; He played aggressively to reach his fifty in just 80 minutes, striking a six onto the roof of the members' stand at [[long on]], the biggest hit at the ground at the time,&lt;ref name=p188/&gt; before being trapped [[leg before wicket]] by [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] for 79 as Australia made 645.&lt;ref name=&quot;p188&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w112&gt;Whitington, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was given the new ball along with Lindwall and he took his first Ashes wicket, bowling Hutton as England closed at 1/21. The following day, the pitch had turned into a [[sticky wicket]] following a heavy tropical storm.&lt;ref name=po381/&gt; Miller bowled off breaks at medium pace and mixed in a large amount of [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p189&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- medium pace bouncers? --&gt; On the unpredictable surface, Edrich was struck around 40 times on the body. Miller cut through the English top order, removing Edrich, Washbrook, Compton and [[Jack Ikin]] on the fourth morning, finishing with 7/60 as England made 141 and were forced to [[follow on]]. Miller took two wickets, including the dismissal of Hutton with first ball of the second innings as England fell to defeat by an innings and 334 runs and Miller had match figures of 9/77.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/player/6612.html?class=1;template=results;type=allround;view=innings|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title=Statsguru – KR Miller – Test matches – All-round analysis|accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that first Test, an incident occurred, coloured by Miller's wartime service, that soured his relationship with Bradman and his feelings towards Test cricket. [[Michael Parkinson]] described it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Keith Miller was deeply affected by the Second World War. It changed him ... In the first post-war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... [and] Bill Edrich came in. He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman came up to me and said, 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark put me off Test cricket. Never felt the same way about it after that.'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Wisden'' 2003, p. 1671.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Second Test – Sydney|Second Test in Sydney]]. Miller had a quiet match, scoring 40 and taking one wicket on a spin-friendly pitch as Australia secured another innings victory,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p192&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h397&gt;Harte, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po384&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w116&gt;Whitington, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; but showed he was in prime batting form when he returned to the Sheffield Shield. Playing against New South Wales, he hammered three sixes in one over and made 153 of a 271-run partnership with [[Merv Harvey]] in just over three hours, setting up an innings victory. [[Bill Ponsford]] said that it was the hardest hitting he had ever seen.&lt;ref name=w110/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p194&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsw1&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[CricketArchive]]|title=Victoria v New South Wales Sheffield Shield 1946/47|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17923.html|accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Test was Miller's first in his home town. He had a mediocre game in a drawn match, scoring 33 and 34, and taking two wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Off the pitch, Miller privately decided that he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract.&lt;ref name=p197/&gt; He secretly accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;p197&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; but he shone with the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day.&lt;ref name=&quot;p198&quot;/&gt; He hit the first ball of the next day for six,&lt;ref name=w132&gt;Whitington, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised [[leg theory]] to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men on the [[boundary (cricket)|fence]]. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;p198&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po387&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.&lt;ref name=&quot;p199&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1946-47 Ashes series#Fifth Test – Sydney|Fifth Test]]. saw Miller take a wicket in each innings. Australia were left a target of 214 runs on a wearing wicket. Wright beat Miller with three consecutive leg breaks, but Miller survived and struck consecutive boundaries on the way to reaching the target.&lt;ref name=&quot;p201&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1988), pp. 388–389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h399&gt;Harte, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w136&gt;Whitington, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia had taken the series 3–0; Miller scored 384 runs at 76.80 and took 16 wickets at 20.88, which placed him second in both the batting and bowling averages, to Bradman and Lindwall respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;p201&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Miller had become disillusioned with Bradman's ruthless mentality. Miller was impulsive and cared little for records or ruthlessly dominating his opponents, preferring to play in a flamboyant manner in close contests.&lt;ref name=&quot;p193&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 114–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1947–48 Australian season, Miller transferred to [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales (NSW)]], for whom he played the remainder of his Sheffield Shield career. He also represented the New South Wales interstate football team at the [[1947 Hobart Carnival]], as vice captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://army.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4619/history/story01.htm|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate=23 November 2008|title=Air Force News – A rich innings}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made him one of the few players to play both football and cricket for two states.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

Miller had a light workload in the 1947–48 home Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p219&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; who were on their first tour to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://stats.cricinfo.com/india/engine/records/team/series_results.html?class=1;id=6;type=team| accessdate =24 September 2008| publisher = ESPNcricinfo| title = Series results – India – Test matches}}&lt;/ref&gt; India were well beaten, losing 4–0, three of the four defeats by an innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/india/engine/series/60340.html| title = India in Australia Test Series, 1947/48| publisher = ESPNcricinfo| accessdate =24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185&amp;nbsp;runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; while the batsmen ahead of him plundered the bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;p219&quot;/&gt; His bowling duties were also light; his 72&amp;nbsp;overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; In both his fifties, Miller featured in century partnerships with his partners, respectively Bradman and Hassett in the First and Fourth test respectively.&lt;ref name=po394&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; His 58 in the First Test at Brisbane featured many big hits.&lt;ref name=po393&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later match, against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], Miller was involved in a famous incident that is frequently cited when his character is discussed; it also spotlighted his differences with Bradman. On a day when the Australians set a world-record of 721&amp;nbsp;runs in a single day,&lt;ref name=&quot;p227&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m69&gt;Mallett, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller came to the crease with his side already dominating, with the score 2/364. He deliberately allowed himself to be [[bowled]] first ball, much to Bradman's displeasure, in a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;p226&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f67&gt;Fingleton, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia then took on [[Marylebone Cricket Club|the MCC]] at [[Lord's]]; effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests as many of England's Test players were in the MCC team.&lt;ref name=&quot;p228&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller scored 163 in 250&amp;nbsp;minutes, hitting 20&amp;nbsp;fours and three sixes in another innings win.&lt;ref name=&quot;p228&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Rawtenstall dropped the contract dispute with Miller after being offered compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;p230&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first morning, Miller bowled Hutton and Compton on his way to 3/38, helping Australia dismiss England cheaply and seize the initiative. Miller scored a duck, but Australia took a 344-run lead on the first innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p235&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= First Test Match England v Australia|work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]|year=1949|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152894.html|accessdate=2 July 2008|publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second innings, he resumed his battle with Hutton and Compton, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;p235&quot;/&gt; The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd.&lt;ref name=f98&gt;Fingleton, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, he bowled Hutton for 74 and then [[bouncer (cricket)|bounced]] Compton, causing him to [[hit wicket|fall onto his stumps]] for 184.&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 99–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia won by eight wickets,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 236–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller ending with 4/125 for the second innings and 7/163 for the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p238&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller was unfit to bowl during the Second Test at Lord's.&lt;ref name=&quot;p239&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; During England's first innings, Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that he would reverse his decision not to bowl. Miller refused and returned the ball, citing his back. Miller's action generated news headlines, with journalists believing that he had disobeyed Bradman.&lt;ref name=&quot;m73&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p240&quot;/&gt;

As a batsman, Miller was out for four in the first innings, not offering a shot to an [[inswinger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p240&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second innings, Miller's first ball was a [[hat-trick#Cricket|hat-trick ball]] from English captain [[Norman Yardley]]; he survived a loud [[leg before wicket]] appeal and then hit a six into the grandstand, on his way to 74.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia declared at 7/460, 595&amp;nbsp;runs ahead.&lt;ref name=&quot;p241&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f112&gt;Fingleton, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Lord's Test, Miller enjoyed a night out and returned to the team hotel after daybreak the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;p242&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia were due to play [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]] that day. With Australia in the field, Bradman sent Miller to the [[Cricket terminology#F|fine leg]] boundary as a punishment—between overs, he was forced to walk the length of the field. One of the spectators felt sorry for Miller and lent him his bicycle, which Miller used to cycle around the circumference of the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;p242&quot;/&gt;

The efforts of Miller and Lindwall against Hutton had led the English selectors to drop the Yorkshireman for the Third Test. The Australians were surprised by the move and thought that it was a bad move by their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 126–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller had a quiet Third Test at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], taking one wicket and scoring 31 as the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; In a rain-shortened match, Miller again earned the ire of the crowd, after aiming a series of bouncers at Edrich, in apparent retaliation to the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;p243&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 141–145.&lt;/ref&gt; He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman ordered him to stop.&lt;ref name=&quot;p243&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p244&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams moved to [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley Carnegie Cricket Ground|Headingley]] for the Fourth Test at [[Leeds]]. Hutton had been recalled and the home team batted first. England tallied 496 and Miller took 1/43.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 145–151.&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Australia were struggling at 3/68 in reply on the third morning. [[Neil Harvey]], playing his first Ashes Test, joined Miller at the crease.&lt;ref name=&quot;p245&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted [[Jim Laker]]'s first ball over square leg for six. Miller struck consecutive sixes over long off and the [[List of cricket terms#S|sightscreen]] respectively. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative; Harvey joined in and hit consecutive boundaries against Laker. Miller then lifted another six over [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|long off]], and another over [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|long on]] from [[Norman Yardley]]. He was dismissed for 58 attempting another six.&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f162&gt;Fingleton, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f163&gt;Fingleton, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership had yielded 121&amp;nbsp;runs in only 90&amp;nbsp;minutes, and was described by Wisden as a &quot;hurricane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Wisden 1954 – Neil Harvey|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/154608.html| publisher=[[Wisden]]|year=1954|accessdate=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Arlott]] described the innings as the most memorable that he had witnessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;/&gt; He said &quot;Miller played like an emperor ...

He made only 12 but Australia broke the world record to take a 3–0 lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 170–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australians moved onto the next match against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]], where Miller scored a half-century and took 3/31 in an innings victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;/&gt; Against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], Miller took two wickets before striking a hard-hitting 84 with five sixes. He struck one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; In a match against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Ikin]] had reached 99 despite being repeatedly hit. Miller refused to bowl to Ikin, saying that he felt the batsman deserved a century. Lindwall was given the ball and promptly removed Ikin for 99.&lt;ref name=&quot;p249&quot;/&gt;

The teams proceeded to [[The Oval]] for the Fifth Test. After England elected to bat,&lt;ref name=&quot;p249&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller bowled [[John Dewes]] with his second ball and then removed [[Jack Crapp]] without scoring, leaving England at 4/23.&lt;ref name=&quot;f184&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller ended with 2/5 as Lindwall (6/20) cut down the home team for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five.&lt;ref name=&quot;p250&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia led by 337 on the first innings and Miller dismissed Hutton and Crapp to end with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.&lt;ref name=&quot;p251&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller ended the Tests with 184&amp;nbsp;runs at 26.28 and 13&amp;nbsp;wickets at 23.15. He took eight catches.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p251&quot;/&gt;

In a match against the [[History of English amateur cricket#Amateurism in cricket|Gentlemen of England]] at [[Lord's]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p251&quot;/&gt; Miller scored 69 and was dismissed attempting a third consecutive [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hooked]] boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;p252&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia went through the remaining tour matches unbeaten to end the summer without a defeat.&lt;ref name=sched&gt;{{cite web|title=Matches, Australia tour of England, Apr–September 1948 |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/invincibles/engine/series/61329.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the tour, Bradman was full of praise for Miller, though somewhat critical of his aggressive batting: {{quote|One of the most volatile cricketers of any age.

After another victory over Western Australia,&lt;ref name=w198&gt;Whitington, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; he received a request from the Australian Board of Control. At the request of captain Hassett, Miller was asked to tour South Africa as cover for Johnston, who had been injured in a car crash.&lt;ref name=po26/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p266&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h9&gt;Haigh (1997), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w165&gt;Whitington, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller accepted the offer and resigned himself to bowling heavily.&lt;ref name=&quot;p267&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w167&gt;Whitington, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller almost missed the trip after arriving late at the dock in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] after a drunken night.

Miller was given the responsibility of batting in the [[batting order (cricket)|number three]] position when Hassett was afflicted by [[tonsillitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p270&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; In the First Test at [[Johannesburg]], Miller scored 21 and then took 5/40 in South Africa's first innings,&lt;ref name=w172&gt;Whitington, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; only his second match on tour,&lt;ref name=po28&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the home side being forced to follow on and lose by an innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; In the Second Test at [[Cape Town]], he scored 58 and then took 3/54 in the first innings.&lt;ref name=po28/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p271&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; On the third morning, Miller crashed his car and arrived late to the ground, still putting on his trousers as he entered the playing field.

Miller started the 1950–51 season with an unbeaten 201 in a Shield match against Queensland.

England had started the Third Test at Sydney strongly.

Miller took 3/27 on the final day, helping to cut through the middle order as Australia won by 274&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;p300&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po43&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w206&gt;Whitington, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was out for seven and a duck in the Fifth Test at the MCG. He took 4/76 in the first innings, joining Lindwall in cutting down the middle order, despite which England won by eight wickets.&lt;ref name=po44&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller topped the Test batting averages with 350 runs at 43.75,&lt;ref name=po45&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the entire first-class season, he scored 1332&amp;nbsp;runs at 78.35, the highest among all comers.&lt;ref name=&quot;p300&quot;/&gt; His bowling was also strong, with 17&amp;nbsp;wickets at 17.70, second only to [[Jack Iverson]] (21 wickets at 15.23). However, an attack by Morris (182) and Miller (83) in a Shield match dispirited Iverson, and he never played Test cricket again.&lt;ref name=&quot;p301&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po46&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Indies tour Australia===
The 1951–52 Australian season saw the first tour by a [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian team]] in two decades. The Caribbean team had beaten England 3–1 in 1950 and were regarded as the biggest threat to Australia since ''[[Bodyline]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;p303&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The batting was led by the &quot;three Ws&quot;: [[Everton Weekes]], [[Frank Worrell]] and [[Clyde Walcott]]. The English had also been bamboozled by the [[leg spin]] and [[left arm orthodox]] of [[Sonny Ramadhin]] and [[Alf Valentine]], who took 59&amp;nbsp;wickets between them in four Tests against England.&lt;ref name=&quot;p303&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1990), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and Lindwall were charged with attacking the opposition batsmen, testing them with short-pitched bowling.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po51&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The West Indies batted first in the First Test at Brisbane and were dismissed for 216; Miller dismissing their captain [[John Goddard (cricketer)|John Goddard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p306&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w209&gt;Whitington, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller came to the crease at 3/80 and could not pick Ramadhin. He decided to attack the leg spinner without picking him. He missed some, was dropped twice and hit a six before falling for 46 to Valentine. Australia scraped out a 10-run lead.&lt;ref name=po51/&gt;&lt;ref name=w209/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 306–307.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller took another wicket in the second innings but managed only four as Australia stumbled to a three-wicket victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;p307&quot;/&gt; Between Tests, Miller took eight wickets in the match as New South Wales beat the tourists in a tour match.&lt;ref name=po52&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Second Test at Sydney, Miller came to the crease at 3/106 having gone wicketless in the West Indies' first innings of 362.&lt;ref name=&quot;p307&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to pick Ramadhin and finished with 129 in 246 minutes. Miller and Hassett put on 235, an Australian Test record for any wicket against the West Indies.&lt;ref name=w209/&gt;&lt;ref name=po52/&gt; Ramadhin ended with 1/196 and was demoralised.&lt;ref name=w210&gt;Whitington, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second innings, Miller took 3/50 with a heavy barrage of short balls and claimed two catches to help Australia to a seven-wicket victory.&lt;ref name=po52/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 308–309.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' decried Lindwall and Miller's &quot;relentless bumper tactics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p309&quot;/&gt;

Miller had a lean Third Test, taking only one wicket and scoring four and 35,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; as Australia lost by six wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;p309&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Fourth Test at the MCG, the West Indies batted first and Miller removed both openers in the first hour, before returning to end with 5/60 as the tourists were bowled out for 272. He then scored 47 as Australia managed only 216. He took 2/49, but only scored two in Australia's run-chase of 259. The home team won by one wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p310&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Fifth Test, Miller took 5/26 in the first innings with another concentrated display of short-pitched bowling,&lt;ref name=po53&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and then scored 69 in the second innings. He took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia fell short of their target.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Miller ended the series as the leading bowler, with 20&amp;nbsp;wickets at 19.90. He was second in the batting, with 362&amp;nbsp;runs at 40.22.&lt;ref name=&quot;p311&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the series, Miller and Lindwall were repeatedly successful with their concerted bouncer tactics, which were heavily criticised.&lt;ref name=po54&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Test series ended, Miller captained a [[Commonwealth XI cricket team|Commonwealth XI]] that played against a touring England team in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. England had been on a tour of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Miller scored 106 as the Commonwealth compiled 517. Miller took three wickets in the first innings and led his team to a victory by an innings and 259&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captain of New South Wales===

[[File:Sid Barnes, Adelaide Oval 1952.jpg|thumb|upright|Sid Barnes, dressed in suit and tie and carrying a range of toiletry items. This incident was said to be held against Miller when the Australian Board of Control considered Hassett's replacement as Australian captain.]]
At the start of the 1952–53 season, the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]]'s five-man selection panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season.&lt;ref name=po54/&gt; Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 314–315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po57&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 211–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first match as leader, Miller scored 109 against Queensland. Taking 260&amp;nbsp;minutes, it was the slowest century of his career.&lt;ref name=p3156/&gt;&lt;ref name=w215&gt;Whitington, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; In another match against the touring South Africans, Miller elected to field and reduced his opponents to 3/3 and went on to win by five wickets.&lt;ref name=p3156&gt;Perry, pp. 315–316.&lt;/ref&gt; His players respected him, and some began to mimic his cough, voice, gait and idiosyncrasies. [[Richie Benaud]] unbuttoned his shirt in Miller's mould.&lt;ref name=&quot;p316&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w214&gt;Whitington, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; He captained in an unorthodox manner, often trying unusual ploys to unsettle the opposition. He encouraged the opposition to attack in an attempt to get a wicket, and often shuffled his batting order to suit the circumstances of his batsmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;w215&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p317&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon called before authorities after a match against South Australia. Sid Barnes, his [[List of cricket terms#T|12th man]], had come onto the ground with drinks, dressed as a flight attendant. He also brought things such as cigars, mirrors and combs. Barnes' antics extended the break longer than usual. Miller was called before the NSWCA after the [[South Australian Cricket Association]] lodged a complaint, and had to give an assurance that such an incident would not be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 318–319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1990), pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller started the Test series against South Africa poorly. Suffering from a throat infection,&lt;ref name=&quot;p320&quot;/&gt; he scored three in both innings and took 1/46 in an Australian victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;p319&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Second Test at the MCG, Miller performed consistently with bat and ball, taking 4/62 and 3/51 and scoring 52 and 31. In the course of the match, he passed the all-round double of 1000&amp;nbsp;Test runs and 100&amp;nbsp;Test wickets when he dismissed [[John Waite (cricketer)|John Waite]] in the second innings, but this was not enough to prevent defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;p319&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w216&gt;Whitington, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Third Test, Miller scored 55, putting on 168 with Harvey,&lt;ref name=po61&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and took 3/48 and 2/33 in an innings victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p320&quot;/&gt; Australia's fortunes took a turn for the worse in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Miller scored nine and injured his back after two overs with the ball. Lindwall also broke down.&lt;ref name=&quot;p320&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Without their spearheads, Australia were unable to bowl out the South Africans and match was drawn.&lt;ref name=po61/&gt;&lt;ref name=w217&gt;Whitington, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were ruled out of the Fifth Test and the South Africans levelled the series despite conceding 520 runs during the first innings. Australia's bowlers were unable to stop the South African batsmen without their new ball pair.&lt;ref name=po61/&gt;&lt;ref name=w217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 5th Test: Australia v South Africa at Melbourne February&amp;nbsp;6–12, 1953|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62750.html| publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953 Ashes tour===
{{main|Keith Miller with the Australian cricket team in England in 1953}}

Australia proceeded to the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953 Ashes tour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p322&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; During a stopover at [[Naples]], Miller was locked inside after entering a private opera rehearsal without authorisation, but managed to escape and rejoin the boat as it was about to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;p322&quot;/&gt; During his career, several cricket books were published under Miller's name, and he was embroiled in further controversy when one ghost-written tome, which was printed as the team left for England, criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious.&lt;ref name=&quot;p323&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p324&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w219221&gt;Whitington, pp. 219–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden on Miller and Lindwall increased when Johnston broke down in an early tour game.&lt;ref name=&quot;p256&quot; /&gt; Miller was wicketless against Worcestershire, but succeeded with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 220 in just over six hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;p327&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w221&gt;Whitington, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored 159&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;out against Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;p327&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w222&gt;Whitington, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Miller had scored 421&amp;nbsp;runs in the week of May, and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000&amp;nbsp;runs in one month, something that had been done on a tour only by Bradman.&lt;ref name=w222/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p328&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's love of [[Thoroughbred horse race|horseracing]] then interfered with his quest. Wanting to attend an afternoon race meeting, he opened the batting in the morning against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. Not intending to play a long innings, he attacked the bowling and was out for 20, before heading for the track.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 328–329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w220&gt;Whitington, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed at the track until late afternoon, and returned to find the Australians walking out to field.&lt;ref name=&quot;a119&quot;/&gt; This was followed by a match against the MCC at Lord's where he took four wickets of English Test players.&lt;ref name=w222/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p329&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller then took match figures of 5/27 against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p329&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p330&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w223&gt;Whitington, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In the match against Essex, Miller pulled rib muscles, meaning he could not bowl in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He scored 55 and five in a rain-affected draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, pp. 331–332&quot;&gt;Perry, pp. 331–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia travelled to [[Bramall Lane]] under the captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested and stayed in London with the team manager. After the first day's play, he organised a party for that lasted until the next afternoon—the rest day. He woke up with a hangover the next day just minutes before the start of play. Improvising, Miller arrived at the ground in a [[hearse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p332&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was Australia's turn to bat, Miller was the last man to be dismissed, having scored 86 despite his hangover.&lt;ref name=&quot;p333&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Test series moved to Lord's. Miller resumed bowling, sending down 42&amp;nbsp;overs and taking a total of 1/74. He managed 25 in the first innings, but promoted to number three in the second innings, he batted patiently to reach stumps before reaching his first Test century on English soil the following morning,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p334&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; but England held on for a draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;p335&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of the Third Test at Old Trafford was washed out, resulting in another draw. Miller took 1/38 bowling fast off breaks and scored 17 and six.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p335&quot; /&gt; Australia then played Middlesex at Lord's, where Miller scored a hard-hitting 71.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 335–336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia elected to field on a wet wicket in the Fourth Test at Headingley. Miller dismissed Edrich and Graveney and ended with 2/39 from 38&amp;nbsp;overs as England were bowled out for 167.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leeds56&quot;&gt;Perry, pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt; Miller made only five in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall launched a short-pitched barrage and dismissed Watson and Simpson in consecutive balls. England were 5/177 a stumps on day four, leading by 78.&lt;ref name=&quot;p337&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w224&gt;Whitington, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The pacemen were booed from the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;p338&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w225&gt;Whitington, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Miller dismissed Evans early, before [[Trevor Bailey]] began his resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, pp. 331–332&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p338&quot;/&gt; Frustrated by Bailey's defensive style and time-wasting, Miller lost his cool and aimed a [[Beamer (cricket)|beamer]] straight at Bailey's head, further angering the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;p338&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller ended with 4/63 from a long spell of 47&amp;nbsp;overs.&lt;ref name=&quot;p339&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; England held on for another draw after more time-wasting by Bailey. The teams headed for the Fifth Test at The Oval tied 0–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;p340&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's last Test performance was his least productive; he scored one and a duck and took a total of 2/89. England won the match and regained the Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p341&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's returns were below his career standards, with 223&amp;nbsp;runs at 24.77 and 10&amp;nbsp;wickets at 30.30. He took two catches.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p342&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller scored 67 against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's and then played against the Combined Services at [[Sabina Park|Kingston]]. He reached his century before lunch and then proceeded to 262&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;out with 24&amp;nbsp;boundaries. This included a 377-run fourth-wicket stand by [[Jim de Courcy]] in only 205 minutes, in particular targeting [[Fred Trueman]]'s bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;p343&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 228–229.&lt;/ref&gt; He then took 3/17 with the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;p344&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the English summer with 1,433&amp;nbsp;runs at 51.17, the second highest average behind Harvey among batsmen with over 200&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;p344&quot;/&gt; He was the only Australian to hit two double centuries and also took 45&amp;nbsp;wickets at 22.51.&lt;ref name=&quot;p344&quot;/&gt; For his efforts that summer, ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' named him one of its [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Five Cricketers of the Year]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WCOTY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154607.html|title=Cricketer of the year – 1954: Keith Miller|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |publisher=[[Wisden]] |year=1954|accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overlooked for Test captaincy===

Miller was the state captain, but Morris was the vice-captain of the Test team ahead of Miller.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 347–348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team, but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett, who accused him of not trying. Hassett told Johnson that he could become Test captain if he regained his form and his Test position.&lt;ref name=&quot;p346&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po80&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As the outgoing captain, Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor. Miller had also criticised Hassett in his book,&lt;ref name=&quot;p346&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; and there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller's departure from South Melbourne and Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;a119&quot;/&gt; Johnson returned to form with 45&amp;nbsp;wickets at 22.75 for the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;p349&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po81&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November, the Australian Board of Control selected Johnson as captain, with Morris as his deputy.&lt;ref name=&quot;p352&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po83/&gt; Miller's irreverent nature was cited as a possible reason for the board's selection.

He ended up bowling for the entire first session of play and had 3/5 at lunch from nine overs, before finishing at 3/14. England were bowled out for 191.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p355&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po85&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller struggled with the bat, scoring six and seven as [[Frank Tyson]]'s pace saw England inflict a second successive defeat on Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 250–252.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia needed to win the Fourth Test in Adelaide to keep the series alive. Miller scored 44 and 14 as Australia were bowled out in the second innings to leave England with 94 for victory. Miller made a late burst, removing Edrich, Hutton and [[Colin Cowdrey]] in consecutive overs to leave England at 3/18.&lt;ref name=&quot;p358&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; He then took a difficult catch from Johnston to dismiss [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]].&lt;ref name=m67&gt;Mallett, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; England were then 4/49 but hung on to win by five wickets and secure the Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p359&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po87&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that Australia had lost three consecutive Tests since the ''Bodyline'' series of 1932–33.&lt;ref name=&quot;auslist&quot;/&gt; Miller made 19 and 28 in the rain-affected draw in the Fifth Test. He ended the series with 167&amp;nbsp;runs at 23.86, his lowest ever at international level,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p360&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; and took 10&amp;nbsp;wickets at 24.30.&lt;ref name=&quot;p361&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had more success as domestic level. New South Wales beat Victoria in two days at the SCG to win the Sheffield Shield; Miller taking five wickets in the second innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p357&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; He also led his state in a 45-run win over the tourists, their only defeat apart from the First Test.&lt;ref name=po87/&gt; The match was marked by a quickfire 71 in 57 minutes and his team's attacking strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 359–360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w254&quot;/&gt;

===West Indies tour===

After leading his state to another Sheffield Shield title and a win over England,&lt;ref name=w254&gt;Whitington, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller replaced Morris as the vice-captain for the tour of the [[West Indies]] that started in early 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;p357&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po89&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years, having lost two consecutive series to England.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p363&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia batted first in the opening Test at [[Sabina Park]] in [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p364&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller came to the wicket at 2/137 and put on a 224-run partnership with Harvey. Both ended with centuries and Miller scored his highest Test score of 147, striking 15&amp;nbsp;fours.&lt;ref name=po93&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w2623&gt;Whitington, pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt; When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100&amp;nbsp;runs, he respectively shook their hands.&lt;ref name=w2623/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p365&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia finished at 9/515. Johnson had been injured when hit in the foot by a [[yorker]] so Miller was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short.&lt;ref name=w2623/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p365&quot;/&gt; Miller attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities. He took the new ball at 5/239 and the hosts collapsed to be all out for 259.&lt;ref name=&quot;p366&quot;/&gt; Miller had taken 2/36,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; and enforced the [[follow-on]], which was questioned as paceman [[Ron Archer]] had broken down. With Australia two bowlers short, the West Indies moved to 1/114. When Weekes arrived at the crease, Miller unsettled him with delaying tactics, and he was out for one.&lt;ref name=&quot;p366&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; He then placed two [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|silly points]] and two silly mid-ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott, who fell to Lindwall soon after. Miller then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs. The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=w2645&gt;Whitington, pp. 264–265.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller had taken 3/62 in the second innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;

Johnson resumed the leadership on the field in the Second Test at [[Queen's Park Oval]] in [[Trinidad]]. The match was a high-scoring draw, but Miller scored only three and took match figures of 1/148.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 368–369.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Third Test at [[Georgetown, Guyana]], Miller removed both openers in the first innings and then scored 33 as Australia by eight wickets. He took 3/51 for the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p370&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Fourth Test at [[Bridgetown, Barbados]], Miller came to the wicket with Australia at 3/226 on the first day. The tourists lost two more wickets to be 5/233. Miller and Archer launched a counter-attacking partnership of 206. Miller reached 137 and then walked after edging a ball, even though none of the opposition had appealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;p371&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia reached 668 and the West Indies were struggling at 6/147, with Miller having dismissed Weekes and [[Collie Smith]] in the same over.&lt;ref name=&quot;cap196&quot;&gt;Perry, pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Miller was bowling at medium pace, but Johnson felt that the new batsmen [[Denis Atkinson]] and [[Clairmonte Depeiaza]] were vulnerable to express pace. Johnson ordered Miller to bowl fast, but was turned down. Johnson replaced Miller with Lindwall, who was tired and was hit around the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;cap196&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=po94&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair seized the initiative and compiled a world Test record of 347 for the seventh wicket and the Australians were tired after failing to break the partnership.&lt;ref name=po94/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 371–372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w276&gt;Whitington, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller attacked Johnson in front of the other players, saying &quot;You couldn't captain a bunch of bloody schoolboys!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p372&quot;/&gt; Johnson then offered to resolve the dispute &quot;out the back&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;p372&quot;/&gt; implying a fisticuffs.&lt;ref name=po94/&gt;&lt;ref name=w276/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p372&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller declined the offer and stopped.&lt;ref name=po94/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p372&quot;/&gt; The match resumed the next day and the West Indies were eventually bowled out 158 behind. Miller had been punished by the batsmen, taking 2/113 from 22&amp;nbsp;overs.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Miller scored 10 and took 1/66 in the second innings as the match ended in a high-scoring draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;p373&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller then took 6/107 in the first innings of the Fifth Test in Jamaica. He removed [[John Holt (cricketer)|John Holt]], Walcott and Smith, before taking three tail-end wickets as the home team were bowled out for 357. When Australia batted, Miller arrived at the crease to join Harvey with the score at 3/302. He added his third century of the series and ended with 109 as Australia reached 8/758. He took 2/58 in the second innings as Australia completed a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 373–374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po95&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Miller's most statistically successful series, with 439&amp;nbsp;runs at 73.17 and the 20&amp;nbsp;wickets at 32.05 made him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p374&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w277&gt;Whitington, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final domestic season===
Miller started the 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic,&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane. On the final day, Miller set the hosts 275 for victory in three hours. He lengthened the innings break by seven minutes, by remonstrating with officials to pause the match for the running of the [[Melbourne Cup]]. They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 minutes for the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;p376&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.&lt;ref name=&quot;p377&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next match was against South Australia in Sydney. New South Wales had declared at 8/215 and the visitors were 0/2 at stumps on the first day. Miller's wife gave birth to their fourth child, and Miller was drinking into the next morning. He then arrived at the SCG, having forgotten to pick up team-mate [[Peter Philpott]] as arranged, so he had to rush back and the pair arrived late for the day's play.&lt;ref name=&quot;a119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p377&quot;/&gt; Miller was still in a tuxedo as play was about to start.&lt;ref name=&quot;m65&quot;/&gt; Miller completed the unfinished over from the previous night and felt that the pitch did not offer any assistance. He then told [[Alan Davidson (cricketer, born 1929)|Alan Davidson]] to bowl the next over from his end. However, as Davidson was about to bowl, Miller changed his mind and took over.&lt;ref name=&quot;p377&quot;/&gt; Miller bowled [[Les Favell]] in the over. He kept on bowling and finished with 7/12 from 7.3 overs, clean bowling five of his victims. The visitors had been levelled for 27,&lt;ref name=&quot;a119&quot;&gt;Armstrong, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; the lowest score in the history of the Sheffield Shield.&lt;ref name=p97/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p378&quot;/&gt; Miller then asked South Australia to follow-on,&lt;ref name=m66&gt;Mallett, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; but showed little interest in bowling again, delivering only six overs despite the bowler-friendly conditions. Philpott said that &quot;this was typical Miller. He was never an accumulator of records, not particularly concerned with figures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p378&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident, Miller had been making a speech at a civic reception for the New South Wales team in the town of [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]]. In front of the mayor at the town hall, he praised the hospitality,&lt;ref name=&quot;p380&quot;/&gt; before turning around to his players and asking what the name of the town was.&lt;ref name=&quot;p380&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m70&gt;Mallett, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po78&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller then turned up late to a coaching clinic the next day and instead of teaching, he made a speech, advising the children to play tennis as there was more money on offer.&lt;ref name=m70/&gt;

In January 1956, Miller injured his back in a match against Queensland.&lt;ref name=po97/&gt; He suffered spasms that forced him to miss the rest of the season. He had scored 403&amp;nbsp;runs at 80.60 and taken 19&amp;nbsp;wickets at 14.94.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 382–383.&lt;/ref&gt; New South Wales again won the Sheffield Shield.&lt;ref name=po97&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/260057.html|accessdate=30 November 2007|title=A history of the Sheffield Shield|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|first=Martin|last=Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Ashes tour===
{{main|Keith Miller with the Australian cricket team in England in 1956}}
[[File:Keith Miller.JPG|thumb|upright|Miller preparing to play a drive]]
Miller was selected for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956 Ashes tour]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p384&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p385&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; but could not bowl for a month because of a back injury from the first match.&lt;ref name=&quot;p386&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller captained the Australians against Leicester. Coming in at 3/175, Miller made his highest first-class score of 281 not out, striking 35&amp;nbsp;fours in six and a half hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;p386&quot;/&gt; A tougher fight awaited against Surrey at The Oval, who had England's Test spin combination of Laker and [[Tony Lock]]. Miller came in at 3/124 and struggled, scoring 18&amp;nbsp;runs in his first 120&amp;nbsp;minutes, his slowest two hours of scoring in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;p387&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; As his partners continued to fall Miller ended unbeaten on 57 as Australia were bowled out for 259; Laker taking all ten wickets. Australia lost by ten wickets, its first loss to a county since 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;p387&quot;/&gt; As a result, sections of the Australian media began campaigning for Miller to replace Johnson as captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;p388&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w284&gt;Whitington, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was shouldering most of the bowling load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He struggled with the bat, making a duck and four.&lt;ref name=&quot;p389&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; The teams headed to Lord's where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and [[Ken Mackay]] were called in to make their debut and support Miller with the pace duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;p393&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia batted first and Miller managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating the burden on Miller. Miller had [[Peter Richardson (cricketer)|Peter Richardson]] and then bowled [[Tom Graveney]] with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] received an [[inswinger]] from Miller first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged.&lt;ref name=&quot;p394&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Miller beat May four times and then had Watson caught in the gully in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller's 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p394&quot;/&gt; Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when Miller came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. Miller removed Graveney at the start of the run chase.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 395–396.&lt;/ref&gt; Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled [[Johnny Wardle]] and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185&amp;nbsp;runs and Miller had bowled 70.1&amp;nbsp;overs for the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p397&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley.&lt;ref name=w286&gt;Whitington, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England's 325,&lt;ref name=&quot;p401&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; and Miller top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on.&lt;ref name=&quot;p402&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads.&lt;ref name=w288&gt;Whitington, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second innings, Miller fell for 26 to Laker. Australia lost by an innings,&lt;ref name=&quot;p403&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time in a Test in 18&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;auslist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype|title=Statsguru – Australia – Tests – Results list|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian press attacked the team, and called for changes,&lt;ref name=&quot;p404&quot;/&gt; including the omission of the captain, Johnson.&lt;ref name=&quot;p404&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes&quot;&gt;Smith (1999), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, Miller and [[Gil Langley]] were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;p404&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;&gt;Miller (1956), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 1956 [[New Year Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40670|supp=yes|startpage=41|date=30 December 1955|accessdate=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.&lt;ref name=&quot;p404&quot;/&gt;

The curator at Old Trafford had been ordered to prepare a dusty, spinning pitch for the Fourth Test.&lt;ref&gt;Whitington, pp. 290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; A win for England would see them retain the Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p406&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller bowled 21 wicketless overs as England amassed 459. Miller was out for six and a duck and fell twice to Laker, who took a world record 19&amp;nbsp;wickets as Australia lost by an innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p408&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' reported that the Australians were said &quot;to be extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvA4thT56Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1957|url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152629.html|title = Fourth Test Match: England v Australia 1956|work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack – online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate =7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller then took 5/84 against Surrey, before leading the team against Warwickshire. He had received death threats in the lead-up to the game, ordering him to lose. He scored 46 not out and took 2/13 as Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p409&quot;/&gt; He then took 5/29 in the second innings against Lancashire and made 50 and took match figures of 5/78 against Essex.&lt;ref name=&quot;p409&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the Fifth Test at The Oval, Miller announced that the tour would be his last, so that he would retire from cricket after the tour of the [[Indian subcontinent]] on the return voyage. In his final Test on English soil, he took 4/91 in the first innings. Miller came in to bat at 5/47 and helped Australia recover to 202, top-scoring with 61.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt; He took another one wicket in the second innings and was unbeaten on seven when stumps were drawn in the second innings. The series ended 1–2.&lt;ref name=&quot;p411&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the series with 199&amp;nbsp;runs at 28.43 and topped the bowling with 21&amp;nbsp;wickets at 22.23.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p413&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; He topped the first-class bowling for the Australians with 50&amp;nbsp;wickets at 19.60.&lt;ref name=&quot;p414&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia played [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] at [[Karachi]] in the first Test between the two countries on a [[cricket pitch|matting pitch]], rather than the more familiar grass pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;PvA1956wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1957|url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152645.html|title = Test Match: The unplayable Mahmood|work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack – online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate =9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller top-scored in the first innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80.&lt;ref name=&quot;p414&quot; /&gt; He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;p415&quot;/&gt; It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to the point that he could not play in the three Tests against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;p415&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and personality==
[[File:Miller cut.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Miller playing a cut shot]]
Miller combined classy strokeplay with big hitting, his front foot play especially devastating. He had a rifle like straight drive, played pull and sweep shots with a minimum of effort and was able to cut elegantly. He combined this elegance with unorthodoxy, hitting two [[Boundary (cricket)|sixes]] over square leg with a backhand tennis shot and once beginning the day's play in a Test match with a six.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt; One straight [[six (cricket)|six]] that he hit at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] was still rising when it hit the first deck of the M.A. Noble Stand.&lt;ref name=&quot;a115&quot;/&gt; Len Hutton said he was &quot;the most unpredictable cricketer I have played against&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;

As a bowler, Miller had a classically high arm action, moving the ball sharply either way and able to make the ball rise from a good length. His action caused opposition batsmen to perceive that his deliveries were gaining pace after pitching.&lt;ref name=&quot;a115&quot;/&gt; He was often able to generate more pace than his new ball partner, Lindwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt; He was always willing to try something new if the batsman were set, varying his approach from fifteen paces to five and vice versa. A round arm delivery often managed to capture a wicket, surprising the batsman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt; Compton said that Miller &quot;often had no preconceived idea what he intended to bowl even as he turned to start his run&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;a115&quot; /&gt; Miller often mixed slow [[leg break]]s when he was bowling off a run. He once bowled English opening batsman [[David Sheppard]] with a [[googly]] during a Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;a115&quot;/&gt; Hutton opined that Miller was the bowler who was least concerned with the position of his bowling mark, and said that he &quot;never felt physically safe against him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;a115&quot;/&gt; His use of [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]] at [[Trent Bridge]] during the 1948 tour was seen as excessive by the English crowd, who booed him. Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided. He was often required to bowl through pain, pressing a disk into place at the base of his spine before sending down the next delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ray Lindwall, late 1940s.jpg|thumb|upright|Ray Lindwall, Miller's good friend and bowling partner]]
Miller and Lindwall formed an opening partnership that was regarded as one of the greatest of all time.&lt;ref name=m72&gt;Mallett, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton said that the pair was the most hostile that he faced during his career. [[Alan Davidson (cricketer, born 1929)|Alan Davidson]], a bowling all rounder who supported Lindwall and Miller for New South Wales and Australia, said that &quot;Ray Lindwall was the best bowler I ever saw of any type; his control was just perfect. At the other end you had Miller, who was unpredictable...It really was a perfect team.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;a115&quot;/&gt; He was an acrobatic slips fielder, who would take freakish catches with nonchalant ease, often immediately returning to his discussion with those around him as if nothing was unusual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt;

Miller often required a contest to retain interest in the game. He deplored Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and sometimes refused to try when Australia was in an unassailable position. At [[Southend]] in 1948, as the Australians scored a world record 721 runs in a single day against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], Miller, coming in to bat when the score was 2/364, allowed himself to be bowled first ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt; Indeed, he &quot;turned to the wicketkeeper and said: &quot;Thank God that's over&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt; His teammate [[Sid Barnes]] said that if Miller &quot;had the same outlook as Bradman or Ponsford he would have made colossal scores&quot; and become &quot;the statisticians' greatest customer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;a117&quot;&gt;Armstrong, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller never captained Australia in a Test, as his attitude to the game tended to alarm the authorities. About Miller, [[Ashley Mallett]] wrote, &quot;He loved tradition, but hated convention. His unstructured way of playing and living would be anathema to cricketers now... He played as he fought the war, by impulse and mood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt; He sometimes set his field by saying to his players: &quot;scatter&quot;.&lt;ref name=po80/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m66&quot; /&gt; On another occasion, he is reported turned to his players, after being told that NSW was taking the field with one player too many, and asked for one player to volunteer to &quot;piss off&quot;.&lt;ref name=po80/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m66&quot;/&gt;

A larger than life character, Miller is the subject of many stories, often [[apocryphal]]. One story had Don Bradman answering a knock on the door late one night to see Miller dressed in a dinner suit. Miller advised Bradman that, as demanded, he was in bed at curfew and was now going out.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt; His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick&quot;.&lt;ref name=Selvey/&gt; As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator, his influence grew; this &quot;...&amp;nbsp;almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Selvey&quot;/&gt;

One night, following a duel with [[Messerschmitt]]s in his [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], he made an unauthorised detour over [[Bonn]] because it was [[Beethoven]]'s birthplace and he was a lover of the classics.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt; Despite his fame, Miller remained a humble man; when asked his favourite cricketing memory, he would recall no incident concerning himself, but &quot;a South Australian team-mate walking onto Lord's to a thunderous ovation a few weeks after his release from a POW camp&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt; The cricket broadcaster, [[John Arlott]] said &quot;that for all the glamour that attached to Miller, he was staunch and unaffected as a friend&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;

When asked how he managed to take seven wickets for just 12 runs against South Australia, Miller replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's three reasons, First, I bowled bloody well. Second, I, errr ... second ...&quot; [pause]. &quot;You can forget about the other two reasons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh2&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Later life==
[[File:Miller family.JPG|thumb|Miller and his first wife and sons, pictured in the 1950s]]
After retirement, Miller remained in the public eye, augmented by persistent &quot;unsubstantiated rumours of an affair with [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt; He made a living as a journalist and columnist, employed by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' as a &quot;special cricket writer&quot; for twenty years.&lt;ref name=Selvey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 426–430.&lt;/ref&gt; As during his career, Miller was a proponent of attacking and bright play. He praised the aggressive leadership of his protege [[Richie Benaud]] but criticised the style of play pursued by Australia under Benaud's successors [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] and [[Bill Lawry]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 434, 439.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, when Australia was struggling, Miller called for the removal of [[Allan Border]], an obdurate and defensive batsman, from the captaincy.&lt;ref name=p461&gt;Perry, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;

He later worked for [[Football pools|Vernons Pools]], owned by the millionaire horseracing entrepreneur, [[Robert Sangster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Selvey&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Miller &quot;was happiest at the cricket or at the races&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt; He also worked as the head of a lobby group in promoting [[Australian rules football]] in his adopted New South Wales in the 1980s. At the time, the VFL was the dominant league and there were no top-flight teams in his adopted state or [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 461–462.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's later life was plagued by ill health. In November 1991, he was hospitalised with a stroke, and soon after fell over and broke his hip, necessitating two further operations. He had [[skin cancer]], caused by his insistence on always displaying his mop of hair and not wearing a hat. He accepted these vicissitudes equably. &quot;Some grieved to see him reduced, but not him; these were life's deliveries. He knew only that one would get him out eventually.&quot; He had an earlobe removed. The cancer also attacked his legs, and coupled with his hip injury, severely curtailed his mobility, forcing him to use walking frames and wheelchairs.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=p468&gt;Perry, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Asked at 75 about death, he said: &quot;Never think about it. No regrets. I've had a hell of a good life. Been damned lucky.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;

Despite his illnesses, he continued to travel to England in the 1990s to watch cricket and meet up with Compton, Edrich and other war and cricket colleagues on an annual basis, although he became increasingly isolated as he outlasted his friends, both English and Australian.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 464–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2002, Miller divorced his wife Peg,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had four sons. He did so to marry his long-term mistress Marie Challman, with whom he had been living since 1999. Challman was a hospital receptionist and Miller reasoned that he would receive more effective medical treatment by moving to Melbourne to live with her, as his specialist doctors also lived there.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 477–480.&lt;/ref&gt; He had other long-term mistresses, including an Australian beauty queen with whom he was photographed in public.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 391–398.&lt;/ref&gt; During his later years, his illness contributed to what his family felt was a deteriorating attitude and he fell out with his sons, but they were reconciled shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 476–482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller died in October 2004 after being in persistent poor health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt; He was given a state funeral by the [[Government of Victoria]], which saw hundreds of mourners stand outside the packed cathedral, and was broadcast across the nation on [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 484–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and statistical analysis==
&lt;!-- this should not be listy --&gt;
[[File:Klarfeld Australian Cricketer Keith Miller.jpg|thumb|upright|Life-size bronze statue of Miller outside Melbourne High School, sculpted by [[Linda Klarfeld]]]]
Miller's achievements were recognised by a host of awards during his lifetime and posthumously. Miller was one of the ten inaugural inductees into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was named in the [[Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century]] as its vice-captain.&lt;ref name=p478&gt;Perry, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, Miller was inducted into the [[ICC Cricket Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesportscampus.com/201001043276/news-bytes/icc-hall-of-fame-inductees-jan2010 |title=Lindwall, Miller, O'Reilly, Trumper and Waugh – Australian legends inducted into ICC Cricket Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also one of only four Australian cricketers, (the others being Bradman, [[Victor Trumper]] and [[Shane Warne]]) to be honoured with a portrait in the Long Room at [[Lord's]] in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Selvey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The following sources are, respectively, a Miller obituary from 2004, which lists Trumper and Bradman and a further piece from 2005, when Warne's portrait was added. [[Mike Atherton]], the author of the second piece, curiously overlooks Trumper's portrait; other articles of the same period do similarly.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/2360948/Warne-still-the-incomparable-master-of-spin-bowler%27s-craft.html |title=Warne: still the incomparable master of spin bowler's craft |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Michael |last=Atherton |authorlink=Michael Atherton |date=11 June 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller is one of only three men (the others being [[Vinoo Mankad|M.H. &quot;Vinoo&quot; Mankad]] and [[Garfield Sobers|G.StA. &quot;Garry&quot; Sobers]]) to have his name on both the batting and bowling honours boards in the visitors' dressing-room there, for scoring both a century and for taking five wickets in a test at the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt;

Miller's abilities as an all-rounder led to enormous success as both batsman and bowler. The [[ICC player rankings]] have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Miller achieved top ten rankings with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he peaked at ninth in the world in 1952, and was a top-20 player from shortly after his début and for the rest of the duration of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.lgiccrankings.com/test/batting/player-display.php?id=725&amp;graph=ranking
|title = Keith Miller Batting Test Ranking Statistics
|publisher = LG ICC Rankings
|accessdate =2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's bowling abilities led to even greater success. By the end of 1946, he was already ranked sixth in the world and thereafter never slipped lower than ninth; for much of his career, he was the second-best bowler in the world according to the ratings, remarkably, for a 36-year-old, peaking at the number 1 slot for a few months in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Keith Miller Bowling Test Ranking Statistics
|publisher = LG ICC Rankings
|accessdate =2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an all-rounder, therefore, it is unsurprising to find that he was peerless for most of his career, ranked as number one in the world for most of his career, including an unbroken eight-year run from June 1948 until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Miller's statistics are an inexact measure of his worth to the side. Many of the Australia teams he played in featured very strong batting line-ups, restricting his opportunities as a middle-order player.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 183–186, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; His verve and enthusiasm were also important contributors to Australian success, as was his ability to produce the unexpected (particularly with the ball) and help break partnerships.&lt;ref name=&quot;m65&quot; /&gt; It is for this reason that he is remembered for his personality and his one-off feats, more than statistical accomplishment; in [[Ian Chappell]]'s words &quot;People who saw it still talk of Keith Miller's [[Six (cricket)|monster shot]] that hit the Members Stand clock at the SCG in the 1950s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chappell|first1=Ian|title=The sixes don't add up|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/399274.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
