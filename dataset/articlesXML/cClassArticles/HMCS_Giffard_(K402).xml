'''HMCS ''Giffard''''' was a modified {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} that served with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. She served primarily as a convoy escort in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. She was originally laid down by the [[Royal Navy]] as the '''HMS ''Buddleia''''' but was never commissioned into the RN, being transferred to the RCN before completion.&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910–1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages=104 |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is named for [[Beauport, Quebec City|Giffard, Quebec]], which at the time was a small village, but was eventually amalgamated into first, Beauport Quebec and then finally, [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref name=posterity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forposterityssake.ca/Navy/HMCS_GIFFARD_K402.htm |work=For Posterity's Sake Canadian Genealogy |title=HMCS GIFFARD K402 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Flower-class corvette}}
Flower-class corvettes like ''Giffard'' serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ossian |first=Robert |url=http://www.thepirateking.com/ships/ship_types.htm |title=Complete List of Sailing Vessels |website=The Pirate King |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Fitzsimons |editor-first=Bernard |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons &amp; Warfare |location=London |publisher=Phoebus |date=1978 |volume=11 |pages=1137–1142 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jane&gt;{{cite book |title=Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II |location=New Jersey |publisher=Random House |date=1996 |isbn=0-517-67963-9 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;corvette&quot; designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Nicholas |last2=Lawrence |first2=Richard |title=The Illustrated Companion to Nelson's Navy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I59v6rkg8egC&amp;pg=PA39 |publisher=Stackpole Books |date=2005 |pages=39–63 |isbn=0-8117-3275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, [[Winston Churchill]] reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a [[whaling ship]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesneau |first=Roger |last2=Gardiner |first2=Robert |title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships (1922–1946) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJBMBvyQ83EC&amp;pg=PA62 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date=June 1980 |page=62 |isbn=0-87021-913-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generic name &quot;flower&quot; was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;{{cite book |title=North Atlantic Run |last=Milner |first=Marc |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1985 |pages=117–119, 142–145, 158, 175–176, 226, 235, 285–291 |isbn=0-87021-450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral [[Percy W. Nelles]]. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Milner |first2=Marc |year=1993 |title=Corvettes of the Royal Canadian Navy 1939–1945|publisher=Vanwell Publishing |location=St. Catharines |pages=|isbn=1-55125-052-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
''Buddleia'' was ordered 2 February 1942 as part of the Royal Navy 1942–43 Increased Endurance Flower-class building program. She was laid down 30 November 1942 by [[Alexander Hall and Sons|Alexander Hall &amp; Co. Ltd.]] at [[Aberdeen|Aberdeen, Scotland]] and launched 19 June 1943.&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web |url = http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/782.html | work = Uboat.net | title = HMCS ''Giffard''  (K 402) | accessdate = 5 October 2013|ref=Uboat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of an exchange for {{sclass-|Algerine|minesweeper|1}}s that the RCN intended to use as convoy escorts, the Royal Navy transferred four Flower-class corvettes and twelve {{sclass2-|Castle|corvette|1}}s to Canada in order to acquire them. ''Buddleia'' was transferred on 10 November 1943 and commissioned as HMCS ''Giffard'' into the RCN at Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; The only significant differences between the RCN and RN 1942–43 Flower classes was a shortened mainmast and varying anti-aircraft armament.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt;

During her career, ''Giffard'' underwent one major refit. This took place at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]] which began in December 1944 was completed in March 1945.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Service history==
After working up at [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]], ''Giffard'' joined the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. She was assigned to escort group C-1 and escorted her first convoy in February 1944. In May 1944 she rescued 43 survivors of {{HMCS|Valleyfield|K329|6}} after the frigate had been torpedoed sunk about 50 miles south of [[Cape Race|Cape Race, Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; She remained an ocean escort until 27 November 1944 when she departed for refit. After completing the refit and working up in [[Bermuda]], ''Giffard'' was employed locally beginning April 1945 around [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] until her departure with convoy [[HX convoys|HX 335]] in mid-May. She returned to Canada for the final time in June 1945.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

''Giffard'' was [[paid off]] 5 July 1945 at [[Sorel, Quebec]]. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and sold for scrapping. She was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in October 1952 at [[Hamilton, Ontario]] by Steel Co of Canada.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colledge&gt;{{Colledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=6115262|shipname=Giffard|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
