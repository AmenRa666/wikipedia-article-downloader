The '''Boston campaign''' was the opening [[military campaign|campaign]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]], taking place primarily in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. The campaign began with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775, in which the local colonial militias interdicted a British government attempt to seize military stores and leaders in [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. The entire British expedition suffered significant casualties during a running battle back to [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] against an ever-growing number of militia.

Subsequently, accumulated militia forces surrounded the city of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], beginning the [[Siege of Boston]].  The main action during the siege, the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] on June 17, 1775, was one of the bloodiest encounters of the war, and resulted in a Pyrrhic British victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks237&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also numerous skirmishes near Boston and the coastal areas of Boston, resulting in loss of life, military supplies, or both.

In July 1775, [[George Washington]] took command of the assembled militia and transformed them into a more coherent army.  On March 4, 1776, the colonial army [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|fortified Dorchester Heights]] with cannon capable of reaching Boston and British ships in the harbor. The siege (and the campaign) ended on March 17, 1776, with the permanent withdrawal of British forces from Boston. To this day, Boston celebrates March 17 as [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]].

==Background==

In 1767, the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] passed the [[Townshend Acts]], which imposed import duties on paper, glass, paint, and other common items imported into the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].  The [[Sons of Liberty]] and other [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] organizations responded with a variety of protest actions.  They organized boycotts of the goods subject to the duty, and they harassed and threatened the customs personnel who collected the duties, many of whom were either corrupt or related to Provincial leaders.  [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]], then [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], requested military forces to protect the King's personnel.  In October 1768, British troops arrived in the city of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Military occupation|occupied]] the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer22&quot;&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (1994)]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Tensions led to the [[Boston Massacre]] on March 5, 1770, and the [[Boston Tea Party]] on December 16, 1773.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer23&quot;&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (1994)]], pp. 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Tea Party and other protests, Parliament enacted the [[Intolerable Acts]] to punish the colonies.  With the [[Massachusetts Government Act]] of 1774 it effectively abolished the provincial government of Massachusetts. [[General]] [[Thomas Gage]], already the [[commander-in-chief]] of British troops in North America, was also appointed governor of Massachusetts and was instructed by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George's]] government to enforce royal authority in the troublesome colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer38&quot;&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (1994)]] pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; However, popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in Boston. Gage commanded four [[regiment]]s of British regulars (about 4,000 men) from his headquarters in Boston,&lt;ref name=&quot;French161&quot;&gt;[[#French|French (1911)]], p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; but the countryside was largely controlled by Patriot sympathizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Countryside&quot;&gt;See e.g. [[#Cushing|Cushing (1896)]], p. 58, where Gage describes Crown appointees being harassed out of several towns.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War begins==
[[File:North Bridge Fight Detail.jpg|thumb|left|A 1775 [[Amos Doolittle]] engraving depicting a bit of the action at the [[Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts|North Bridge]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]]]
{{main|Powder Alarm|Battles of Lexington and Concord}}

On September 1, 1774, British soldiers removed [[gunpowder]] and other military supplies in a surprise raid on a powder magazine near Boston. This expedition alarmed the countryside, and thousands of American Patriots sprang into action, amid rumors that war was at hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks16&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; Although it proved to be a false alarm, this event&amp;mdash;known as the [[Powder Alarm]]&amp;mdash;caused all concerned to proceed more carefully in the days ahead, and essentially provided a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for events seven months later. Partly in response to this action, the colonists carried off military supplies from several forts in New England and distributed them among the local militias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer52&quot;&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (1994)]] pp. 52–64&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize [[munition]]s stored by the colonial militia at [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]. Several riders — including [[Paul Revere]] — alerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] on the morning of April 19, they found 77 [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen]] formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord.  At Concord, the troops searched for military supplies, but found relatively little, as the colonists, having received warnings that such an expedition might happen, had taken steps to hide many of the supplies.  During the search, there was a confrontation at the [[Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts|North Bridge]].  A small company of British troops fired on a much larger column of colonial militia, which returned fire, and eventually [[rout]]ed those troops, which returned to the village center and rejoined the other troops there.  By the time the &quot;[[Red coat (British army)|redcoats]]&quot; or &quot;lobster backs&quot; (as the British soldiers were called) began the return march to Boston, several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road. A running fight ensued, and the British detachment suffered heavily before reaching [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer&quot;&gt;See [[#Fischer|Fischer (1994)]] for a comprehensive treatment of Lexington and Concord.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]] — the &quot;[[shot heard 'round the world]]&quot; — the war had begun.

==Siege of Boston==
{{main|Siege of Boston}}
[[File:Boston, 1775bsmall1.png|right|thumb|A map showing a British tactical evaluation of Boston in 1775.]]
In the aftermath of the failed Concord expedition, the thousands of militiamen that had converged on Boston remained. Over the next few days, more arrived from further afield, including companies from New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.  Under the command of [[Artemas Ward]], they surrounded the city, blocking its land approaches and putting the occupied [[Siege of Boston|city under siege]].  The British regulars fortified the high points in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;French219_234&quot;&gt;[[#French|French (1911)]], pp. 219, 234–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need for supplies===
{{main|Thompson's War|Battle of Chelsea Creek|Battle of Machias|Burning of Falmouth}}
While the British were able to resupply the city by sea, supplies in Boston were short.  Troops were sent out to some of the islands in [[Boston Harbor]] to raid farmers for supplies.  In response, the colonials began clearing those islands of supplies useful to the British.  One of these actions was contested by the British in the [[Battle of Chelsea Creek]], but it resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the British ship ''Diana''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks108&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  The need for building materials and other supplies led Admiral [[Samuel Graves]] to authorize a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] merchant to send his ships from Boston to [[Machias, Maine|Machias]] in the [[District of Maine]], accompanied by a Royal Navy schooner.  The Machias townspeople rose up, seizing the merchant vessels and then the schooner [[Battle of Machias|after a short battle]] in which its commander was killed.  Their resistance and that of [[Thompson's War|other coastal communities]] led Graves to authorize an expedition of reprisal in October whose sole significant act was the [[Burning of Falmouth]].&lt;ref name=L67_72&gt;[[#Leamon|Leamon (1995)]], pp. 67–72&lt;/ref&gt;  The outrage in the colonies over this action contributed to the passing of legislation by the [[Second Continental Congress]] that established the [[Continental Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller (1974)]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial army also had issues with supply, and with command.  Its diverse militias needed to be organized, fed, clothed, and armed, and command needed to be coordinated, as each militia leader was responsible to his province's congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks104&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bunker Hill===
{{main|Battle of Bunker Hill}}
Late in May, General Gage received by sea about 2,000 reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war: [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], [[John Burgoyne]], and [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]]. They formulated a plan to break out of the city, which was finalized on June 12.  Reports of these plans made their way to the commanders of the besieging forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks119&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; who decided that additional defensive steps were necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;French254&quot;&gt;[[#French|French (1911)]], p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of June 16–17, 1775, a detachment of the colonial army stealthily marched onto the Charlestown peninsula, which the British had abandoned in April, and fortified Bunker Hill and [[Breed's Hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks122&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], pp. 122–125&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 17, British forces under General Howe attacked and seized the Charlestown peninsula in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. This battle was technically a British victory, but losses (about 1/3 the attacking forces killed or wounded, including a significant fraction of the entire British officer corps in all of North America) were so heavy that the attack was not followed up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks184&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; The siege was not broken, and General Gage was recalled to England in September and replaced by General Howe as the British commander-in-chief.&lt;ref name=&quot;French355&quot;&gt;[[#French|French (1911)]], pp. 355–357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the Continental Army===
The [[Second Continental Congress]], meeting in [[Philadelphia]],  had received reports of the situation outside Boston when it began to meet in May 1775.  In response to the confusion over command in the camps there, and in response to the May 10 [[capture of Fort Ticonderoga]], the need for unified military organization became clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrothRep420_430&quot;&gt;[[#FrothRep|Frothingham (1886)]], pp. 420–430&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Froth98_101&quot;&gt;[[#Frothingham|Frothingham (1851)]], pp. 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress officially adopted the forces outside Boston as the [[Continental Army]] on May 26,&lt;ref name=&quot;FrothRep429&quot;&gt;[[#FrothRep|Frothingham (1886)]], p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; and named [[George Washington]] its commander-in-chief on June 15.  Washington left Philadelphia for Boston on June 21, but did not learn of the action at Bunker Hill until he reached [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frothingham213&quot;&gt;[[#Frothingham|Frothingham (1851)]], pp. 213–214&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washingtoncongress.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Currier and Ives]] print depicting [[George Washington]] accepting the role of Commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]] from [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]].]]

===Stalemate===
Following the Battle of Bunker Hill, the siege was effectively stalemated, as neither side had either a clearly dominant position, or the will and materiel to significantly alter its position.   When Washington took command of the army in July, he determined that its size had reduced from 20,000 to about 13,000 men fit for duty.  He also established that the battle had severely depleted the army's [[Gunpowder|powder]] stock, which was eventually alleviated by powder shipments from Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks194&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;  The British were also busy bringing in reinforcements; by the time of Washington's arrival the British had more than 10,000 men in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForceCounts&quot;/&gt;

Throughout the summer and fall of 1775, both sides dug in, with occasional skirmishes, but neither side chose to take any significant action.&lt;ref name=&quot;French331&quot;&gt;[[#French|French (1911)]], pp. 331–359&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress, seeking to take some initiative and to capitalize on the capture of Ticonderoga, authorized an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]], after several [[letters to the inhabitants of Canada]] were rejected by the French-speaking and British colonists there.  In September, [[Benedict Arnold]] led 1,100 troops on an [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|expedition through the wilderness of Maine]], which was drawn from the army assembled outside Boston.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArnoldForces&quot;&gt;See [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec]] for details on the forces Arnold took on this expedition, and its outcome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington faced a personnel crisis toward the end of 1775, as most of the troops in the army had enlistments that expired at the end of 1775.  He introduced a number of recruitment incentives and was able to keep the army sufficiently large to maintain the siege, although it was by then smaller than the besieged forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks208&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Siege ends==
{{main|Noble train of artillery|Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|l3=Evacuation Day}}

By early March 1776, heavy cannons that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga [[Noble train of artillery|were moved to Boston]], a difficult feat engineered by [[Henry Knox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks211&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]] pp. 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; When the guns were [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|placed on Dorchester Heights]] in the course of one day, overlooking the British positions, the British situation became untenable. While General Howe planned an attack to reclaim the high ground, a snowstorm prevented its execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks230&quot;&gt;[[#Brooks|Brooks (1999)]], pp. 230–231&lt;/ref&gt;  The British, after threatening to burn the city if their departure was hindered,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks230&quot;/&gt; [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuated]] the city on March 17, 1776 and sailed for temporary refuge in [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. The local militias dispersed and, in April, General Washington took most of the [[Continental Army]] to fortify [[New York City]] and the start of the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frothingham312&quot;&gt;[[#Frothingham|Frothingham (1851)]], p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Surrender of General Burgoyne.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Surrender of General Burgoyne]]'']]
The British were essentially driven from New England as a result of this campaign, although there (as elsewhere in the colonies) they continued to receive support from local [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s, especially in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], from which they drove most of the local [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIGuide207&quot;&gt;[[#RIGuide|Rhode Island (1977)]], p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign, as well as the final result of the war as a whole, were a significant blow to British prestige and confidence in its military.  The senior military leaders of the campaign were criticized for their actions (Clinton, for example, while he went on to command the British forces in North America, would take much of the blame for the British loss of the war),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stephen|Stephen (1886)]], p. 550&lt;/ref&gt; and others either saw no more action in the war (Gage),&lt;ref name=&quot;Gagebio&quot;&gt;[[#gagebio|Wise]]&lt;/ref&gt; or were ultimately disgraced (Burgoyne, who surrendered his army at [[Battle of Bemis Heights|Saratoga]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stephen|Stephen (1886)]], pp. 340–341&lt;/ref&gt;  While the British continued to control the seas, and had military successes on the ground (notably in [[New York and New Jersey campaign|New York, New Jersey]], and [[Philadelphia campaign|Pennsylvania]]), their actions that led to these conflicts had the effect of uniting the Thirteen Colonies in opposition to the crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unity&quot;&gt;[[#FrothRep|Frothingham (1886)]], pp. 395–419, in which colonial assemblies defer responses to a Parliamentary olive branch to a united response from the Continental Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, they were never able to marshal enough support from Loyalists to regain meaningful political control of the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern campaign]] by the British, in which they assumed (or were misled to believe) Loyalists would rise to support their military actions, something that did not happen to the degree needed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonies, in spite of their differences, united themselves as a consequence of these events, granting the [[Second Continental Congress]] (predecessor to the modern [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]) sufficient authority and funding to conduct the revolution as a unified whole, including funding and outfitting the military forces that formed as a result of this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson (1912)]], pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;
