{{nihongo|'''''Murasame'''''||村雨|&quot;Passing Shower&quot;}} &lt;ref&gt;Nelson. ''Japanese-English Character Dictionary''. Page 493&lt;/ref&gt; was the third of ten {{sclass-|Shiratsuyu|destroyer}}s, and was built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] under the [[1st Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Japan, 1931)|&quot;Circle One&quot; Program]] (''Maru Ichi Keikaku'').&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 92-3&lt;/ref&gt;  This vessel should not be confused with the earlier [[Russo-Japanese War]]-period {{sclass-|Harusame|destroyer|0}} [[torpedo boat destroyer]] with the same name.

==History==
The ''Shiratsuyu''-class destroyers were modified versions of the {{sclass-|Hatsuharu|destroyer|4}}, and were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night [[torpedo]] attacks against the [[United States Navy]] as it advanced across the [[Pacific Ocean]], according to Japanese naval strategic projections.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie &amp; Evans, ''Kaigun'' .&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the [[Pacific War]].&lt;ref&gt;Globalsecurity.org, IJN Shiratsuyu class destroyers&lt;/ref&gt;
''Murasame'', built at the [[Fujinagata Shipyards]] in [[Osaka]] was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 1 February 1934, [[Ship launching|launched]] on 20 June 1935 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 7 January 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0426.htm| title= Shiratsuyu class 1st class destroyers| last= Nishidah | first=  Hiroshi| year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Murasame'' was assigned to Destroyer Division 2 of Destroyer Squadron 4 of the [[IJN 2nd Fleet]], and had sortied from [[Mako Guard District]] as part of the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)|&quot;Operation M&quot;]] (the invasion of the [[Philippines]], covering landings at [[Vigan]] and [[Lingayen Gulf]]). On 26 December, she collided with [[minesweeper]] ''W-20'' off of [[Kaohsiung|Takao]], [[Taiwan]], suffering minor damage.

From January 1942, ''Murasame'' participated in operations in the [[Netherlands East Indies]], including the invasions of [[Tarakan Island]], [[Balikpapan]] and eastern [[Battle of Java|Java]]. During the [[Battle of the Java Sea]], ''Murasame'' engaged a group of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] destroyers. In March and April, ''Murasame'' was based at [[Subic Bay]], from which she assisted in the invasion of [[Cebu (island)|Cebu]] and the blockade of [[Manila Bay]] in the Philippines. In May, she returned to [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] for repairs.

During the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4–6 June, ''Murasame'' was part of the aborted Midway Occupation Force under Admiral [[Nobutake Kondō]]. In late July, she transferred to [[Mergui]] via [[Singapore]] to join the [[Indian Ocean raids|Indian Ocean raiding force]], but the operation was cancelled due to developments at [[Guadalcanal]], and she returned to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] on 21 August. During the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] on 24 August, she was part of the escort for the [[battleship]] {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mutsu||2}}, and during most of September, she was an escort for the [[seaplane tender]] {{ship|Japanese seaplane tender|Kunikawa Maru||2}}, exploring the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Santa Cruz Islands]] for potential base locations.

In early October, ''Murasame'' participated in two &quot;[[Tokyo Express]]&quot; high speed transport runs to Guadalcanal or [[Lae]], suffering from minor damage on 5 October in an air attack near [[Shortlands]], which necessitated a return to Truk for repairs. In late October through the end of November, ''Murasame'' made an additional nine &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; runs. On 25 October 1942 she assisted in rescuing the crew of the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Yura||0}}, heavily damaged by aircraft attacks, and the next day took part in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] under Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]].  During the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, November 13|First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on the night of 12–13 November 1942, ''Murasame'' assisting in sinking the destroyer {{USS|Monssen|DD-436|6}} and damaging the cruiser {{USS|Helena|CL-50|6}}, as well as possibly torpedoing the cruiser {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|6}}. However, during the battle she was also hit by a shell in her forward boiler, and returned to Truk again for repairs. She continued to patrol from Truk through the end of the year, and returned to Yokosuka for repairs in mid January 1943.

In February 1943, ''Murasame'' returned to Truk escorting the [[aircraft carrier]] {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chūyō||2}}, and continued on to [[Rabaul]] to resume transport operations to [[Kolombangara]]. On the night of 4 March, ''Murasame'' and the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Minegumo||2}} are believed to have sunk the [[submarine]] {{USS|Grampus|SS-207|6}}. However, that same night they were detected by [[radar]]-equipped American ships in [[Kula Gulf]] off [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]], after delivering supplies to the Japanese base there. In a short action both Japanese ships were sunk; ''Murasame'' broke in two from an &quot;extremely violent&quot; explosion after being hit by gunfire and torpedoes from the destroyer {{USS|Waller|DD-466|6}} at position {{coord|08|03|S|157|13|E|display=inline, title}}. Of her crew, 128 were killed, but 53 survivors, including her captain, Lieutenant Commander Tanegashima, and squadron commander Captain Masao Tachibana later reached Japanese territory. She was removed from the [[navy list]] on 1 April 1943.

A memorial monument to the crew of ''Murasame'' exists at [[Kannonzaki]], in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], Japan.
