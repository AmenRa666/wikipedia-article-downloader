The '''91st Air Refueling Squadron''' is part of the [[6th Air Mobility Wing]] at [[MacDill Air Force Base]], Florida.  It operates the [[Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker]] aircraft conducting [[air refueling]] missions.

The squadron was first activated in January 1941 as the '''1st Reconnaissance Squadron''' at [[Langley Field]], Virginia.  Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron performed [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] patrols.  In the spring of 1942 it was renamed the '''391st Bombardment Squadron''' and became part of the [[34th Bombardment Group]], to which it had been attached since activation.  The squadron moved to the western United States and trained until April 1944 when it moved to the [[European Theater of Operations]], where it participated in combat until [[VE Day]].  It returned to the United States in the summer of 1945 and was inactivated.

==Mission==
The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] provides [[air refueling]] and [[airlift]] for combatant commanders.  It operates the [[Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker]], a long-range tanker aircraft capable of refueling a variety of aircraft in mid-air, anywhere in the world and under any weather condition. The 91st's KC-135s have supported US military operations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macdill.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4238 |title=Factsheet, 6th Operations Group|date=20 July 2006|publisher=6th Air Mobility Wing Public Affairs|deadurl=no |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:Douglas B-18 Castle.jpg|thumb|left|B-18 on display at the Castle Air Museum]]
The squadron was first activated at [[Langley Field]], Virginia in January 1941 as the '''1st Reconnaissance Squadron''', a long-range reconnaissance squadron, equipped with a mixture of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17C and B-17D Flying Fortress]]es and [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]]s. It was initially assigned to [[General Headquarters Air Force]], but was attached to the [[34th Bombardment Group]].  Along with the 34th Group, the squadron moved to [[Westover Field]], Massachusetts four months after they were activated.&lt;ref name=91ARSfacts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] the squadron began [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] patrols off the Northeast coast of the United States, but soon became part of [[Western Defense Command]] and moved to [[Pendleton Field]], Oregon.  By the summer of 1942, [[Second Air Force]] had become primarily a heavy bomber training force and the squadron, called the '''391st Bombardment Squadron''' since May, became a B-17 Replacement Training Unit (RTU) at [[Geiger Field]].&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;   RTUs were oversized units which trained [[aircrew]]s prior to their deployment to combat theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Craven &amp; Cate (eds.), Vol. VI, p. xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 1942 the squadron moved to [[Blythe Army Air Base]], California a base of the [[Desert Training Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  The unit provided [[en cadre|cadres]] for a number of [[heavy bomber]] units that served with [[Eighth Air Force]] during this period.&lt;ref name=Freeman240/&gt;

[[File:34bg-b24.jpg|thumb|left|B-24H of the 34th Bomb Group&lt;ref group=note&gt;The plane is Douglas-Tulsa B-24H-15-DT Serial 41-28851 of the 7th Bomb Squadron. This aircraft was damaged during a mission on 24 August 1944 and made an emergency landing in Sweden (MACR 8461). The aircraft was interned until the end of the war then repaired and flown back to the UK in 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The 391st began training with [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s for overseas combat operations on 5 January 1944. Its ground echelon moved to the port of embarkation on 1 April 1944,&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman240/&gt; while the air echelon began its overseas movement on 31 May 1944, taking the southern ferry route, from Florida to Trinidad, Brazil, West Africa and Marrakesh, arriving at [[RAF Valley]], Wales.&lt;ref name=Freeman240&gt;Freeman (1970), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The 34th Group arrived at its permanent station, [[RAF Mendlesham]], England, in April 1944 and entered [[combat]] on 23 May 1944.&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman240/&gt;

The squadron helped to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, by bombing [[airfields]] in France and Germany, and supported the June landings by attacking [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defenses]] and communications. It supported ground forces at [[Saint-Lô]] in late July and struck [[V-1 flying bomb]] launch sites, gun emplacements, and supply lines throughout the summer of 1944.&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;

[[File:34bg-b17.jpg|thumb|34th Bomb Group B-17G Flying Fortress&lt;ref group=note&gt;The aircraft is Lockheed/Vega B-17G-65-VE Serial 44-8457&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The mixture of B-24s and B-17s in the [[3d Bombardment Division]] presented a number of operational problems, and in early 1944 plans had begun at [[VIII Bomber Command]] headquarters to standardize the division with the Flying Fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (1970), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  The 34th group flew its last B-24 mission on 24 August 1944.&lt;ref name=Freeman240/&gt;  It transferred its Liberators for overhaul and eventual transfer to units of the [[2d Bombardment Division]],&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (1970), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; and began converting to B-17s and flew its first mission with the new planes on 17 September 1944.&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman240/&gt;  The squadron engaged primarily in bombardment of strategic objectives from October 1944 to February 1945. Targets included [[marshaling yard]]s in [[Ludwigshafen]], [[Hamm]], [[Osnabrück]], and [[Darmstadt]]; oil centers in [[Bielefeld]], [[Merseburg]], [[Hamburg]], and Misburg; factories in Berlin, Dalteln, and [[Hanover]]; and airfields in [[Münster]], [[Neumünster]], and [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;

During this period the squadron also supported ground forces during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] from December 1944 to January 1945. In March 1945, with few enemy industrial targets remaining and with Allied armies advancing across Germany, the 391st turned almost solely to interdicting enemy communications and supporting Allied ground forces.&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;  The 391st flew its last combat mission on 20 April 1945.&lt;ref name=Freeman240/&gt;

After [[V-E Day]] the squadron flew missions carrying food to flooded areas of the [[Netherlands]] and transported prisoners of war from German camps to Allied centers. The squadron redeployed to the United States in June and July 1945.&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt; The first elements of the air echelon departed 19 June 1945. The ground echelon sailed aboard the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} from [[Southampton]] on 6 August 1945. Upon arrival in the states, unit personnel were given 30 days leave.&lt;ref name=Freeman240/&gt; The squadron reassembled at [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], South Dakota, where it was inactivated on 28 August 1945.&lt;ref name=Maurer34BG/&gt;

===Air Refueling===
[[File:91st Air Refueling Squadron KB-29P Superfortress formation 1951.jpg|thumb|91st Air Refueling Squadron KB-29P Superfortress formation 1951]]
The '''91st Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] as a [[Boeing KB-29 Superfortress]] [[air refueling]] squadron in April 1950.   The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron's]] parent [[91st Strategic Reconnaissance Group]] was equipped with [[North American RB-45 Tornado]]s.  In the fall of 1950, the first air refueling of a jet bomber took place when a squadron [[Boeing KB-29P Superfortress]] refueled one of the group's Tornados.  Over the next eighteen months, the 9lst developed equipment, techniques, and procedures for refueling jet bombers.  The squadron performed the first night refueling and the first refueling performed in [[Instrument flight rules#Weather|instrument weather]] conditions.  However, [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) activated KB-29 squadrons faster than it acquired tankers, and the unit remained understrength through most of 1950 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boeing KC-97G Stratofreighter 53-816.jpg|thumb|Boeing KC-97G Stratofreighter]]
After additional training with tankers, it moved to [[Lockbourne Air Force Base]] along with its parent [[91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]].  It remained at Lockbourne until 1971 and began to fly worldwide air refueling operations.&lt;ref name=91ARSfacts/&gt;  In 1953, the wing began to equip with [[Boeing RB-47 Stratojet]]s and the squadron with [[Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker]]s.&lt;ref name=91ARSfacts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravenstein91SMW&gt;Ravenstein, pp. 125-127&lt;/ref&gt;  SAC had begun to include refueling in its war plans,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and the squadron made frequent deployments with its KC-97s to forward locations, placing it ahead of the faster Boeing B-47 Stratojets it would refuel, and on their programmed route.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Smith, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  During Operation Reflex deployments with the wing, the squadron's aircraft also served as transports, carrying extra air crew, support personnel, and spare parts.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 the 91st wing was inactivated and the squadron was transferred to the [[376th Bombardment Wing]], which moved to Lockbourne from Barksdale in November.&lt;ref name=Ravenstein91SMW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstein, pp. 200-202&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963, the squadron began to transition to the all jet [[Boeing KC-135A Stratotanker]].  Once the transition to the new aircraft was complete, the squadron was attached to the [[301st Bombardment Wing]] in May 1964, and was assigned when the wing became the 301st Air Refueling Wing, the first KC-135 wing in SAC.&lt;ref name=91ARSfacts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravenstein301AREFW&gt;Ravenstein, pp. 144-146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;SAC had several refueling wings before 1964, but they were equipped with the KC-97.  ''See, e.g''. Ravenstein, pp. 271-273 ([[497th Air Refueling Wing|497th]], [[499th Air Refueling Wing|499th]] and [[500th Air Refueling Wing]]s and predecessor units.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Crews and aircraft from the 91st deployed to [[Southeast Asia]] to refuel tactical aircraft and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]es involved in combat in [[Vietnam]] from January 1965 through December 1975.  In July 1971, as regular Air Force operations at Lockbourne were substantially reduced,&lt;ref group=note&gt;In addition to the reduction in size of the 301st Wing, the [[317th Tactical Airlift Wing]] of [[Tactical Air Command]] moved from Lockbourne to [[Pope Air Force Base]], North Carolina.  Ravenstein, pp. 167-169.&lt;/ref&gt; the squadron moved to [[McConnell Air Force Base]].  It refueled aircraft participating in the [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the Grenada rescue mission, between October and November 1983.   The squadron was stationed at McConnell until it was inactivated in 1987.&lt;ref name=91ARSfacts/&gt;

In January 1988, SAC reactivated the 301st Air Refueling Wing and the 91st at [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]], Montana with re-engined KC-135Rs. While at Malmstrom, it was reassigned several times as a result of the implementation of the Objective Wing organization in 1991 and the transfer of the refueling mission from SAC to [[Air Mobility Command]] in 1992. The squadron also supported U.S. operations during the 1991 [[Gulf War]].  It performed refuelings for bombers, airlift, and fighter aircraft as part of Tanker Task Forces around the world between 1992 and 1995.&lt;ref name=91ARSfacts/&gt;  On 1 October 1996 the 91st relocated from Malmstrom to [[MacDill Air Force Base]], Florida, where it became the air refueling component of the [[6th Air Mobility Wing]].  Since 2002 the squadron has refueled fighter aircraft providing security for the [[southeastern United States]].&lt;ref name=91ARSfacts/&gt;
