'''''Umbria''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) built in the 1890s. She was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass2-|Regioni|cruiser|4}}, which included five other vessels. All of the ships were named for current or former regions of Italy. The ship was equipped with a main armament of four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} and six {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} guns, and she could steam at a speed of {{convert|18|kn}}. ''Umbria'' spent much of her career abroad, including several years in American waters. In service during [[Pax Britannica|a period of relative peace]], ''Umbria'' never saw combat. In 1911, she was sold to Haiti and renamed '''''Consul Gostrück''''', though she did not serve for very long under the Haitian flag. Her crew was too inexperienced to operate the ship, and she foundered shortly after being transferred to the [[Haitian Navy]]

==Design==
{{main article|Regioni-class cruiser}}

''Umbria'' was {{convert|84.8|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.03|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.35|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced up to {{convert|3110|MT|sp=us}} at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal [[triple-expansion engine]]s, with steam supplied by four cylindrical [[water-tube boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=G349&gt;Gardiner, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; On her speed trials, she reached a maximum of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}} at {{convert|7400|ihp|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Notes on Ships and Torpedo Boats&quot; 1896, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had a cruising radius of about {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She had a crew of between 213-78.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt;

''Umbria'' was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns mounted singly, with two side by side forward and two side by side aft. Six {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns were placed between them, with three on each [[broadside]]. Light armament included one {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} gun, eight {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns, two {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, and a pair of [[machine gun]]s. She was also equipped with two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. ''Umbria'' was protected by a {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick deck, and her [[conning tower]] had 50&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt;

==Service history==
''Umbria'' was built by the [[Odero-Terni-Orlando shipyard]] in [[Livorno]]. Her keel was laid down on 1 August 1888.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt; Shortages of funding slowed the completion of ''Umbria'' and her sister ships. Tight budgets forced the navy to reduce the pace of construction so that the funds could be used to keep the active fleet in service.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Notes on Ships and Torpedo Boats&quot; 1891, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, her hull was not ready to be launched until 23 April 1891, and [[fitting-out]] work took another almost three years to complete. ''Umbria'' finally joined the fleet on 16 February 1894.&lt;ref name=G349/&gt; On 1 February 1897, ''Umbria'' was assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the main Italian fleet, along with her sister {{ship|Italian cruiser|Liguria||2}} and the cruisers {{ship|Italian cruiser|Marco Polo||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Dogali||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1904, ''Umbria'' stopped in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, to supervise the transfer of sailors who had been killed by a [[yellow fever]] outbreak on her sister {{ship|Italian cruiser|Lombardia||2}} in 1896. The men, 134 in all, had been buried in various cemeteries, but were re-interred in a large mausoleum in [[São Francisco Xavier, Rio de Janeiro|São Francisco Xavier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Public Health Reports'', p. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December, ''Umbria'' stopped in [[Valparaiso]], where she met the German cruiser {{SMS|Falke}} and the United States' cruisers {{USS|New York|ACR-2|6}} and {{USS|Marblehead|C-11|6}} and the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Bennington|PG-4|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Reports'', p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1905, ''Umbria'' represented Italy at the [[Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. She was joined there by the United States' cruisers {{USS|Chicago|1885|6}} and {{USS|Boston|1884|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Southard, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Umbria'' ran aground outside [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in July 1906, while en route from [[Puerto Rico]]. The salvage ship {{SS|Premier}} assisted in pulling the ship free.&lt;ref&gt;''The Summary'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1910, the ''Regia Marina'' had decided to dispose of the obsolescent cruiser. Rumors that year of a potential sale to the [[Ecuadorian Navy]] prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Dupuy de Lôme||2}}, though Ecuador did not end up purchasing ''Umbria''.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in December 1910, the ''Regia Marina'' sold ''Umbria'' to the [[Armed Forces of Haiti|Haitian Navy]], but she did not arrive in [[Port-de-Paix]], Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed ''Consul Gostrück''. The ship was rumored to be carrying [[Cipriano Castro]], the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to be false.&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'', p. 1342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D07E0D61439E333A25755C1A9609C946096D6CF|title=Deny Castro is on Steamer Grostuck|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 June 1911|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Castro in Haiti Alarms Nations|newspaper=The Ogdensburg Journal|date=15 June 1911|url=http://rrlcnewspapers.org/lccn/sn85054113/1911-06-15/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; ''Umbria'' was eventually raised and towed to [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Speerstra, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Haas &amp; Pilkes, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
