== Which is correct? ==
I'm a bit confused. The article title says 1944-45, but the article itself says 1943-1944. Which is correct? -[[User:Etoile|Etoile]] 00:00, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
:Neither. Fighting on Bougainville lasted until the end of the war (eg, 1943-45). While the article does not currently mention it, after the US forces left Bougainville the Australian Army launched a major offensive against the Japanese. --[[User:Nick Dowling|Nick Dowling]] 05:51, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
::I'll be working on this article eventually and I'll make sure to include the final stage of the battle that included Australian troops. If you know of any references that detail the Australian portion of the battle, please list them in the references section. Thanks, [[User:Cla68|Cla68]] 14:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
::One more thing, whoever originally laid out the Solomon Islands campaign, placed an article for the land battle of Empress Augusta Bay (1943) as a seperate article from the later Bougainville campaign (this article). I'm not sure if they should be separate articles. [[User:Cla68|Cla68]] 00:37, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

== Japanese statistics ==
At the moment, citing Gailey, we have 65,000 troops and 44,000 dead. However the AWM website says: &quot;At the surrender it was found that in November 1944 there had been 42,000 Japanese on the island. At the surrender in September 1945, 23,571 were left; 8,500 died in battle and 9,800 of disease and malnutrition.&quot;[http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/AJRP/AJRP2.nsf/437f72f8ac2c07238525661a00063aa6/a25ea01eacbac6cdca256946001ef8ad?OpenDocument] I wonder where Gailey gets the other 23-24,000 from. [[User:Grant65|Grant]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 16:09, 10 June 2007 (UTC)
:I'll check Gailey's book and see what source he cites for his numbers. [[User:Cla68|CLA]] 01:07, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
::Gailey is insistent that there were 65,000 Japanese troops on the island. Rottman's book, however, states that there were 38,000 Japanese troops on Bougainville at the time of the Allied invasion and that 7,000 more arrived later. Since Rottman's figures are closer to AWM's numbers, I think we should use those. I'll make the changes and put Gailey's figures in the footnote. [[User:Cla68|CLA]] 12:53, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
::I agree, thanks. [[User:Grant65|Grant]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 01:21, 12 June 2007 (UTC)
:::By the way, I think the Allied forces numbers in the infobox may be too high also because Gailey is vague on the exact number of Allied soldiers involved. [[User:Cla68|CLA]] 01:38, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

== Concerns about GA nomination ==
Hello, I see that this article has been nominated for a GA review. I have a number of concerns about this. Firstly, this was done without consultation. While I understand that anyone can nominate an article for GA, I think it is best to notify the article's main contributors beforehand. That is a minor point, though, and I understand that the nominator was only acting on good faith, so I will move on. My main concern is the fact that I don't believe that the article is ready for GAN. I say this as the article's main contributor. It is missing a lot of things, for instance: the strategic context of the fighting (background), description of terrain/geography, logistics, air operations, aftermath/analysis, etc. There is a lot more that could be written here. I intend to add this to the article eventually, however, I am not in a position to do so at the moment. Unless someone has the inclination to add this information, I think that the GA nomination should simply be removed as I fear that without it, it won't be successful and it will simply be wasting a reviewer's time. As such, I propose to remove the nomination. I will wait for some feedback on this proposal before doing so, though. If I haven't heard anything by tomorrow night (it is currently 8:00 pm Sunday here), I will go ahead and remove the nomination. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 10:46, 22 July 2012 (UTC)
*After reviewing the article myself, I agree the nomination should be pulled. Not that the article is in bad shape (far from it), but it needs a bit more content. I am willing to help with that, and thanks for notifying me,  [[Special:Contributions/72.184.164.159|72.184.164.159]] ([[User talk:72.184.164.159|talk]]) 17:05, 22 July 2012 (UTC)
**No worries, I've removed the nomination per above. If you are keen to work on the article, please feel free. I'd be very interested to see what you come up with. At the moment, I'm a bit tied up with the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]], but I could drag myself away from that once you get started. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 07:47, 23 July 2012 (UTC)

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Bougainville Campaign]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=704847884 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20070109011150/http://www.nps.gov:80/archive/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003130-00/sec14.htm to http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003130-00/sec14.htm

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' to let others know.

{{sourcecheck|checked=true}}

Cheers.—[[User:Cyberbot II|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:green;font-family:Courier&quot;&gt;cyberbot II]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;margin-left:-14.9ex;color:green;font-family:Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Cyberbot II|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Talk to my owner]]:Online&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 23:28, 13 February 2016 (UTC)

==Serious Issues==
The article seems to heavily focus on the American viewpoint of the campaign, it is riddled with photos of American officers who took part in the campaign (their &quot;hip&quot; nicknames included). The description of the second photo of  the January–February 1944: Encircling Rabaul segment is borderline POV. The reference to the Thanksgiving Day as well as Eleanor Roosevelt's column My Day also seems out of place since it only resonates with American readers. I also spotted some peacock language, example below: 
&quot;With experience learned in previous invasions and extremely detailed staff work, the landings went off with great efficiency.&quot;
Furthermore the article lists an insane number of locations without using enough wikilinks and overuses direct quotations.--[[User:Catlemur|Catlemur]] ([[User talk:Catlemur|talk]]) 20:47, 11 April 2016 (UTC)

:The material on the motivations for the Australian campaign on the island also needs work (which I'll do today). I agree on the photos. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 08:50, 12 April 2016 (UTC)
::G'day, gentlemen, thanks for your input. I've made a bunch of changes now, but TBH I'm finding it difficult working with the text given how complete the rewrite was that was completed a while ago by another editor. Anyway, I've added another Japanese source now; removed the images; and tried to copy edit the article a bit more. If you could both take another look and let me know how we are tracking for B class I'd greatly appreciate it. Cheers, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 11:55, 14 April 2016 (UTC)
:::Much improved IMO. I also had difficulty working with that text, which didn't present a well-rounded view of the campaign. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 12:00, 14 April 2016 (UTC)

== Carrier raids ==

The article mentions the carrier attack of 5 November 1943 but not the one of 11 November.  ''See'' [[Bombing of_Rabaul_%28November 1943%29#Carrier attacks]]. Although the latter raid occurred after Japanese withdrawal of warships, should not the 11 November raid be mentioned as well?
—[[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 12:31, 21 May 2016 (UTC)
:G'day, thanks for this. Yes, I think this would be a good addition. I think there is something about it here: [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/IV/AAF-IV-8.html#page260] on p. 260. Unless you beat me to it, I will see if maybe I can work something in tomorrow (it's getting late here). Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 13:08, 21 May 2016 (UTC)
::I will check some sources also.  I believe that the AIRSOLS operation against Rabaul was in essence a battle of attrition against forces including the air groups of the two [[Shōkaku-class aircraft carrier]]s, which were highly trained.  The success of that operation led to Japanese withdrawal of those groups and others, which gave the Allies command of the air and enabled further Allied advances.  It also allowed some Allied air elements to be withdrawn.  I'll be glad to work with you, but I leave it to you how much detail we should give to those elements in this article.
