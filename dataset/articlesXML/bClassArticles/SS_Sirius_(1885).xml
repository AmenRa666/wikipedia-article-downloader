'''SS ''Sirius''''' was a Norwegian iron-hulled steamship built in Germany in 1885. ''Sirius'' spent over 55 years sailing with cargo, regular passengers and tourists between Norway and Europe, and on the Norwegian coast. In 1894-1895, she served a year on the [[Hurtigruten]] route on the coast of Norway, before reverting to her former duties. 

''Sirius'' was rebuilt twice, the final rebuild in 1927 converting her to a dedicated cargo ship, a role which she fulfilled for the rest of her existence. Following the 1940 German [[Operation Weserübung|invasion of Norway]], she was requisitioned by the Norwegian government and carried supplies for both the civilian authorities and the military until bombed and sunk by a German aircraft on 18 May 1940.

==Construction and characteristics==
''Sirius'' was built as yard number 76 at the ''[[Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft]]'' shipyard in [[Flensburg]], Germany. Displacing {{GRT|877|disp=long}}, the iron-hulled steamship was launched on 26 February 1885.&lt;ref name=miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=5615399|shipname=Sirius |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sirius'' featured an overbuilt (&quot;hurricane&quot; or [[awning]]) deck, and was powered by a 700 [[indicated horsepower]] two-cylinder [[compound steam engine]], propelling her at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Bakka49&gt;Bakka 2003, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; She was {{convert|191.2|ft|m}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28.8|ft|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|20|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Storberget 1993, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; At completion, she was delivered in April 1885 to the [[Bergen Steamship Company]] in [[Bergen]], Norway.&lt;ref name=miramar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt; ''Sirius'', which had cost {{NOK|350,435}} to build, was one of four ships acquired by the Bergen Steamship Company around that time to replace the mid-19th century vessels then in service with the company.&lt;ref name=Solemdal141&gt;Solemdal 1946, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forening&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjohistorie.no/skip/s/Sirius%201885 |title=D/S Sirius |accessdate=10 February 2013 |work=Sjømannsforeningene på Agder |publisher= |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The three other ships acquired by the company in the 1880s and 1890s were {{SS|Capella|1885|2}}, {{SS|Mira|1891|2}} and {{SS|Neptun|1890|2}}.&lt;ref name=Solemdal141/&gt;|group=Note}}

''Sirius'' was divided into three passenger classes for 70 passengers, with 24 First Class cabins, 22 cabins in the Second Class and 24 in the Third Class section of the ship. The passenger accommodation was located at the main deck, while the cargo holds were situated afore and abaft of the engine room.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vesterålen&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Krogstad | first =Peter | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =På havets bunn står skutene... | journal =[[Bladet Vesterålen]] | volume = | issue = | page =56 | date =21 December 2007 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = | language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sirius'' was named after the star [[Sirius]], in keeping with Bergen Steamship Company's tradition of naming their ships after heavenly objects.&lt;ref&gt;Svanberg 1990, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early service==
The Bergen Steamship Company's initial use for ''Sirius'' was as a passenger/cargo vessel connecting the various ports of Norway with the North-German port city of [[Hamburg]]. In this regard, she sailed between Hamburg and Norwegian ports as far apart as [[Kristiansand]] and [[Vadsø]].&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt; 

She also carried tourists during the summer season. On one occasion in 1890, ''Sirius'' encountered the German royal yacht [[SMY Hohenzollern|''Hohenzollern I'']], carrying [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]] on one of his cruises to Norway. As the two ships passed each other off [[Kristiansund]], ''Sirius'' raised her flag and fired a salute gun in honour of the German emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Güßfeldt 1891, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, following a great fire which destroyed large parts of the port city of [[Hammerfest]], the Norwegian Internal Affairs Department despatched ''Sirius'' from [[Tromsø]] with 50 barrels of bread, butter, coffee and flour to Hammerfest as emergency aid.&lt;ref&gt;Sivertsen 1973, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurtigruten service==
In 1894, the year after businessman [[Richard With]] and his ''[[Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab]]'' had pioneered the [[Hurtigruten]] coastal passenger/cargo route along the coast of Norway, fulfilling a government contract with his steamer {{SS|Vesteraalen|1890|2}}, the Bergen Steamship Company and ''[[Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskab]]'' gained a joint four-year contract to sail the route. While ''Nordenfjeldske'' employed the brand-new {{SS|Erling Jarl||2}}, the Bergen Steamship Company used four older ships on the route. The two companies were to sail the route alternate years. The first voyage of the new business venture began on 3 July 1894, when ''Sirius'' set sail from north from [[Trondheim]]. During the summer season the route transported goods and passengers between ports from Trondheim to Hammerfest, while the winter route only went as far north as Tromsø.&lt;ref&gt;Bakka 2003, pp. 35-39, 49&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The three other ships initially employed on Hurtigruten service by the Bergen Steamship Company were ''Capella'', {{SS|Jupiter|1856|2}} and {{SS|Orion|1874|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bakka 2003, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

''Sirius'' ended her stint on the Hurtigruten route on 1 July 1895, when ''Nordenfjeldske'' stepped in in accordance with the contract. While on Hurtigruten service, ''Sirius'' had set out on her northbound route from [[Brattøra]] in Trondheim each Thursday at 08:00.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;
[[File:DS Sirius i Bergen.jpg|thumb|left|''Sirius'' docked in [[Bergen]], c. 1890]]

==Passenger/cargo and tourist service==
Once finished with her year on the Hurtigruten service, ''Sirius'' returned to her Hamburg-Norway route. Every spring, she was taken out of service for cleaning and maintenance, before being employed as a tourist cruise ship on the coast of Norway during the summer season.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;

In 1896, ''Sirius'' had electric lighting installed,&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt; and in 1898 she stood in on the route from Bergen to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in England for ships undergoing maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Danielsen 1991, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==1908 rebuild and continued traffic==
In 1908, ''Sirius'' was taken out of service for a comprehensive rebuild. [[Laxevaag Maskin- og Jernskipsbyggeri]] in Bergen carried out the work on ''Sirius'', increasing her length to {{convert|207.5|ft|m}}.  The rebuilding also saw the replacement of her two-cylinder compound steam engine with a 950 indicated horsepower [[triple expansion steam engine]].&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warsailors&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lawson |first =Siri Holm |url=http://warsailors.com/homefleetsingles/sirius.html |title=D/S Sirius |accessdate=10 February 2013 |work=Warsailors.com |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rebuild, ''Sirius'' was employed both on her previous passenger/cargo routes, and on a route between Norway and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt; The route between Hamburg and Norway sailed by ''Sirius'' and other ships was interrupted by the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914-18, and was resumed as a reduced service between Hamburg and Bergen in 1918. By 1918, ''Sirius'' was an old and rat-infested ship, barely fit for passenger transport, and was replaced on the route by newer vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Solemdal 1946, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cargo ship conversion==
In 1927, ''Sirius'' had further rebuilding carried out. The rebuild, which cost {{NOK|108,000}}, saw the removal of her passenger accommodation and a conversion to carry only cargo. Twelve cabins were retained, although not used for regular passenger traffic. As a cargo ship, she had a tonnage of {{GRT|944|disp=long}} ({{NRT|534|disp=long}}). For the rest of her career, she carried cargo between the Norwegian capital city of [[Oslo]] and Norway's northernmost county, [[Finnmark]]. By 1930, she had been assigned the [[code letters]] JVTL, and had [[wireless]] radio on board.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=forening/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warsailors/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lloyds-30&gt;{{cite book | title = Register of Ships | edition = 1930–31 }} {{cite web | url = http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b1096.pdf | title = Scan of page 'Sir'  | format = pdf | publisher = Hosted at [http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/ Plimsoll Ship Data] | accessdate = 10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, the code letters were changed to LEUS and remained so for the remainder of the ship's life.&lt;ref name=Lloyds-34&gt;{{cite book | title = Register of Ships | edition = 1934–35 }} {{cite web | url = http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=34b0777.pdf | title = Scan of page 'Sir-Siv'  | format = pdf | publisher = Hosted at [http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/ Plimsoll Ship Data] | accessdate = 10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

===German invasion===
When Germany [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] neutral Norway on 9 April 1940, ''Sirius'' was located in [[Northern Norway]]. On 8 April, the day before the Germans launched their attack on Norway, she had left [[Narvik]], bound for Tromsø. Along with other ships in the still-unoccupied areas of Norway, ''Sirius'' was [[requisition]]ed by the Norwegian authorities to support the [[Norwegian Campaign|war effort]] against the Germans.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warsailors/&gt; Following her requisition, ''Sirius'' sailed as a supply ship for the Norwegian civilian authorities and [[6th Division (Norway)|military]] in Northern Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Abelsen 1986, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; In all, the Norwegian government requisitioned 30 ships during the April–June fighting in Norway, of which six were sunk by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersen 1992, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinking===
On 18 May, ''Sirius'' was on her way from Tromsø to [[Risøyhamn]] to retrieve a number of requisitioned civilian motor vehicles. The vehicles were destined for [[Helgeland]] further south in Northern Norway, where Norwegian forces were opposing advancing German units.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt; ''Sirius'' sailed in [[Sailing ballast|ballast]], having unloaded a cargo of [[hay]] at [[Røsneshavn]] after departing Tromsø. She had left Røsneshavn in the morning of 17 May 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vesterålen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warsailors/&gt; ''Sirius'' was under instructions to use an outer route off the island of [[Senja]], but due to misunderstandings was sailing close to the coast, where German bombers were regularly patrolling.&lt;ref name=Nordanger&gt;Nordanger 1975, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late evening of 18 May, ''Sirius'' was spotted by a German bomber aircraft in the strait [[Solbergfjorden]] off Finnlandsnes on [[Dyrøya (Troms)|Dyrøya]] in [[Troms]] county.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vesterålen&quot;/&gt; The bomber came from a westerly direction, and after first [[strafing]] ''Sirius'', the German aircraft attacked with seven bombs, and despite evasive manoeuvring by the Norwegian vessel, hit ''Sirius'' with two of them, sinking her.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vesterålen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordanger/&gt; The first bomb hit the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] area, while the second struck amidships, breaking the ship in two lengthwise, in what was described by eyewitnesses on shore as &quot;opening up like a book&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordanger/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hafsten&gt;Hafsten, Larsstuvold, Olsen and Stenersen 2005, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Seven crew members, including both the captain and the first mate, were killed in the sinking, while 11 survivors were rescued from the water by local people in [[rowing boat]]s.&lt;ref name=Bakka49/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vesterålen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warsailors/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hafsten/&gt; The survivors, who had been strafed in the water by the German aircraft, were later retrieved by the [[submarine tender]] {{HNoMS|Lyngen||2}} and the local steamer {{SS|Mosken|1924|2}} and brought to [[Harstad]].&lt;ref name=Warsailors/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vold 1995, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

The wreck of ''Sirius'' lies north of Dyrøya, at depths between {{convert|45|m|ft}} and {{convert|75|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vesterålen&quot;/&gt;
