At about 23:55 hrs (German time) on 25 August, ''Stakesby'' was hit by a [[torpedo]] fired by {{GS|U-124|1940|2}}, which was under the command of [[Kapitänleutnant]] [[Georg-Wilhelm Schulz]]. She was hit in the No.1 hold. Her cargo provided sufficient buoyancy to keep her afloat, although a fire developed at the forward end of the ship. At the time, ''Stakesby'' was {{convert|23|nmi|km}} north of the [[Butt of Lewis]] ({{coord|58|52|N|6|34|W}}). After an hour, the 36 crew abandoned ship, as the fire was beyond their capacity to fight. They were rescued by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] merchant ship {{SS|Cetus|1920|2}} which took them to [[Stornoway]], [[Outer Hebrides]]. {{HMS|Thames|1938|6}} was despatched to the aid of ''Stakesby''.

====1942-43====
In January 1942, ''Stakesby'' was raised and temporary repairs were carried out. She departed from Stornoway under tow on 9 June and arrived at [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothesay Bay]], [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], on 12 June. She was then towed to the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] where more temporary repairs were made. ''Stakesby'' was then towed to Sunderland for permanent repairs to be made. She was taken over by the MoWT, renamed ''Empire Derwent'' and placed under the management of Neill &amp; Pandelis Ltd, London.&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt; She retained her Code Letters GPWM and Official Number 161017.
