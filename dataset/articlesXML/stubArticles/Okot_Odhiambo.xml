'''Okot Odhiambo''' (also known as '''Two Victor''', his radio [[call sign]]&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt;) was a senior leader of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], a [[Uganda]]n rebel group which operates from [[Garamba National Park]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Odhiambo was one of five people for whom the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) issued its first ever arrest warrants in 2005, for alleged [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. In 2009, he announced his intention to defect from the LRA and return to Uganda if the government would agree not to surrender him to the ICC.

==Lord's Resistance Army==
Odhiambo was reported to be the LRA's Deputy Army Commander and a member of the &quot;Control Altar&quot;, the core leadership group responsible for devising and implementing LRA strategy.&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt; He is believed to have become deputy leader of the LRA following the (alleged) death of [[Vincent Otti]] in October 2007.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

===International Criminal Court indictment===
On 8 July 2005, Odhiambo was one of five LRA commanders for whom the ICC issued its first ever arrest warrants. The court ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Odhiambo had [[command responsibility|ordered]] the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=warrant&gt;International Criminal Court (8 July 2005). {{cite web|url= http://www2.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc97197.PDF |title=''Warrant of arrest for Okot Odhiambo (public redacted version)'' }}. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution alleges that Odhiambo led a number of massacres and commanded attacks against two [[internally displaced person]] camps in 2004, during which more than 300 people were burnt, shot and hacked to death and children were abducted.&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt; Odhiambo was charged with three counts of crimes against humanity ([[murder]] and [[enslavement]]) and seven counts of war crimes (murder, intentionally directing attacks against civilian populations, [[pillaging]], and [[Military use of children|forced enlisting of children]]) in connection with the two attacks.&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt;

According to the ICC warrant for his arrest, Odhiambo is described by former LRA commanders and members as a &quot;ruthless killer&quot;, as &quot;the one who killed the most&quot;, and as &quot;a ‘bitter’ man who will kill anyone&quot;.&lt;ref name=warrant/&gt;&lt;ref name=trial-watch&gt;Trial Watch. &quot;[http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/okot_odiambo_398.html Okot Odhiambo]&quot;. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defection from the LRA===
In April 2008, it was reported that Odhiambo and eight others had been killed by LRA leader [[Joseph Kony]] during a dispute over a proposed peace deal.&lt;ref name=nyakairu&gt;Frank Nyakairu and Grace Matsiko (14 April 2008). &quot;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200804140008.html Uganda: Kony Kills His Deputy]&quot;. [[AllAfrica.com]].

Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 29 January 2009, Odhiambo said he had suffered a serious gunshot wound during a clash with Ugandan forces and was defecting from the LRA.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; He told [[Agence France-Presse]], &quot;We have requested a safe corridor. I want to come out. I am tired of going up and down all the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=afp&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]] (28 January 2009).  &quot;[http://www.monuc.org/news.aspx?newsID=20010 Lord's Resistance Army number two plans to turn himself in]&quot;. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted the [[International Organization for Migration]] seeking safe passage to Uganda,&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;Xan Rice (29 January 2009). &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/29/uganda-rebels-odhiambo-defects Ugandan rebel deputy leader defects]&quot;. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; along with 45 other rebels and 10 abductees,&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;[[Reuters]] (29 January 2009). &quot;[http://alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LT210157.htm Uganda rebel deputy wants to surrender -world body]&quot;  Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but said he would not surrender unless he was given a guarantee that he would not be turned over to the ICC.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; The [[government of Uganda]] has indicated that it would try Odhiambo in a national court rather than surrender him to the ICC.&lt;ref name=IWPR&gt;Bill Oketch, Patrick Okino and Samuel Okiror Egadu (29 January 2009). &quot;[http://www.iwpr.net/EN-acr-f-349637 Kampala Faces Odhiambo Dilemma ]&quot;. [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gulu|Catholic Archbishop of Gulu]], John Baptist Odama, said the defection could revive hopes of a peaceful end to the conflict.&lt;ref name=IRIN&gt;[[IRIN|IRIN News]] (30 January 2009). &quot;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=82659 UGANDA: Rebel commander's defection 'a boon' to peace]&quot;. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Amnesty International]] criticized the International Organization for Migration for agreeing to facilitate Odhiambo's transfer to Uganda instead of to the ICC.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;[[Amnesty International]] (30 January 2009). &quot;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE200901309245&amp;lang=e Uganda: International organization must not help fugitive evade justice]&quot;. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

An LRA spokesman dismissed the reports of Odhiambo's planned defection, claiming the story was invented by the Ugandan army &quot;to create disharmony and danger to LRA fighters&quot;.&lt;ref name=olali&gt;Godffrey Olali (1 February 2009). &quot;[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/-/1066/522788/-/13rvr6nz/-/ Surrender? Not our deputy, says LRA]&quot;. The ''[[Daily Nation]]''.  Retrieved on 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, it was reported that Odhiambo had been killed in October 2013. Odhiambo's body was found based on GPS coordinates provided by the man who buried him after his death and afterward defected to UPDF forces. His body was exhumed on March 20, 2015, and flown to Entebbe, Uganda for identity confirmation.
