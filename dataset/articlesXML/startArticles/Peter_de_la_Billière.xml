[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] '''Sir Peter Edgar de la Cour de la Billière''',&lt;ref&gt;Although the name is often seen without the accent, it is spelt with the accent in ''[[Who's Who]]'' and in de la Billière's own books.&lt;/ref&gt; {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KCB|KBE|DSO|MC}} &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]] (born 29 April 1934) is a former [[British Army]] officer who was [[Director Special Forces|Director SAS]] during the [[Iranian Embassy siege]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British forces in the [[Gulf War]]. He is often known by the acronym DLB.

==Early years==
Peter de la Billière was born in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]], the son of Surgeon [[Lieutenant Commander]] Denis de la Billière and his wife Kitty Lawley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=skhhNJ5RfJ29gPh%2FPEKmww&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=24 April 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 May 1941, his father was killed when his ship, [[HMS Fiji (C58)|HMS ''Fiji'']], was sunk by [[Germany|German]] [[bomber]]s in an attack southwest of [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=wars/&gt;

He was educated at [[Wellesley House School]], in the coastal town of [[Broadstairs]] in [[Kent]],&lt;ref name=Wellesley/&gt; and [[Harrow School]] at [[Harrow-on-the-Hill]] in North West London.&lt;ref name=wars/&gt;  A “Peter de la Billière” is mentioned as pupil evacuee of St. Peter’s, Broadstairs, Kent sent to Crediton, Devon in ''Our Land at War'' by Duff Hart-Davis.&lt;ref&gt;William Collins 2015 ISBN 978-0-00-751653-7&lt;/ref&gt; The book (p48) states “during the night of 23 January 1945 the building caught fire, and pupils and staff alike, trapped on balconies, were forced to abseil down makeshift ropes …&quot;

==Military career==
He originally enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; He was later [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a [[Second Lieutenant]] into the [[Durham Light Infantry]].&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; During his early career as an officer he served in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Egypt]] with the first battalion (1 DLI).&lt;ref name=wars/&gt;

===Special Air Service===
In 1956, he attended and passed Selection for the [[Special Air Service]]. During his first SAS tour, he served in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and [[Oman]], where he was [[mentioned in despatches]] and won the [[Military Cross]] in 1959 for leading a troop in the assault on Jebel Akdar.&lt;ref name=MinD/&gt;&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; After his initial tour with [[22 SAS]], he returned to the Durham Light Infantry to run recruit training, before taking up the post of [[Adjutant]] of [[Artists' Rifles|21 SAS]]&amp;nbsp;– the London-based [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (reserve) SAS regiment.&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; In 1962, he was attached to the Federal Army in [[Aden]].&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; In 1964, he failed [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] but was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] A Squadron 22 SAS.&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; From 1964 to 1966, A Squadron 22 SAS was deployed to [[Borneo]] where he was second-in-command of the regiment for the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]].&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; For his actions during this period he was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to the Military Cross.&lt;ref name=MCbar/&gt;

After this tour, he re-attended Staff College, and, this time, passed. After Staff College he was posted as G2 (intelligence) Special Forces at Strategic Command. He then served a tour as second-in-command of 22 SAS, of which he was Commanding Officer from 1972 to 1974.&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; For service in Oman, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) in 1976 for his actions in the battles at Musandam and Dhofar.&lt;ref name=DSO/&gt;

He then served from 1977 in a number of administrative posts assuming command of the [[British Army Training Team]] in Sudan before returning to the regiment as [[Director Special Forces|Director SAS]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=commands&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201860-.pdf |title=Army Commands|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next four years he commanded SAS Group with overall responsibility for military command.  It was during this period that the SAS shot to public fame as a consequence of their storming of the [[Iranian Embassy Siege|Iranian Embassy]] in 1980. He was also responsible during the [[Falklands War]] for planning [[Operation Mikado]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph2002-03-08&quot;/&gt; In 1982, he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).&lt;ref name=CBE/&gt;

===Regular service commands===
After the SAS he was appointed Military Commissioner and Commander of British Forces in the [[Falkland Islands]] from 1984 and General Officer Commanding Wales District from 1985.&lt;ref name=commands/&gt; He was succeeded by Brigadier [[Morgan Llewellyn]] on 1 December 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;LG 30 November 1987&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51136 |date=30 November 1987 |startpage=14774 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB).&lt;ref name=KCB/&gt; He was General Officer Commanding [[Aldershot Command|South East District]] from 1988.&lt;ref name=commands/&gt;

Despite being due for retirement he was appointed on 6 October 1990 as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of British Forces in the [[Gulf War]]&amp;nbsp;– in effect the second-in-command of the [[Coalition of the Gulf War|multinational military coalition]] headed by US General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.|Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr]].  His past experience of fighting in the area, knowledge of the people and possession of some fluency in Arabic overrode concerns about his age.  In this role he was largely responsible for persuading Schwarzkopf (who was initially sceptical) to allow the use of SAS and other special forces in significant roles in that conflict.  The British army contingent expanded 14,000 from early in November 1990 to more than 45,000 through to completion of the engagement and cessation of hostilities in February 1991.&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; In 1991, he was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE).&lt;ref name=KBE/&gt;

By the end of his career he had risen to the rank of a general, and became a special adviser to the Ministry of the Defence on Middle East military matters.  In order to allow him to receive the pension benefits of full general he was given the newly created [[sinecure|sinecurist]] (honorarium) post of Middle East Advisor to the [[Secretary of State for Defence]].&lt;ref name=wars/&gt; He retired in June 1992.&lt;ref name=wars/&gt;

==Later life==
In August 1991, he received Canada's [[Meritorious Service Decoration|Meritorious Service Cross]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;  In 1993, he received Saudi Arabia's [[Order of King Abdul Aziz]], 2nd Class&lt;ref name=&quot;'93&quot;/&gt; and was made a Commander of the United States' [[Legion of Merit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;'93&quot;/&gt;

He has written or co-authored 18 books, including an autobiography, a personal account of the Gulf War and a number of works about the SAS.&lt;ref name=amaz/&gt;

He is currently a patron of the UK based international development charity, [[FARM-Africa]] having served on the board since 1992 and as chairman from 1998 to 2001.
