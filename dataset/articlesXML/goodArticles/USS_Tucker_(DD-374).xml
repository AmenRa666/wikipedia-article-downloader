'''USS ''Tucker'' (DD-374)''' was a {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer}} in the [[United States Navy]]. The ship was named for [[Samuel Tucker]], an officer in both the [[Continental Navy]] and the United States Navy. 

''Tucker'' began her service in 1936. Following [[shakedown cruise|shakedown]], the new destroyer was assigned to the [[United States Battle Fleet]] in [[San Diego, California]], operating along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. She participated in naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea, and was then reassigned to duty between the West Coast and [[Hawaii]]. After a goodwill tour to New Zealand, the ship returned to [[Pearl Harbor]]. When the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7{{nbsp}}December 1941, ''Tucker'' was berthed at the East Loch in Pearl Harbor undergoing overhaul but sustained no damage. Afterward, ''Tucker'' escorted convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. She then did escort work to [[American Samoa]], the [[Fiji Islands]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Espiritu Santo]], [[New Hebrides]].

''Tucker'' entered the harbor at Espirtu Santo's western entrance, leading the cargo ship SS{{nbsp}}''Nira Luckenbach'', unaware they had entered a minefield laid earlier by US Navy [[minelayer]]s. After striking at least one [[Naval mine|mine]], the destroyer was almost torn in two at the No.{{nbsp}}1 stack, killing all three of the crew in the forward [[fire room|fireroom]]. The rest of the crew survived but ''Tucker'' did not. The destroyer slowly settled in the water and sank. An investigation revealed that ''Tucker'' had been given no information about the existence of the minefield.

==Design and armament==
''Tucker'' displaced {{convert|1500|LT|t|0}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship's [[length overall|overall length]] was {{convert|341|ft|3|in|m|1}}, the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and her [[draft (hull)|draft]] was {{convert|10|ft|7|in|m|1}}. She was powered by two [[General Electric]] [[gear]]ed [[steam turbine]]s that developed a total of {{convert|46000|shp|lk=in}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}}. Her four [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] or [[Foster Wheeler]] [[water-tube boiler]]s generated the [[superheated steam]] needed for the turbines.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=465}} The ship's design incorporated a new generation of land-based propulsion machinery. Boiler pressures capable of reaching 600{{nbsp}}PSI (pounds per square inch) powered high-pressure turbines with double reduction gears, making it possible for the ship's turbines to run faster and more efficiently than previous destroyer designs.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=88}} ''Tucker'' carried a maximum of {{convert|523|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], with a range of {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. Her peacetime complement was 158 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=465}} The wartime complement increased to approximately 250 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn |Roscoe|1953| p=20}}

Like the other destroyers in the ''Mahan'' class, ''Tucker'' had a tripod [[foremast]] and a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft [[Field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], the tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=88}} In silhouette, the ship was similar to the larger {{sclass-|Porter|destroyer|4}} that immediately preceded her.{{sfn |Reilly|1983| p=28}} She was fitted with emergency diesel generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier destroyers. Gun crew shelters were built fore and aft for the superimposed weapons. A third quadruple set of torpedo tubes was added, with one mount on the centerline and two in the side positions. This required relocating one [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun]] to the aft deckhouse.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=88}}

The main battery of ''Tucker'' consisted of five 5&quot;/38 caliber guns, equipped with the MK{{nbsp}}33 gun [[fire control system]].{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=465}} Each gun was [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]], configured for surface and aerial targets.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=88}} The ship's [[anti-aircraft]] battery had four water-cooled [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s.{{sfn |Hodges|Friedman|1979| p=111}}  The ship was fitted with three quadruple torpedo-tube mounts for twelve {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]]es, guided by the MK{{nbsp}}27 torpedo fire-control system.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=465}} [[Depth charge]] roll-off racks were rigged on the stern of the ship.{{sfn |Friedman|1982| p=86}} In early 1942 the Navy began to refit the ''Mahan''-class destroyers with new anti-aircraft armament, although most of the class was not refitted until sometime in 1944.{{sfn |Hodges|Friedman|1979| p=145}}

==Service history==
[[File:USS Tucker.jpg|thumb|''Tucker'' rigged with sails, June 1940]]
''Tucker'', one of the 18 ships constructed in the ''Mahan''-class design,{{sfn |Conway's|1980| pp=125–126}} was built at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. She was the second vessel to be named for Samuel Tucker, who had been an officer in both the Continental Navy and the United States Navy. ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid down on 15 August 1934. She was launched on 26 February 1936 and christened by Mrs.{{nbsp}}Leonard Thorner (relationship unknown). The ship was commissioned in the United States Navy on 23 July 1936, with Lieutenant Commander George T. Howard in command.
Following her shakedown cruise in the western [[Atlantic]], ''Tucker'' joined the destroyer forces attached to the United States Battle Fleet based in San Diego, California. As part of Destroyer Squadron{{nbsp}}3, Destroyer Division{{nbsp}}6, she operated with the Battle Force along the west coast and in the Hawaiian Islands.{{sfn |NHHC}}

In February 1939 she took part in [[Fleet Problem XX]], the naval exercise in the Caribbean that was observed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] aboard the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Houston|CA-30|2}}. As the international situation in the [[Pacific]] worsened, the fleet was ordered to return to Hawaiian waters in the early part of 1940.{{sfn |NHHC}} During fleet exercises around [[Wake Island]] in June 1940, ''Tucker'' buttressed her fuel supply by rigging sails, allowing the ship to proceed at over three knots. She maintained her steerage and lingered on station for several days.{{sfn |Reilly|1983| p=30}} ''Tucker'' operated between the West Coast and Hawaii through the end of the year. On 14 February 1941, she arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] from San Diego, and then proceeded to New Zealand, arriving at [[Auckland]] on 17 March for a goodwill tour. Returning to Pearl Harbor from the South Pacific, she took part in routine exercises at sea before returning to her home port of San Diego on 19 September. After a short stay, ''Tucker'' steamed to Hawaii as part of Task Force{{nbsp}}19 and began operating again in the Hawaiian Islands in November 1941. Shortly afterwords, she put in to Pearl Harbor for an overhaul by a [[destroyer tender]].{{sfn |NHHC}}

When the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Tucker'' was moored at berth X-9, East Loch, along with four other destroyers and one destroyer tender: {{USS|Selfridge|DD-357|2}}, {{USS|Case|DD-370|2}}, {{USS|Reid|DD-369|2}}, {{USS|Conyngham|DD-371|2}}, and {{USS|Whitney|AD-4|2}}. None of the ships sustained any damage. While all the destroyers were undergoing overhaul, they still managed to open fire on the attacking Japanese aircraft.{{sfn |Roscoe|1953| pp=47–48}} After completing her overhaul, ''Tucker'' patrolled off Pearl Harbor, escorted convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii and then steamed to the South Pacific. With the reinforcement of United States island bases in the Pacific, ''Tucker'' escorted the [[auxiliary ship]] {{USS|Wright|AV-1|2}} to [[Tutuila]], [[American Samoa]], as part of the drive to fortify these outposts. The destroyer then escorted her charge to [[Suva]], [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], and proceeded to [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]]. Steaming on for Australia, she arrived at [[Sydney]] on 27 April. After taking on fuel, she visited [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] before heading back to Sydney. With ''Wright'', ''Tucker'' returned to Suva, arriving on 3 June 1942. For the remainder of June and into the first week of July, ''Tucker'' operated out of Suva; then relieved the cruiser {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} on 10 July to carry out convoy escort duties. On 30 July, the ship arrived at [[Auckland]] and the following day steamed for Suva in the Fiji Islands.{{sfn |NHHC}}

==Fate==
[[Image:DD-374 sunk 5Aug1942 EspirituSanto NAN09-10-86.jpg|thumb|USS ''Tucker'' sinking at Bruat Channel on 5 August 1942]]
Docked at Suva, ''Tucker'' received orders to escort the cargo ship SS ''Nira Luckenbach'' to [[Espiritu Santo]], [[New Hebrides]]. On 1 August 1942, the ships left Suva by a route north of [[Efate Island]] and west of [[Malekula Island]]. Making their way through the Bruat Channel, both ships set courses to enter the Segond Channel on the final leg of their voyage.{{sfn |NHHC}} On 4 August, ''Tucker'' was leading the cargo ship into the harbor at Espirtu Santo. As the destroyer headed into the western entrance, she struck a [[Naval mine|mine]]. The mine exploded, nearly tearing her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] in two at the No.{{nbsp}}1 stack, killing all three crew members on watch in the forward fireroom. The rest of the ship's company survived. USS ''Tucker'' slowly settled in the water. ''Nira Luckenbach'' and other vessels quickly rescued the destroyermen from their sinking ship. The stern of the ''Tucker'' sank the following morning and a diving party scuttled and sank the bow.{{sfn |Roscoe|1953| p=165}} ''Tucker'' had steamed into the Segundo Channel unaware that the minelayers ''Gamble'', ''Breese'', and ''Tracy'' had laid a field of mines at its western entrance. An investigation revealed that ''Tucker'' had been given no information regarding the existence of the minefield.{{sfn |Rohwer|2005| p=184}} She was struck from the Navy list on 2 December 1944.{{sfn |NHHC}}

The wreck site &quot;resembles an underwater junkyard&quot;;{{sfn |Stone|1997| p=79}} the wreck itself was ransacked by [[Marine salvage|salvors]] both military and private, who removed equipment and valuable metals and did great damage to the ship: &quot;the vessel was torn limb from limb in the attempt to remove brass portholes, copper piping and heat exchangers&quot;. Later, sports divers looked for keepsakes. The wreck is in poor state: the two engines are at some distance from it, rubble is everywhere, and it is only barely recognizable as the ''Tucker''.{{sfn |Gerken|2013}} A more attractive dive nearby is the wreck of {{SS|President Coolidge}},{{sfn |Jackson|2008| p=190}} which sank in the same minefield within three months of ''Tucker'',{{sfn |Gerken|2013}} though it is noted that the wreck of ''Tucker'' and MV ''Henry Bonneaud'' &quot;ensure variety&quot;.{{sfn |Jackson|2008| p=190}}

==Honors==
''Tucker'' received one [[battle star]] for her [[World War II]] service.{{sfn |NHHC}}
