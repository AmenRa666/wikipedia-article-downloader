As a [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], Bailey served in the Municipal Police Commission of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] and [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]], until he resigned to take another post in December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ragdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nUMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4353,4166976&amp;dq=caleb-bailey+marine&amp;hl=en Governor Appoints Col.

Bailey commanded [[Marine Aircraft Group 11]] in the [[Palau]]s, which provided [[close air support]] to the [[81st Infantry Division (United States)|81st Infantry Division]] and [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] during the [[Pacific War|War in the Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/pacific-war-%E2%80%93-1941-1945 The Pacific War – 1941-1945: Peleliu], ''Marine Corps Gazette'', November 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/forum/wwii?page=1 Naval War in the Pacific in 1944], ''Marine Corps Gazette'', March 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; While group commander of MAG-11 at [[Peleliu]], his pilots of [[VMF-122]] began what they called &quot;Operation Freeze&quot;. In these missions, a single [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]] flew at 30,000 to 33,000 feet to practice high-altitude operations, which also had the side benefits of drawing ineffective Japanese [[anti-aircraft artillery]] fire (thereby wasting their ammunition stores), and creating ten gallons of chocolate [[ice cream]]. The field-expedient dessert was made from a concoction of [[evaporated milk|canned milk]] and [[cocoa solids|cocoa powder]] stored in an underwing tank, which froze during flight at the high altitude. According to the book ''Corsair: The F4U in World War II and Korea'', Bailey called the unit and told them, &quot;You guys aren't fooling me, I've got spies. You tell Hunter I'm coming over there tomorrow and get my ration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett Tillman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JqRIaIn1LFgC ''Corsair: The F4U in World War II and Korea''], pp. 85&amp;ndash;86, Naval Institute Press, 2002, ISBN 1-55750-994-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
