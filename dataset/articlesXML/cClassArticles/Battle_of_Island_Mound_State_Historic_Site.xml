The '''Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site''' is located in a rural area of [[Bates County, Missouri|Bates County]], [[Missouri]], in the western part of the state. The site was established in 2012 to preserve the area of the [[American Civil War]] [[Skirmish at Island Mound|battle]] that took place in October 28-29, 1862 between [[Union Army|Union]] forces and Confederate guerrillas. The battle was significant as the first time African-American troops on the Union side engaged enemy white troops in the Civil War.&lt;ref name=Battle/&gt; A ''[[New York Times]]'' correspondent reported on the battle; the headline noted the &quot;desperate bravery&quot; of the African Americans in achieving Union victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;/&gt;

This area was active with guerrillas and raiding parties from either side. In this conflict, the Union forces were mainly the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored)]] with supporting elements of the [[5th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry]]; they opposed a much larger, mounted force of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[guerrillas]], who were supplemented with elements of the pro-Confederate [[Missouri State Guard]].&lt;ref name=MSHS/&gt; 

==The site==
The historic site is located approximately eight miles southwest of [[Butler, Missouri]], a short distance off State Highway K. The 40-acre site is near the battle location, which is located on private property one-half mile to the south.&lt;ref name=General/&gt; It encompasses much of the Toothman homestead, which was commandeered by the Union troops, fortified with temporary [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] and christened &quot;Fort Africa.&quot; It is believed to include the graves of the eight Union men who died in the battle, although their remains have not yet been located.&lt;ref name=General/&gt; 

The site offers visitors hiking and picnic opportunities and is strictly a &quot;day use&quot; facility open from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref name=MSHS/&gt; A central kiosk provides information about the battle and is adjacent to a .6&amp;nbsp;mile looping trail.&lt;ref name=Access/&gt; Visitors will find the &quot;Courage Monument&quot; and several interpretive panels at various points along the trail.&lt;ref name=Access/&gt; A picnic shelter, which can accommodate up to fifty, a toilet facility, and drinking fountain are located near the kiosk.&lt;ref name=Access/&gt; 

Although the battle was covered by a ''New York Times'' correspondent, who praised the &quot;desperate bravery&quot; of the black soldiers, the site and the battle were largely forgotten in the post-bellum period. Much historical research since the late 20th century has documented and interpreted African-American history. In addition, with the approach of the American Civil War sesquicentennial, interest was rekindled. The state of Missouri acquired the land in order to preserve as much of this notable site as possible. Dedication ceremonies were held for the site on October 26–27, 2012, nearly 150&amp;nbsp;years to the day of the battle.&lt;ref name=dedication/&gt; 

In May 2013, the site was accepted into the [[National Park Service]]'s &quot;National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom,&quot; a series of locations deemed to be significant to African-American history in their struggle for freedom, including the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref name=Freedom/&gt;

==The battle==
{{main|Skirmish at Island Mound}}

During the [[Skirmish at Island Mound|Battle of Island Mound]] (aka &quot;Battle of Fort Toothman&quot; or &quot;Fort Africa&quot;) on October 28–29, 1862, the Union [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored)|1st Kansas Colored Volunteers]]—composed of former [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]] slaves—and a scouting team of Cherokee and blacks from the [[5th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry|5th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry]] engaged a numerically superior force of Confederate guerrillas and recent Missouri State Guard recruits led by [[Jeremiah V. Cockrell|Vard Cockrell]] and Bill Truman (who was related to future President [[Harry S. Truman]]. The Union forces had crossed into Missouri on a mission to clear Confederate guerrillas from their base known as &quot;Hog Island&quot; in the [[Osage River]].&lt;ref name=Battle/&gt; 

Finding themselves outnumbered in an early sortie, the Union troops commandeered and fortified the homestead of Confederate guerrilla Enoch John Toothman, and a one-day siege ensued. Part of the regiment was caught out on the tall-grass prairie by mounted Confederate guerrillas. They stood their ground through several volleys of gunfire and a cavalry charge, before the Confederates withdrew from the area on October 29. Union casualties were relatively light: Union losses were seven enlisted men (six African Americans: Corp. Joseph Talbot, Privates Samuel Davis, Thomas Lane, Marlon Barber, Allen Rhodes, Henry Gash, all of Co F; Cherokee John Six-Killer of Seaman's Battalion) and Captain A.G. Crew of Co. A.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;/&gt; Confederate losses are estimated at more than thirty.&lt;ref name=General/&gt; 

The clash was significant as the first time African-American troops engaged Confederate forces during the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabor/&gt; It was covered by a correspondent of the ''[[New York Times]]'' who was with the regiment, and he praised the men's &quot;desperate bravery.&quot; He also noted that Bill Truman had told men in Butler that the blacks had fought &quot;like tigers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/19/news/affairs-west-negro-regiment-action-battle-island-mounds-desperate-bravery-negros.html?emc=eta1 &quot;AFFAIRS IN THE WEST.; A Negro Regiment in Action--The Battle of Island Mounds--Desperate Bravery of the Negros--Defeat of the Guerrillas--An Attempted Fraud&quot;], ''New York Times,'' 19 November 1862, accessed 22 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was also covered by ''[[Harper's Weekly]].'' Such positive reports provided encouragement to other African-American units that were forming across the northern states and petitioning the Union government to fight in combat.&lt;ref name=General/&gt; The [[United States Colored Troops]] were established, contributing critical fighting and support to the Union effort.
