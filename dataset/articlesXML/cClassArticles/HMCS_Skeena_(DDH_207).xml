'''HMCS ''Skeena'' ''' was a {{sclass-|St. Laurent|destroyer}} that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and later the [[Canadian Forces]] from 1957-1993. ''Skeena'' was constructed as a [[destroyer escort]] and was converted in the 1960s to a helicopter-carrying destroyer. In 1972, the ship was designated a French Language Unit, the second in Canadian service.&lt;ref name=hadley&gt;Hadley et al., p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; Discarded in 1994, the ship was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in India.

==Design and description==
[[File:Canadian ships at Yokosuka in 1958.jpg|thumb|left| Two ''St. Laurent''-class destroyers in their original configuration]]
The need for the ''St. Laurent'' class came about in 1949 when Canada joined [[NATO]] and the [[Cold War]] was in its infancy. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was assigned responsibility for [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) and controlling sea space in the western [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. The ''St Laurent'' class were built to an operational requirement much like that which produced the British Type 12, and were powered by the same machinery plant. The rounded deck-edge forward was adopted to prevent ice forming.&lt;ref name=f1&gt;Friedman, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were designed to operate in harsh Canadian conditions. They were built to counter [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]], [[biological warfare|biological]] and [[chemical warfare|chemical]] attack conditions, which led to a design with a rounded hull, a continuous main deck, and the addition of a pre-wetting system to wash away contaminants. The living spaces on the ship were part of a &quot;citadel&quot; which could be sealed off from contamination for the crew safety. The ships were sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Cadillac]]s&quot; for their relatively luxurious crew compartments; these were also the first Canadian warships to have a bunk for every crew member since previous warship designs had used [[hammock]]s.&lt;ref name=barrie9&gt;Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

As built, the ships were {{convert|366|ft|m}} [[Length overall|long overall]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|42|ft|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|13|ft|2|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=barrie17&gt;Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer escorts [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|2263|t|LT}} standard and {{convert|2800|t|LT}} at deep load.&lt;ref name=barrie17/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Conway's'' says 2000 tons standard displacement, 2600 deep load.&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer escorts had a crew of 12 officers and 237 enlisted.&lt;ref name=barrie17/&gt;

===Armament===
The ''St. Laurent'' class was fitted with twin [[3″/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|0}}/L50]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns in two mounts for engaging both surface and air targets. The ships were also fitted with two single-mounted [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}]] guns.&lt;ref name=barrie17/&gt; The class's anti-submarine armament consisted of a pair of triple-barreled Mk. NC 10 [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] ASW mortars in a stern well. The stern well had a roller top to close it off from following seas. As with the British Type 12 design, the provision for long-range homing [[torpedo]]es (in this case BIDDER [Mk 20E] or the US Mark 35 were included. However, they were never fitted.&lt;ref name=f1/&gt;

===Machinery===
The vessels of the ''St. Laurent'' class had two [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] water tube boilers installed.&lt;ref name=barrie17/&gt; The steam produced by these boilers was directed at two geared [[steam turbine]]s which powered two shafts, providing {{convert|30,000|shp|kW|lk=on|order=flip}} to drive the ship at a maximum speed of {{convert|28.5|knot|km/h|lk=in|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Blackman, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The ships had an endurance of {{convert|4570|nmi|km}} at {{convert|12|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=barrie17/&gt;

===DDH conversion===
Following successful trials aboard the [[frigate]] {{HMCS|Buckingham|K685|2}} and [[sister ship]] {{HMCS|Ottawa|DDH 229|2}}, plans to convert the ''St. Laurent'' class took shape.&lt;ref name=&quot;soward63&quot;&gt;Soward 1995, pp. 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;readyayeready.com&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.readyayeready.com/timeline/1960s/beartrap/index.htm |title=The Beartrap - A Canadian Invention |magazine=The Crowsnest |volume=17 |number=3 |date=March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackman, pp. 35, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Th development of the [[beartrap (helicopter device)|beartrap]], installed in {{HMCS|Assiniboine|DDH 234|2}} during her 1962-63 conversion, finalized the concept. By keeping the aircraft secure, the beartrap eliminated the need for deck handling from landing to the hangar, or from hangar to takeoff.&lt;ref name=&quot;readyayeready.com&quot;/&gt;

In the conversion to a helicopter-carrying vessel, ''Skeena'' was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fueling facilities for the helicopter and activated fin stabilizers installed. The fin stabilizers were to reduce roll in rough weather during helicopter operations.&lt;ref name=Barrie12&gt;Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; All seven ''St Laurent''s were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). The single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels to permit the forward extension of the helicopter hangar.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; To make room for the helicopter deck, the aft 3-inch mount and one of the Limbos were removed.&lt;ref name=Barrie12/&gt;&lt;ref name=cg&gt;Chumbley &amp; Gardiner, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The two 40 mm guns were also removed.&lt;ref name=cg/&gt; Following the conversion, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to {{convert|3051|t|LT}}.&lt;ref name=barrie17/&gt;

===DELEX program===

In the late 1970s, under the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program was commissioned to upgrade ten of the ''St. Laurent''-class ships with new electronics, machinery, and hull upgrades and repairs. However, only enough was done to keep the ships in service into the late 1980s. For the ''St. Laurent''s, this meant hull and machinery repairs only.&lt;ref&gt;Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:HMCS Skeena (DDH 207) MIKAN 4821372.jpg|thumb|left|HMCS ''Skeena'' commissioning, 1957]]
''Skeena'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] by [[Burrard Yarrows]] at [[Vancouver]] on 1 June 1951. The vessel was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 August 1952 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 March 1957, initially carrying the [[Hull classification symbol (Canada)|hull number]] DDE 207, as a [[destroyer escort]].&lt;ref name=M1&gt;Macpherson &amp; Barrie (2002), p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

After commissioning, ''Skeena'' was assigned to the [[Second Canadian Escort Squadron]] based out of [[CFB Esquimalt|Esquimalt, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=g&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=728&amp;dat=19580703&amp;id=xpZNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oEEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1320,4691783|title=Canadian Ships at Saigon |work=The St. Maurice Valley Chronicle |date=3 July 1958 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=barrie32&gt;Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Canadian Escort Squadron departed on a training cruise around the Pacific in January 1958, returning on 2 April.&lt;ref name=barrie32/&gt; On 29 January 1962, ''Skeena'' accidentally shelled an American village in the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]. As one of four ships practicing their gunnery, some of the shrapnel from the ship's guns fell on [[Clallam Bay, Washington]]. The commander of the warship, Richard H. Leir, faced a court-martial for the event.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19620221&amp;id=YH9OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VEsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6162,1884685 |work=Ellensburg Daily Record |title=Wild shot by destroyer has trial aftermath |date=21 February 1962 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later convicted.&lt;ref name=g2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19620312&amp;id=VVVYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5056,2611022 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |title=Naval Officer Convicted |date=12 March 1962 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Skeena'' underwent conversion to a destroyer helicopter escort (DDH) beginning in 1964 by [[Davie Shipbuilding]] at [[Lauzon, Quebec]]. The vessel exited the yard and was recommissioned as a DDH with the hull number DDH 207 on 14 August 1965.&lt;ref name=M1/&gt; Following re-entry into service, the ship joined the [[Third Canadian Escort Squadron]] at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=barrie32/&gt;

In 1972, ''Skeena'' was designated a French Language Unit (FLU), replacing ''Ottawa''.&lt;ref name=hadley/&gt; A French Language Unit was a Canadian Forces designation where French was to be the primarily spoken language to encourage career opportunities for Canadian Francophones.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley et al., pp. 310-12&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] which were held in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the vessel was among those assigned to provide security.&lt;ref name=M1/&gt;

''Skeena'' was selected by the Canadian Forces for the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program and completed this refit on 20 November 1981 at Montreal. However, the ship only began [[sea trials]] with the modifications on 4 January 1982. In May 1985, ''Skeena'' deployed as part of [[STANAVFORLANT]], [[NATO]]'s standing naval fleet. On 24-26 May, ''Skeena'' and {{USS|Richard F. Byrd|DDG-23|6}} tracked a [[Soviet]] task force off the coast of Portugal.&lt;ref name=barrie32/&gt; During the summer of 1991, the ship participated in the NATO naval exercise Ocean Safari 91. She was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] from active service in the Canadian Forces on 1 November 1993. ''Skeena'' was sold in 1994 and broken up in India in 1996.&lt;ref name=M1/&gt;
