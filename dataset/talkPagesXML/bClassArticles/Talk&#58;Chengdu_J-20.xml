Where does this call sign J-20 comes from there are no official statements on the plane what so ever ? Is everthing in this article and the sources that it rely's on just speculations ?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.118.168.93|213.118.168.93]] ([[User talk:213.118.168.93|talk]]) 10:15, 24 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Why is the [[F-18 Hornet|F-18]] called the F-18? Why not W-18? Why not Z-18? Why not the &quot;Mega-Thruster 18000(TM)&quot;? It would sound much more cool that way. ''--is what I would like to say.'' In essence, that would be using the same logic that you've shown me. If the Chinese call their plane the 歼-20, does there have to be a reason for it? Why did [[Bill Clinton]]'s parents name him &quot;Bill&quot;? Why not &quot;Tony&quot;? Why did Sony release the [[PlayStation]]? Shouldn't it be better called the &quot;GamerTron-XTREME&quot;?

Why should anybody use a crude translation of the Chinese term?  The Chinese will use the Chinese form and The West will use J-20 or whatever.  Yes we do have to work from imperfect sources like People's Daily, PressTV or even Fox.  The fix is to test sources against each other, understand their limitations and not reach too far ahead of ourselves.  We can indeed include links to sources that claim more than we report here. [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 15:52, 24 April 2011 (UTC)
:But where does the term &quot;J-20&quot; as used in the west come from? Who made it up? Inevitably the Chinese did. &quot;J&quot; is the initial for &quot;Jian&quot; (歼), which means fighter aircraft. Did you think NATO made the term up or something? It's the same reason why the [[Xian H-6]] is called the &quot;H-6&quot;: &quot;H&quot; is the initial for &quot;Hong&quot; (轰), which means &quot;bomber&quot; in Chinese.
:Plus, nowhere in the article does it say that the world-recognised callsign for the plane in English is &quot;Annihilator Twenty&quot;. It merely says that it's a literal translation of the Chinese name that is 歼二十 (or 歼-20). The &quot;literal&quot; variable is a part of [[Template:Zh]], and as you can see in all China-related articles, it is standard procedure to provide, more or less, the [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Traditional Chinese]], [[Pinyin]] and literal meaning of Chinese terms, as seen at [[Beijing]], [[Chengdu J-10]], [[Xian H-6]], [[Zhonghua Minzu]], [[Ten thousand years]], [[Tianxia]], [[Three Principles of the People]], [[Battle of Taiyuan]], et cetera, through the use of [[Template:Zh]]. In fact, practically all China-related articles begin with their first sentence with [[Template:Zh]] somewhere. --&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid yellow;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:benlisquare|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#FFFF00;background:red;&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;李博杰&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;small&gt;—[[User talk:benlisquare|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|contribs]] [[Special:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|email]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:01, 24 April 2011 (UTC)

==Radar==
Does this aircraft have an e-scan radar or a conventional mechanically scanned one? Or is its radar capability totally &quot;anticipated&quot; at this stage? Does it have FLIR? In fact has it got any sensors? Thanks. [[User:Wittlessgenstein|Wittlessgenstein]] ([[User talk:Wittlessgenstein|talk]]) 22:57, 11 March 2011 (UTC)

:Yes it has sensors.  It's got those little air probe things poking out of it.  But these are expected to be removed on the production aircraft.  My question is does it have a wet wing?  Just look at how thin the main wing is.  [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 23:03, 11 March 2011 (UTC)

==Very poor quality article compared to other aviation topics==
Half the content is criticism about the topic or otherwise POV opinions while the other is unverified speculation. Hcobb seems to be singularly responsible as he is responsible for most of the edits while simultaneously providing all of the POV comments on the talk page. The entire article needs to be rewritten or at least flagged with an NPOV dispute.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.65.64.254|69.65.64.254]] ([[User talk:69.65.64.254|talk]]) 03:15, 13 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:What the article lacks in quality is made up for in quantity (It sucks, I know... but its all that is available right now).  There are several sources and opinions on the fighter from numerous locations that vary from calling the fighter a direct challenge to US air dominance, to calling it an utter piece of crap.  The article is composed of speculation because up to this point only speculation exist.  Perhaps it would be helpful to state at the beginning of the article that it is composed largely of speculation and analysis that is likely to change.
Also, Hcobb's contributions are taken from both sides of the spectrum and everything added to this article is monitored and edited by a fairly large group of users.  It would be difficult to prove that one users POV is being pushed throughout the article. -[[User:Nem1yan|Nem1yan]] ([[User talk:Nem1yan|talk]]) 04:29, 14 March 2011 (UTC)

==Need a source for the engines==
According to all the information I can find, China has been reluctant to integrate the WS-10A onto their current fighters yet this one is supposed to be flying with the WS-10&lt;strike&gt;BCDEF&lt;/strike&gt;G?  Also, since most sources I've found list the aircraft in the +60,000 lb/f class the WS-10A seems to be the correct engine to use. -[[User:Nem1yan|Nem1yan]] ([[User talk:Nem1yan|talk]]) 13:25, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

:Why are you conflating the engines troubles they have today with an aircraft design that is realistically more than a decade from completion? The Chinese are sure to make great leaps forwards in engine production by the time they've got the rest of their canards in a row. [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 14:15, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

::Yeah, it needs to be sourced regardless.  If I changed the Raptor's engines to 45,000 lb/f based on a future upgrade that no one had ever heard of there would be a problem.  Yes speculation is helpful sometimes but lets not forget that we can leave certain specs blank if we, lets face it, have no information. -[[User:Nem1yan|Nem1yan]] ([[User talk:Nem1yan|talk]]) 17:31, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

==Lenght==
In the article it states that the plane is 23m long but in the specs it just 19m which is correct ?
And how does the sources know this since there are no official statements on the specs ?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.118.168.93|213.118.168.93]] ([[User talk:213.118.168.93|talk]]) 10:09, 24 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==The article is basically crap==
Looks to me the article is written by someone with some serious inferiority complexity towards China and Chinese.

There is no solid evdience about technical transfer occured in this fighter, all from baseless funny soap-grapes claims with no evidence.

There is also no Chinese side of story shown in the article, mostly from the west soap grapse who can not accept that Chinese are simply smarter than them thus can get things done way quicker.

Check the PAK-FA's wiki article, and you can clearly see there is no place for such splectations (You know the American Airforce generals dont think very high about PAK-FA, and nobody put a full sections covering these american generals' POVs).

Basically the article is a piece of crap, first, tech-transfer section is based on pure sepelcations, thus should be removed completely, seconldy, some editors of this article, namely, Hubb somethings,  obviously has a strong POV, most likely, sourced from his deeply rooted inferiority complex, should be banned from edit this article.

Just a note about the 1st flight test date: 2011-01-11. This is not any offense to any american, it's just simply a nice date. Chinese people are very meticulous when they elect the date for something important, studying if it is an auspicious date or not. They like dates like &quot;11/1/11&quot;, or &quot;8/8/8&quot; (remember olympics?). It sounds as the project leaders have thougth about making its first test on a good date, while it is not as significant to inform prime minister...  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/195.77.16.215|195.77.16.215]] ([[User talk:195.77.16.215|talk]]) 12:13, 4 August 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Yeah, this article is seriously POVed.  From the POV of a neutral observer (myself), you'd think that a pack of editors with a massive chip on their shoulders descended upon this page and set out to systematically destroy the rep of this aircraft based solely on speculation.  The 'calls' from the most vocal editors on this page for people to 'contribute' their own speculation as a means to ameliorate their own blatant biases does less than nothing to hide their POV slants that are spread all over this page.  It's so blatant it makes this article somewhat surreal in the volume of negativity heaped upon the aircraft, and all based on completely unsubstantiated speculation that just happened to be uttered by someone perceived to be important yet no less ignorant than any other commoner, and BAM! it gets highlighted and slapped onto this page like it was Gospel.  This article is just sad.

NO F-22 is clearly 1000 times better than j-20. And if there was a war between the lying Chinese and the US and her allies,F-22 will quickly annihilate the J-20. I guess that is why it is called annihilator 20. And it is obvious that the Chinese stole the info about F-22 and F-35 and than lied. I don't know why the stupid american congress is ordering the weak F-35 that will get torn apart. The US Military should have atleast 750 raptors to win a war. 1 F-22=20 F-35s. 1 F-22=3 J-20(Im not American.)

:::Yes, good enough. Feel free add it, Hcobb. This comes from a reputable news agency, has received broad coverage, and is much more informative than the speculation already present in that section. There are ''no'' policies on Wikipedia that say something has to be definitive to be added to an article. That's a rule someone with an agenda invented. When we're dealing with military technology, especially top secret matters, rarely is anything definitive. If military analysts speculate that there was transfer of technology, that's about as good as it will get. It isn't as if the Chinese would come out and admit if this were the case. 

Looks like we need to site the truth in tech transfer and espionage:  http://www.defensetech.org/2016/03/23/chinese-man-pleads-guilty-to-hacking-us-military-aircraft-data/ jrn-hsv 17:07, 31 March 2016 (UTC)

==The J in J-5/6/7/8/10/20==
*For the laymen out there, please note that:
#[[Fighter aircraft]] = [[:zh:战斗机]] is the term used by the Chinese speaking world-at-large while '''[[:zh:歼击机]] is the term used mainly in mainland China and is often transliterated as &quot;Annihilator&quot; instead of &quot;Fighter&quot;.'''
#[[Interceptor aircraft]] = [[:zh:拦截机]] is the term used by the Chinese speaking world-at-large while '''[[:zh:截击机]] is the term used mainly in mainland China'''

Another good example to illustrate this type of subtle difference is:
#[[Aircraft]] = [[:zh:航空器]]
#[[Airplane]] = [[:zh:飞机]]

Since this article is about a '''China-made aircraft''', it naturally has to follow their naming method. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Dave1185|&lt;font face=&quot;Rage Italic&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;color:#000000;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Italic;color:black&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:Dave1185|♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫®]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 02:20, 16 June 2011 (UTC)

:These were my concerns. 
# The article needs some grammar copyediting in places, possibly - I misread the one spot I thought was obvious, though, so I'm removing that tag.
# &quot;Globalsecurity.org states that China probably declined to participate in joint development and production of a new fifth-generation fighter with Russia&quot; - smells of [[WP:WEASEL|weasel wording]]. This is borderline though. Is there a way to say it better without &quot;probably&quot;?
# Biggest concern...well, I'm going to catch flak for this one, I'm sure. But it's the big, bold &quot;Annhiliator-20&quot; at the top of the page. I looked at a variety of other Chinese aircraft pages. Only three that I saw defined their designation beyond just &quot;letter-number&quot; - the J-10, J-20, and (oddly) the [[Shaanxi Y-9]]. The other J- aircraft don't explain that &quot;J for Jian&quot;, which seems rather like saying &quot;F-16, meaning Fighter-16&quot;. and the Y-9 doesn't define the term beyond &quot;Yun-9&quot;. Including &quot;Annhilator-10&quot; and &quot;Annhilator-20&quot;, in bold, italic letters in the lede of the two most recent Chinese fighter aircraft looks very, very much like [[WP:PEACOCK|peacocking]] that &quot;our fighter is badder than yours&quot;, I'm afraid.

Kopp's not uninformed and does get some things right, but he also has an axe to grind for the F-22 (and various proposals for souped up F-111s) and often engages in fairly out-there speculation so stuff he self-publishes on his website shouldn't be considered a useful source.

== Merger proposal ==

The relationship between J-XX and J-20 is the same as that of Airbus A3XX and A380.  Now that the designation of China's fifth generation aircraft is known, the J-XX designation and the J-XX page is not needed anymore.  The J-XX page is also redundant since its content is clearly talking about the J-20.  These are two main reasons why the two articles should be merged.  I propose that the entire J-XX's History section to be merged into J-20's Development sub-section.

:That isn't the case even though I understand why you may think so.  The J-XX page describes a joint-effort by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) and Shengyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) to design a fifth generation fighter.  This joint-effort can't be the J-31 because the J-31 is SAC's own project.  What's more, J-31 as a real project is unknown and not predicted by the West until the first aircraft piece was spotted on the road.  In other words, J-XX couldn't be referring to the J-31 at all and it was not the original intention of the J-XX page to mention anything about the J-31.  J-XX has always been a designation referring to '''the''' fifth generation fighter from China, not a blanket term for all of China's fifth generation fighter projects.

== Let's find a better photo of the J-20 ==

Was wondering if we could find a better photo of the J-20.  The plane has been flying around for a while, so the artists' impression is slightly out of date.  Here's a site with some fairly new pictures:

:::I think that the fact the some people have been taking pictures means it would fail the non-free content rules, it means in theory that somebody could take a free image, or be asked to release an image as free.

::::I doubt that we can come across a free-license image in the near future, for a variety of reasons. Due to the rarity of the J-20 and other developmental aircraft from appearing, money is always a factor for photographers, and in most cases copyright holders choose to sell the photographs for money, instead of releasing it under a free license such as Creative Commons. One of the limitations of &quot;free content&quot; is that one really has to be a ''libre'' content enthusiast to be willingly give away for free something which they could make plenty of spare cash with. Not everyone in the world is a [[Richard Stallman]], and it's quite natural for people to seek profits out of their work. I am personally acquainted with a university student from Tianjin who is a hobbyist photographer and an aircraft enthusiast; he has taken photographs of the [[Shenyang J-31]] and sold them to establishments such as [[Reuters]] and various others. Many of the J-31 images you see in magazines were actually taken by him. If you're going to be enthusiastic about taking photographs of aircraft to the point of spending thousands of yuan to take planes and trains to airshows, it's almost natural to want to make a bit of cash out of it. Just my two cents. --[[User:benlisquare|&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid yellow;padding:1px;color:#FFFF00;background:red;&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;李博杰&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &amp;#124; &lt;small&gt;—[[User talk:benlisquare|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|contribs]] [[Special:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|email]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:35, 2 January 2013 (UTC)

== A 'purported' 5th-gen fighter ==

'Purported' in the cited link here:

www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/01/04/351462/long-march-chinas-fifth-generation-fighter-is-years.html

refers to the images, not the fighter itself -- now we have verified images, so the word 'purported' in the opening sentence is no longer valid by this citation.

What's more, many publications have referred to the J-20 as a 5th-gen stealth fighter.

If they can't be linked, I'm going to delete them.  First among this is the claim that &quot;there is a belief China can't produce high-powered jet engines.&quot;  By whom?  Who has that belief?

:I think your concern has to do with that particular sentence more than passive languages being used throughout the article.  In my opinion, &quot;there is a belief&quot; is a pretty accurate description on the current situation regarding that particular point of view.  There are some five or six articles in the list of references that repeat the same point of view, and more if you count sources not included within the article.  There are enough authors holding this belief that if you have to mention every single one of them, the article will turn into a summary of who-made-what statements instead of a description of the aircraft.  &quot;There is a belief&quot; conveys the current situation to the reader eloquently.

== Cleaning up specifications section == 
Per [[WP:BOLD]], I've removed numerous speculative specifications. This is a developmental aircraft, and yet the speculations had gone so far as to distinguish prototypes and &quot;production&quot; J-20s, detailing everything from the engines to the operational ceiling and MTOW. It is reasonable to retain approximate specifications derived from photogrammetry --- exterior dimensions, primarily, and obvious things like the number of engines --- though to be honest I do not see any evidence in the references that these calculations were carried out in any systematic way. Please add detailed references if including any additional specifications. Much of the rest of the article (and references therein) is also speculative blog-matter, which should probably be cleaned out.

=== New image ===

As requested per contributing towards Wikipedia, I have provided a new image for the article. I spent several hours searching for a non-commercial image that was not part of some bulletin board or weblog. Ironically, the engines are RUSSIAN!

The engine petals indicates that it is an AL-31 derivative. The image is suitable for encyclopedic content and properly illustrates the specifications and most importantly, the engines used on the image. No other image on the entire public internet, currently, has the level of detail as found.

Also, a detailed fair-use rationale is provided for the image. A summary of the WP:NFCC is provided under &quot;Other information&quot;, and indicates that the image is neither the ownership of a specific web site, nor of &quot;non-commercial only&quot; status. The image falls under the criteria &quot;promotional&quot; as a press release. The image meets the &quot;non-free equivalent&quot; criteria in which it is impossible to properly identify the aircraft's engines and viability by a free version (previous image) with the same effect. The item is of sourced commentary on the Talk page of this article (e.g. speculation on engines), and thanks benlisquare for providing a rational initiative. &lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 06:02, 17 February 2014 (UTC)

* &quot;General He Weirong, Deputy Commander of the People's Liberation Army Air Force said in November 2009 that he expected the J-20 to be operational in 2017–2019.&quot;
:* shortened to: &quot;[which is] expected to be operational in 2017–2019.&quot; while keeping the citations.

* Origin section is speculation, and has contesting claims from various magazines. The claims should be organized by magazine, while keeping a separate paragraph for Chinese sources.

* &quot;The prototype's engine is unknown, but is speculated to be either a AL-31 derivative or a version of the domestic WS-10.&quot;
:* remove unknown, change to &quot;the prototype's engine is speculated to be ...&quot;

:*Project 718 can be moved towards the beginning of the article or under &quot;Origins&quot;, and the general designer sentence can be added to the introduction or placed under &quot;Origins&quot;

* I would like to make a new section called Cybersecurity (rename of technology transfer allegations) and move the F-35 connection to J-20 there. Also, I would like to eventually, within a period of time, move the F-117 crash to the Stealth section and write how it may or may not have improved the design for the Stealth coating. Lastly, the Mig 1.44 section should be placed correctly in Origins. I will probably write about how the F-35 has (or may have) influenced the avionics of the J-20, but I will need a source.

* In the new section called Cybersecurity, I would like to expound the strategic implications of how the compromise of the F-35 it will affect both China and the US, and include views from analysts if possible.

* Regarding the addition of the HAL / FGFA, I promise to include that once the test flight has been conducted later this year.

* Should change the sentence to &quot;uses similar stealth shaping as the F-22.&quot; According to Carlo Kopp from aviation.au:

* The stealth shaping is without doubt considerably better than that seen in the Russian T-50 and, even more so, than the F-35. The design appears to be largely built around the stealth shaping design rules employed in the F-22A Raptor. The nose section and canopy are close in appearance to the F-22, yielding similar signature performance in a mature design.

* Remove dubious sources like wantchinatimes.com, defense-update.com, and defensetech.org that are usually infested with cookies and are regurgitation of other sources. Replace them with accurate, valid sources such those from the jamestown foundation (e.g. think tanks), and those from military reports and intelligence agencies.

* Organize the references so that they are in order with the flow of the article.

* Add one or two videos for reference.

== Origins Section ==

The Origins section can be rewritten, while the separate J-XX article can be improved in a future date. Here are a few versions of introduction of the Origins section:

* The Origins of the J-20 came from the J-XX program which was started in the late 1990s. A proposal from Chengdu Aerospace Corporation, designated “Project 718”, won the PLAAF endorsement in a 2008 competition against a Shenyang proposal that was reportedly even larger than J-20.

* The Origins of the J-20 came from the J-XX program which was started in the late 1990s. Two designs emerged from this program, one from Chengdu designated “Project 718”, and one from Shenyang, which was reportedly even larger than the J-20. In 2008, the Chengdu proposal won PLAAF endorsement in a competition.

* two competing designs ... One from Chengdu designated “Project 718”, and one from Shenyang. The Chengdu design was designated “Project 718”, and won the PLAAF endorsement in a 2008 competition against a Shenyang proposal that was reportedly even larger than J-20.

the first version is better, but the second one has a stronger chronological emphasis. &lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 21:03, 21 February 2014 (UTC)

* Now the next step is for us to write a little more about the Origins. I blanked out the Origins section and transferred the useless information to the J-XX article that should be there instead for reference. I also made some minor corrections in the J-XX article prior to the transfer of content.

* We should keep the article as concise as possible but fresh and informative to aviation experts. Examples that would make it a worthy article is more detail about the 3 different prototypes organized by prototype. that information can be in Origins or in Flight testing, as there is some overlap and ambiguity.

== Supermanueverable ==

there are three articles that strongly suggest that the J-20 is supermaneuverable:

[http://www.andrewerickson.com/2011/01/j-20-fighter-development-outlook-strategic-implications/ &quot;China’s J-20 Fighter: Development Outlook and Strategic Implications.&quot;]

&quot;the aircraft’s front canards and movable tail structure suggests that despite the plane’s size, it would be highly nimble - with appropriately powerful engines.&quot;

&quot;If equipped with suitable engines, a J-20 would be very efficient in supersonic cruise regime&quot;

:* It's not speculative but I'm not going to add anything; it's just not necessary.

Contrary to popular belief to what seems to be advertised on the media, the J-20 is not intended to challenge the F-22. in one of Carlo Kopp's article [http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-090111-1.html 6 roles have been outlined], although the bottom two, EW and ASAT are not really its primary functions. However, to call it just a stealth bomber would be simplistic, because this plane is clearly also designed for air combat.

What could be said about about its role in the greater context of all current and future 5th-generation developments, according to Kopp, &quot;the development of the J-XX represents a well thought out 'symmetrical techno-strategic response' to the United States' deployment of stealth aircraft.&quot; As in, the design of the aircraft took into consideration America's F-22 and F-35 fleets.

== Characteristics Section ==

Just started on the section so I will not be able to add everything at once, including balance.

* &quot;at the cost of being a poor dogfighter.&quot; it should as good as the F-35, but it's unknown what the role of the J-20 will be. More likely a air superiority / stealth interceptor / stealth bomber. Multirole would be the best word. I know you want to indicate that if the J-20 is built for it strike capabilities, it's air-to-air ability will be compromised.

* All the sources however, seem to indicate or at least hint that strike and air-to-air are not mutually self-exclusive. The reason is the canards negates the problems that the F-35 would experience. There's only three major weaknesses in the design - the sides of the stealth shaping, the engines, and the shape of the engines. Of course, the main problem is Quality and integration of the components.

* Aside from the shaping, the other weakness of the J-20, in my opinion, is the holographic HUD and interior, which are components of the avionics and pilot interface. The F-22 has a much better targeting system and interior design; just the quality of the components visually look better.

&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 20:16, 24 February 2014 (UTC)

* So the design weaknesses are twofold, the curvature on the side and the engines, which can be later developed upon in the stealth section (not in Characteristics), followed by two strengths, which are F-35 style DSI incorporated in F-22 intakes, a hybrid between the two, and the missile launch system on how the missile is extracted internally.

&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 00:14, 25 February 2014 (UTC)

== Military Section ==

Although this portion appears to be well-written, there are some problems upon closer analysis:

* the section states that the J-20 is not unlike a &quot;stealth version&quot; of the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, and then shifts that the J-20 will be more similar to a MiG-25 with stealth.

* the Pentagon shifts its tone several times in this article from the J-20 is not a big deal to &quot;a platform capable of long range, penetrating strikes into complex air defense environments.&quot; I think the Morrell statement has got to go because first of all, it's a PR statement, and second, that statement cannot be reconciled once the two portions are merged.

* Carlo Kopp also stated  similarities to the F-111, but he specifies [http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-J-XX-Prototype.html &quot;combat radius class&quot;] of the F-111 and [http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-090111-1.html 6 roles] of the J-20, so somehow we have to reconcile all these roles.

* After we are done elucidating the role of the J-20, we still have to place it into perspective how it is a grand-strategic rather than a tactical piece:
:* &quot;What could be said about about its role in the greater context of all current and future 5th-generation developments, according to Kopp, &quot;the development of the J-XX represents a well thought out 'symmetrical techno-strategic response' to the United States' deployment of stealth aircraft.&quot;

&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 02:21, 27 February 2014 (UTC)

I believe I was able to remove the back and forth speculation, adding much more logical flow and chronological emphasis, although there is one section below that I was not able to fully address. The paragraph listed below doesn't seem have a way to credit the source, because of previous references to Carlo Kopp.

* In the greater context of all current and future 5th-generation fighter developments, according to Kopp, &quot;the development of the J-XX represents a well thought-out 'symmetrical techno-strategic response' to the United States' deployment of stealth aircraft.&quot;

Anyways, I'm finished with the section, and that should be the structure that should be worked with future:

* Chronologically from military intelligence, initial assessments, later assessments, geo-military role, and then finally Pentagon and think tank confirmation.

I've made it easy to insert information. Just place information under the 6 roles of the J-20 paragraph, and the strategic role of the J-20, like information about island chains, etc. If anyone wants to add anything in the future, they can just quote sections without having to edit between older paragraphs.

== Cybersecurity Section ==

I would like to emphasize the importance of letting readers draw their own conclusion on what the plane resembles.

We're not here to bash China, and we should hope that their civilian leadership becomes more sophisticated and pragmatic when it comes to foreign policy and restrictions on their citizens, and that the United States and China should work on areas of common interest and security concerns, although that is not for me to say.

However, there is a possible connection between the J-20 and the F-35, that compromise of the F-35 data occurred at some point, and that the development of the J-20 seems to have benefited from the F-35 program, in my opinion, in the areas of avionics and the targeting system. Of course there are many other areas that may have benefited, but they are convergent principles, at least in theory.

Changes to the section:

* Archiving the information on the F-117 connection. It has no bearing on the current situation, and will only adversely effect how America is perceived. Also, the Pentagon filed a report that stated the development of the J-20 had no connection with the F-117.

* remove the Mig 1.44 Section entirely. (letting readers draw their own conclusion goes both ways)

* discuss the strategic implications of how the compromise of the F-35 will affect both China and the US both politically and militarily. found this information on the F-35 article: &quot;Other sources suggested that the incident caused both hardware and software redesigns to be more resistant to cyber attack.&quot; China's Role In JSF's Spiraling Costs.&quot; ''Aviation Week'', 8 February 2012.

&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 08:21, 28 February 2014 (UTC)

Actually, if any similarity were drawn here to the F-35, that would be breaking our own rule of letting users draw their own conclusions. The problem here is suggestibility.

* What would be just and accurate to reality would be to say that information from the F-35 program was compromised, which may have helped the development of the J-20, and then place citations there, which most academic and policy sources will support.

&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 19:34, 28 February 2014 (UTC)

== Afterthoughts ==

Ok, finished. there is much to be wanting from the article, I wanted to develop more on the ideas of strategy how the J-20 will be used, as well as how the United States has since improved its security systems in light of the F-35 compromise, and how the development of the J-20 will fundamentally change US-China relations. but these ideas never got around because of the sheer time it takes to write new content.

However, I was able to change fundamentally the article from a chaotic state to a unified one, while retaining neutrality. For example, in the Origins, I moved all the content to the J-XX article, paraphrased everything nicely, without any nonsense to cloud the minds of readers.

I've made the Flight testing schedule extremely precise, consistent, with no errors. there are many other tests that were conducted as well that I could've added but I intentionally left those out and focused on the most important flight tests.

The Characteristics section make sense now, for once, that someone new to aviation or an expert can appreciate.

Engines, well, you know they're going to use the WS-15 or AL-41 now, but not before the writing of the article.

As for Stealth, two sentences from Kopp sums it up:

* the J-20 has the potential to yield much better stealth performance from the front and sides than the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and possibly as good as the F-22A Raptor, should Chinese designers master materials and detail design techniques adequately.

* Any notion that an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter or F/A-18E/F Super Hornet will be capable of competing against this Chengdu design in air combat, let alone penetrate airspace defended by this fighter, would be absurd. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet are both aerodynamically and kinematically quite inferior to the as presented J-XX/J-20 design.

I shaved more than 10 kilos of fluff, poor wording, random referencing tags, and assorted comments ranging from unsourced to untrue. I reduced the number of references from 110 to 86, while trying to place emphasis on the good links. I apologize for the back and forth editing, but that was necessary because of the state of disrepair the article was originally in.

As for the picture, I uploaded a huge 1367 x 768 picture, but the bastards took it down and replaced it with a neutered and more tame version because &quot;someone will steal it.&quot; Yeah right. Most content from China's government falls under the free-use criteria so it can be used. There is probably a workaround to this problem that can be done in the future.

It will be awhile before this becomes a featured article, but I hope that future contributions and edits will make this article even better, and perhaps indistinguishable from the present.

Good luck and happy editing. &lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 10:17, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

== Shaping ==

Current description:

The J-20 has a long and wide fuselage, with the chiseled nose section and a frameless canopy resembling that of the F-22 Raptor. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed just behind the intakes, and behind these, leading edge extension merging into delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section features twin, outward-canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes and conventional round engine exhausts.

Is this not exactly what the image provided describes, the upturned canards with pronounced dihedral, Russian AL-31 engines with round exhausts, leading edge extensions, and most importantly in the stealth section, the bump surface that reduces the engine's exposure to radar. All the artists renderings do not describe any of the features written in this section; this image, out of a million possible renderings, angles, and time of taking the image, is the one that most accurately represents the aircraft in this context. Note that the image has long since disappeared from the Chinese internet entirely, but luckily, I was able to capture it. Many copies and low-resolution of this image do exist that have been circulating ever since I uploaded it a month ago, but currently, I am the only person in possession of the original.

For reference, the older description is also provided here:

The J-20 has a long and wide fuselage, with the chiseled nose section and a frameless canopy resembling that of the F-22 Raptor. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes mounted with a pair of upturned canards. They are followed by leading edge extension and a diamond wing. The aft section features canted all-moving fins and conventional round engine exhausts.

Sorry Dark Liberty but I have removed the image again, it clearly can be replaced with a free image and to keep uloading can be seen as being disruptive.

I've done extensive research on image copyright status. I uploaded a picture of the J-20 almost a year ago from cctv.com. Since then, the image no longer exists. I believe the image passes the fair-use clause. And, I don't think China has a concept of intellectual property rights.

According to WP:NFCC#1, &quot;in theory that somebody could take a free image, or be asked to release an image as free.&quot; -MilbourneOne, that means any civilian can take a picture of the J-20. however, there isn't another copy of the picture, even if a thousand years pass. the reason is you cannot reproduce another picture taken of the prototype taken from a J-10 chase plane.

&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;Dark Liberty&lt;/font&gt; ([[User talk:Dark Liberty|talk]]) 05:28, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

there are four main components to the [[Fair use|Fair-use]] criteria.

Purpose and Character: the first criteria is whether an image can be used for the general education and enrichment of the public rather than profit. 99% of images fail this in this regard, because they are used for profit. Other images fail the character clause, because the image does not demonstrate the discussion or content of the article in question, or does not do so in a clear manner.

Nature of the copied work: the picture is non-fictional, and not an artistic work. It is a photograph, and to forensic scientists, trained artists, as well as military experts can confirm that indeed the the image is real. I think... Of course, by offering it available on Wikipedia...

Amount and substantiality and Effect upon work's value: The picture does not infringe upon the the copyright owner's ability to exploit his or her original work.

In conclusion, despite being fair use, I will not re-upload of the image because of the controversy and possible copyright violation it may generate. However, if someone can research the copyright status laws for images from government sites other than the United States, it would be appreciated.

== Regarding misleading statements ==

There have been repeated attempts at passing references, claiming them to be from X, when in fact they are from Y.  Specifically, we see statement such as &quot;Global Times has said ...&quot; but following the references lead you to news sites other than Global Times.  This presents a misleading situation for normal readers.

For a well established news organization such as Global Times, it is a reasonable assumption that the reference links to the original Global Times article in question.  Yet in the current state, we have a statement sourcing from a news article that talks about another article.  It is like sourcing from Fox News on something that CNN said, which defies common senses.  If there is so much trouble finding the original article, then there are cleary [[wp:v|verifibility]] issues, and the source shouldn't be included.

And that leads us to the next issue: when I pull the quotes and look them up on Google, not one of the results actually linked to Global Times.  So, even the very existence of the Global Times article is in question.  At best, the aricle currently being referenced is merely a re-interpretation of what Global Times said, and that is not equivalent to what Global Times is saying.

One possible solution is to reword the statement in question to better reflect the source being used.  However, seeing that approach has been tried before and we come back to the same situation, I am now being bold and removed said statement from the article.
