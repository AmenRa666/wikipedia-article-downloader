'''No. 77 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) squadron headquartered at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales. It is controlled by [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing]], and equipped with [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] multi-role fighters. The squadron was formed at [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, in March 1942 and saw action in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War&amp;nbsp;II]], operating [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|Curtis P-40 Kittyhawks]]. After the war, it re-equipped with [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s and deployed to Japan as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. The squadron was about to return to Australia when the [[Korean War]] broke out in June 1950, after which it joined [[United Nations]] forces supporting South Korea. It converted from Mustangs to [[Gloster Meteor]] jets between April and July 1951 and remained in Korea until October 1954, claiming five [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]]s and over five thousand buildings and vehicles destroyed during the war for the loss of almost sixty aircraft, mainly to ground fire.

The squadron re-equipped with [[CAC Sabre]]s at Williamtown in November 1956. Two years later it transferred to [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Butterworth]] in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] to join the air campaign against communist guerrillas in the last stages of the [[Malayan Emergency|Emergency]]. The squadron remained at Butterworth during the 1960s, providing regional air defence during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] between Indonesia and Malaysia. It returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with [[Dassault Mirage&amp;nbsp;III]] supersonic jet fighters. No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron began converting to Hornets in June 1987. It supplied a detachment of four aircraft to the American base on [[Diego Garcia]] in 2001–02, supporting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], and deployed to the Middle East as part of the [[military intervention against ISIL]] in 2015–16. Along with its Hornets, the squadron briefly operated [[Pilatus PC-9]]s in the [[forward air control]] role in the early 2000s. The RAAF plans to replace its Hornets with [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning&amp;nbsp;II]] fighters commencing in 2018, and No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron is scheduled to convert to the new type in 2021.

As the Japanese advanced in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three fighter units—[[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]], [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]] and 77 Squadrons—equipped with [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks]] recently delivered from the United States.&lt;ref name=Stephens139&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was formed at [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, on 16&amp;nbsp;March, with a complement of three officers and 100 men. Temporarily commanded by [[Squadron Leader]] D. F. Forsyth, the unit was initially responsible for the defence of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].&lt;ref name=Fighter54&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 77 Squadron (1942–50), &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Squadron Leader [[Dick Cresswell]] assumed command on 20&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref name=Fighter60&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron transferred to [[Batchelor Airfield]] near [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, in August, the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the area.&lt;ref name=Fighter54/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; Until this time, air defence over Darwin had been provided by the P-40s flown by the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]'s [[49th Operations Group|49th Fighter Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 136, 249&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron moved to another of Darwin's satellite airfields, [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone]], in September.&lt;ref name=Eather/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 644]&lt;/ref&gt; Among its pilots was [[John Gorton]], future [[Prime Minister of Australia]].&lt;ref name=Johnston250&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron saw action defending Darwin from Japanese air raids and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1942, when Cresswell destroyed a [[Mitsubishi G4M|Mitsubishi &quot;Betty&quot;]] bomber.&lt;ref name=Fighter54/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston251&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first &quot;kill&quot; for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia.&lt;ref name=Johnston251/&gt; As of 24&amp;nbsp;December, the unit's strength was twenty-four Kittyhawks.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 649]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1943, concurrent with [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Wing]] and its three [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons becoming operational in the Darwin area, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was transferred to [[Milne Bay]] in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070521--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 267, 291&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;6]], 75 and [[No. 100 Squadron RAAF|100 Squadrons]] it came under the control of the newly formed [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]], which was part of [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]], the RAAF's main mobile formation in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]].&lt;ref name=Odgers23&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070531--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 23–24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens144&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron registered its first daytime victory on 11&amp;nbsp;April, when a Kittyhawk shot down a [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] taking part in a raid on Allied shipping near [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]]. Three days later the Japanese attacked Milne Bay; the squadron claimed four bombers and a fighter for the loss of one Kittyhawk.&lt;ref name=Fighter54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 285–287&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Allied headquarters had finalised plans for a drive north to the Philippines involving heavy attacks on [[Rabaul]] and the occupation of territory in New Guinea, [[New Britain]] and the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070531--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 21–22]&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by Wing Commander Lou Spence, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was committed to action over Korea as part of [[United Nations Command]], and came under the operational control of the US [[Fifth Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian unit was specifically requested by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], commander of UN forces; the Mustang was considered the best long-range ground-attack aircraft in the theatre, and Stratemeyer contended that No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was the best Mustang outfit in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War: Volume 1'', pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron flew its initial escort and patrol sorties from Iwakuni on 2&amp;nbsp;July 1950, becoming the first non-American UN unit to commence operations.&lt;ref name=Eather/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Several Australian families were still living at Iwakuni pending their repatriation from what had become an operational theatre, and could watch the Mustangs depart for missions over Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[friendly fire]] incident occurred on 3&amp;nbsp;July 1950, when No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron attacked a train full of US and South Korean troops on the main highway between [[Suwon]] and [[Pyongtaek|P'yongtaek]], inflicting many casualties, twenty-nine of them fatal.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War: Volume 2'', p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Spence had raised concerns before the mission that the North Koreans could not have penetrated so far south, but was assured by Fifth Air Force controllers that the target was correct; the incident was widely reported in US newspapers but a public statement by Stratemeyer cleared the RAAF of any blame.&lt;ref name=Solo226&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron did not encounter enemy aircraft in the opening phase of the war but often faced intense ground fire. It suffered its first fatality on 7&amp;nbsp;July when its deputy commander, Squadron Leader Graham Strout, was killed during a raid on [[Samcheok|Samchok]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo227&quot;/&gt; He was also the first Australian, and the first non-American UN serviceman, to die in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two months, equipped with bombs, rockets and [[napalm]], No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron supported UN troops retreating before the North Korean advance. To expedite turnaround times between missions, the Mustangs, which were still based at Iwakuni, often refuelled and rearmed at [[Daegu|Taegu]] near the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]], where UN forces made a last-ditch stand on the southern tip of Korea.&lt;ref name=Solo226/&gt;&lt;ref name=Odd92&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 92–94&lt;/ref&gt; One of the squadron's Dakotas regularly flew between Iwakuni and Taegu carrying ordnance and spare parts.&lt;ref name=Odd92/&gt; According to the official history of the Air Force in 1946–71, the squadron's part in the victory at Pusan earned recognition &quot;not only for the RAAF but also Australia at the highest political levels in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref name=Solo226/&gt; During a visit to Japan in August 1950, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] presented the [[Gloucester Cup]] to No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron as the RAAF's most proficient unit of the past year.&lt;ref name=Odd92/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article135299764 |title=Persistency on Korea failed |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald|Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate]] |date=16 August 1950 |accessdate=5 September 2014 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, the squadron claimed thirty-five tanks, 212 other vehicles, eighteen railway engines or cars, and thirteen fuel or ammunition dumps destroyed.&lt;ref name=Fighter54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron was transferred from Iwakuni to [[Pohang]], South Korea, on 12&amp;nbsp;October, to support UN forces advancing northwards.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;October, the squadron became a component of the RAAF's newly established [[No. 91 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;91 (Composite) Wing]], which also included [[No. 391 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;391 (Base) Squadron]], [[No. 491 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;491 (Maintenance) Squadron]], and [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight]], formerly the No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron Communications Flight.&lt;ref name=Wilson170/&gt;&lt;ref name=Solo228&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The wing and all units except No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, which came under the operational control of the US [[35th Fighter-Interceptor Group]], were headquartered at Iwakuni.&lt;ref name=Solo228/&gt;

China entered the war in mid-October 1950, as advancing UN troops closed in on the [[Yalu River]].

The RAAF attempted to procure Sabres to replace No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's Mustangs but the priority being given to re-equipping the USAF meant that deliveries would not be possible until 1954. The Australian government agreed to purchase [[Gloster Meteor]] straight-wing jet fighters from Britain as the only viable alternative; the initial order included thirty-six single-seat Mk.8 interceptors and four two-seat Mk.7 trainers.&lt;ref name=Stephens229/&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron completed its last Mustang mission on 6&amp;nbsp;April 1951 and returned to Iwakuni the next day to begin converting to Meteors.  It subsequently transferred to [[Gimpo|Kimpo]], South Korea, and commenced operations with its new aircraft on 29&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 119, 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 126, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron deployed twenty-two Meteors at Kimpo, and came under the control of the USAF's [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]]. Although it had operated effectively as a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's primary role in the RAAF was interception, and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as by this stage the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 231–233&lt;/ref&gt;

Wing Commander [[Gordon Steege]] succeeded Cresswell on 16&amp;nbsp;August 1951, by which time No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's Meteors had conducted offensive sweeps up the Yalu River with USAF Sabres, and escorted [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es on bombing missions.&lt;ref name=Solo234&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurst143&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 143–145&lt;/ref&gt; MiG-15s had appeared on several occasions without engaging the Meteors; it was speculated at the time, and subsequently confirmed, that they had been observing the performance of the newly arrived RAAF jets.&lt;ref name=Hurst143/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron's first Meteor fatalities occurred on 22&amp;nbsp;August, when two aircraft collided in mid-air as they returned to Kimpo after a sweep.&lt;ref name=Hurst143/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fighter58&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The Meteors first engaged MiG-15s on 25&amp;nbsp;August, but scored no hits. Four days later, eight Meteors and sixteen Sabres fought twelve MiGs; one RAAF pilot ejected when his aircraft was shot down, and a second Meteor was badly damaged. One week later another Meteor suffered severe damage in a dogfight with MiGs.&lt;ref name=Solo234/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurst147&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', pp. 147–151&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these clashes, Steege became convinced that the Meteor was outclassed as a fighter. Following discussions with the Fifth Air Force, he decided to take No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron out of its air-to-air combat role and curtail its operations in &quot;[[MiG&amp;nbsp;Alley]]&quot;, the area between the Yalu and [[Chongchon River]]s on North Korea's border with [[Manchuria]]. This caused controversy among those who believed that proper tactics exploiting the Meteor's manoeuvrability and heavy armament would have allowed it to remain competitive as a fighter; for the Australian pilots the change of role amounted to a loss of prestige.&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War: Volume 2'', pp. 335, 358&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], backed the decision, which relegated the squadron mainly to escort duty and local air defence. Morale suffered and it was not until Wing Commander Ron Susans succeeded Steege on 26&amp;nbsp;December 1951 that the Meteors were once more assigned an offensive role, namely ground attack.&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;
