Dr. '''Ismet Popovac''' (died 21 August 1943) was a Bosnian Muslim{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=288}} ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]]) military commander who led a Muslim [[Chetnik]] militia known as the Muslim People's Military Organization ({{lang-sh|Muslimanska nacionalna vojna organizacija}}, MNVO) in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] during [[World War II]]. A physician and lawyer by profession, he was a member of a cultural society known as ''[[Gajret]]'' prior to the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941. He was also the mayor of the town of [[Konjic]] prior to the invasion and was allegedly a candidate for [[Vladko Maček]]'s electoral list, but was left without a job in the Yugoslav state government after the creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] in 1939. 

In 1941, Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of [[Draža Mihailović]]. As a proponent of Bosnian Muslim collaboration with the Chetniks, he suggested that the Chetniks recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] aid in fighting the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], and later visited [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]] to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre took the lives of 543–2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943 he led an attack against a Muslim village, before being killed by either the Partisans, Chetniks, or an assassin in the vicinity of the town of [[Trebinje]] later that year.

==Early life==
From the Herzegovinian town of [[Nevesinje]], Ismet Popovac was a physician{{sfn|Redžić|2005|p=143}} and lawyer{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=240}} by profession. He finished medical school in [[Belgrade]] and was a vocal supporter of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during this time.{{sfn|Košarić|18 August 2013}} Prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]] he was a member of the pro-[[Serbs|Serb]] and pro-monarchy cultural society known as ''[[Gajret]]'', whose members were often persecuted by non-Serbs because of their political inclinations.{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=41}} Popovac was also the mayor of the Bosnian town of [[Konjic]],{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=188}}{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} and allegedly a candidate for [[Vladko Maček]]'s electoral list, but was left without a job in the state government after the creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] in 1939.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}}

==Joining the Chetniks==
On 6 April 1941, [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] was quickly defeated.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}} Afterwards, Yugoslavia was dismembered, with Serbia being reduced to its pre-1912 borders and placed under a government of German military occupation.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=50}} [[Milan Nedić]], a pre-war politician who was known to have pro-Axis leanings, was then selected by the Germans to lead the collaborationist [[Government of National Salvation]] in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]].{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=182}} Meanwhile, the extreme [[Croat]] nationalist and fascist [[Ante Pavelić]], who had been in exile in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was appointed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of an [[Ustaše]]-led Croatian state – the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (often called the NDH, from the {{lang-hr|Nezavisna Država Hrvatska}}).{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} The NDH combined almost all of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]] into an &quot;Italian-German quasi-protectorate.&quot;{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} NDH authorities, led by the [[Ustaše militia]],{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=397–409}} subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] population living within the borders of the new state.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=20–24}} As a result, two resistance movements emerged – the royalist and Serb Chetniks, led by [[Colonel]] [[Draža Mihailović]], and the multi-ethnic, [[Communist]] [[Yugoslav Partisans]], led by [[Josip Broz Tito]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=4}}

That year, Popovac and fellow Muslim leader [[Mustafa Pašić]] joined the Chetniks.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} Popovac hoped to achieve independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina through his cooperation{{sfn|Burgwyn|2005|p=180}} and, according to one Serb Chetnik, his &quot;main goal was to protect the Muslims, rather than to struggle for the Serb nation and Serb affairs.&quot;{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} He later wrote to Mihailović, suggesting that [[Bosnian Muslims]] be recruited into the Chetnik ranks.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=137}} This proposal was met with support from pro-Serb, anti-Communist Muslim leaders in several Bosnian towns. However, as more Muslims began joining the Partisans, the Chetniks increasingly began considering Muslims to be their enemies. Chetnik [[Chetniks#Terror tactics and cleansing actions|atrocities]] against Muslim civilians subsequently increased{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=188}} in the late spring of 1941. Due to these actions, and due to Muslims, especially those in eastern Bosnia, being branded by the Chetniks as &quot;Turks&quot; and &quot;[[Ustaše]] cronies,&quot; the Chetniks found few Muslim recruits.{{sfn|Velkonija|2003|p=167}}

==Muslim People's Military Organization==
[[File:Panorama Prozora.JPG|thumb|right|220px|In 1942, Popovac visited the Bosnian town of Prozor to discourage further bloodshed following a Chetnik massacre of Muslim and Croat civilians.]]
In late 1942, a Muslim Chetnik militia known as the Muslim People's Military Organization ({{lang-sh|Muslimanska nacionalna vojna organizacija}}, MNVO){{sfn|Christia|2012|p=200}} was formed in Herzegovina{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} following a meeting between Popovac and [[Bosnian Serb]] Chetnik leaders [[Dobroslav Jevđević]] and [[Petar Baćović]].{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=49}} The militia was placed under the control of Popovac, [[Fehim Musakadić]] and Mustafa Pašić.{{sfn|Durmanović|15 November 2006}} It was part of a greater Muslim autonomist circle and in September 1942 an assembly of Herzegovinian Muslim notables in Mostar declared: &quot;We Herzegovinians and Bosnians are nobody's property and we recognize the right of nobody to persecute us; so, insofar as our brothers in [[Zagreb]] do not wish to accede to our demands, we shall seek protection of our interests from other big powers from the ranks of our allies.&quot;{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=271}} In October of that year, Popovac enlisted [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] aid in fighting the [[Yugoslav Partisans]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=494}} This resulted in the establishment of a Bosnian Muslim [[quisling]] force that operated as part of the [[Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia]].{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} It was reported that Popovac had &quot;won the majority of the Muslims to his purpose&quot; in the [[Mostar]], Konjic, Nevesinje and [[Gacko]] districts.{{sfn|Redžić|2005|p=104}} Eventually, he came to be seen as one of &quot;the principal representatives of the pro-Chetnik Muslim current&quot; in Bosnia.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}}

That October, during [[Operation Alfa]], a joint Chetnik–Italian attack against the Partisans, the Chetniks massacred 543–2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians in [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]. Several days later, Popovac arrived in the town to console the Bosnian Muslim population and to advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities.{{sfn|Goldstein|7 November 2012}} While there, he also attempted to convince local Muslims to join the Chetnik ranks, but was unsuccessful due to the extent of Chetnik atrocities against the Muslim population.{{sfn|Dizdar|Sobolevski|1999|p=365}} On 31 December, in face of widespread Muslim opposition to the Chetniks' genocidal nature, Popovac and his MNVO declared a resolution in [[Kalinovik]], vowing allegiance to [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Petar II]] and Mihailović, and claiming Bosnian Muslims as &quot;an integral part of [[Serbdom]]&quot; and the MNVO as &quot;part of the Chetnik movement led by Draža Mihailović, Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Forces.&quot;{{sfn|Redžić|2005|p=153}}

In January 1943, Popovac led an attack which resulted in the capture of a Muslim village that was guarded by a large force of Muslim volunteers.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|pp=188 &amp; 309}} That same month more Chetnik massacres against Bosnian Muslims were carried out, especially in east Bosnia in the areas of [[Koraj]], [[Bijeljina]], [[Srebrenica]], [[Višegrad]], [[Foča]], [[Goražde]], [[Vlasenica]], and around the [[Drina]] river.{{sfn|Redžić|2005|p=154}} His militia cooperated with Chetnik units in fighting the Partisans during the Axis-led [[Case White]] operation in January to March 1943, but did not distinguish itself.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=494}} During the operation itself Chetniks continued their efforts to exterminate the Muslims. Nonetheless, Popovac and Pašić continued seeking Muslim recruits. They declared in their &quot;Address to the Brethren Muslims of Čajniče and Other Nearby Districts&quot; that the main goal of the Chetniks was &quot;the intelligent and honest protection of Muslim interests&quot; and &quot;securing a safe future for our people with the highest principles of [[Islam]]: freedom of religion, holiness of the family, respect for private property, social justice, and democratic political freedom.&quot; Furthermore, they dismissed the claim that Muslims were collectively responsible for Ustaše crimes and said &quot;Muslims are bound to the brethren of the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] religion by blood and land.&quot;{{sfn|Redžić|2005|p=154}}

==Death and legacy==
Popovac was killed on 21 August 1943.{{sfn|Gobetti|2007|p=165}} Sources vary on the circumstances of his death. Historian [[Marko Attila Hoare]] states that he was killed by members of the Partisan 10th Herzegovinian Brigade,{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=51}} Professor [[Jozo Tomasevich]] writes that he was killed by an assassin{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=240}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=494}} and Zdravko Dizdar and Mihael Sobolevski claim that he was killed by the Chetniks in the vicinity of [[Trebinje]] after objecting to the killing of Muslims.{{sfn|Dizdar|Sobolevski|1999|p=365}} 

By December 1943, it is estimated that 4,000 of Mihailović's Chetniks were Bosnian Muslims. This number accounted for eight percent of all of Mihailović's soldiers.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=188}} In 1944, Mihailović appealed to the Muslims to fight against the Communists, citing the example of Popovac and other Muslim Chetniks.{{sfn|Radan|Pavković|1997|p=221}}
