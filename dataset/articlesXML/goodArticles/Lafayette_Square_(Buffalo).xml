The block, which was once square, is lined by many of the [[List of tallest buildings in Buffalo|city's tallest]] buildings.  The square was named for [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]], who visited Buffalo in 1825.&lt;ref name=LSBNCVB/&gt;

The square was part of the original [[urban planning|urban plan]] for the city as laid out by [[Joseph Ellicott]] in 1804.&lt;ref name=39ALS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/Home/OurCity/Buffalo_My_City/Buffalo_My_City_Watercolors/39A_Lafayette_Square |title= Buffalo My City: Water Color Series |chapter= 39-A Lafayette Square|agency=GLK Enterprises |accessdate= March 7, 2008 |year=1994 |publisher= www.ci.buffalo.ny.us |author= Lalli, V. Roger (watercolor)/ Rote, David Mott (text)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its eastern edge has long been defined by important civic structures; first, the Erie County Courthouse, followed by the original [[Buffalo Public Library|Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library]].  Presidential history was made in Lafayette Square when former [[United States President]] [[Martin Van Buren]] received the [[Free Soil Party]] nomination for the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 election]].&lt;ref name=OPotNFSC/&gt;  [[President-elect]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] also spoke at the square.&lt;ref name=FDAROL/&gt;

Today, the square offers a clear view of [[Buffalo City Hall]], an [[Art Deco]] building three blocks to the west.  A granite Civil War monument, titled ''Soldiers and Sailors,'' gives a strong vertical and ceremonial definition to the space.  Conceived by Mrs. [[Horatio Seymour]], the monument's dedication ceremony was attended by [[Grover Cleveland]] and other prominent figures.&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.bfn.org/bah/a/lafsq/index.html|title=The Soldiers &amp; Sailors Monument in Lafayette Square Buffalo, New York|accessdate=March 7, 2008|publisher=Lancaster Historical Society |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051122234408/http://www4.bfn.org/bah/a/lafsq/index.html |archivedate = November 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011, Lafayette Square hosted the annual [[Thursday at the Square]] summer concert series and is occasionally the site of [[demonstration (people)|rallies and demonstrations]].&lt;ref name=SCS/&gt;

Lafayette Square is one of three squares laid out in [[Joseph Ellicott]]'s city plan.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; The square is located three blocks east of [[Niagara Square]] and is the second most important space in downtown Buffalo.&lt;ref name=BA88&gt;Kowsky, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The block is surrounded by the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]]'s [[Metro Rail (Buffalo)|Metro Rail]] [[light rail]] [[rapid transit]] to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the [[Free Fare Zone]],&lt;ref name=O/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfta.com/metro/index.asp|title=Welcome to the NFTA-Metro Web site &gt;&gt; System Maps|accessdate=March 25, 2009|publisher=[[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a [[One-way traffic|one-way]] westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection to Clinton Street).&lt;ref name=F&gt;Fox, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfta.com/metro/pdfs/Buffalo.pdf|title=System Maps: City of Buffalo Map |accessdate=March 25, 2008|publisher=[[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The square once was surrounded by an iron fence that was no longer present by 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Passing of Old Building Recalls  Early Buffalo|date=December 21, 1920|work=[[Buffalo Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, the square was a heavily wooded park.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; In 1876-7, trees that lined the square along main street were removed.&lt;ref name=TPBoEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=BA46-47&gt;Kowsky, p. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafayette Square was the last park in the heart of the city, but the commercialization of the downtown area caused vehicular space demands.&lt;ref name=BA46-47/&gt; The original parklike square was originally viewed by [[urban planning|urban planners]] as an impediment to crosstown traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA88&quot;/&gt;    In 1912, the [[Buffalo Common Council]] authorized the extension of Broadway to Main Street through Lafayette Square, which reduced the size of the square &quot;to devote to street purposes all that part of the Square except for a small circle around the Soldiers and Sailors Monument.&quot;&lt;ref name=BA46-47/&gt;  The square has since been redeveloped a few times and is now more of a thoroughfare than a park.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA88&quot;/&gt;  In 1920, the square circumscribed a vehicular circle with the monument in the center surrounded by sidewalks and grass.&lt;ref&gt;Bisco, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monument===
The monument's shaft supports a {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m|1|adj=on}} female figure, and four {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} bronze statues, representing the [[infantry]], [[artillery]], [[cavalry]] and [[navy]], sculpted by [[Caspar Buberl]], which face the four cardinal points.  Bronze bas-reliefs encircle the column above the statues.&lt;ref name=39ALS/&gt;  The female figure is an allegorical figure representing the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].&lt;ref name=F/&gt;  By the time of the 1979 report for the Mayor's Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs, two plaques were missing from the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Buffalo's Public Art|publisher=The Mayor's Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs|page=62|author=School of Architecture and Environmental Design, State University of New York at Buffalo|date=December 20, 1979|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication on the west (Main Street) side honors those who laid down their lives &quot;in the war to maintain the union for the cause of their country and of mankind.&quot; Half of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] graces the east side of the monument. Several [[bas-relief]] panels feature scenes of Lincoln's original [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]]: [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Salmon Chase]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edward Bates]], [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Montgomery Blair]], [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[Caleb Blood Smith|Caleb Smith]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]], [[Major General]] [[Winfield Scott]], and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]].&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY/&gt;

At one time, a [[rivulet]] flowed from Lafayette Square down Court Street where it eventually met a stream at Niagara and Mohawk Streets.&lt;ref name=FDAROL&gt;{{cite news|title=Familiar Downtown Area Retains Oldtime Laurels: Lafayetts Square, once Court House Square still center of activities|work=[[Buffalo Courier-Express]]|date=September 30, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The square hosted the [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]] Courthouse from 1810 until it was destroyed by the [[British Army]] during the [[Burning of Buffalo]] during the [[War of 1812]] on December 30, 1813.&lt;ref&gt;see plaque picture on this page, Niagara Frontier Landmarks Association, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1831, the [[Holland Land Company]] gave the deed of the public park to the city.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

The original Erie County court house was built facing the square park in 1818.  Buffalo was the county seat of Niagara County until 1821, when Erie County was created. In 1833 an adjacent county jailhouse was added.&lt;ref name=HMMaMiBNY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrle.com/markers/marke.htm|title=Historic Markers, Monuments, and Memorials in Buffalo, New York|accessdate=March 26, 2009|publisher=Chris Andrle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The jail, which was crude,&lt;ref name=VN60&gt;Van Ness, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; and a debtors' prison were located in the back of the courthouse.&lt;ref name=FDAROL/&gt;&lt;ref name=TPBoEB&gt;{{cite book|title=The Picture Book of Earlier Buffalo|editor=Severance, Frank H.|publisher=[[Buffalo Historical Society]]|pages=172â€“175|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1853, the city fenced in the square and installed a [[US$]]30,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|30000|1853|r=0}}}} today) fountain.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; Erie County Sheriff Grover Cleveland once personally hanged a criminal in the square when it was still named Court House Square, after his subordinates refused to do so.&lt;ref name=FDAROL/&gt;  [[President-elect]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] spoke at the square on February 16, 1861.&lt;ref name=FDAROL/&gt; The courthouse was used as the place for the determination of justice for the American side of the [[Niagara River]] until it was abandoned on March 11, 1876.&lt;ref name=HMMaMiBNY/&gt;

A [[Cyrus Eidlitz]] Buffalo Public Library building was first erected on the Court House's location and dedicated on February 7, 1887.&lt;ref name=VN61/&gt;  The current [[Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library]] building that replaced Eidlitz's building was constructed between 1961 and 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA89&quot; /&gt; Eidlitz had won an architectural competition against the likes of [[Henry Hobson Richardson|Henry Richardson]], who was regarded as the nationâ€™s top architect at the time.&lt;ref name=VN61&gt;Van Ness, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  The gargoyles of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] Eidlitz building were widely respected and admired.  However, they were not saved due to prohibitive expense at the time of the early 1960s demolition.&lt;ref name=VN61/&gt;

In 1825 [[American Revolutionary War]] veteran and [[French people|French]] [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]] [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|visited this square during his historic tour of the United States]] and gave a speech in the square.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA88&quot;/&gt;  He spoke on a platform in front of the Eagle Tavern, a highly regarded hotel in its day, on June 4 as part of ceremonies to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Eberle and Grande, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, Buffalo carried out its last official public hanging when brothers Israel, Isaac and Nelson Thayer were hanged for murdering John Love, which some accounts say occurred in the square,&lt;ref name=F/&gt; while others say it was at Niagara Square.&lt;ref&gt;Eberle and Grande, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The square hosted many public meetings and early [[Erie County Fair]]s,&lt;ref name=EaG33/&gt; such as the October 1841 fair that was held in the square and behind the courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Eberle and Grande, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, the [[Free Soil Party]], which was absorbed into the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1854, held its national nominating convention in Buffalo. At the convention, the party selected former [[New York Governor]] and former United States President [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] as their nominees for [[United States President]] and [[United States Vice President]] for the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 election]].&lt;ref name=OPotNFSC&gt;{{Cite book|title=Official Proceedings of the National Free Soil Convention, assembled at Buffalo, N.Y., August 9th and 10th, 1848|publisher=E.

The first meeting regarding the erection of a Civil War monument was held on April 14, 1866.  Efforts stalled until Mrs. [[Horatio Seymour]] organized the Ladies Union Monument Association on July 2, 1874, which raised $12,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12000|1874|r=0}}}}) and approved a design by [[George W. Keller|George Keller]].  Following this proactive effort, the city of Buffalo approved an additional $45,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|45000|1874|r=0}}}}) for the project.&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY/&gt;  Support for the monument effort coalesced when public interest in and support for an arch by [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] at Niagara Square in front of [[Buffalo City Hall]] faded.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA88&quot;/&gt; In 1879, the name of the square was changed from Court House Park to Lafayette Square.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA88&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=VN46&gt;Van Ness, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Joseph Ellicott.jpg|102|President Grover Cleveland Restored.jpg|81|[[Joseph Ellicott]] planned Lafayette Square, and [[New York State Governor]] [[Grover Cleveland]] was one of two United States Governors who attended the square's ''Soldiers and Sailors'' dedication.}}
Then-[[Mayor of Buffalo]] [[Grover Cleveland]] laid the cornerstone of Keller's {{convert|85|ft|m|1|adj=on}} [[granite]]-shaft ''Soldiers and Sailors'' monument in the center of the square on July 4, 1882 and returned as New York Governor to dedicate the monument July 4, 1884.&lt;ref name=39ALS/&gt;&lt;ref name=F/&gt;  When the cornerstone was laid with military pomp and Masonic ritual, Cleveland spoke,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[time capsule]] was sealed away.&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffaloah.com/a/lafsq/index.html|title=The Soldiers &amp; Sailors Monument in Lafayette Square Buffalo, New York|accessdate=March 25, 2009|author=Maryniak, Benjamin R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Brigadier General]] [[Stewart Woodford]] made remarks at the first ceremony.&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY/&gt; Woodford was among several notable people who attended the dedication, including [[Pennsylvania Governor]] [[John Hartranft]] and Brigadier General [[William Findlay Rogers]].&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY/&gt;  Columns of [[Union Army]] veterans marched down Main Street to celebrate the day.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

The monument has survived two significant threats.  First, in 1889, the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] was found to have settled unevenly, causing a dangerous tilt similar to that of the [[Tower of Pisa]].  The square was cracking and crumbling due to an inadequate core of rubble and mortar to support the granite shaft and statuary.  In addition the copper box time capsule was found to be three feet below its intended chamber and cracked with its contents destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preserve.bfn.org/bpr/june96/858main/index.html|title=The Old Curiosity Shop|accessdate=March 25, 2009|author=Van Ness, Cynthia|work=Buffalo Preservation Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The monument was dismantled and rebuilt with an expanded {{convert|15|ft|m|1|adj=on}} base.  On February 12, 1973, a motorist drove his vehicle into the monument,&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY/&gt; prompting calls for its demolition by 1982 by the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]].&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY/&gt;  Instead, the monument was repaired through fundraising efforts by the Buffalo Civil War Round Table involving a successful public awareness campaign.&lt;ref name=TS&amp;SMiLSBNY/&gt;
