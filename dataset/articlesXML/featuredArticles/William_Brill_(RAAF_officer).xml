'''William Lloyd Brill''', {{post-nominals|size=100%|country=AUS|sep=,|DSO|DFC}} &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]] (17{{nbsp}}May 1916 – 12{{nbsp}}October 1964) was a senior officer and bomber pilot in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in the [[Riverina]] district of [[New South Wales]], he was a farmer and a member of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] before joining the RAAF in 1940. After [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|training in Australia and Canada]], he was posted to Britain in 1941 to take part in the [[RAF Bomber Command#Strategic bombing 1942–45|air war over Europe]]. Brill first saw combat with [[No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron RAAF]], flying [[Vickers Wellington]] medium bombers. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) in May 1942 for attacking a target after his plane was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Following assignment as an instructor with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), he returned to the bombing campaign in January 1944 as a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] with [[No.&amp;nbsp;463 Squadron RAAF]], flying [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers.

Brill's leadership and determination to complete his missions despite damage to his aircraft—on one occasion inflicted by another Lancaster's bombs from above—earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Promoted to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in May 1944, he took over [[No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron RAAF]] after the death in combat of its then-commander, Group Captain [[John Balmer]]. Brill was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC in July, for his skill in evading three German [[night fighter]]s. Returning to Australia, he remained in the Air Force after the war and led [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron]] in 1949–50. He went on to command air bases at [[RAAF Base Rathmines|Rathmines]], [[Fairbairn, Canberra|Canberra]] and [[RAAF Base Townsville|Townsville]] during the 1950s and 1960s. Brill served two terms as RAAF Director of Personnel Services, in 1956–59 and 1960–63, by which time he had been promoted to [[group captain]]. His final posting was at the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]] in Canberra. He died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in October 1964.

==Early life==
Brill was born on 17 May 1916 in the [[Riverina]] town of [[Ganmain]], New South Wales. He was the fourth of seven children of farmer Edward Brill and his wife Bertha, who were originally from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The Brills owned a property called &quot;Clearview&quot;, and Bill attended the local school. He completed his education at [[Yanco Agricultural High School|Yanco Agricultural High]], gaining his [[Intermediate Certificate (Australia)|Intermediate Certificate]] before joining his brothers in wheat farming.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Eaton|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130292b.htm |title=Brill, William Lloyd (1916–1964)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 3-6&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 3–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Thickly set and physically strong, he was a keen [[Australian rules football]]er, playing for Ganmain, [[Grong Grong]], and [[Matong]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 3-6&quot; /&gt;  On 5&amp;nbsp;January 1939, Brill enlisted in the [[Australian Light Horse|21st Light Horse Regiment]], a [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] unit, at [[Narrandera]]. He was promoted to [[corporal]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=9266397 |title=Brill, William Lloyd&amp;nbsp;– Australian Military Forces enlistment form|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The previous month he had been tested as a potential air cadet, the interview panel finding him a &quot;quiet country chap&quot; who was &quot;rather slow&quot; but &quot;intelligent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 6-7&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 1940, Brill transferred to the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt;  He went through the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS), undergoing initial instruction at [[RAAF Bradfield Park]] in Sydney. Selected to be a pilot, he received his elementary flying training on [[De Havilland Tiger Moth]]s at [[RAAF Station Narrandera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 6-7&quot; /&gt; In March 1941, Brill was posted to Canada for advanced instruction on [[Avro Anson]]s at [[RCAF Station Calgary|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Service Flying Training School, Calgary]]. He was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] on 28&amp;nbsp;July 1941, and sailed to Britain the next month. In October he began converting to [[Vickers Wellington]] medium bombers at [[RAF Lichfield|No.&amp;nbsp;27 Operational Training Unit, Lichfield]], and was assigned to [[No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron RAAF]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 16-17&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; which formed at [[RAF Molesworth]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM460&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11163.asp |title= 460 Squadron RAAF | publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air war in Europe==
===First tour of operations===
Raised under the [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV]] provisions of EATS, No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron was one of several nominally Australian formations taking part in [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s strategic air campaign against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070696--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 649]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;460Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 118–123&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1942, the unit moved from Molesworth to [[RAF Breighton]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM460&quot; /&gt; Brill flew as a co-pilot in No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron's first operation, against the German port of [[Emden]] in March.&lt;ref name=&quot;460Sqn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 20-24&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 20–24&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon in command of his own Wellington, attacking targets in northern France. On 5&amp;nbsp;April 1942, he undertook his first [[sortie]] against a well-defended city deep in enemy territory, [[Cologne]]. He later recorded his apprehension before the raid:&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 20-24&quot; /&gt;{{blockquote|How can I get back from this when others who are better than I'll ever be, have fallen on such targets? Will I funk if I'm in a tight spot? Will I let the rest of the boys down? Who am I to hold the lives of five other men in my hands?}}

[[File:SUK10297DoubledayBrill1942.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Pilot Officer Brill (''right'') with fellow No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron RAAF pilot Arthur Doubleday at Molesworth, England, {{circa|1941–42}}|alt=Informal half portrait of two men in dark military uniforms, with peaked caps]]
On the night of 29/30 May 1942, Brill's was one of 27 aircraft detailed to bomb the [[Gnome et Rhône]], [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company|Thomson Houston]], and [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]] factories in the Paris suburb of [[Gennevilliers]]. The crews were required to have good visibility of the target area before bombing, to ensure accuracy and reduce civilian casualties. Due to foul weather over the [[English Channel|Channel]], Brill flew at an altitude of less than {{convert|200|ft|m|disp=5}} until crossing the French coast. The clouds had begun to clear over Paris and searchlights swept the sky, accompanied by heavy anti-aircraft fire. Most of the bombers released their loads from between {{convert|4000|and|8000|ft|m}}, but Brill dropped to {{convert|1500|ft|m}} before making his attack. With the bomb bay doors open, his Wellington was struck by flak, damaging the hydraulics and rear gun turret, and leaving one of the {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs hanging after the others dropped on target. Returning to England through more bad weather, he spotted an emergency landing ground and brought the crippled Wellington down with the bomb doors still open and one tyre flat; the plane was later scrapped. Brill's was the only one of four Wellingtons from No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron to find the target area and successfully attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson p.26-27&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070685--1-.PDF ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp. 309–310]&lt;/ref&gt;  For his &quot;splendid courage and determination&quot; in pressing home the assault, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] on 26&amp;nbsp;June,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068963/RCDIG1068963--195-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross |publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35609|supp=yes|startpage=2818|date=26 June 1942|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first pilot in his squadron to be decorated.&lt;ref name=&quot;460Sqn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson p.26-27&quot; /&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron participated in [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|1,000-bomber raids against Cologne]], [[Essen]] and [[Bremen]] in May and June 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;460Sqn&quot; /&gt; Brill was promoted to acting [[flight lieutenant]] in July, and completed his first tour of operations, numbering 31 sorties, on 11&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/people/P10679732/#timeline |title=Group Captain William Lloyd Brill|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.27-30&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; He was seconded to the RAF as an instructor in November 1942, returning to No.&amp;nbsp;27 Operational Training Unit at Lichfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.27-30&quot; /&gt; He spent the next eleven months there, leading a training [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] and gaining promotion to acting [[squadron leader]] in April 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.27-30&quot; /&gt; In August, he was best man at the wedding of his friend and fellow RAAF pilot, Arthur Doubleday. The press would come to refer to the pair as the &quot;Flying Twins&quot;, as their wartime careers closely paralleled one another—both men came from the Riverina district, joined the Air Force together on [[Remembrance Day]] 1940, arrived in England in August 1941, flew Wellingtons in No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron, volunteered for second tours in Bomber Command, and received many decorations and promotions in tandem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.27-30&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47698768 |title=DSO for second &quot;Flying Twin&quot; |newspaper=[[Army (newspaper)|Army News]] |location=Darwin, Northern Territory |date=7 August 1944 |accessdate= 16 April 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubleday would go on to survive the war and become active in civil aviation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.52-53&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second tour of operations===
[[File:463 Squadron RAAF Lancaster taking off August 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|No. 463 Squadron Lancaster, RAF Waddington|alt=Four-engined, twin-finned military aircraft taking off]]
Having volunteered for his second tour, Brill underwent conversion to [[Handley Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers in the last months of 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.27-30&quot; /&gt; In the new year, he was appointed a flight commander in [[No.&amp;nbsp;463 Squadron RAAF]], operating Lancasters out of [[RAF Waddington]], Lincolnshire. Waddington was also home to another Australian squadron, [[No. 467 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;467]], and Brill took an active part in the station's raucous mess life.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother Vic, who had joined the RAAF in 1941, was in the same squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.52-53&quot; /&gt; Brill returned to combat in the middle of the [[Battle of Berlin (RAF campaign)|Battle of Berlin]], flying his first sortie to the &quot;Big City&quot; on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.33-36&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50%, but loss rates during the Battle of Berlin were far higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill took off for his second mission to Berlin on 27&amp;nbsp;January. The Lancaster he flew was said to be jinxed, possessed of an engine that lost power in the air but always tested well on the ground, and suffering oxygen failure that killed its rear gunner on the previous sortie. One of the engines did begin to falter before Brill reached Berlin, forcing him to fly lower than normal. Having released his bombs over target, he felt the plane take several strikes that he assumed were anti-aircraft fire, but were in fact the [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]] of a Lancaster flying above. His aircraft's nose, rudder controls, and electricals were all severely damaged, and the [[Port and starboard|port]] wing was on fire. Having warned his crew to prepare to bail out, Brill dived the Lancaster and succeeded in putting out the flames. The crew was able to remain on board and, after a nine-hour flight, the plane landed back at Waddington. Brill's verdict on the mission was, as he later wrote, &quot;not my idea of an evening's entertainment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.33-36&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070696--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 645]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a total of eleven operations during the Battle of Berlin, including Bomber Command's costliest raid of the war, against [[Nuremberg]] in March. On that occasion, one of his engines failed and another was damaged when he had to fly through a cloud of debris from a Lancaster that was blown to pieces directly in his path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.33-36&quot; /&gt;

[[File:SUK12496Brill1944.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wing Commander Brill as commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron RAAF, July 1944|alt=Half portrait of man in dark military uniform with peaked cap]]
By April 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;463 Squadron had begun to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of the continent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.37-38&quot;&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;463Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 130–133&lt;/ref&gt; On 8&amp;nbsp;May, Brill was the bombing controller for a raid on an airfield near [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The controller was required to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. By the time Brill had completed this task and gone in himself to attack, the ground defences were fully alert and peppered his Lancaster with 140 bullet holes, but he refused to take evasive action until he had delivered his bombload.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.37-38&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070702--1-.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 13–21]&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to acting [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]], Brill assumed control of No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron on 12&amp;nbsp;May, following the death in combat of its previous commanding officer, Group Captain [[John Balmer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;467Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 144–147&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the RAAF in World War&amp;nbsp;II]], Brill &quot;proved a very worthy successor to Balmer both in administration and in the dashing type of leadership which had brought the Waddington squadrons to the fore in [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Group]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070702--1-.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 38]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 19&amp;nbsp;May for &quot;leadership, skill and gallantry of the highest order&quot; and &quot;his determination to make every sortie a success&quot; in spite of frequent damage to his aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068963/RCDIG1068963--193-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Distinguished Service Order |publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue= 36521|supp=yes|startpage=2289|date=19 May 1944|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early the next month he led No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron in raids on Axis radar stations in northern France.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070702--1-.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 34–35]&lt;/ref&gt; The unit [[Australian contribution to the Battle of Normandy|was in action on D-Day]] over [[Pointe du Hoc]] and, later, clearing a corridor for Allied troops advancing up the [[Cherbourg peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;467Sqn&quot; /&gt;

On the night of 4/5&amp;nbsp;July, Nos.&amp;nbsp;463 and 467 Squadrons bombed supply depots for [[V-weapons]] near [[Saint-Leu-d'Esserent]]. Brill's Lancaster was attacked by three German [[night fighter]]s, but he was able to evade them with only a few bullets striking his plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070708--1-.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 180–181]&lt;/ref&gt; His &quot;fine leadership and courage&quot; during the action earned him a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC; the award was promulgated in ''[[The London Gazette]]'' on 16&amp;nbsp;January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068963/RCDIG1068963--194-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Flying Cross| publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36894|supp=yes|startpage=415|date=16 January 1945|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brill completed his second tour of operations later in July but stayed on to fly more missions, often mentoring less experienced crews. By now he had earned a reputation for being quite &quot;mad&quot;, as he would often circle back and check over his handiwork after a bombing run, rather than making his escape from the target area as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; During non-operational periods, he made a habit of taking a Lancaster on a so-called test flight to the southern border of Northern Ireland, where he and his crew would change into civilian clothes, cross into Ireland and stock up on food and liquor for a party back at Waddington; he always made a point of inviting the Air Officer Commanding [[RAAF Overseas Headquarters]], Air Vice Marshal [[Henry Wrigley]], to such events, which Wrigley attended without fail.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Skylarks'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Brill handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron on 12&amp;nbsp;October 1944, becoming the first man to survive his time as its leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;467Sqn&quot; /&gt; He had flown a total of 58 missions in Bomber Command when he returned to Australia in the new year. On 29&amp;nbsp;January 1945 he married Ilma Kitto, a teacher, at Ganmain's Methodist Church. The couple had been engaged since before the war; they later had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;, pp. 4, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill remained in the Air Force following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; From February 1946 to August 1947 he served as the first and only commanding officer of the RAAF's newly formed and soon-disbanded Heavy Bomber Crew Conversion Unit at [[RAAF Base East Sale|RAAF Station East Sale]], Victoria. Little support or direction on its use as a training facility was forthcoming from higher command, and in the summer months its [[Avro Lincoln]] bombers were employed in bushfire patrols over [[East Gippsland]], reporting 44 outbreaks in February 1947 alone.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; Brill transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in 1948,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; and reverted to the rank of squadron leader. In March 1949 he became the inaugural commanding officer of a re-formed [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]], which had been disbanded in 1945 after service throughout World War&amp;nbsp;II. In its new guise the squadron was established from the staff and facilities of RAAF Station Garbutt in [[Townsville]]. Brill's main tasks were organising to absorb or close surplus wartime facilities in North Queensland, and preparing No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron for [[search-and-rescue]] operations. The unit took delivery of its first four Lincoln [[Mark (designation)|Mk]] 30s in September 1949, and Brill handed over command the following January.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime Units'', pp. 8–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised to substantive wing commander, Brill served as a director at [[RAAF Staff College]] in [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]], Victoria, until his appointment as Staff Officer to the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal Sir [[Donald Hardman]], in March 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18249450 |title=RAAF officer for UK |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 March 1952 |accessdate= 16 April 2016 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48261692 |title=Personal |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=25 June 1953 |accessdate= 16 April 2016 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to command the [[Officers' Training School RAAF|Officer Training School]] (OTS) at [[RAAF Base Rathmines]], New South Wales, in December 1953. In this role he was also the commanding officer of the base.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26588080 |title=RAAF announces new postings|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=30 January 1954 |accessdate= 16 April 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; His title changed in May 1956 as Rathmines and OTS were reorganised under the newly established RAAF School of Ground Training, with Brill taking charge of the school until July.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Considered an empathetic leader, he then became Director of Personnel Services. Promoted to [[group captain]], Brill served throughout 1959 as commanding officer of [[Fairbairn, Canberra|RAAF Base Canberra]] before again being appointed Director of Personnel Services.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt; Active in local charities and youth organisations, he became a [[Freemason]] and in the early 1960s was assistant commissioner for the [[Canberra]]–[[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro]] Boy Scouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Highly decorated RAAF pilot dies at Campbell|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=13 October 1964 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1964 he assumed command of [[RAAF Base Townsville]], returning to Canberra that October for assignment to the Department of Air.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', pp. 160–163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1070431 |title=Brill, William Lloyd |work=World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate= 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his home in [[Campbell, Australian Capital Territory|Campbell]] on 12&amp;nbsp;October. Survived by his wife and children, Brill was buried in Canberra.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt; He is commemorated by Brill Place, in [[Gowrie, Australian Capital Territory|Gowrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/tools_resources/maps_land_survey/place_names/place_search?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYWN0bWFwaS5hY3QuZ292LmF1JTJGUGxhY2VOYW1lcyUyRlBsYWNlRGV0YWlscy5hc3B4JTNGb2JqZWN0SUQlM0Q2MjQ4JmFsbD0x |title=Brill Place |publisher=[[Australian Capital Territory Planning and Land Authority|ACT Planning and Land Authority]] |accessdate= 16 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319085650/http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/tools_resources/maps_land_survey/place_names/place_search?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYWN0bWFwaS5hY3QuZ292LmF1JTJGUGxhY2VOYW1lcyUyRlBsYWNlRGV0YWlscy5hc3B4JTNGb2JqZWN0SUQlM0Q2MjQ4JmFsbD0x |archivedate=19 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
