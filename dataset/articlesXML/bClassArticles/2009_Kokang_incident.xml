The '''Kokang incident''' was a violent conflict or series of [[skirmish]]es that broke out in August 2009 in [[Kokang]] in [[Myanmar]]'s northern [[Shan State]].&lt;ref name=BangkokPost&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/152806/more-fighting-feared-as-thousands-flee-burma | title=More fighting feared as thousands flee Burma | publisher=[[Bangkok Post]] | author=[[Agence France-Presse]] | date=27 August 2009 | accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several clashes between the Burmese [[military junta]] forces (including the [[Myanmar Armed Forces]], also known as [[Tatmadaw]], and the [[Myanmar Police Force]]) and ethnic minorities took place.&lt;ref name=NYTrefugees/&gt; As a result of the conflict, the [[MNDAA]] lost control of the area and as many as 30,000 [[refugee]]s fled to [[Yunnan]] province in neighbouring [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref name=CNN-2t&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/12/asia/myanmar-violence/ 47 Myanmar soldiers reported dead in clashes with Kokang rebels]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

===Background===
Before the events, the military government had a [[cease-fire]] with most of the region's ethnic groups since 1989.&lt;ref name=BangkokPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Since 2008, however, the military junta has proposed that the ethnic armies (so-called &quot;cease-fire groups&quot;&lt;ref name=renew/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web | last=Kate | first=Daniel Ten | date=28 August 2009 | accessdate=30 August 2009 | title=Myanmar Takes Rebel-Held Town Near China Oil Projects | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=anSfhGW8jick | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) be assimilated into the Tatmadaw and converted into &quot;border guards&quot;; most of the ethnic armies have opposed this.&lt;ref name=NYTrefugees/&gt;&lt;ref name=renew/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irrawaddy88/&gt; Some political analysts claim{{Who|date=January 2012}} that the junta's motivation for this proposal is to &quot;disarm&quot; and &quot;neutralize&quot;&lt;ref name=petty&gt;{{cite web | last=Petty | first=Martin | work=[[Reuters]] | date=29 August 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2009 | title=Q+A: Will fighting in northern Myanmar escalate? |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE57S0T020090829}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cease-fire groups before the [[Burmese general election, 2010|Burmese general election]] scheduled to take place sometime in 2010.&lt;ref name=NYTrefugees/&gt;&lt;ref name=magnier/&gt;

The Kokang Special region is a self-administrating area&lt;ref name=ngdsb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ngdsb.hinews.cn/html/2009-08/29/content_154639.htm | script-title=zh:果敢乱局当前 传“果敢王”已逃离 | date=29 August 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2009|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xinhua/&gt; in northern Shan State; it has been ruled by chairman [[Pheung Kya-shin]] (Peng Jiasheng, 彭家声) since its establishment in 1989,&lt;ref name=notshootfirst&gt;{{cite web|title=Kokang capital falls: &quot;Not shoot first&quot; policy under fire |url=http://www.shanland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2695:kokang-capital-falls-not-shoot-first-policy-under-fire&amp;catid=86:war&amp;Itemid=284 |work=[[Shan Herald]] |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902153753/http://www.shanland.org:80/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2695:kokang-capital-falls-not-shoot-first-policy-under-fire&amp;catid=86:war&amp;Itemid=284 |archivedate=2 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is populated mostly by [[Kokang people]] (果敢), the name for [[Han Chinese]] living in Myanmar. Since its inception, Kokang has been implicated in the [[illegal drug trade]] and [[Drug trafficking|trafficking]]&lt;ref name=renew/&gt;&lt;ref name=bodeen/&gt; as well as [[gambling]]&lt;ref name=crossinto/&gt; and prostitution.&lt;ref name=bodeen&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | last=Bodeen | first=Christopher | url=http://www.canadaeast.com/news/article/774873 | title=Fighting in Myanmar sending refugees to China, underscoring Beijing's border woes | date=28 August 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crossinto/&gt;

Kokang has its own army, the [[Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army]] (MNDAA), not to be confused with the [[National Democratic Alliance Army]] (or Mongla Group). The MNDAA reportedly has about 1,000&lt;ref name=ET/&gt; to 1,500&lt;ref name=magnier/&gt; soldiers. Recently there has been an inter-faction split within the army,&lt;ref name=renew/&gt; with Pheung being opposed by deputy chairman Bai Suoqian—while Pheung has opposed efforts to integrate the Kokang army with the Tatmadaw, Bai has supported it and gained the junta's backing.&lt;ref name=ET/&gt; According to the newspaper ''[[Shan Herald]]'', several factions of the Kokang army have become loyal to the junta,&lt;ref name=notshootfirst/&gt; and three high-ranking army officials informed the junta government that Pheung was secretly producing illicit weapons and drugs.&lt;ref name=ploy/&gt;
