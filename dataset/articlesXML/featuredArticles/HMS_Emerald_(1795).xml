'''HMS''' '''''Emerald''''' was a 36-gun {{sclass-|Amazon|frigate (1795)|0}} [[frigate]] that Sir William Rule designed in 1794 for the [[Royal Navy]]. The [[Admiralty]] ordered her construction towards the end of May 1794 and work began the following month at [[Northfleet]] dockyard. She was completed on 12 October 1795 and joined [[Admiral]] [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis's]] fleet in the [[Mediterranean]].

In 1797, ''Emerald'' was one of several vessels sent to hunt down and capture the crippled [[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Santísima Trinidad|Santisima Trinidad]], which had escaped from the British at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]]. ''Emerald'' was supposed to have been present at the [[Battle of the Nile]] but in May 1798 a storm separated her from [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]'s [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] and she arrived in [[Abu Qir Bay|Aboukir Bay]] nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Thomas Duckworth's]] squadron during the [[Action of 7 April 1800]] off [[Cadiz]].

''Emerald'' served in the [[Caribbean]] throughout 1803 in [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]]'s fleet, then took part in the invasion of [[St Lucia]] in July, and of [[Suriname|Surinam]] the following spring. Returning to home waters for repairs in 1806, she served in the [[western approaches]] before joining a fleet under Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|James Gambier]] in 1809, and taking part in the [[Battle of the Basque Roads]]. In November 1811 she sailed to [[Portsmouth]] where she was [[laid up in ordinary]]. Fitted out as a [[receiving ship]] in 1822, she was eventually [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in January 1836.

== Construction ==

''Emerald'' was a 36-gun, 18-pound, ''Amazon''-class frigate built to William Rule's design.{{#tag:ref|The original Amazon-class frigates were 32-gun, 12 pounder, frigates of  677 tons (bm), designed by Sir John Williams and built between 1771 and 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield pp.193-196&lt;/ref&gt; In need of a larger frigate,  in 1794, the Admiralty asked Sir William Rule to design a 36-gun, 18 pounder, Amazon-class frigate. Originally a series of four, by the time the first one had been launched in 1795, Rule had already drawn up plans for Naiad; an expanded version which was larger at 1,013 tons (bm), had a complement of 284 men and carried 38 guns.&lt;ref name=Win/&gt; A third design was unveiled in 1796, also with 38 guns but larger still at 1,038 tons (bm) and with a crew of 300 men. Two were ordered, one in April 1796 and a second in February 1797.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield pp.150-151&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=Win&gt;Winfield p.148&lt;/ref&gt; She and her sister ship, {{HMS|Amazon|1795|2}}, were ordered on 24 May 1794 and were built to the same dimensions: {{convert|143|ft|2+1/2|in|1}} along the [[gun deck]], {{convert|119|ft|5+1/2|in|m|1}} at the [[keel#structural keels|keel]], with a beam of {{convert|38|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a depth in the hold of {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|1}}. They measured 933 {{small|{{frac|67|94}}}} [[tons burthen]].&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;

''Emerald'' was completed at Thomas Pitcher's dockyard in Northfleet at a cost of £14,419 and launched on 31 July 1795, twenty-seven days after ''Amazon''. Her [[Copper sheathing|coppering]] at [[Woolwich]] was finished on 12 October 1795 and she was [[Fitting-out|fitted-out]] at a further cost of £9,390.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt; The Admiralty ordered a second pair of ''Amazon''-class ships on 24 January 1795. They were marginally smaller at 925{{small|{{frac|87|94}}}} tons (bm) and were built from [[Pinus rigida|pitch pine]].&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;{{#tag:ref|The second pair of ''Amazon''s were named ''Trent'' and ''Glenmore'' and were launched in 1796 on 24 February and 24 March respectively.&lt;ref name=Win/&gt;|group=Note}}

== Service ==

=== Mediterranean ===

[[File:CombateDeSanVicenteElNavíoPelayoAcudeEnAuxilioDelNavíoSantísimaTrinidad.jpg|thumb|''Santisima Trinidad'' being rescued at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. ''Emerald'' was one of the British frigates sent out to track her down afterwards.]]

''Emerald'' was first [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in August 1795, under Captain [[Velters Cornewall Berkeley]] and in January 1797, she sailed for the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=Win /&gt; Spain had become allied to France and declared war on Britain in October 1796. Early in 1797, a Spanish fleet of 27 [[ships of the line]] was at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] with orders to join the French fleet at Brest. A storm blew the Spanish fleet off course, enabling [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Admiral John Jervis']] fleet of 15 ships of the line to intercept it off Cape St Vincent on 14 February.&lt;ref&gt;Willis pp.89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Although attached to Jervis' fleet at the time, as a frigate ''Emerald'' was too lightly built to take part in the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]]; instead she anchored in nearby [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos Bay]] with other vessels.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;&lt;ref name=JII49 /&gt;

On 16 February, the victorious British fleet and its [[prize ship|prizes]] entered the bay. Jervis ordered the three frigates—''Emerald'', {{ship|French frigate|Minerve|1794|2}}, and {{HMS|Niger|1759|2}}, of 40 and 32 guns respectively—to search for the disabled flagship, ''Santisima Trinidad'', which had been towed from the battle. Two smaller craft—[[HMS Bonne Citoyenne (1796)|''Bonne-Citoyenne'']], a [[corvette]] of 20 guns, and the 14-gun sloop {{HMS|Raven|1796|2}}—joined the frigates.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;&lt;ref name=JII49 /&gt; The British squadron on 20 February sighted ''Santissima Trinidad'' under tow by a large frigate and in the company of a [[brig]]. Berkeley, considering the small squadron under his command insufficient, declined to engage and eventually the Spanish ships sailed from sight.{{#tag:ref|Berkeley's reluctance to attack infuriated some of his fellow officers who asked for a court-martial. ''Minerve''{{'}}s captain, George Cockburn, however came down on Berkeley's side, opining to Jervis that, under a [[jury rig]], ''Santassima Trinidad'' was still capable of making a defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Ralfe |title=Volume 3 of The Naval Biography of Great Britain: Consisting of Historical Memoirs of Those Officers of the British Navy who Distinguished Themselves During the Reign of His Majesty George III |publisher= Whitmore &amp; Fenn |location=London |year=1828|page=266|oclc=561188819}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} The 32-gun {{HMS|Terpsichore|1785|6}}, while cruising alone, later located ''Santissima Trinidad'' and engaged her but the out-gunned British frigate was forced to abandon her attack.&lt;ref name=JII49&gt;James (Vol.II) p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Action of 26 April 1797 ====
{{Main article|Action of 26 April 1797}}

Following the Battle of Cape St Vincent, the British pursued the remainder of the Spanish fleet to [[Cádiz|Cadiz]], where Jervis began a long-running blockade of the port.&lt;ref&gt;Dull pp. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April, while cruising in the company of the 74-gun {{HMS|Irresistible|1782|2}}, ''Emerald'' helped to capture a 34-gun Spanish ship and to destroy another.&lt;ref name=Wood99 /&gt; The Spanish vessels were close to the coast when Jervis's fleet sighted them. Sent to investigate, ''Emerald'' and ''Irresistible'', under Captain [[George Martin (Royal Navy officer)|George Martin]], discovered the ships were the frigates {{ship|Spanish frigate|Santa Elena|1783|2}} and {{ship|Spanish frigate|Ninfa|1795|2}}&lt;ref name=CIV507&gt;Clowes (Vol.IV) p.507&lt;/ref&gt;—the Spanish ships had been carrying silver from [[Havana]] to Cadiz, but had transferred their cargo the previous night to a fishing boat that had warned them of the proximity of the British fleet.&lt;ref name=Wood99&gt;Woodman p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish ships sought shelter from the British north of Trafalgar in [[Conil de la Frontera|Conil Bay]], the entrance to which was protected by a large rocky ledge. ''Irresistible'' and ''Emerald'' negotiated this obstacle at around 14:30 and engaged the Spanish ships, which were anchored in the Bay.&lt;ref name=JII82&gt;James (Vol.II) p.82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G14010&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=14010|startpage=446|date=16 May 1797|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish ships surrendered at approximately 16:00. Eighteen Spaniards were killed and 30 wounded during the fighting; one Briton was killed and one wounded.&lt;ref name=G14010 /&gt; The remaining crew of ''Santa Elena'' avoided capture by cutting her [[Hawser|cable]]s and drifting her on shore so they could flee on foot. The British managed to drag ''Santa Elena'' off the beach but, badly damaged, she sank at sea.&lt;ref name=JII82 /&gt;&lt;ref name=G14010 /&gt;

The British took ''Ninfa'' into service as HMS ''Hamadryad'', a 36-gun frigate with a main [[Gun battery|battery]] of 12-pounders,&lt;ref name=CIV507 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JII83&gt;James (Vol.II) p.83&lt;/ref&gt; but were unable to retrieve the cargo of silver, which later arrived safely in Cadiz.&lt;ref name=Wood99 /&gt;

==== Second bombardment of Cadiz ====
{{Main article|Assault on Cádiz (1797)}}
Captain [[Thomas Waller (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Waller]] took command of ''Emerald'' in mid-1797, and was stationed with Admiral Jervis' fleet off Cadiz.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;&lt;ref name=G14032&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=14032|startpage=717|date=29 July 1797|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July, Jervis attempted to end the protracted blockade by ordering a bombardment of the town. A first attempt resulted in the capture of two Spanish mortar boats but achieved little else.&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol.II) pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; During a second bombardment on the night of 5 July, ''Emerald'', in the company of ''Terpsichore'' and the 74-gun {{HMS|Theseus|1786|2}}, provided a protective escort for three bomb vessels, {{HMS|Thunder|1797|2}}, {{HMS|Terror|1779|2}}, and {{HMS|Strombolo|1797|2}}. This attack caused considerable damage; the next morning, the Spanish hurriedly moved ten of their line-of-battle ships out of range.&lt;ref name=JII54&gt;James (Vol.II) p.54&lt;/ref&gt; The British cancelled a third bombardment, planned for 8 July, when the weather became unfavourable.&lt;ref name=G14032 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JII54 /&gt;

==== Attack on Santa Cruz ====
[[File:Ataque británico en Santa Cruz de Tenerife.jpg|thumb|The British attack on Santa Cruz de Tenerife, painted in 1848 by Francisco de Aguilar]]
{{Main article|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)}}

Later in July 1797, ''Emerald'' took part in an unsuccessful attack on [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=Win /&gt; A planned attack in April, proposed by [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], had been aborted as the troops required to execute it were unavailable. When Jervis was subsequently advised that the Spanish treasure fleet was anchored there, he revived Nelson's idea.&lt;ref name=H181&gt;Heathcote p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

For the new attack, Nelson was to take three ships of the line, three frigates, including ''Emerald'', and 200 [[marines]], for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;&lt;ref name=H181 /&gt; The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.&lt;ref name=H182&gt;Heathcote p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attack, Nelson sent ''Emerald'' with his report to Jervis, who in turn sent her on to England with dispatches. Waller arrived at the [[Admiralty]] on 1 September, with the news of the failed attacks.&lt;ref name=G14041&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=14041|startpage=835|date=2 September 1797|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alexandria ====

While serving with Jervis on the [[Lisbon]] station in December 1797, ''Emerald'', under the temporary command of [[William Proby, Lord Proby|Lord William Proby]], captured the 8-gun [[privateer]], ''Chasseur Basque''. Waller returned as captain in April 1798.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt; In May, Jervis dispatched a squadron of five ships, including ''Emerald'' and commanded by Nelson in the 74-gun {{HMS|Vanguard|1787|2}}, to locate a large invasion fleet that had left [[Toulon]].&lt;ref name=JII148&gt;James (Vol.II) p.148&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In addition to ''Emerald'' and ''Vanguard'', the squadron comprised ''Terpsichore'', ''Bonne-Citoyenne'', and the 74-gun {{HMS|Orion|1787|2}}. It left [[Gibraltar]] on 9 May 1798.&lt;ref name=JII148/&gt;|group=Note}} After receiving intelligence on 22 May, Nelson correctly predicted the French fleet's destination and set course for [[Alexandria]]&lt;ref name=JII154&gt;James (Vol.II) p.154&lt;/ref&gt; where the British captured or destroyed all but two of the French ships at the [[Battle of the Nile]], which occurred between 1–3 August 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Willis p.168&lt;/ref&gt; ''Emerald'' missed the battle; having previously become separated from the rest of the squadron in a storm on 21 May,&lt;ref name=JII148/&gt; she arrived at [[Abu Qir Bay|Aboukir Bay]] on 12 August.&lt;ref name=JII183&gt;James (Vol.II) p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nelson left for Naples on 19 August 1798, he left behind a squadron—comprising three [[Seventy-four (ship)|74s]] {{HMS|Zealous|1785|2}}, {{HMS|Goliath|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Swiftsure|1787|2}}, three frigates ''Emerald'', {{HMS|Seahorse|1794|2}}, and {{HMS|Alcmene|1794|2}}, and the corvette ''Bonne Citoyenne''—under [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]] to patrol the waters around the port and along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes (Vol.IV) p.373&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September, it encountered and destroyed the French [[aviso]] ''Anémone''.{{#tag:ref|''Anemone'' was the [[tartane]] ''Cincinnatus'', which the [[French Navy]] had commissioned in June 1794 as an aviso, and renamed in May 1795. Her armament consisted of two 6-pounder and two 4-pounder guns, and four [[swivel gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; which had left Toulon on 27 July and [[Malta]] on 26 August.&lt;ref name=LG15082&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15082|startpage=1110|date=20 November 1798|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=LG15082&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15082|startpage=1110|date=20 November 1798|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emerald'' and ''Seahorse'' chased ''Anemone'' inshore, where she anchored in shallow water out of their reach. When they launched their boats to cut-out ''Anėmone'', her crew cut the anchor cable and their ship drifted on to the shore; as the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, hostile Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. A heavy surf prevented the British boats from landing, so a midshipman from ''Emerald'', the young [[Francis Fane (Royal Navy officer)|Francis Fane]], swam ashore with a line and empty cask to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach.&lt;ref name=LG15082 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol.II) pp.192-193&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Arabs captured some 17 to 20 survivors (accounts differ), and offered them to General [[Jean Baptiste Kléber|Kleber]], who ransomed them.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern (2009), pp. 223–225.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Anėmone'' had a crew of 60 men under the command of [[Ensign (rank)#France and Canada|''Enseigne de Vaisseau'']] (Ensign) Garibou,&lt;ref&gt;''Fonds Marine'', p.210.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, [[Aide-de-Camp]] to General [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed.&lt;ref name=LG15082 /&gt;{{#tag:ref|Adjutant General Jean-Baptiste Camin (1760-1798), came from Calais. After his death, the French erected a small fort on the outskirts of Cairo and named it in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Fort Camin du Caire et l'Adjudant Général Camin (1760-1798), de Calais'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Emerald'' remained stationed off Alexandria for the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;

==== Action on 18 June 1799 ====
{{Main article|Action of 18 June 1799}}

''Emerald'' and ''Minerve'', while cruising together on 2 June, took ''Caroline'', a 16-gun French privateer, off the south-east coast of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref name=G15162-740&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=740|issue=15162|date=23 July 1799|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G15162-741&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=741|issue=15162|date=23 July 1799|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ''Emerald'' assisted in the capture of {{ship|French frigate|Junon|1786|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Alceste|1780|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Courageuse|1778|2}}, [[Spanish brig Infante (1787)|''Salamine'']], and {{ship|French brig|Alerte|1787|2}} in the [[Action of 18 June 1799]].&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;&lt;ref name=G15162-741 /&gt; The British fleet under [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]] was some 69 miles off Cape Sicié when three French frigates and two brigs were spotted. Elphinstone engaged them with three seventy-fours, {{HMS|Centaur|1797|2}}, {{HMS|Bellona|1760|2}} and {{HMS|Captain|1787|2}}, and two frigates, ''Emerald'' and {{HMS|Santa Teresa||2}}.&lt;ref name=JII262&gt;James (Vol.II) p.262&lt;/ref&gt; The next evening, after a 28-hour chase, the French ships were forced into an action. The French squadron had scattered, enabling the British to attack it piecemeal. ''Bellona'' fired the first shots at 19:00 as she, ''Captain'', and the two frigates closed with ''Junon'' and ''Alceste'', both of which [[striking the colors|struck their colours]] immediately. ''Bellona'' then joined ''Centaur'' in chasing ''Courageuse''. Faced with overwhelming odds, ''Courageuse'' also surrendered. ''Emerald'' then overhauled ''Salamine'', and ''Captain'' took ''Alerte'' at around 23:30.&lt;ref name=G15162-741 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tr164&gt;Troude (1867),  Vol. 3, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth (1748-1817).jpg|thumb|right|Rear-Admiral John Duckworth, commander of the squadron blockading Cadiz, of which ''Emerald'' was a part when she fought in the Action of 7 April 1800]]

''Emerald'' returned to blockade duty at Cadiz in April 1800, joining a squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Thomas Duckworth]] that included the 74-gun ships {{HMS|Leviathan|1790|2}} and ''Swiftsure'', and the [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|2}}. The squadron sighted a Spanish convoy on 5 April, which comprised 13 merchant vessels and three accompanying frigates, and at once gave chase.&lt;ref name=JIII37&gt;James (Vol.III) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; At 03:00 the following day, ''Emerald'' managed to overhaul and cross the bow of a 10-gun merchantman, which, having nowhere to go, immediately surrendered.&lt;ref name=G15253-421&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=421|issue=15253|date=29 April 1800|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By daybreak, the remainder of the Spanish convoy had scattered and the only ship visible was a 14-gun brig, ''Los Anglese''. The absence of wind prevented the becalmed British vessels approaching her. Instead, ''Leviathan'' and ''Emerald'' lowered boats that rowed towards the brig, which they captured after a short exchange of fire.&lt;ref name=JIII37 /&gt;&lt;ref name=G15253-421/&gt;

Other sails were now spotted in the east, west and south, forcing the British to divide their force: ''Swiftsure'' went south, ''Emerald'' east, and ''Leviathan'' west.&lt;ref name=JIII37 /&gt; At midday, ''Emerald'' signalled that there were six vessels to the north-east, and ''Leviathan'' [[Wearing ship|wore round]] to pursue. By dusk, the two British ships had nine Spanish craft in sight. Three ships were seen at midnight to the north-north-west, and by 02:00 the following morning, two had been identified as the enemy frigates {{HMS|Carmen|1800|2}} and {{HMS|Florentina|1800|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol.III) pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Duckworth ordered ''Emerald'' to take a parallel course to the enemy frigates in anticipation of a dawn attack, and at first light, the British closed with their opponents.&lt;ref name=JIII38 /&gt;

The Spaniards had assumed the approaching vessels were part of their convoy, but by daybreak they had realised their error and vainly set more sail to escape. Being close enough to hail the Spanish crews, Duckworth ordered that they surrender. When the Spaniards ignored the demand, he ordered ''Leviathan'' and ''Emerald'' to open fire on the rigging of the Spanish vessels in order to disable them. Both Spanish frigates quickly surrendered.&lt;ref name=JIII38&gt;James (Vol.III) p.38&lt;/ref&gt; ''Carmen'' had had 11 men killed and 16 wounded; ''Florentina'' 12 killed and 10 wounded, including her first and second captains. The two Spanish frigates were each carrying 1500 [[quintal]]s of mercury.&lt;ref name=G15253-423/&gt;

A third frigate was visible on the horizon. ''Emerald'' immediately set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The need to make the two captured frigates ready to sail delayed ''Leviathan'', and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape.&lt;ref name=JIII38 /&gt; ''Leviathan'' then returned to rendezvous with ''Emerald'', managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed for [[Gibraltar]] with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered ''Incendiary'', which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own.&lt;ref name=G15253-422&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=422|issue=15253|date=29 April 1800|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.&lt;ref name=G15253-423&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=423|issue=15253|date=29 April 1800|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G15253-422 /&gt;

Britain declared war on France in May 1803 following the short-lived [[Peace of Amiens]] and by June, ''Emerald'', under the command of Captain James O'Bryen, had joined Samuel Hood's squadron in the [[Leeward Islands]]. Prior to the British invasion of [[St Lucia]] on 21 June, she harassed enemy shipping, disrupting the island's resupply.&lt;ref name=G15605-918 /&gt;

The invasion force left [[Barbados]] on 20 June. It comprised Hood's 74-gun flagship {{HMS|Centaur|1797|2}}, the 74-gun {{HMS|Courageux|1800|2}}, the frigates {{HMS|Argo|1781|2}} and ''Chichester'', and the [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] {{HMS|Hornet|1794|2}} and {{HMS|Cyane|1796|2}}. The following morning, ''Emerald'' and the 18-gun sloop {{HMS|Osprey|1797|2}} had joined them. By 11:00, the squadron was anchored in [[Choc Bay]].&lt;ref name=G15605-918 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clowes (Vol.V) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The troops were landed by 17:00 and half an hour later the town of [[Castries]] was in British hands.&lt;ref name=JIII207 /&gt; In the island's main fortress, Morne-Fortunée, the French troops refused to surrender; the British stormed it at 04:00 on 22 June, and by 04:30 St Lucia was in British hands. Following this easy victory, the British sent a force to [[Tobago]], which capitulated on 1 July.&lt;ref name=JIII207&gt;James (Vol.III) p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emerald'' was between St Lucia and Martinique on 24 June, when she captured the 16-gun French privateer [[HMS Saint Lucia (1803)|''Enfant Prodigue'']] after a 72-hour chase. The French vessel was under the command of ''[[lieutenant de vaisseau]]'' Victor Lefbru and was carrying dispatches for Martinique.&lt;ref name=G15605-918&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=918|endpage=919|issue=15605|date=26 July 1803|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy took ''Enfant Prodigue'' into service as HMS St Lucia.&lt;ref name=Win3&gt;Winfield p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the company of the 22-gun brig {{HMS|Heureux|1800|6}}, ''Emerald'' intercepted and captured a Dutch merchant vessel travelling between [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Surinam]] and [[Amsterdam]] on 10 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;G15669-109&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=109|issue=15669|date=24 January 1804|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September, she captured two French schooners,&lt;ref name=&quot;G15669-110&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=110|issue=15669|date=24 January 1804|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later that month took part in attacks on [[Berbice]], [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] and [[Demarara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1329|issue=16505|date=16 July 1811|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fort Diamond ====

''Emerald''{{'}}s first lieutenant, Thomas Forest, commanded the 6-gun [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Fort Diamond||2}} on 13 March 1804 when, with 30 of ''Emerald''{{'}}s crew aboard, she captured a French privateer off [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique]].&lt;ref name=G15697-539&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=539|issue=15697|date=28 April 1804|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary winds prevented the privateer, ''Mosambique'', from entering St Pierre and she had sought shelter beneath the batteries at Seron.&lt;ref name=JIII253&gt;James (Vol.III) p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''Emerald'' was too far downwind, Captain O'Bryen used boats and crew from ''Emerald'' to create a diversion and draw fire from the battery while ''Fort Diamond'' approached from the opposite direction, rounded Pearl Rock (some two miles off the coast), and bore down on ''Mosambique''.&lt;ref name=G15697-539 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JIII253 /&gt; Forest put the cutter alongside with such force that a chain securing the privateer to the shore snapped. The 60-man French crew abandoned their vessel and swam ashore.&lt;ref name=JIII253 /&gt; The Royal Navy took {{HMS|Mosambique|1804|2}} into service.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield p.364&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Capture of Surinam ====

[[File:AMH-8054-KB Map of Surinam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|1773 map of the Dutch colony of Surinam showing the respective positions of the Surinam and Commewine rivers, Warapee Creek, Braam's point, and the forts Leyden and New Amsterdam]]

In the spring of 1804, ''Emerald'' and her crew took part in an invasion of [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Surinam]]. The invasion force consisted of Hood's flagship {{HMS|Centaur|1797|2}}, ''Emerald'', the 44-gun heavy frigates [[Hector (1784 ship)|''Pandour'']] and {{HMS|Serapis|1782|2}}, the 28-gun [[sixth-rate]] {{HMS|Alligator|1787|2}}, the 12-gun [[schooner]] {{HMS|Unique|1804|2}}, the 12-gun [[corvette]] {{HMS|Hippomenes|1803|2}}, and the 8-gun [[Earl of Mornington (1799 ship)|''Drake'']], together with 2,000 troops under [[Brigadier-General]] Sir Charles Green. The force arrived from Barbados on 25 April after a twenty-two-day journey.&lt;ref name=LG15712&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15712|date=19 June 1804|startpage=761|endpage=762|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol III) pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; The sloop ''Hippomenes'', a transport and a further three armed vessels, landed [[Frederick Maitland|Brigadier-General Frederick Maitland]] and 700 troops at Warapee Creek on the night of 30 April. The following night, O'Bryen was ordered to assist Brigadier-general Hughes in the taking of Braam's Point. A sandbar initially prevented ''Emerald'' from entering the [[Surinam River]] but O'Bryen forced her across on the rising tide, with ''Pandour'' and ''Drake'' following. Anchoring close by, the three British ships quickly put the Dutch battery of 18-pounders out of action and captured the fort without loss of life.&lt;ref name=LG15712 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JIII-289&gt;James (Vol.III) P.289&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emerald'', ''Pandour'', and ''Drake'' then pushed up the river, sometimes in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived close to the forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching under the cover of the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts.&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol.III) pp. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the [[Commewijne River|Commewine River]], and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.&lt;ref name=JIII-290&gt;James (Vol.III) p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emerald'' captured the vessel ''Augusta'', which was under American colours, on 22 August and sent her into Antigua with the cargo of wine that she had been carrying from [[Livorno|Leghorn]] to Guadeloupe.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lloyd's List]]'' n° 4506.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1804/11-16-1804.jpg] - accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Emerald'' left [[Tortola]] on 26 October as escort to a convoy of 50 vessels for England but having parted from them in a storm, she put into Madeira in distress on 11 December.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lloyd's List]]'' n° 4513.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1804/12-11-1804.jpg] - accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lloyd's List]]'' n° 4185.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1805/01-22-1805.jpg] - accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service on the Home Station ===
Between February and June 1806, ''Emerald'' underwent repairs at [[Deptford dockyard]] and was recommissioned under Captain John Armour; [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|Frederick Lewis Maitland]] assumed command in the first quarter of 1807.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt; While in the [[Basque Roads]] in April, ''Emerald'' captured the 14-gun privateer ''Austerlitz'', a brig from Nantes under the command of Captain Gatien Lafont.&lt;ref&gt;Demerliac (2004), n° 2190, p.278.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Emerald'', while escorting a Spanish [[Xebec|polacca]] that she had taken, spotted and captured the privateer on 14 April after a ten-hour chase.&lt;ref name=Win/&gt;&lt;ref name=G16023-533&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=533|issue=16023|date=25 April 1807|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Austerlitz'' had been out of port two days but had made no captures; the polacca was the Spanish ship ''Prince of Asturias'', which had sailed from [[La Guaira|La Guayra]] with a cargo of cocoa, bark and indigo. ''Emerald'' sent both prizes into Plymouth, where they arrived on 22 April. ''Emerald'' herself set off in pursuit of another vessel from La Guayra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1807/04-24-1807.jpg ''Lloyd's List'', n°4146 – accessed 11 November 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|''Prince of Asturias'' was sold as a prize with the buyer being &quot;McCarthy&quot;.

''Emerald'' recaptured ''Zulema'' which had been plundered and taken by a French privateer as she sailed from Philadelphia to Liverpool. She arrived in Plymouth under her master, Mr Howard, on 4 May.&lt;ref name=LZ&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4150.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1807/05-08-1807.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; During December, Plymouth received more of ''Emerald's'' captures. At the beginning of the month, ''Young Elias'' was detained. Her master Monsieur Delance, had been sailing from Philadelphia to Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4210.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1807/12-11-1807.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December, Mr Seaton's vessel, ''Friendship'' was caught returning from France.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'' n°4215,[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005721488?urlappend=%3Bseq=215] - accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Apropos'' ====

''Emerald''{{'}}s boats participated in a [[Naval boarding|cutting-out expedition]] in [[Viveiro]] harbour on 13 March 1808. While cruising inshore at around 17:00, ''Emerald'' spotted a large French schooner, ''Apropos'',{{#tag:ref|Sometimes referred to as ''Apropus''.|group=Note}} of 250 tons (bm), anchored in the bay. ''Apropos'' was armed with twelve 8-pounder guns, though pierced for 16, and had a crew of more than 70 men under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Lagary.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

The crews of the schooner and of the two batteries guarding the harbour had seen ''Emerald'' but Maitland still made plans to attack ''Apropos''.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;&lt;ref name=G16130-416&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=416|issue=16130|date=22 March 1808|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon discovered it was not possible to place ''Emerald'' so as to engage both enemy batteries simultaneously, and instead sent landing parties to silence the guns, which had been firing on his ship since 17:30.&lt;ref name=G16130-416 /&gt; The first landing party, led by Lieutenant Bertram and accompanied by two marine lieutenants and two master mates, stormed the outer fort. Maitland then positioned ''Emerald'' close to the second battery while a boat under the command of his third lieutenant, Smith, landed about a mile along the shore. This second landing party encountered Spanish soldiers, but drove them off and pursued them inland. By the time Smith's party returned to the beach, ''Emerald'' had already silenced the battery. In the darkness, Smith subsequently failed to locate the fort.&lt;ref name=G16130-416 /&gt;

The crew of ''Apropos'' had run her ashore soon after ''Emerald'' had entered the harbour. The harbour batteries having been destroyed, Captain Maitland sent a further force under Midshipman Baird to secure and refloat the French ship. The original landing party under Lieutenant Bertram, which had already encountered and dispersed 60 members of the schooner's crew, met Baird's party on the beach. The British made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the schooner before being forced to set her afire and depart.&lt;ref name=G16130-416 /&gt; British casualties were heavy. ''Emerald'' had nine men killed, and 16 wounded, including Lieutenant Bertram. Maitland estimated that French casualties too had been heavy.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==== Back in the Basque Roads ====

[[File:Chart of the Road of Basque 1757.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|British chart of the Basque Roads, 1757]]

A French schooner ''Amadea'' arrived in [[Plymouth]] on 15 December 1808 having previously been captured and sent in by ''Emerald''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4302.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1808/11-18-1808.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the Basque Roads on 23 February 1809, ''Emerald'' was this time part of a squadron under [[Robert Stopford (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Stopford]]. Stopford's flagship, the 80-gun {{HMS|Caesar|1793|2}}, was also accompanied by the seventy-fours {{HMS|Defiance|1783|2}} and {{HMS|Donegal|1798|2}}, and the 36-gun frigates {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|2}} and {{HMS|Naiad|1797|2}}.&lt;ref name=G16234-289&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=289|issue=16234|date=4 March 1809|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 20:00, Stopford's squadron was anchored off the Chassiron Lighthouse, to the north-west of [[Ile d'Oléron]], when the sighting of several rockets prompted him to investigate. About an hour later, sails were seen to the east which the British followed until daylight the following morning. The sails belonged to a French squadron that Stopford deduced to be out of [[Brest, France|Brest]] and which [[Heave to|heaved to]] in the [[Pertuis d'Antioche]].&lt;ref name=G16234-289 /&gt;

The French force comprised eight ships of the line and two frigates, and Stopford immediately sent ''Naiad'' to apprise [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Admiral James Gambier]] of the situation. ''Naiad'' had not gone too far however when she signalled that there were three other vessels to the north-west. Stopford ordered ''Amethyst'' and ''Emerald'' to remain while he and the rest of the squadron set off in pursuit. The British frigate {{HMS|Amelia|1796|2}} and the sloop {{HMS|Doterel|1808|2}} also joined the chase.&lt;ref name=G16234-289 /&gt; ''Caesar'', ''Donegal'', ''Defiance'', and ''Amelia'' eventually drove the three French frigates ashore and destroyed them.&lt;ref name=G16234-289 /&gt;&lt;ref name=G16337&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=139|issue=16337|date=27 January 1810|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emerald'' and ''Amethyst'' had more success in the spring of 1809 when on 23 March they captured the brigs ''Caroline'' and ''Serpent''. In April, ''Emerald'' assisted ''Amethyst'' in the chase of a large 44-gun frigate off [[Ushant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1593|issue=16303|date=3 October 1809|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G16246-499&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=499|issue=16246|date=11 April 1809|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Emerald'' sighted {{HMS|Niemen|1809|2}}, with a main battery of 18-pounders and under the command of Captain Dupoter, at 11:00 on 5 April and immediately signalled ''Amethyst'' for assistance. ''Amethyst'' caught a glimpse of the French forty-four just as she turned away to the south-east and gave chase but by 19:20 had lost sight of both ''Niemen'' and ''Emerald''. ''Amethyst'' fell in with ''Niemen'' again at around 21:30 and engaged her. ''Niemen'' was forced to strike when a second British frigate, {{HMS|Arethusa|1781|2}} came into view and fired a broadside.&lt;ref name=G16246-499 /&gt; The Royal Navy took ''Niemen'' into service under her existing name.&lt;ref name=Win4&gt;Winfield p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March, ''Enfant de Patria'' arrived at Plymouth. ''Patria'', of 500 tons (bm), 10 guns, and 60 men, had sailed from France for [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Île de France]] when ''Emerald'' and ''Amethyst'' captured her.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4340.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1809/03-31-1809.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Marshall describes ''Enfant de Patria'' as a [[letter of marque]] of 640 tons (bm), armed with eight guns, and carrying a crew of 60 men.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall (1824) , Vol. 2, Part 1, pp.395-6.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Two days later ''Emerald'' captured a second letter of marque, the 4-gun ''Aventurier'', bound for the relief of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 30 men.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==== Battle of the Basque Roads ====
{{Main article|Battle of the Basque Roads}}

[[File:Battle of Basque Roads 11 April.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Map illustrating the position of the anchored French fleet shortly before the British attack on the night of 11 April]]

''Emerald'' was part of the fleet under Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|James Gambier]] that fought the [[Battle of the Basque Roads]] in April 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=450|issue=17458|date=9 March 1819|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French ships were anchored under the protection of the powerful batteries on the [[Isle d'Aix]]&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol. V) pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; when on 11 April Lord Cochrane attacked them with fireships and explosive vessels.&lt;ref name=J5-105&gt;James (Vol.V) p.105&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Emerald'' provided a diversion to the east of the island with the brigs {{HMS|Beagle|1804|2}}, {{HMS|Doterel|1808|2}}, {{HMS|Conflict|1805|2}}, and ''Growler''.&lt;ref name=J5-105 /&gt; The fireships met with only partial success; the French, having anticipated such an attack, had rigged a boom across the channel.&lt;ref name=J5-104&gt;James (Vol.V) p.104&lt;/ref&gt; One of the explosive vessels breached the boom, leading the French to cut their cables and drift on to the shoals.&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol.V) pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, after much delay, Gambier took the rest of his fleet into the Basque Roads. The British ships anchored, with springs, in a crescent around the stranded French, and exchanged fire.{{refn|A spring was a second rope attached to the anchor cable so that by pulling on it, the ship could be slewed round contrary to wind and tide, which would otherwise determine the angle of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Davies p.188&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Emerald'' took up position ahead of ''Indefatigable'' and behind ''Aigle'' and ''Unicorn'', and directed her fire mainly towards the French ships of the line, [[French ship Ville de Varsovie (1808)|''Varsovie'']] and [[French ship Nestor (1793)|''Aquilon'']], both of which struck at around 17:30.&lt;ref name=J5-114&gt;James (Vol.V) p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
At 20:00, ''Emerald'', along with the other British frigates and brigs, weighed and anchored with the 74-gun {{HMS|Revenge|1805|6}} in the Maumusson passage to the south of Oléron while a second fireship attack was under preparation.&lt;ref&gt;James (Vol.V) pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; Although the fireships were ready in the early hours on the 13th, contrary winds prevented their deployment.

''Emerald'' took two French sloops in July 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=411|issue=16352|date=17 March 1810|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Deux Freres'', en route for Guadeloupe from Rochelle when captured, arrived in Plymouth on 26 July.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4375.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1809/08-01-1809.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, ''Emerald'' captured the French schooner ''Balance'', which had been sailing to France from Guadeloupe.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4376.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1809/08-04-1809.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Both captures carried [[letters of marque]], a government licence authorising the attack and capture of enemy vessels. The first, of four guns, was carrying a small reinforcement for Guadeloupe's garrison. The second, also of four guns, was carrying a cargo of coffee and other colonial produce.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

While off the coast of Ireland on 8 October, ''Emerald'' rescued a British brig by capturing ''Incomparable'', an 8-gun French privateer. The Frenchman was about to take the British vessel when ''Emerald'' intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1708|issue=16310|date=28 October 1809|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Incomparable'' had a crew of 63 men and was four days out of [[Saint-Malo]], but had not yet captured any other vessel.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The report in ''Lloyd's List'' describes ''Incomparable'' as being armed with 14 guns.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4400.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1809/10-20-1809.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; French records show that she was commissioned in November 1807. She served under René Rosse until March 1808, Jean-Baptiste Dupuis from December, and from May 1809 made two cruises under Charles Tribalau.&lt;ref&gt;Demerliac (2004), n° 2057, p.267.&lt;/ref&gt; A third account gives her armament as eight 6-pounder guns and her crew as numbering 60 men.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;|group=Note}} Still in Irish waters on 6 November, ''Emerald'' took the 16-gun French brig {{ship|French brig|Fanfaron|1804|2}}, two days out of [[Brest, France|Brest]] and bound for [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1826|issue=16315|date=14 November 1809|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an all-night chase, ''Emerald'' caught up. ''Capitaine de fregate'' Croquet Deschateurs of ''Fanfaron'' resisted, firing several broadsides and a final double-shotted broadside. Unable to escape, Deschateurs prepared to board but ''Emerald'' evaded the manouvre and fired a broadside that dismasted ''Fanfaron'', leaving Deschateurs no option but to surrender his vessel. The subsequent French court-martial not only absolved Deschateurs of any liability for the loss but also commended him for his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Troude (1867), Vol. 4, pp.74-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later ''Emerald'' arrived at Cork with ''Fanfaron'' and ''Luna''. ''Fanfaron'', with a crew of 113, had been carrying a cargo of flour, salt, and other provisions, as well as iron, lead, and nails, all for Guadeloupe.&lt;ref&gt;''European Magazine and London Review'', Vol. 56, p.469.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The report in ''Lloyd's List'' describes ''Fanfaron'' as being armed with 18 guns and having a crew of 135 men.

At the beginning of February 1810, ''Emerald'' captured and sent into Plymouth, ''Commerce'', Hanson, master, which had been sailing from Drontheim to Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4432.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1810/02-13-1810.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 22 March, ''Emerald'' captured the 350-ton (bm) ''Belle Etoile'' in the [[Bay of Biscay]].

''Emerald'' was still serving on the Home Station on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4554.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1810/08-03-1810.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the 18-gun ''Auguste'' (or ''Augusta''), which had been taken on 6 April.&lt;ref name=LG16548/&gt;{{#tag:ref|''Auguste'' was a three-masted ship the Courau brothers in Bordeaux had built. She was probably similar to [[Confiance (1800 ship)|''Confiance'']]. Bordeaux built dozens of these corvettes for privateers. She measured 33.1m overall by 9.7 metres breadth, and displaced 300 tons (French). She had a crew of 70 men and carried eighteen 8-pounder guns. She cruised under Henry the younger from 1808 to 1809, and again from September 1910 to November. She also cruised under La Case at some point in 1809 or 1810. In December 1810, command passed to Juan Jamays, who was her captain at the time of her capture.&lt;ref&gt;Demerliac (2004), n° 2303, p.287.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Nearly a month later, on 5 July, ''Emerald'' left Madeira in the company of five [[East Indiamen]]{{#tag:ref|The Indiamen were ''Minerva'', ''Harleston'', [[William Pitt (1803 ship)|''William Pitt'']], ''Lord Forbes'', and ''Lady Lushington'' all of which had arrived in Madeira three days earlier.&lt;ref name=LL4593&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4593.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1811/08-30-1811.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} and was still on convoy duties later that month when a transport ship spotted her escorting thirteen vessels off the coast of West Africa on 18 July.{{#tag:ref|The transport ship, ''Fanny'' was travelling from Rio de Janeiro to Portsmouth, and on her arrival reported ''Emerald'' and her convoy, &quot;all well&quot; at {{coord|13|2|N|24|0|W}}.&lt;ref name=LL4594&gt;''Lloyd's List'', n° 4594.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1811/09-03-1811.jpg] – accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=LL4593/&gt;&lt;ref name=LL4594/&gt;

In November 1811, ''Emerald'' sailed to [[Portsmouth]] and was laid up [[reserve fleet|in ordinary]]. Fitted out as a receiving ship in 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.&lt;ref name=Win /&gt;
