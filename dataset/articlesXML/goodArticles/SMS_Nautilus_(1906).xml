'''SMS ''Nautilus'''''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;SMS&quot; stands for &quot;Seiner Majestät Schiff&quot;, or &quot;His Majesty's Ship&quot; in  German.&lt;/ref&gt; was a German minelaying cruiser built for the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) in the 1900s, the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Nautilus|minelayer|4}}. The ship was built by [[AG Weser]], with her [[keel laying]] taking place in December 1905. She was launched in August 1906 and commissioned in March 1907. ''Nautilus'' initially carried 186&amp;nbsp;[[naval mine]]s and a battery of eight {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} guns, but she was later modified to carry 205 mines and, in 1918, numerous light weapons to support [[amphibious operation]]s.

''Nautilus'' spent her peacetime career conducting training exercises with the main fleet and minesweeping experiments before being placed in reserve in 1911. Reactivated at the start of [[World War I]], she initially laid both defensive and offensive mine fields in the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s. She was permanently transferred to the Baltic in 1916, and the following year she supported [[Operation Albion]], the conquest of the [[Gulf of Riga]]. After Germany's defeat, ''Nautilus'' was demilitarized and used as a [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] from 1921 to 1928 before being sold for scrap and [[ship breaking|broken up]] in [[Copenhagen]].

==Design==
[[File:SMS Albatross.jpg|thumb|left|Model of {{SMS|Albatross|1907|2}}; ''Nautilus'' had a [[clipper]] bow and a [[superstructure]] deck from the [[conning tower]] to the main mast]]
{{main|Nautilus-class minelayer}}

''Nautilus'' was {{convert|98.2|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.2|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.42|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|1975|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|2345|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. Her crew numbered ten officers and 191&amp;nbsp;enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G169&gt;Gröner, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Her propulsion system consisted of two [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s each driving a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by four coal-fired marine-type [[boiler]]s. The ship's engines were rated to produce a top speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|6600|PS|ihp kW|abbr=on|lk=on|-1}}, though ''Nautilus'' slightly exceeded those figures on speed trials. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|3530|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|9|kn}}.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;

The primary armament for ''Nautilus'' was a battery of eight {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} SK L/35 guns in individual mounts. Six were placed on the [[superstructure]] [[amidships]], with three on each [[broadside]], and the last two were mounted side by side at the stern.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, &quot;SK&quot; (Schnelladekanone) denotes that the gun is quick loading, while the L/45 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/45 gun is 45 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter.&lt;/ref&gt; She initially carried 186&amp;nbsp;[[naval mine]]s, though her storage capacity was later increased to 205.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;

==Service history==
''Nautilus'' was built by the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]]; her [[keel]] was [[keel laying|laid down]] as &quot;mine steamer A&quot; on 19 December 1905, and her completed [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched as ''Nautilus'' on 28 August 1906. After completing [[fitting-out]] work, the ship was commissioned for [[sea trials]] on 19 March 1907, which lasted until 25 May. She was initially used for mine warfare training and was based in [[Cuxhaven]]. ''Nautilus'' took part in the annual fleet maneuvers in August and September 1907 and 1908 before being decommissioned in [[Kiel]]; her role in the peacetime fleet was then taken over by her recently commissioned [[sister ship]] {{SMS|Albatross||2}}.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;&lt;ref name=HRS149&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909&amp;ndash;10, ''Nautilus'' was modernized at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel. Her stern overhang was extended by {{convert|2.7|m|abbr=on}}, bringing the ship's overall length to {{convert|100.9|m|abbr=on}}, and her superstructure deck was extended further aft.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt; The work was completed by January 1910.&lt;ref name=HRS149/&gt;

On 23 January, ''Nautilus'' returned to her previous role with the fleet, and she took part in the annual fleet maneuvers that year. At the end of the year, she went to Kiel for an [[:wikt:overhaul|overhaul]]; the work lasted from 27 December to 27 January 1911. On 4 April, she returned to Kiel, her role in the fleet again being taken by ''Albatross''. ''Nautilus'' spent the rest of the year conducting experiments with [[minesweeper]]s in the [[North Sea]]. These were interrupted only by the annual fleet exercises. On 30 October, she was again decommissioned in Kiel, having been replaced by the light cruiser {{SMS|Arcona||2}} for the minesweeping experiments. She remained in reserve for over a year and a half, until she was reactivated on 5 June 1914 to replace the minelayer {{SMS|Pelikan||2}}, which was at the time going through a major overhaul.&lt;ref name=HRS149/&gt;

===World War I===
After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in July 1914, ''Nautilus'' was classified as a coastal defense mine cruiser.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt; She was temporarily sent to the [[Baltic Sea]] to lay defensive minefields against a possible attack by the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldrick, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In late August, ''Nautilus'' and ''Albatross'' were sent to lay a minefield off the [[Humber]] and the [[River Tyne]]. The two minelayers proceeded independently, and were each covered by a [[light cruiser]] and half-flotilla of [[destroyer]]s. ''Nautilus''{{'}}s group, which included the cruiser {{SMS|Mainz||2}}, departed from [[Helgoland]] early on the morning of 25 August. After arriving, ''Nautilus'' laid a pair of mine fields that were both {{convert|5|nmi|abbr=on}} long. On the way back to port, the German vessels sank six British fishing vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldrick, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nautilus'', ''Albatross'', and the auxiliary minelayer {{SMS|Kaiser|1905|2}} laid a defensive minefield in the western [[German Bight]] on 9&amp;ndash;10 September.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, pp. 149&amp;ndash;150&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 1914, ''Nautilus'' and the light cruiser {{SMS|Kolberg||2}} steamed into the North Sea to lay a minefield off the [[Firth of Forth]], but upon realizing British forces were operating off the [[Dogger Bank]], they broke off the operation and returned to port.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Operation Albion Map.jpg|thumb|Map of German movements during [[Operation Albion]]]]
In April 1916, ''Nautilus'' was transferred to the Baltic after the newer, faster minelaying cruiser {{SMS|Brummer||2}} entered service.&lt;ref name=HRS150&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917, the ship was assigned to the [[VI Scouting Group]], along with the light cruisers ''Kolberg'', {{SMS|Strassburg||2}}, and {{SMS|Augsburg||2}}, and the old [[aviso]] {{SMS|Blitz||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nautilus'' was assigned to the task force that launched [[Operation Albion]] in October 1917; she remained outside the [[Gulf of Riga]] until after the German squadron had cleared Russian forces from the area. She arrived in [[Kuressaare|Arensburg]] on 18 October to improve the defenses of the port.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; On the 21st, ''Nautilus'' was to have laid mines in a channel to the west of [[Kesselaid|Schildau]], but the depth of the water was too shallow. Instead, ''Nautilus'' transferred her mines to some vessels from the [[II Minesweeper Flotilla]], after which she returned to Arensburg.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 144&amp;ndash;145&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the ship's armament was revised significantly to allow the ship to support [[amphibious operation]]s. Her armament now consisted of two {{convert|7.6|cm|abbr=on}} guns, four {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, twenty-four [[machine gun]]s, two [[flamethrower]]s, and four mine-launchers, in addition to her normal capacity of mines.&lt;ref name=G169/&gt; In February that year, she was assigned to the ''Sonderverband'' (Special Unit) tasked with supporting the anti-communist faction fighting in [[Finland]]'s civil war. On 30 April, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Rear Admiral) [[Ludolf von Uslar]] took command of the ''Sonderverband'', and he chose ''Nautilus'' as his [[flagship]]. Following the disbanding of the unit the next month, ''Nautilus'' remained in the northern Baltic, patrolling off the [[Åland Islands]], until she was decommissioned on 10 December.&lt;ref name=HRS150/&gt;

Following the end of the war in late 1918, Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which significantly reduced Germany's naval strength. The new ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' was limited to six old [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships, six light cruisers, twelve destroyers, and twelve [[torpedo boat]]s. All other vessels, to include ''Nautilus'', were to either be sold for scrap or demilitarized.{{refn|[[s:Treaty of Versailles 1919|Treaty of Versailles]] Section II: Naval Clauses, Article 181.}} As a result, the ship was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 21 March 1919 in Kiel. From 1921, she was used as a storage [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] in Bremen, before being renamed ''Hulk I'' on 1 January 1923. She was renamed again, as ''Hulk A'' on 1 April 1928 and moved to [[Bremerhaven]], where she was assigned to the Training Inspectorate. She remained there for just four months, before being sold for 180,000&amp;nbsp;marks and [[ship breaking|broken up]] in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=G169/&gt;
