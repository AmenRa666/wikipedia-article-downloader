The '''Yugoslav destroyer ''Beograd''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the [[Beograd-class destroyer|''Beograd''-class]] of [[destroyer]]s built for the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{lang-sh|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM) during the late 1930s. When [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] entered [[World War II]] due to the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] of that country in April 1941, she was damaged by a near miss during an air attack, and was then captured by the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]]. After refitting, she saw extensive service with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] from August 1941 to September 1943, completing over 100 convoy escort missions in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] under the name '''''Sebenico''''', mainly as a convoy escort on routes between Italy and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[North Africa]]. Following the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian armistice]] in September 1943, she was captured by the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] and redesignated '''''TA43'''''. Re-armed, she served with the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla on escort and minelaying duties in the northern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. She was sunk or [[Scuttling|scuttled]] at [[Trieste]] on 30 April or 1 May 1945. She was raised in June 1946, probably to remove her as a navigation hazard, only to be scuttled again in either July 1946 or in 1947.

==Description and construction==
The [[Beograd-class destroyer|''Beograd'' class]] was developed from a French design, and the [[name ship]] of the class, ''Beograd'', was built by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] at [[Nantes]], France.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|pp=357–358}} The ship had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|98|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.45|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.18|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Her standard [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|1210|t|LT}}, and she displaced {{convert|1655|t|LT}} at full load.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} The crew consisted of 145 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by Curtis [[steam turbine]]s driving two propellors, using steam generated by three [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her turbines were rated at {{convert|40000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}{{refn|One source gives a rating of {{convert|44000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=106}}|group = lower-alpha}} and she was designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|38|kn|lk=in}}. She carried {{convert|120|t|LT}} of [[fuel oil]],{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} which gave her a radius of action of {{convert|1000|nmi}}.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=106}}

Her main armament consisted of four [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/46{{refn|L/46 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/46 gun is 46 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 46 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} [[superfiring]] guns in single mounts, two [[bow (ship)|forward]] of the [[superstructure]] and two [[aft]], protected by [[gun shield]]s. Her secondary armament consisted of four [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s in two twin mounts,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=738}}{{sfn|Campbell|1985|p=394}} located on either side of the aft shelter deck.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=312}} She was also equipped with two triple mounts of {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]] and two [[machine gun]]s.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} Her [[fire-control system]] was provided by the Dutch firm of Hazemayer.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=738}} As built, she could also carry 30 [[naval mine]]s. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 23 December 1937,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and was commissioned into the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{lang-sh|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM) on 28 April 1939.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=312}}

==Service history==
===Yugoslavia===
On 20 May 1939, ''Beograd'' arrived at [[Portsmouth]], England, with a large part of Yugoslavia's [[gold reserve]], 7,344 [[ingot]]s, to be lodged with the [[Bank of England]] for safekeeping.{{sfn|Hoptner|1963|p=156}} At the time of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, ''Beograd'' and her sister ships were allocated to the 1st Torpedo Division at the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} When the invasion commenced, to prevent a bridgehead being established at [[Zadar|Zara]], an Italian enclave on the Dalmatian coast, ''Beograd'', four [[250t-class torpedo boat]]s and six [[motor torpedo boat]]s were dispatched to [[Šibenik]], {{convert|80|km}} to the south of Zara, in preparation for an attack. The attack was to be coordinated with the [[12th Infantry Division Jadranska|12th Infantry Division ''Jadranska'']] and two combined regiments ({{lang-sh-Latn|odredi|links=no}}) of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] attacking from the [[Benkovac]] area, supported by the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]]'s 81st Bomber Group. The Yugoslavs launched their attack on 9 April, but the naval prong of the attack faltered when ''Beograd'' was damaged by near misses from Italian aircraft off Šibenik when her starboard engine was put out of action, after which she limped to the Bay of Kotor for repairs, escorted by the remainder of the force.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=312}} She was captured there by Italian forces on 17 April.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=44}}

===Italy===
She was refitted and repaired,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=301}} a new [[Director (military)|director]] was fitted on her [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]],{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=186}} and {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/65 [[Breda Model 35]] guns were added to her armament. She was commissioned in the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) under the name ''Sebenico'' in August 1941, and served as a convoy escort on routes between Italy and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[North Africa]], completing more than 100 missions over a two-year period.{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=134}} On 18 October 1941, off the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], the British submarine [[HMS Ursula (N59)|HMS ''Ursula'']] sank a steamer that was under escort by a force that included ''Sebenico''.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1992|p=93}} On 29 March 1942, ''Sebenico'' and three [[torpedo boat]]s were escorting a convoy off [[Brindisi]] when the British submarine [[HMS Proteus (N29)|HMS ''Proteus'']] sank one of the escorted freighters.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1992|p=133}} She retained her searchlight [[amidships]] and her aft director until at least mid-1942. It is likely that her aft torpedo tubes were removed towards the end of her time in Italian hands in order to augment her anti-aircraft armament.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=186}}

===Germany===
When the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kriegsmarine}}) seized ''Sebenico'' in the port of [[Venice]] on 9 September and renamed her  ''TA43'' ({{lang-de|links=no|Torpedoboot Ausland}} ''43'').{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=94}} The term ''Ausland'' and prefix ''TA'' referred to the fact that she was a captured vessel put into German service.{{sfn|Mallmann Showell|1979|p=93}} At the time of her capture she was either damaged or had been made unserviceable by her crew.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1992|p=231}} While in German service her anti-aircraft armament was improved using space provided by removing one of the triple torpedo mounts. She was fitted with seven {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns in one double-mount and five single-mounts, as well as two single-mount {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=106}} In February 1945 she was allocated to the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, which consisted entirely of captured destroyers and torpedo boats.{{sfn|Mallmann Showell|1979|p=93}} She was used for escort work and on minelaying duties in the northern Adriatic.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=80}} As late as 1 April 1945, ''TA43'' was still in commission and available to fight, although she saw little action.{{sfn|O'Hara|2013|p=181}} Sources differ on her final fate. According to Roger Chesneau, she was sunk at [[Trieste]] by [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] [[artillery]] fire on 30 April 1945, and was raised in June 1946, probably to remove her as a navigation hazard, only to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] a month later.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} David Brown records that she was scuttled at Trieste on 1 May 1945.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=149}} Maurizio Brescia states she was scuttled by the Germans at Trieste on 1 May 1945 and was broken up in 1947.{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=134}}
