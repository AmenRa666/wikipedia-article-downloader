[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KT|PC}} (20 July 1673{{snd}}9 May 1747) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] soldier and diplomat. He served in the [[Nine Years' War]] and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and, after a period as British Ambassador in [[Paris]], became a military commander at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].

==Early military career==
Born the son of [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|John Dalrymple, 2nd Viscount Stair (and later 1st Earl of Stair)]] and Elizabeth Dalrymple (née Dundas), Dalrymple accidentally killed his brother in a shooting accident in April 1682 and thereafter spent most of his early life in the [[Netherlands]] where he studied at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7053?docPos=3 |title=John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined up as a volunteer for the [[Nine Years' War]] with the [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Earl of Angus's Regiment]] and fought at the [[Battle of Steenkerque]] in August 1692.&lt;ref name=heath97&gt;Heathcote, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; At Steenkerque he rallied his regiment several times when the ranks had been broken by cannon fire.&lt;ref name=electric&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/nation/stair.htm|title=Stair|publisher=Electric Scotland|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1695 he became Master of Stair when his father succeeded to the [[Earl of Stair|Viscountcy of Stair]].&lt;ref name=heath98&gt;Heathcote, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

He was commissioned as a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Scots Guards|3rd Foot Guards]] on 12 May 1702 and fought with the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] at the Battle of Peer in August 1702 and the Battle of Venlo in September 1702.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; At Venlo he also saved the life of the [[Frederick I of Sweden|Prince of Hesse-Kassel]].&lt;ref name=electric/&gt;

He became Viscount Dalrymple in 1703 when his father was created 1st Earl of Stair.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; In January 1706 he was appointed colonel of the Earl of Angus's Regiment.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; He commanded a brigade at the [[Battle of Ramillies]] in May 1706 and, having been promoted to [[brigadier general]] on 1 June 1706,&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; became colonel of the [[Royal Scots Greys|Grey Dragoons]] on 24 August 1706.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; He became 2nd Earl of Stair in January 1707 when his father died and later that year he was elected as one of sixteen Scottish [[representative peer]]s in the newly formed [[Parliament of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

He commanded a brigade at the [[Battle of Oudenarde]] in July 1708, the [[Siege of Lille (1708)|Siege of Lille]] in Autumn 1708 and then, having been promoted to [[major general]] on 1 January 1709, at the [[Battle of Malplaquet]] in September 1709.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; In Winter 1709 the Duke of Marlborough sent him on a diplomatic mission to [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II of Poland]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He returned in time to take part in the Siege of Douai in April 1710.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant general]] on 1 June 1710, he fought at the [[Siege of Bouchain]] in August 1711.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; He was also appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]] that year.&lt;ref name=electric/&gt;

He was sent to [[Flanders]] to join the military campaign there in April 1712&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=4988|supp=|startpage=1|date=5 April 1712|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became colonel of the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons|Black Dragoons]] on 9 April 1714.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=5319|supp=|startpage=2|date=9 April 1715|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diplomatic service ==
When [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] ascended to the throne in August 1714, Dalrymple was sent as an envoy to the Court of France at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He was temporarily recalled on 20 November 1714 to take up the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=5279|supp=|startpage=2|date=20 November 1714|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Louis de Rouvroy, Duke of Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]], Stair quickly established friendly relations with [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], Regent to the young [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]], paving the way for the [[Triple Alliance (1717)|Triple Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Duc de Saint-Simon, ch.35–37&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Paris, Stair's spies effectively thwarted various &quot;intrigues&quot; by the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=5378|supp=|startpage=1|date=1 November 1715|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stair retired from his position as ambassador in Paris in June 1720.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=5860|supp=|startpage=1|date=14 June 1720|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1729, he became [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland|Vice Admiral of Scotland]], but lost the position on 5 May 1733,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=7192|supp=|startpage=1|date=1 May 1733|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because of his opposition to the Excise Bill of 1733 promoted by [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Walpole]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He was promoted to full [[general]], on the basis of seniority, on 27 October 1735&lt;ref name=heath99&gt;Heathcote, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; and also found time to lay out the gardens at [[Castle Kennedy]] in the 1730s.&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitstranraerandtherhins.co.uk/castle-kennedy.html|title=Castle Kennedy|publisher=Visit Stranraer and the Rhins|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 1742, after Walpole had fallen from office, Dalrymple was promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8102|supp=|startpage=2|date=16 March 1741|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 April 1742 he was made [[List of Governors of Minorca|Governor of Minorca]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8110|supp=|startpage=3|date=13 April 1742|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 20 April 1742 took command of the &quot;Pragmatic Army&quot; sent to act with [[Hanover]]ian and [[Austria]]n forces in support of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] to appoint [[Maria Theresa]] to the position of [[Emperor of Austria|Empress of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8112|supp=|startpage=2|date=20 April 1743|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in South Britain]] on 28 February 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8305|supp=|startpage=8|date=25 February 1743|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colonel of the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons|Black Dragoons]] again on 30 April 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8218|supp=|startpage=2|date=26 April 1743|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led the allies to victory at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] in June 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8240|supp=|startpage=1|date=12 July 1743|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from command of the army in Flanders at his own request on account of his advancing years in September 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8257|supp=|startpage=1|date=10 September 1743|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retired as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces to make way for [[George Wade|General Wade]] in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 1745 he became colonel of the [[Royal Scots Greys|Grey Dragoons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8437|supp=|startpage=4|date=12 July 1743|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 14 June 1746 he became General of the [[Royal Marines|Marine Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=8544|supp=|startpage=8|date=10 June 1746|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favourite residence was [[Newliston]] near [[Kirkliston]] in [[Linlithgowshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/gaztext_page.jsp?u_id=10125005|title=Gazetteer entries for Kirkliston|publisher=Vision of Britain|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he laid out gardens in the French style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2400:15:0::::GARDEN:GDL00298#history |title=Newliston: Site History |work=Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 9 May 1747 at [[Queensberry House]] in [[Edinburgh]] and was buried in the family [[burial vault (tomb)|vault]] at [[Kirkliston]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

== Family ==
In March 1708 he married Lady Eleanor Primrose Campbell, daughter of [[James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun]]. They had no children.&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt; 

[[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s story ''[[The Keepsake Stories#My Aunt Margaret's Mirror|My Aunt Margaret's Mirror]]'' is believed to have been based on efforts made by the Earl of Stair to get Lady Eleanor Primrose Campbell to marry him.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=heath98/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/scotland/mid-lothian/occult/lady-eleanor-primrose-and-the-conjurer-of-canongate.html|title=Lady Eleanor Primrose And The Conjurer Of Canongate|publisher=Mysterious Britain|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stair wanted his earldom to pass to his nephew John Dalrymple; but on 4 May 1748 the House of Lords ruled that the right to nominate an heir had lapsed, and the earldom passed to the legal heir [[James Dalrymple, 3rd Earl of Stair]].&lt;ref name=electric/&gt;
