[[Second Lieutenant]] '''George Hubert Kemp''' (1897 – 1 June 1918) was a World War I British [[flying ace]] credited with twelve aerial victories. He served with the [[Durham Light Infantry]], [[Royal Flying Corps]], and [[Royal Air Force]]. The observer ace scored his last victory shortly before his death at age twenty in aerial combat over France.

==Background==

George Hubert Kemp, son of George and Margaret Kemp,&lt;ref name=cwgc&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=George Hubert|title=Casualty details|url=http://www.cwgc.org/search-for-war-dead/casualty/20691/KEMP,%20GEORGE%20HUBERT|work=cwgc.org|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 1897 in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[Middlesex]], England. He was the second of three sons. In 1901, his family lived in [[Willesden]], Middlesex, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=George H|title=1901 England Census|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Census Returns of England and Wales, 1901.

==Military career==

In 1917, George Kemp received a commission in the 15th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry.&lt;ref name=flight/&gt;&lt;ref name=above&gt;{{cite book|title=Above The War Fronts|year=1997|publisher=Grub Street|isbn=1-898697-56-6|author=Norman Franks|author2=Russell Guest |author3=Gregory Alegi |page=29|chapter=Two-seat Fighter Observer Aces}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=great&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=G H|title=UK, Soldiers Died in the Great War, 1914–1919|work=ancestry.com|publisher=British and Irish Military Databases. The Naval and Military Press Ltd. (as re-printed on Ancestry.com)|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While serving with that regiment, he was wounded at [[Chérisy]], Pas-de-Calais, France.&lt;ref name=flight/&gt;&lt;ref name=auction/&gt; His rank was that of second lieutenant, which he again had when he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1918.&lt;ref name=flight/&gt;&lt;ref name=great/&gt;&lt;ref name=medal&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=George Herbert|title=British Army WWI Medal Rolls Index Cards, 1914–1920|work=ancestry.com|publisher=WWI Medal Index Cards. Army Medal Office (as re-printed on Ancestry.com)|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to [[No. 20 Squadron RAF|No. 20 Squadron]] of the Royal Air Force. Kemp was credited with twelve aerial victories as an observer, all from the [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol F.2b]] and with [[William McKenzie Thomson]] as his pilot.&lt;ref name=above/&gt;&lt;ref name=aeroGK&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=George|title=Aces|url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/kemp.php|work=theaerodrome.com|publisher=The Aerodrome|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 1918, observer Kemp and pilot Thomson, in Bristol F.2b (C4851) were cut off from their formation by an [[Albatros D.V]]. Kemp emptied a drum into the Albatros which side-slipped and nose-dived, and was destroyed, crashing between [[Comines (Belgium)|Comines]] and [[Wervicq]].&lt;ref name=auction/&gt; This was Kemp's first victory. His next four were all from Bristol (C859). On 14 May 1918, Kemp scored his second aerial victory. He and his pilot followed an Albatros D.V down to 4,000 feet and fired about 100 rounds at it over the Wervicq and [[Zillebeke]], [[West Flanders]]. The enemy plane crashed and the crew was captured.&lt;ref name=auction/&gt;&lt;ref name=above/&gt; While on a patrol with other Bristol Fighters on 17 May 1918, Kemp and Thomson engaged a formation of enemy aircraft. They dived on an Albatros D.V, and fired a burst of about 200 rounds into it. It went down in a vertical dive and was destroyed, crashing between [[Armentières]] and [[Lille]].&lt;ref name=auction/&gt; Kemp scored a double victory that day, as another Albatros D.V was sent out of control over Armentières.&lt;ref name=above/&gt; On 18 May 1918, Kemp scored his fifth victory when a [[Pfalz D.III]] was sent out of control south of [[Merville, Nord|Merville]], Nord.&lt;ref name=above/&gt;&lt;ref name=aeroGK/&gt;

All seven of Kemp's remaining aerial victories (6–12) were from Bristol F.2b (C843).&lt;ref name=above/&gt;&lt;ref name=aeroGK/&gt; On 19 May 1918, Kemp and Thomson were on a patrol with No. 20 Squadron when they engaged about twenty enemy aircraft. As Thomson dived on a [[Pfalz D.III]], Kemp fired three drums into it. The Pfalz was destroyed, crashing into a house at [[Estaires]].&lt;ref name=auction/&gt; Kemp racked up his seventh win on 21 May 1918 when an Albatros D.V was destroyed in flames over [[Warneton]]. His eighth was the result of an Albatros D.V that was sent out of control over [[Bac St Maur]] on 29 May 1918.&lt;ref name=above/&gt; Two days later, on 31 May 1918, Second Lieutenant Kemp scored a double victory when a Pfalz D.III was destroyed over [[Bois-Grenier]] and, minutes later, an Albatros D.V was sent out of control over Armentières.&lt;ref name=above/&gt; On 1 June 1918, Kemp earned his final two victories (11 and 12) when two Albatros D.V aircraft were destroyed over Comines.&lt;ref name=above/&gt;&lt;ref name=aeroGK/&gt;

==Death==

Second Lieutenant Kemp and Lieutenant Thomson were cut off from their patrol and attacked by four enemy planes on 1 June 1918. Thomson turned and fired 200 rounds into an Albatros D.V, which crashed. Observer Kemp shot down another over Comines. They were then attacked by an Albatros scout from above. During that encounter, Kemp, age 20, was fatally wounded.&lt;ref name=cwgc/&gt;&lt;ref name=great/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=George Hubert|title=England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1861–1941|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Calendar of the Grants of Probate and Letters of Administration made in the Probate Registries of the High Court of Justice in England. Principal Probate Registry (as re-printed on Ancestry.com)|accessdate=4 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot Thomson spun down to 2,000 feet, and then turned and fired upon the Albatros, driving it off. Thomson successfully flew his aircraft home.&lt;ref name=auction/&gt;

A portion of the letter from No. 20 Squadron commanding officer to Kemp's parents reads: &quot;You have no doubt been advised by the War Office that your son has unfortunately been killed in action. It happened during a fight with about 15 enemy machines. One enemy machine with the sun behind him surprised your son and his pilot and dived on them before anything could be done. Before your son was killed however he had shot down one of the enemy machines and his pilot eventually shot down another. He and his pilot have done excellent work together and both have been recommended for awards. I am particularly sorry to lose your son as he was just the type of conscientiously brave officer that one looks forward to having. He was extraordinarily keen on his work and looked forward to the day when he could learn to fly himself. Death must have been instantaneous as he was hit in the head and heart...&quot;&lt;ref name=auction/&gt;

Second Lieutenant George Hubert Kemp was interred at Longuenesse (St. Omer) Souvenir Cemetery at Rue Louis Delattre, between that road and Route des Bruyères in [[Longuenesse]], Pas-de-Calais, France. His grave reference is V. B. 56.&lt;ref name=cwgc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Longuenesse (St. Omer) Souvenir Cemetery|title=Cemetery details|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2100/LONGUENESSE%20(ST.%20OMER)%20SOUVENIR%20CEMETERY|work=cwgc.org|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Maps – 50.73088,2.25126|url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=50.73088,2.25126|work=maps.google.co.uk|publisher=Google|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS Coordinate Converter, Maps and Info|url=http://boulter.com/gps/#50.73088%2C2.25126|work=boulter.com|publisher=boulter.com|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on his headstone reads: &quot;Second Lieutenant George Hubert Kemp, Durham Light Infantry, Attd.

==War memorabilia==

In 2002, an auction of Lieutenant Kemp's war memorabilia was held. The items included his [[British War Medal|British War]] and [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory]] medals, his [[Memorial Plaque (medallion)|memorial plaque]], and photocopies of original documents, research materials, and photographs, as well as the British War and Victory medals of his brother, Private Leslie Newton Kemp.&lt;ref name=auction/&gt; Despite twelve aerial victories, having been wounded twice, the second time fatally, and a recommendation for an award, George Hubert Kemp was not decorated.&lt;ref name=flight/&gt;&lt;ref name=auction/&gt;&lt;ref name=medal/&gt; Lieutenant Thomson received the [[Military Cross]] shortly after the encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracts from the News|url=http://www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/transcripts/transcriptDisplay.asp?Type=N&amp;transNo=768|work=canadiangreatwarproject.com|publisher=Canadian Great War Project|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=William|title=Aces|url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/canada/thomson3.php|work=theaerodrome.com|publisher=The Aerodrome|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died 9 July 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson&quot;/&gt;
