== Numbers of Plain Indians killed by disease ==

I'm planning to add a sentence or two about the depopulation of Indians during the Westward Expansion (1800-1900), but I'm conflicting about a good section to put it. [[User:Godzilladude123|Godzilladude123]] ([[User talk:Godzilladude123|talk]]) 06:20, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
::I think the smallpox/ measles etc epidemics hit long before the frontier arrived in 6the vicinity. try it out here. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 06:54, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
::: Thanks for the reply, but can you specify to what section of the article I can add it. [[User:Godzilladude123|Godzilladude123]] ([[User talk:Godzilladude123|talk]]) 07:15, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
::::If it happened before the frontier arrived  in a locality,  then it doesn't fit.   Wikipedia has  numerous articles  dealing with the history of  all the major tribes, and that is the best place to include it. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 10:03, 1 April 2015 (UTC)

==Indians West of the Mississippi==
Hey guys. I'm planning to nominate the article for GA is the times comes when it's good enough. But there are some problems need fixing. One of it is the section of &quot;Indians West of the Mississippi&quot;, which is too descriptive, excessive and probably needs to be trimmed and generalized.

== Genocide of indigenous people ==

I added a small item to the intro (see history) that is described and sourced extensively not only in this article but in the article I linked to as well as the various articles linked to them.  I had no strong position but was simply expanding the intro to include what seemed to me to be obvious information missing that, again, is described and sourced on Wikipedia: that is that the native population was decimated, and native cultures destroyed, by the arrival and expansion of peoples from the eastern hemisphere including by direct written policy of the United States government (that last point I didn't know before researching this today). That that obviously fits the plain meaning of &quot;genocide&quot; seems clear to me.  I couldn't understand the controversy at all and certainly within the context of &quot;assuming good faith&quot;.

I found it odd that rjensen insisted that something so incidental would need an additional citation but after the last revert I began to collect citations to add to my change.  This was easy enough because there is no shortage of citations within the article as well as linked articles.  This is where I learned who &quot;Ward Churchill&quot; is (whom rjensen referenced in arguing that my simple change advocated a non neutral pov - ironically, however, the fact that rjensen invoked such a polarizing figure seems to demonstrate that he is editing the article with a non-neutral POV in mind).

That there are articles in existence that deny this genocide brings up a question as to what constitutes a &quot;reliable source&quot;.  Are racist sources acceptable? Does Wikipedia entertain anti-semetic holocaust deniers in world war 2 articles? An article countering that the plain meaning of genocide describes what happened to the native Americans and that the historicity of this is no less solidly supported than the nazi holocaust is racist, per se, and morally repugnant.  

I'm new to Wikipedia but I do understand it's open and uncensored way.  However if this policy allows for the site to be a platform for racist propaganda then perhaps I won't fit in here?- [[User:Geeks On Hugs|Geeks On Hugs]] ([[User talk:Geeks On Hugs|talk]]) 23:07, 7 September 2016 (UTC)</text>
