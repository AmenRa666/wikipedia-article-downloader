==Untitled==
I stayed at the Marine Hotel in Llandudno &amp; was intrigued to find that Queen Elizabth who used the Pen Name Carmen Sylva had been at the hotel for about two years in the 1890's ~ there is a letter in a frame @ the Hotel in which she thanks the people of Llandudno for all their kindness &amp; help in her difficulies...   how ever.....  after reading several books on the King and Queen, plus research on the Web I can find no refernece to her ever being out of Romainia for a period of time....  why was she @ Llandudno..  it is certain she was there as there are many references to her in the Town... Sylva.  and Carmen and Queen Elizabeth feature in so many places... is anyone able to enlighten me of this...  from all I have read she was well liked in the Country and she had come to live in and there is no seemingly reason for any exile.....   Crocus Rokersosski...   E mail address if it easier for reply/info is christefercrocus@fsmail.net

check out the last section 'life and family'. also the [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth]] article. in short, she actively encouraged an engagement between [[Elena Văcărescu]], her lady in waiting, and [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Crown Prince Ferdinand]], although the romanian constitution specifically forbade the marriage of royal family members and romanians. she was exiled for two years.

== day of death ==

i see someone corrected the date of death from the 27th of september to the 10th of october. i must point out that both dates are correct because romania at the time was using the julian calendar, meaning it was 14 days behind the western world...  the 27th of september is more correct because it's the romanian time and we are talking about someone who died in romania. if you want to point out the difference, you could use the general 27th of september/10th of october style...

:Was Romania really using the Julian calendar?  I've never heard this before. At any rate, I think that both dates ought to be given for any event after 1582 in a country that adopted the Gregorian calendar later. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 21:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

:: Yes. It switched to Gregorian calendar only in 1919. [[User:Bogdangiusca|bogdan]] 22:07, 12 February 2006 (UTC)


i'll edit to mention both dates [[User:Ilyawh|ilya]] 08:55, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

:I have read the article about John Hunyadi, where it is emphasized, that he was a Romanian. I suggest adding to this article, that Carol I was German. Just to follow the same pattern.[[User:Zmiklos|Zmiklos]] 12:14, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

i thought the article made it pretty clear.... [[User:Ilyawh|ilya]] 09:21, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

==Consent==

''; following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War he was proclaimed King of Romania with the consent of both the Turkish Sultan and the major European powers on 26 March 1881''.

I have a huge problem with this sentence. The 1881 act did not require (nor asked) for any consent - Romania was an independent country by then, and could pursue any choice of government desired. The act proclaiming independence, required no consent from the outside world (just countersignatures from the ministries, the heads of the two chambers of parliament and the head of the Supreme Court). Further, since the Ottoman Empire was defeated and all claims were declared null and void through the treaties of San Stefano and Berlin, the Turks could not de jure even give their accord!--[[User:Xanthar|Xanthar]] ([[User talk:Xanthar|talk]]) 02:55, 10 May 2009 (UTC)
