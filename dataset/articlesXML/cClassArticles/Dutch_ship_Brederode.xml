'''''Brederode''''' was a [[ship of the line]] of the navy of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] of the Netherlands, and the [[flagship]] of the Dutch fleet in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]].  Throughout her career, she carried from 53-59 guns. She was named after [[Johan Wolfert van Brederode]], the brother-in-law of [[stadtholder]] [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]]. 

== Construction==
The ''Brederode'' was, in Maas feet, about {{convert|132|ft|m|abbr=on}}. long by about {{convert|32|ft|m|abbr=on}}. wide by approximately {{convert|13.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. deep.  The English dimensions were very close to those figures. The published dimensions are in Maas feet of 308 mm, divided into {{convert|12|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name=Bender148/&gt; 

The ''Brederode'' was initially armed with 49 guns, increasing to 54 from 1652.  These comprised 4 36-pounders, 12 24-pounders, and 8 18-pounders on the lower deck, 20 12-pounders on the upper deck, and 10-12 6-pounders on the forecastle, quarterdeck, and poop deck. All of her guns were bronze-cast except four of the 12-pounders which were Swedish-made and cast in iron.&lt;ref name=Bender148/&gt;

Crew numbers varied considerably over ''Bredereode''{{'}}s sailing career. In September 1652 her complement was 175 sailors, rising to 260 in June 1653 before falling back to 113 in 1656. Between 40 and 175 soldiers were also accommodated aboard.&lt;ref name=Bender148/&gt; 

== Ship history ==
Launched at [[Rotterdam]] in 1644, and a design of shipwright [[Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel]], she was the flagship of Vice-Admiral [[Witte Corneliszoon de With]] from May 1645 until 1647 when she was assigned to [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] [[Maarten Tromp]]. The same year however, she again became De With's flagship for his expedition to [[Dutch Brazil]]. De With delegated actual command of the vessel to Lieutenant [[Jan Janszoon Quack]], who remained in that role after the expedition returned to Holland in 1647. Only in 1652 would Tromp sail for the first time with his flag on the ''Brederode'', during an attack against royalist privateers operating from the [[Scilly Islands]].&lt;ref name=Bender148&gt;Bender 2014, pp. 148-49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] ''Brederode'' was present under Tromp's command at the [[Battle of Goodwin Sands]] on 29 May 1652. After Tromp's failure to bring the English to battle off the [[Shetland Islands]] in July, Tromp was relieved and [[Michiel de Ruyter]] took over command. When De Ruyter was subordinated to De With in September, ''Brederode's'' crew refused to let the latter come on board to take command, so he had to content himself with the ''Prins Willem''. Under De Ruyter, ''Brederode'' fought at the [[Battle of the Kentish Knock]] on 8 October 1652.

[[Image:Witmont, Battle of the Gabbard.jpg|thumb|left|''The [[Battle of the Gabbard]], 12 June 1653'' by [[Heerman Witmont]], shows the Dutch flagship ''Brederode'', right, in action with the English ship ''Resolution'', the temporary name of HMS ''Prince Royal'']]
With Tromp back in command, ''Brederode'' fought at the [[Battle of Dungeness]] on 10 December 1652 where she came close to being captured, but was instrumental in that victory over the English. She fought again on 18 February 1653 at the [[Battle of Portland]] and on 12 June 1653 at the [[Battle of the Gabbard]], where she fought an exhausting but inconclusive duel with [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|William Penn]]'s flagship ''James''. On that day, the first day of the battle, Tromp's men boarded the English ship but were beaten back; boarded in turn by the English, Tromp was only able to dislodge the boarders by blowing up ''Brederode's'' deck. On 13 June the English were joined by a squadron under Admiral [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] and the Dutch were scattered in defeat.

''Brederode'' fought in the last major engagement of the war, the [[Battle of Scheveningen]] on 26 July 1653, when Tromp was killed. The acting [[flag captain]] (later Admiral) [[Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer]] kept Tromp's standard raised after his death to keep up morale.

In the [[Northern Wars]] the United Provinces sent an expeditionary force to support [[Denmark]] in the war against [[Charles X of Sweden]]. In the [[Battle of the Sound]] on 8 November 1658 the Dutch fleet, commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral [[Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam]], defeated a Swedish fleet and relieved the [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|siege of Copenhagen]]. Van Wassenaer's flagship was ''[[Dutch ship Eendracht|Eendracht]]''; De With commanded the van in ''Brederode''; attacking the enemy without proper knowledge of the shoals he grounded his ship (after damaging ''Leoparden'' so much that this enemy vessel subsequently was lost by fire) and was surrounded; after many hours of fighting, ''Brederode'' was boarded by ''Wismar'' and De With mortally wounded. The partially burnt wreck was deemed unsalvagable.
