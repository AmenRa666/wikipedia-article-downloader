}}The '''126th Guards Rifle Division''' was a [[Red Army]] division from 1945 to 1946, part of the [[Southern Group of Forces]]. The 126th Guards Rifle Division was originally the 10th Guards Airborne Division (10-я гвардейская воздушно-десантная дивизия), which was transformed into a rifle division on 20 December 1945.

After briefly becoming part of 9th Mechanised Army (after [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th Army]] was reorganised within the [[Southern Group of Forces]], the division was disbanded on 30 November 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;V.I.
