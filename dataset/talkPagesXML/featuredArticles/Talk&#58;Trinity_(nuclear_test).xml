==Crazy-ass reference==
A recent paper ({{cite journal | author = P.P. Parekh | coauthors = T.M. Semkow, M.A. Torres, D.K. Haines, J.M. Cooper, P.M. Rosenberg and M.E. Kitto | title = Radioactivity in Trinitite six decades later | journal = Journal of Environmental Radioactivity | year = 2006 | volume = 85 | pages = 103–120 | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.01.017 | pmid = 16102878 | issue = 1}}) reports the levels of long-lived radioisotopes in the trinitite. The trinitite was formed from [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]] melted by the heat. The &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu was mainly formed by the [[neutron activation]] of [[europium]] in the soil; it is clear that the level of radioactivity for these isotopes is highest where the neutron dose to the soil was larger. Some of the &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co is generated by activation of the [[cobalt]] in the soil, but some was also generated by the activation of the cobalt in the steel (100 ft) tower. This &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co from the tower would have been scattered over the site, reducing the difference in the soil levels.

The &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba and &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am are from the [[neutron activation]] of [[barium]] and [[plutonium]] inside the bomb. The barium was present in the form of the [[barium nitrate]] in the [[baratol]] explosive used in the [[explosive lens]]es, while the plutonium was the [[fissile]] fuel used.

The &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs level is higher in the sample which was farther away from the ground zero point; this is thought to be because the precursors to the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;I and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Xe) and the cesium to a lesser degree are volatile. The natural radioisotopes in the glass are about the same in both locations.


It's a lot of text, i felt bad just deleting it though it doesn't belong in the citation text. Dumping here in case it should be incorporated into the article. [[User:Larryisgood|Larryisgood]] ([[User talk:Larryisgood|talk]]) 13:18, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

==Focus of article==
The article has too much on the weapon and the Manhattan Project, duplicating what is in other articles, but not enough on the test itself. For example, there is nothing about the cover story that the Trinity test was an ammunition dump blowing up. Would anyone object to my doing some major cuts? I know about BRD, but this one has been stable for quite a time. [[User:Figureofnine|Figureofnine]] ([[User talk:Figureofnine|talk]]) 17:20, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
: Agreed, it is full of superfluity. If we removed all the stuff from [[Manhattan Project]], [[Fat Man]], [[Nuclear weapon design]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the article could be cut at least in half. This would then allow major improvements to the article. [[User:Bomazi|Bomazi]] ([[User talk:Bomazi|talk]]) 09:27, 12 August 2011 (UTC)

== Timing of the 'atmosphere ignition' report ==

In the Gadget section it says:

'It was feared by some that the Trinity test might &quot;ignite&quot; the earth's atmosphere, eliminating all life on the planet, although a classified report produced several years earlier had demonstrated that this was not possible.[17]'

The report in reference 17 seems to have been written in 1946 (http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf), a year after the test, so I think this should be re-worded to remove the reference.

:Although this is not a reliable reference, I once attended a talk by Richard Hamming, the inventor of the Hamming code.  In WWII, he was assigned to the Manhatten project, and one of his job was to do this particular calculation.  When he showed it to his boss, the boss said thanks and laid the report on a pile of other papers.  Hamming asked &quot;Aren't you going to check my work?&quot; and his boss said &quot;I assure you that if you are wrong no-one will complain.&quot;  So this particular calculation was done before the test, and I believe that given the impact of the problem, several groups were asked to do this calculation.  [[User:LouScheffer|LouScheffer]] ([[User talk:LouScheffer|talk]]) 12:11, 28 November 2011 (UTC)

Interesting - another pioneering computer scientist working on Manhattan. It's good they did the calculations before the test.

:::I've heard that the reason for the report in 1946 was to provide some proof of due diligence after the fact and to support the development of Teller's SuperBomb (thermonuke).  My understanding from informal sources is that Bethe was assigned the problem by Oppenheimer (see http://www.sciencemusings.com/2005/10/what-didnt-happen.html) soon after arriving at Los Alamos, and that Hamming did a later calculation at the request of another physicist (as he relates in the reference).

== Where was Oppenheimer? ==

The article currently states: &quot;Two bunkers were set up to observe the test. Oppenheimer and Brig. Gen. Thomas Farrell watched from a bunker ten miles (16 km) from the detonation, while Gen. Leslie Groves watched at a bunker seventeen miles (27 km) away.&quot;, 
First of all, this does not match this map: http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/images/trmap2.gif
Additionally this page on the DOE website suggests Oppenheimer watched the explosion with Kistiakowsky at the south shelter only 10,000 yards from ground zero, while Groves watched from the 10-mile base camp: http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.mbe.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/trinity.htm (go back to any time prior to 2011, because the page disappeared in early 2011)

Actually, the distances are off by a factor of about 1.6, suggesting that somebody may have gotten sloppy in copying distances in kilometers into this Wikipedia article and saying they were miles, while the new additional conversion to kilometers may have been added later by another editor.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.191.33.23|71.191.33.23]] ([[User talk:71.191.33.23|talk]]) 04:03, 18 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:The book &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;, an excellent reference, has Oppenhiemer at 10,000 yards (9.1km, 5.7 miles) and Groves at base camp (10 miles, 16 km).   I changed the article...  [[User:LouScheffer|LouScheffer]] ([[User talk:LouScheffer|talk]]) 19:36, 18 December 2011 (UTC)

== General Patton ==

&quot;A Mojave Desert Army base near Rice, California was considered the best location, but was opted against because General Leslie Groves, military head of the project, did not wish to have any dealings with Gen. George S. Patton, commander of the base, whom he disliked.[19] &quot;

The base would be [[Rice Army Airfield]]. [[User:Terry Thorgaard|Terry Thorgaard]] ([[User talk:Terry Thorgaard|talk]]) 14:41, 16 July 2015 (UTC)

According to Patton's wikipedia article, in 1944-5, Patton was very busy in Europe - what would he be doing commanding a base in the USA? [[Special:Contributions/86.26.121.213|86.26.121.213]] ([[User talk:86.26.121.213|talk]]) 00:06, 23 December 2011 (UTC)

:I agree that it seems odd, and I noticed that myself. But it is reliably sourced to the National Atomic Museum in Albuquerque.

::It's not reliable if it isn't true. Patton was in Europe fighting the Germans from 1942 to after the Trinity tests. He came home briefly in 1945, but only to visit, then returned to Europe where he served in the occupation forces before being relieved of his command. He died of complications from an automobile accident in late 1945. The Atomic museum is not a military history, so not sure why this is being cited as &quot;reliable&quot;. Recommend a second source be sought for this. It's mostly gossip at this stage.[[Special:Contributions/198.161.2.241|198.161.2.241]] ([[User talk:198.161.2.241|talk]]) 21:56, 29 March 2012 (UTC)

::Earlier in the war, Patton personally [http://www.ameriforce.net/PDF/rng_dec09/RNG_Dec09_024-25.pdf set up a training base for desert warfare].  Although he was obviously not personally running it later in the war, I'd guess it was possible he was the supervisor of the guy who was.  In this case he might still need to be consulted.  Surely military records would indicate if this was the case, but I have no idea how to check.    [[User:LouScheffer|LouScheffer]] ([[User talk:LouScheffer|talk]]) 13:19, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

::::It may be that Groves was worried Patton might somehow get wind of the test, from &quot;his people&quot; at that base, and didn't want to answer any inquiries from Patton about it.  At the time, Patton would not have had any supervisory ties to the base, as his command was elsewhere in Europe.

== Fallout map ==
[[File:Trinity fallout.png|thumb|Fallout around the Trinity site in [[Roentgen (unit)|Röntgen]]s. The radioactive cloud moved towards the northeast with high [[radiation]] levels within about {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}}.]]
I find the fallout map quite puzzling and therefore dubious. For starters, I would expect fallout to be measured in units of curies per unit area, and not in roentgens. Furthermore, I would expect a time after the test to be given, such as integrated dose measurements one year after the explosion, or suchlike. Some of the doses given seem very high for such a broad area. For instance, the dose for &gt;5.0 roentgens seems to cover a very large area, and I would expect the death rate for such does (i.e. on the order of 5000 millirem) to quite noticeable, but no mention is made of deaths due to fallout in the article. 

Lastly and most importantly, no pedigree is given for these numbers. Are they measurements? If so, where is the primary reference for the data? Are they calculations? Again where is the primary reference for them? Does [[WP:OR]] apply here? If not, how do we know? [[User:Rwflammang|Rwflammang]] ([[User talk:Rwflammang|talk]]) 02:18, 16 September 2012 (UTC)

:Ha, ha, I had the exact same concerns. I didn't read your views until I removed the suspect graphic. As to the 5 R region on the map, 5 R is not a major issue as far as causing deaths per se. People don't typically die from radiation sickness until they receive the equivalent of 200 to 800 R in an acute dose. 500 R is the accepted [[LD50]] dose.

:So here is the dud map. It needs some work, but it could be useful if cleaned up. [[User:Uruiamme|I like to saw logs!]] ([[User talk:Uruiamme|talk]]) 05:08, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

== Fireball or Pressure Wave? ==

The picture at the top of the page states that the image is of the fireball from detonation. Now, I'm not disputing this, but it seems a bit big, not to mention remarkably smooth and symmetrical? To grow 600 feet across within 16 milliseconds, and so perfectly round and smooth? Also, the trees in front of the fireball should be in full blaze from the radiant heat in front of the fire?
I would think it's more likely to be the pressure wave, as it has been stated in several diffrent sources that the blast compressed the air until it was visible to the naked eye, something which would also make a smooth and symmetrical 'ball' as the pressure grew in all directions at once. However, I do not KNOW, so if someone could answer/prove me wrong, please do. [[Special:Contributions/85.230.41.75|85.230.41.75]] ([[User talk:85.230.41.75|talk]]) 21:19, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
:It is indeed a picture of the fireball. The pressure front initially grows more slowly than the fireball, then overtakes it and detaches from it. You can see this clearly in [[:File:Trinity_Test_Fireball_62ms.jpg|Trinity_Test_Fireball_62ms.jpg]]. [[User:Bomazi|Bomazi]] ([[User talk:Bomazi|talk]]) 20:38, 16 July 2013 (UTC)

== One pool or many ==

The bit talking about betting pools starts of saying there were multiple pools (suggesting there was a culture of gambling around it) but ends talking about one specific pool. Which one is it? I don't know, but perhaps someone who knows can make this section consistent?

[[User:Lucaswilkins|Lucaswilkins]] ([[User talk:Lucaswilkins|talk]]) 03:50, 6 February 2013 (UTC)

:OK, clarified this using info from Rhodes, &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;, a very solid (and readable) reference. [[User:LouScheffer|LouScheffer]] ([[User talk:LouScheffer|talk]]) 14:16, 6 February 2013 (UTC)

:: I have a copy of Rhodes here (paperback edition, 1986).  Quote from page 656: 

:::&quot;The senior men arranged a betting pool with a $1 entry fee, wagering on the explosive yield.  Edward Teller optimistically picked 45,000 tons of TNT equivalent. Hans Bethe picked 8,000 tons, Kistiakowski 1,400. Oppenheimer picked a modest 3,300 tons. Norman Ramsey picked a cynical zero.  When I. I. Rabi arrived a few days before the test the only bet left was 18,000 tons; whether or not he believed this to be the Trinity yield, he picked it.&quot;

Page 664:

&quot;With the weather [on the night before the 5:00 AM scheduled firing] turning from stagnant to violent, and everyone short of sleep, moods swung at base camp. The occasion of Fermi's satire that evening made Bainbridge furious. It merely irritated General Groves:

::::'I had become a bit annoyed with Fermi; ...when he suddenly offered to take wagers from his fellow scientists on whether or not the bomb would ignite the atmosphere, and if so, whether it would merely destroy New Mexico or if it would destroy the world.  ....'

:::&quot;Bainbridge was furious because Fermi's &quot;thoughtless bravado&quot; might scare the soldiers, who did not have benefit of the knowledge of thermonuclear ignition temperatures and fireball cooling effects. But a new force was about to be loosed on the world, no one could be absolutely certain -- Fermi's point -- of the outcome of the debut.&quot;

::It would appear that there was at least two separate betting incidents, one of them a mock teasing possibly with a more serious point, the other a straight numbers pool.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:SkoreKeep|SkoreKeep]] ([[User talk:SkoreKeep|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/SkoreKeep|contribs]]) 07:40, 7 February 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Tchaikovsky ==

I've heard a few mentions of a story that some sort of radio interference made a radio station playing Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings cut into the military channels during the Trinity test. Does anyone have references on whether or not this is simply urban legend, and if so, is it noteworthy enough for inclusion?

== DYK ==

Congratulations to everyone in bringing this back to GA status. As a new(?) GA, is it eligible for [[WP:DYK]]?

Some suggested hooks (more formatting needed)

* ... that the first nuclear bomb to be detonated was hauled up with an electric winch into an oak platform and a shack made of corrugated iron?
* ... that the first nuclear bomb to be detonated had a truckload of mattresses placed underneath it in case the winch cable broke?
* ... that [[Richard Feynmann]] claimed to be the only person to see the first nuclear bomb explosion without protective goggles, using a truck windscreen instead?
* ... that before the explosion of the first atomic bomb, anger was caused by one physicist scaring other staff by speculating on the chance the Earth's entire atmosphere would ignite and burn?
* ... that for the explosion of the first ever atomic bomb, cameras were placed in bunkers only 800 yards (730 m) from ground zero, mounted on sleds so that a lead-lined Sherman tank could tow them out?
* ... that after they saw the first atomic bomb explosion, Bainbridge told Oppenheimer, &quot;Now we are all sons of bitches&quot;?
* ... that a U.S. transport aircraft pilot perceived the first ever atomic bomb as &quot;the sun rising in the south&quot;, and when radioing for instructions was told &quot;don't fly south&quot;?
* ... that after the first ever atomic bomb explosion, Robert Oppenheimer said, &quot;We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent&quot;?
* ... that after the first ever atomic bomb explosion, Robert Oppenheimer said that he recalled a line from Hindu scripture, &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds&quot;?
* ... that after the first atomic bomb explosion, a coded message was sent from New Mexico to the Secretary of War who was at the [[Potsdam Conference]], saying &quot;Doctor has just returned most enthusiastic and confident that the little boy is as husky as his big brother&quot;?
* ... that the press releases for different outcomes of the first ever nuclear bomb detonation had been written by [[William L. Laurence]], and he knew that if the most negative were issued, it would likely be his own obituary?
* ... that newspapers on the east coast of the USA largely ignored unofficial reports of the first ever nuclear bomb detonation, including a blind woman 150 miles from the site who asked &quot;what's that brilliant light&quot;?

== Comparison with later tests ==
I think comparisons to later tests would improve the article by giving readers the ability to see video of devices of similar yield detonated at similar [[effects of nuclear weapons|height of burst]]s. As due to the lack of good video, how the trinity test really might have looked is a bit of a black box to those uninitiated - and this is an issue even that many who were in attendance at the trinity test have, as they were told to keep their backs to it until the intense flash was over, with only Teller and Feynman reportedly really getting to look at it.

I added the following, but it was removed as un-sourced, sadly no one else appears to have stated that any of these later tests were similar to Trinity, otherwise I would have attached such a source, although personally I don't think we need this redundant corroboration as it is plain to see that they were very similar, in fact probably the most similar tests to Trinity ever conducted. - 
	 	
[[File:Operation Teapot test.ogg|thumb|Video of shot ''MET'' (Military Effects Test) of [[Operation Teapot]], fired on 15 April 1955, with a yield of 22 [[kilotons]], was approximately of the same yield and [[effects of nuclear weapons|height of burst]] as the Trinity test device/&quot;Gadget&quot; detonated in 1945.]]
[[File:Upshot-Knothole Annie 001.jpg|thumb|left|This night shot of Upshot-Knothole Annie was televised and gives a rare record of both the sound and appearance of an actual nuclear device of similar yield and [[ambient]] brightness to the Trinity test.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpm6cVbwcQI|title = Operation Upshot-Knothole Shot Annie |publisher  = Youtube.com| accessdate = October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]	 	
Apart from [[Joe-1]] in 1949, the Soviet Union's first nuclear test, and due to its [[atomic espionage]], it was almost identical to the Trinity Gadget. Although it was a daytime shot and not a darkly lit dawn shot like Trinity, the 1955 US Military Effects Test of [[Operation Teapot]] was another nuclear device with a slightly higher yield(22 kt) and atop a tower with moderately taller dimensions(120 m) to the Trinity test.

A closely paired night test with a similar yield to the trinity test was [[Upshot-Knothole Annie]] which produced a yield of 16 kt.

==How did they determine the yield?==
At the very least we should relay the story of Fermi using bits of confetti paper to estimate the yield of the gadget, the story can be found on [[Enrico Fermi]] and in [[nuclear fireball]], furthermore I'd like to see explained why the initial estimates of the yield stated by Oppenheimer were so wrong.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.251.175.116|92.251.175.116]] ([[User talk:92.251.175.116|talk]]) 03:37, 24 October 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::Great, I was expecting a dedicated heading for yield determination though. Really we could get rid of that boring claptrap about the men using salt water soap, and fit in a section on yield determination with info on the piezoelectric gauges and [[Herbert L. Anderson]]'s radiochemical analysis having the final say. I've since put in a table that shows Fermi's estimate as damned accurate! However the table is a bit anachronistic as readers might go - hang on a minute how'd they know 50% of the energy would go into the blast before the blast even happened? Well they didn't! With a dedicated yield determination heading we'd be able to communicate to readers how such a table began to come into existence in the first place from measurements at the Trinity site etc.

:::Good job on the contemporary yield estimates section hawkeye7! All we have to do now is put a referenced sentence or two in on how the yield was revised, and finally came to be &quot;20 kiloton&quot;. On a related note, I'm a bit disturbed by your removal of the fact that Gadget was a euphemism for a bomb. Can you explain why you continue to remove this?

=== Gadget ===
AIUI, 'Gadget' had two meanings, depending on date and context.

Early on, 'Gadget' was the term for the design of a [[physics package]], broadly the weaponising of a scientific principle. This was a specific and relatively narrow piece of work, because most of Manhattan's efforts were actually going into research in physics or metallurgy, or the problem of producing fissile materials. 'Gadget' work began with the concept of core compression (by linear assembly or implosion) and turning physics into a weapon.

Later on, '''The'' Gadget' became a term for the specific physics package to be used for Trinity. This was ''not'' a bomb: it had no casing, no fuzing and didn't necessarily have the mechanical robustness to be air-dropped. An even more obvious demonstration of the differences would be for the cryogenic thermonuclear devices, such as the [[Ivy Mike]] 'Sausage' / Mk 16 bomb. In Trinity's case, it ended up being mechanically very similar to Fat Man, although the X unit wasn't robust enough (you can make electronics to be easily modifiable during development, or packed solid to be robust, but it's hard to do both simultaneously) and AFAIK there had been proposals to test implosion with more crudely built mechanical prototypes at one time, overtaken by good progress on the mechanical design intended for Fat Man. Trinity was a test of physics and effects, not of engineering: there was already confidence that the engineering was good. The &quot;thing built for Trinity&quot; though was not a bomb, never a bomb and still needed something to call it - hence, 'The Gadget'. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 12:16, 9 November 2014 (UTC)

::A bomb does not have to be an aerial bomb; consider the common road-side bomb. And while &quot;Sausage&quot; was a purely experimental device, the Trinity gadget was a Y-1561 Fat Man with only a few differences from the one used at Nagasaki. But if I understand you correctly, you are saying that in the subsequent historiography, the term &quot;gadget&quot; was misapplied to mean the Trinity gadget? Do we have sources for that? The ones I consulted were careful to avoid that. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 20:06, 9 November 2014 (UTC)

::: No, I mean that the term  'Gadget' had two meanings, depending on date and context, ''at the time of the term's use''.
::: In the early context, the need was to talk about 'gadgeteering' as a branch of engineering. Later there was a need to refer to the device being built for Trinity, in particular in the ways that it was distinct from Fat Man. Both of these needed a neologism – they had to call it something.

== Code name ==

Well, with all respect to Oppenheimer, I think he made up that poetic answer in order to give it relevance and depth. I think that the name &quot;Trinity&quot; sounds very much like the first letters in &quot;trinitrotoluene&quot; (TNT), not to be a hypothesis to consider. Remember that the explosive yield of nuclear devices began to be expressed in kilotons and megatons of TNT around that time, and the term was probably used on a daily basis during design and trials. They may even use &quot;Trinity&quot; as an informal apocope for the entire name of the explosive. Later, Oppenheimer could find that naming something so trascendent after an inner joke may sound frivolous and inappropriate, and chose to offer a deeper and gloomily inspirational explanation for the code name.

== Stimson's home ==
Because Stimson's summer home at High Hold was on Long Island and Harrison's farm near Upperville, Virginia, this indicated that the explosion could be seen 200 miles (320 km) away and heard 50 miles (80 km) away.[122]

This part, while induced in the source, is badly written the the source, and just confusing without the context of the full article, and should be removed.  What it is trying to do is explain how far 200 miles actually, is.  It is probably unnecessary.

:You got it right. Well done. The sequence in question actually serves a number of different purposes. Firstly, the reder is reminded that senior officials were at the Potsdam Conference. Second, millennial reader may assume that someone picked up a mobile phone and called Potsdam. It is noted that the report took time to reach Potsdam. Third, the chain of command is illustrated, the message being passed from Harrison to Stimson, the Secretary of War, and not directly to the President. And finally, the quote is famous, because it refers to Little Boy, which was already en route to Tinian. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 22:07, 18 July 2015 (UTC)

==  Presence of Richard Feynmann at Trinity test ==

Richard Feynmann, qv, not only viewed the Trinity test, he did so without goggles. He not only participated in the Manhattan Project, he was the envoy sent to observe the first chain reaction (squash court, Chicago) and report back to project leaders. He is now known as one of the greatest physicists of our time. His direct contributions to the Manhattan Project and his later developments in quantum theory suggest STRONGLY that his presence,and eyewitness account of Trinity, be AT LEAST briefly included, with a link to your eponymous article.

Thank you for your consideration!

== Some questions about geography of trinity site ==

The phrase Jornada del Meurto, tho poetic, is not one that is used a lot in those parts of NM--at least as far as I have ever heard. No matter. However, it is not a valley or basin but a trail--most of which stretches far south of trinity site. As a matter of fact the section in the vicinity of trinity (no poesy intended) is also in the Tularosa basin. Thus the statement:  &quot;Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau;...&quot; hardly makes sense. I just kinda think these things should be cleared up or less ambiguous language used. [[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 20:52, 6 November 2016 (UTC)
*I see on perusing the Bainbridge report that this is the language he used...i.e., &quot;Jornada del Muerto Valley&quot;. Still it is an ambiguous wording. Sigh. We now have to know what Bainbridge meant by &quot;Tularosa valley&quot; and &quot;Jornada del Muerto Valley&quot;. Sigh. If only I had known to ask him 40 years ago when he laughed at me for being afraid of thorium pellet.[[User:JuanRiley|Juan Riley ]] ([[User talk:JuanRiley|talk]]) 21:01, 6 November 2016 (UTC)
**Technically I see now as I google more that some folk do refer to the area of the Tularosa basin to the west of Oscuro Mts as the Jornada del Muerto Valley. So please disregard.
