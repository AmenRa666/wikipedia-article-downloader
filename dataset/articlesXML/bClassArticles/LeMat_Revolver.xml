The '''LeMat revolver''' was a .42 or .36 [[caliber]] [[percussion cap|cap &amp; ball]] [[black powder]] [[revolver]] invented by [[Jean Alexandre LeMat]] of [[New Orleans]], which featured an unusual secondary 20 [[Gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] smooth-bore barrel capable of firing [[buckshot]]. It saw service with the armed forces of the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–65 and the Army of the [[Government of National Defense]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

==History and design==
This unique sidearm was also known as the &quot;Grape Shot Revolver.&quot; It was developed in New Orleans in 1856 by Jean Alexander Le Mat, whose manufacturing effort was backed by [[P. G. T. Beauregard]], who became a general in the Confederate Army. Fewer than 100 were made by John Krider of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in 1859, including the first 25 prototypes. It is estimated that 2,900 were produced in [[Liege, Belgium]] and [[Paris, France]]. The European made pistols were shipped through [[Birmingham, England]], where they were proofmarked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flayderman2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Flayderman|first=Norm|title=Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THeWYkwoLSUC&amp;pg=PA643|date=17 December 2007|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89689-455-X|page=643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 900 revolvers were shipped to the Confederate Army and 600 to the Confederate Navy through [[Bermuda]] to avoid the Southern Naval Blockade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flayderman2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicoine2005&quot;/&gt;

The distinguishing characteristic of LeMat's revolver is that its 9-shot cylinder revolves around a separate central barrel of larger [[caliber]] than the chambers in the cylinder proper. The central barrel is smooth-bore and can function as a short-barreled [[shotgun]] (hence the name &quot;Grape Shot Revolver&quot;) with the shooter selecting whether to fire from the cylinder or the smooth-bore barrel by flipping a lever on the end of the hammer.  Flipping the lever up caused the movable striker to fall upon the primer set directly under the hammer, discharging the lower barrel, while leaving it in the standard position would fire the chambers in the cylinder, much like any other revolver.&lt;ref name=adler&gt;{{cite book|title=Guns of the Civil War|first=Dennis|last=Adler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_uDFetQrUbcC&amp;pg=PA205|date=28 March 2011|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3971-8|pages=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeMat originally chambered his pistol for .40 (or .42) caliber revolver bullets, with a .60 (20 gauge) smooth-bore barrel, and had a jointed [[ramrod]] (mounted on the right-hand side of the frame), which was used to load both barrels.  Later, during the American Civil War, a lighter .35-caliber pistol with a .55 caliber (28-gauge) smooth bore barrel was produced, but as these were non-standard ammunition sizes (.36 or .44 caliber were most common for contemporary revolvers) LeMat owners had to cast their own bullets (as opposed to being issued them from general military stores).  The final models of the LeMat were produced in .36 or .44 caliber in response to these criticisms, but too few of them managed to get past the [[Union blockade]] of the South during the Civil War to be of any real use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cumpston2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cumpston|first=Mike|title=Percussion Pistols and Revolvers: History, Performance and Practical Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQausfRgWvYC&amp;pg=PA138|date=July 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-35796-3|pages=138–146|chapter=A Hail of Lead-the Confederate LeMat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War use==
LeMat hoped to market his adaptable revolver as a primary sidearm for [[dragoon]]s and other mounted troops. He entered into a partnership with [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] (at that time a major in the U.S. Army) in April 1859 to market his handgun to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. Beauregard, besides being LeMat's cousin, was one of the first U.S. Army officers to resign and join the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=adler/&gt;
[[File:Perkussions Revolver Le Mat.JPG|thumb|LeMat Revolver, original [[Percussion cap|cap &amp; ball]] model, used by the Confederate Troops in the American Civil War]] 
When war broke out, LeMat received Confederate contracts for the production of five thousand revolvers, and plans were laid to manufacture the gun abroad and then import them into the Confederacy, which lacked the necessary facilities to produce the weapon locally. Confederate gun runners were able to slip shipments of the gun through the Union naval blockade and it is estimated that about 2,500 made it into Confederate service.&lt;ref name=adler/&gt;

In addition to General Beauregard and Colonel LeMat, LeMat’s revolver was used by such famous Confederate officers as Major Generals [[Braxton Bragg]], [[J. E. B. Stuart]], [[Richard H. Anderson]], and Major [[Henry Wirz]].  Confederate Major General J. E. B. Stuart &quot;was known to favor the LeMat revolver&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pocket Book of Civil War Weapons|first=Angus |last=Konstam|publisher= Chartwell Books, Inc.|location=Edison NJ|year= 2004|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Beauregard's personal engraved LeMat, which he carried throughout the war, is preserved at the [[Museum of the Confederacy]] in Richmond, Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taffin2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Taffin|first=John|authorlink=John Taffin|title=Single Action Sixguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vrK2zj7V3cC&amp;pg=PA187|year=2005|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2694-6|pages=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LeMat revolver was manufactured from 1856 to 1865, with approximately 2,900 being produced. The first models were manufactured by John Krider of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], with the second model (the first overseas model) being produced by Charles Frederic Girard and Son of [[Paris]]. Quality concerns prompted LeMat to consider production at the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], but production was never mounted there. LeMat revolvers from [[France]] were shipped to the Confederate forces via the [[United Kingdom]], and all firearms landed in the UK were (and still are) required to be [[proof (firearms)|proofed]]. The LeMats which found their way through the Union blockade were stamped with British proof marks from the [[Birmingham Proof House]], leading to the misapprehension that the pistols were actually manufactured in the UK. A handful are known to have been made illegitimately in the UK by an unknown manufacturer, believed to be the [[London Armoury Company]], but only two examples survive to the present day and it is doubtful any of the English-made LeMats ever saw service during the U.S. Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Russell E.|title=Warman's Civil War Collectibles Identification and Price Guide|date=4 March 2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1522-7|pages=331–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original revolver, constructed of [[blued steel]] with grips of checkered [[walnut]], was not considered to be a very accurate weapon although it was deadly at close range. Civil War cavalrymen, particularly in the South, preferred to carry several pistols, as it was faster to draw another loaded weapon than it was to try to reload a cap and ball revolver in combat.

After the introduction of [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]-firing [[firearm]]s, the LeMat system appeared in [[pinfire]], but this version is exceedingly rare. A centerfire version in 12mm Perrin or 11mm Chamelot-Delvigne, with a 24 gauge shot barrel, was made in later years in Belgium.&lt;ref name=adler/&gt; While having better sales than its pinfire relative, the centerfire LeMat also had no real commercial success due to the invention of the double-action system. With both weapons, loading was accomplished via a loading gate located at the 4 o'clock position for the cylinder, and by swinging the breech of the shot barrel up and left.&lt;ref name=adler/&gt;

==Variants==
*'''Muzzle Loader''' – The first variant of the LeMat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shideler2011&quot;/&gt;
*'''Pinfire Cartridge''' – Second variant, can be recognised by cylinder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis2010&quot;/&gt;
*'''Centerfire''' – The centerfire variant came with a distinctive grip.&lt;ref name=adler/&gt;
*'''Carbine''' – A rare variant with extended barrels and a rifle type stock totalling 20&quot; in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shideler2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Shideler|first=Dan|title=The Gun Digest Book of Guns &amp; Prices 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyoOLh4ZNCQC&amp;pg=PA556|date=10 May 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1890-0|pages=555–556}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Baby LeMat''' - The rarest variant of the LeMat is a reduced size version with a 4 3/4&quot; barrel and the revolver chambered in .32 caliber and the shotgun chambered in .41 bore. Only 100 were produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shideler2011&quot;/&gt;
