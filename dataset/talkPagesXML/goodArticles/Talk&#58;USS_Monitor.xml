== A few comments ==

Here are some comments that may be useful for the GAN and future reviews you may plan on doing:
*Please watch for duplicate links, quite a few of which are currently in the article. 
*Ship names should always be italicized - I caught a few examples of this, but there may be more. 
*Since this is an article about an American warship, American spellings should be used - I fixed a couple of these in the Legacy section.
*The definite article is sometimes used before a ship's name, other times it is not. One should be standardized - I'd recommend dropping them (since one wouldn't refer to a person with the definite article), but that's my opinion.
*It would be helpful to explain to the reader what exactly was happening with ''Merrimack/Virginia'' up front - the reader has to go through a whole paragraph before they're even told that ''Virginia'' started out as ''Merrimack''. Few readers will already know this.
*The line about Vikings needs to go - you're talking apples and oranges here. It'd be like connecting early bronze helmets with the need for modern infantry to have head protection from shell splinters. So many things changed between the two that the comparison is completely meaningless. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 20:18, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
::'''Thanks''' for your time and effort here. Regarding the Virginia - Merrimack, it says right off in the lede that the Virginia was the former Merrimack.  Links, I'll check on these. Sometimes I'll add a second link if it's an important topic and the links occur in different sections that are far apart. I believe MOS specifies this, but I'll look for others. Re: the Vikings analogy. It only makes a simple reference to the need for armor, whether it be a need for protection against arrows, spears or cannonballs, but okay, I was given a similar opinion before by another editor, so I'll look for a better analogy. Need one that goes back in time a little bit, however. Any suggestions off hand? Also, I'm not sure what you mean by a &quot;definite article&quot; before a ships name. Isn't the ship's name the article itself? -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:49, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
:::I mean [[the|the definite article]], grammatically speaking ;) Sometimes, for instance, it's &quot;the ''Monitor''&quot;, other times it's just &quot;''Monitor''&quot;. As for links, the relevant section in the MOS is [[WP:OVERLINK]] - either way, [[gun turret]] is linked in successive paragraphs for example, and that is excessive by any yardstick. And on ''Merrimarck/Virginia'', yes, but it doesn't explain how the ship came to be in Confederate hands (and more troubling, the paragraph in the body just jumps in, assuming that the reader knows what's going on).
:::The problem with the comparison to Vikings (or basically anything else) is that there's the very long period where ships were completely unarmored (beyond what the wood itself provided, of course) and there was no need to armor them. The need for armor arose completely from the Paixhans gun (and derivatives thereof), and any comparison between earlier attempts to armor ships (even with the allegedly iron-armored [[turtle ship]]s) is inappropriate. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 12:24, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
:::::Have been making the changes. 
:::::*Have removed the Viking shield analogy.
:::::*Removed some duplicate links. Still checking for others.  Duplicate links will be used (no more than twice) and only for important items when the linked topic is in a separate section far away from the first link. This was once stipulated in MOS but I see it has since been removed. If this becomes a sore issue I'll go along, but it seems we would be doing the reader a service if an important topic was linked more than once in some cases where it's practical, imo.
:::::*Using ''The Monitor'' vs ''Monitor'', by itself. I am not a fan of truncated phraseology -- it makes the narrative read like a police report, so I would prefer using '''''The''' Monitor'', using the same convention for other ship's names. Will wait for some feed back on that before any changes are made there.
:::::*The Merrimack to Virginia conversion: The lede is not the place to get into actual details, and the conversion is explained in the first section following the lede. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:12, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Re: ''Merrimack/Virginia'' - I wasn't asking for more details in the lead, it's the first section I'm talking about. It starts:
::::::::{{xt|&quot;The Union Navy's attitude towards ironclads changed quickly when it was learned that the Confederates were building one of their own. The urgency of Monitor's completion and deployment to Hampton Roads was driven by fears of what the ironclad Virginia would be capable of doing...&quot;}}
:::::::I don't think that suitably explains what was going on, since it sounds like the Confederates were building an ironclad from scratch. It would be better to state up front that the Confederates were rebuilding a salvaged Union frigate, ''Merrimack'', into the casemate ironclad ''Virginia''. 
:::::::Also ''Merrimack'' isn't mentioned until:
::::::::{{xt|&quot;Word of her reconstruction was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when Mary Louveste of Norfolk, Virginia, a freed slave who worked as a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on Merrimack&quot;}}
:::::::This assumes the reader knows that ''Merrimack'' and ''Virginia'' are the same ship. I can guarantee you that very few will already know this, and they will be confused why we're talking about two different Confederate ships.
:::::::On links - there are still redundant links to draft and freeboard in successive paragraphs. And as for &quot;the&quot;, it's not truncated, it's just a different style - the name of a ship is treated like the name of a person, and there's only [[The Donald |one idiot]] I know of who uses the definite article with his name ;) [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 18:48, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::*Here are the new statements (w/ changes in bold):

:::::::::::*''The Union Navy's attitude towards ironclads changed quickly when it was learned that the Confederates were '''converting the captured [[USS Merrimack|''Merrimack'']] to an ironclad at the naval shipyard in Norfolk'''''
:::::::::::*''Word of her reconstruction '''and conversion''' was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when Mary Louveste ...''

:::::::::*Zapped some links. Looking for other dup's.
:::::::::*Okay, except for the first sentence in the lede, I'll use ''Idiot'' instead of ''The Idiot''. {{=)}} -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 21:04, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
::::::::::*Oh yeah, it's normal to use &quot;the&quot; if you're saying something like &quot;the casemate ironclad ''Virginia''&quot; or &quot;the battleship ''Bismarck''&quot; and whatnot.
::::::::::*Your changes with ''Merrimack/Virginia'' looks good to me.
::::::::::*There's a handy tool that helps you find redundant links - it's at [[User:Ucucha/duplinks]]. If you want to use it, just follow the instructions there, and it adds a button in your tool box on the left. It's easiest if you open the page in two browser tabs, turn on the tool in one, and then edit the article in the other.

===Bibliography===
Extraneous text in {{cs1}} parameters should be avoided because it corrupts the citation's [[COinS]] metadata.  This is most noticeable in parameters like {{para|publisher|National Geographic Books, 191 pages}} where the number of pages is included as part of the publisher's name when clearly it is not.

There seem to be discrepancies between various parts of individual citations.  For example, this one:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=James Phinney, 3rd |authorlink=James Phinney Baxter III |title=The Introduction of the Ironclad Warship |ref=Baxter |edition=reprint of the 1933 |year=1968 |publisher=Archon Books, 398 pages,| location=Hamden, Connecticut,  |oclc=695838727|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rR95Mi7vVHoC&amp;dq=%22Cornelius+Scranton+Bushnell%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
::→{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=James Phinney, 3rd |authorlink=James Phinney Baxter III |title=The Introduction of the Ironclad Warship |ref=Baxter |edition=reprint of the 1933 |year=1968 |publisher=Archon Books, 398 pages,| location=Hamden, Connecticut,  |oclc=695838727|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rR95Mi7vVHoC&amp;dq=%22Cornelius+Scranton+Bushnell%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}

The link to Google books returns the Naval Institute Press edition from the Classics of Naval Literature series, neither of which are mentioned in the citation; the OCLC link returns a page of WorldCat data about the Archon books version.

Wherever a CS1 citation links to a non-html file, editors should include {{para|format}} to identify the file format of the online resource.  This also includes those links that get automatic pdf icons:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite book |last=Holloway |first=Anna |title=The Last Voyage of the USS Monitor |ref=Holloway |year=2013 |publisher=The Mariner's Museum |location=Newport News, VA |url=http://www.marinersmuseum.org/sites/default/files/holloway-last_voyage_monitor.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
::→{{cite book |last=Holloway |first=Anna |title=The Last Voyage of the USS Monitor |ref=Holloway |year=2013 |publisher=The Mariner's Museum |location=Newport News, VA |url=http://www.marinersmuseum.org/sites/default/files/holloway-last_voyage_monitor.pdf|format=pdf}}

The reason for this is so that readers who use screen readers can know the file format – the icons do not have alt text (though they should).

With Chrome, the list of crew members looks strange.  The commanding officer text is offset right but his bullet point is at the far left margin.  Perhaps a table instead?

::Thanks for your input Trappist'. Would be interested in your thoughts about what to do with the number of pages for books. The number gives one an idea of how extensive the coverage a given work is. For example Konstam's ''Union Monitor 1861–65'', is only 48 pages long, so right off one can tell this is just a summary, whereas Quarstein's ''The CSS Virginia: Sink Before Surrender'' is 591 pages, which tells one that the work is indepth. Comes in handy when you're going over the bibliography trying to decide where to look for things. Re:Chrome. Various browsers don't recognize certain markup. For example, Netscape doesn't recognize reflist (i.e. column settings for references) along with other markup that controls graphics. Many library computers have the resolution set low, yielding bigger letters, etc, which sometimes crowds the text and images in a given article.  Then we have all the new mobile devices which present their own problems, so I'm afraid Wikipedia can't please all the people all of the time, and I've stopped trying to do so a long time ago. If there is a serious problem that effects everyone I'll do what I can to accommodate matters. In any case, I've added the format= to the given cite book templates and fixed some url problems you've brought to our attention. Will look for any others. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 16:14, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

:::I'm not sure that the length of a cited source should matter.  The validity of a source isn't measured by mass; as we don't judge a book by its cover ...  Konstam's ''Union Monitor 1861–65'' is cited as the source for information presented in the article.  The editor who added that particular citation presumably determined that the source was sufficiently authoritative that its mass was of no consequence.

:::The purpose of a citation is to refer readers to the source of the information contained in the article.  In this, a list of citations is different from a bibliographic list of related materials.  The former is the source material, while the latter might be useful as source material but hasn't been so used.  Perhaps this:
:::#§Bibliography gets renamed §Cited sources
:::#move §§Further reading out of §Bibliography to become §Further reading because those items aren't cited sources
:::#§Bibliography and §§Primary sources: remove the number of pages entirely from all listed items (or move then outside the templates and then hide them inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:::#§Further reading: move the number of pages from {{para|publisher}} to after the citation template's closing &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

:::Yep, understand about browser differences ...  But, Wikipedia has a lot of those worked out so there should be some way to get what you want.  Perhaps this:

::::The purpose of page numbers is as stated, not as a means to 'judge a book by it's cover'. Are you suggesting that we eliminate page numbers entirely?  In any case, I'll try the table layout you've provided. If you're using Chrome, let us know how it works in the article. (Btw, thanks!) -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:42, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
:::::FWIW, I'm using Chrome right now and the table Trappist added here works fine for me.
:::::Out of curiosity, what style guide are you using for the citations? It's not one I'm familiar with. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 20:08, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

:::::You wrote: {{tq|The number gives one an idea of how extensive the coverage a given work is.}}  I think that for the purposes of supporting information in the article, the number of pages in the source is irrelevant.  What matters is the quality of the source.  So, making a judgement about a source based on its length is the same a making a judgement about that source based on its cover.

:::::Yes, I am suggesting that the source's length (number of pages) should be moved out of the CS1 citation templates because: (1) there is no native support for that information in CS1 templates and (2) because, where it has been included as part of {{para|publisher}}, it corrupts the citation's [[COinS]] metadata.

:::::I guess I'd have gone the other way with Baxter.  It seems that at courtesy link to Google books that doesn't give a reader a preview of the content isn't much of a courtesy.  Does the Naval Institute Press edition not support the article text?

:::::I haven't checked them all but I notice that Holzer 2013, while listed in §Biblography, has no matching reference in §References.

:::::Here is a peculiar one:
::::::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite book |title=The Monitor and the Navy under steam |last=Bennett, Lieutenant, U.S. Navy |first=Frank M.  |ref=Bennett |location=Boston and New York |publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 369 pages, |year=1900 |isbn=}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=9xiZsRXWVRYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s E'book]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

::::::*personal titles or rank, if they are necessary (I would argue that they are generally not necessary) follow the author's first name when listed in the last/first order as they are in this article.  This keeps the ordering of other similarly named authors standardized – especially when computers are doing the ordering (from the metadata).
::::::*url to Google books outside of the CS1 template: that's why {{para|url}} exists.
::::::*punctuation: trailing comma in {{para|publisher}} is followed by the citation's terminal punctuation followed by the comma that introduces the Google books link.  If you need special punctuation ate the end of a CS1 citation, use {{para|postscript}}:

:::::For demonstrations purposes assume: that Bennett's rank is necessary; that it's important to show the number of pages in the source; that the desired terminal punctuation is a semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;): then, we might write Bennett this way:

::::::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Frank M., LT USN |title=The Monitor and the Navy under steam |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9xiZsRXWVRYC |type=Ebook |ref=Bennett |location=Boston and New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1900 |isbn= |via=Google books |postscript=;}} 369 pages.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

:::::I'll shut up now.

:::::Yeah, what Editor Parsecboy said.  The table works for me on Chrome, and old copies of Opera and Windows Exploder.

::::::{{ec}} (Somehow this got zapped by Trappist's last edit.) I've already added the table Trappist provided to the article and it works good on my end too. I'm using Firefox, which is said to have the least amount of hang-ups as websites, mark up etc, is concerned.  Re: Citations: This is the format I've been using: &lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#xyz|Author, 1900]], p.123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt; where ''xyz'' is is the label used in the ''ref'' field (&amp;nbsp;|ref=xyz&amp;nbsp;) in the 'Cite book' template. When you click on the cite, it of course links you to the respective reference, but when you click on the reference it will now link you to the respective source listing in the bibliography. If you simply hover over the cite without clicking, the citation information will automatically be displayed in a small pop up window next to the cite. At least it does with Firefox. Been using this style for years with no problems. Have also been using page numbers, including articles that achieved GA, all along with no issues from anyone either. Btw, wouldn't it have been better if someone [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations#Warfare|started the GA review]] and held all these discussions there? As the GA nominator I can't start the review. In any case, greatly appreciate the feed back, criticism, advice, et al. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 00:05, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

:::::::What I wanted to convey, and I guess I didn't, is that there is no &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holzer13|Holzer, 2013]], p.???&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; nor, it turns out, a &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holzer06|Holzer, 2006]], p.???&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the article text, so no links in §References to the Holzer citations in §Bibliography.  This suggests that both Holzer citation should be moved from §Bibliography to §Further reading (where there is already a duplicate of Holzer 2006).

:::::::But, there is a Holtzer (with a t) 2006 ... Are Holzer and Holtzer the same?  If so, still no Hol(t)zer 2013.

::::::::I can't speak for Trappist, but the reason I posted my comments on the talk page rather than the GA review page is because I don't really have the time to devote to a full review of an article this size, but I thought my comments would still be helpful for improving the article for GA, and A-class or FAC if you decide to take it further.

No problems with contaminated data, or anything else, would occur by placing the page number outside of the cite book template, which would display the number of pages at the end of a given source listing. Below is an example of the markup.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*{{cite book |title=Harriet Tubman, Secret Agent: How Daring Slaves and Free Blacks Spied for the Union During the Civil War |last=Allen |first=Thomas B. |ref=Allen |publisher=National Geographic Books|year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4263-0401-9}}, 191 pages&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

&lt;center&gt;Which would display the publication like so:&lt;/center&gt;

*{{cite book |title=Harriet Tubman, Secret Agent: How Daring Slaves and Free Blacks Spied for the Union During the Civil War |last=Allen |first=Thomas B. |ref=Allen |publisher=National Geographic Books|year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4263-0401-9}}, 191 pages

:Yes, of course.  And then what happens?  If you implement your suggestion, does some industrious editor come along and clean up after you, neatly putting all those page numbers into {{para|pages}} inside the templates?  You could, I suppose, leave a hidden note: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;!-- not the same as |pages= --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or some such, but it's my experience that industrious editors ignore those kinds of notes.  Also, notice the extraneous punctuation between the end of the citation and the number of pages.  

:Seems best to me to just delete the stuff and have done.

:::The ''|page='' (single page) and ''|pages='' (page range) is used to cite the actual page number(s) when cite book is used as a citation in the text. As I've said, been listing page numbers for years with no issues, or &quot;cleanup&quot;, from anyone. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:12, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Now what? Is there some policy that says we have to hide url's to books that are not viewable? Maybe the reader might want to check out any reviews, or even purchase the book. Please restore the url's, or I will. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]])

:The citations are in the article to support the article.  A link in a citation implies that readers can view supporting information by following the link.  If the linked Google books page turns out to be a non-preview page, then the reader is disappointed.  

:In part, this is why I asked about Baxter where the oclc identifier and the courtesy link pointed to different editions and why I said that I wouldn't have made the choice that you did.  With the [http://books.google.com/books?id=rR95Mi7vVHoC Naval Institute] edition, Google books has a preview; not so with the [http://books.google.com/books?id=4CQzAAAAMAAJ Archon], though that matches the oclc identifier.  After you changed Baxter to Archon, when I clicked the citation's title I was disappointed to find that I couldn't go any further because there was nothing to see there.  If the Naval Institute edition supports the article, I would suggest that it should be the source, not the Archon.

:While it doesn't directly address this particular issue, one might infer from the similar issue addressed at [[WP:CITE#Linking to Google Books pages|WP:CITE]] and the linked [[Wikipedia talk:Citing sources/Archive 29#Linking to Google Books pages|RfC]] that we ought not link to non-preview pages at Google books.

:I'm sure that there may be a few readers who might wish to read reviews of, or purchase, a book but they would seem the rare case.  And, Wikipedia ought not be in the business of facilitating book sales so I don't find these reasons to be particularly persuasive.

:::Well, it's also rare that anyone will be concerned with COinS, library software, etc. In any case,  since these particular url's do not link to a book that's viewable, I have no problems with keeping them hid, if you're insisting. If anything, these url's tell the reader that they can't check on a statement using these particular sources. Without them, they're left wondering why a few of the url's are missing. Anyway, no biggie. Again, thanks for all the time and help you've extended. Hope we can get this review rolling. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:54, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

==Nominated for GA==
The '''USS ''Monitor''''' article has been nominated for GA. A preliminary review was conducted above. To start the review and/or leave comment go to the [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations#USS Monitor|'''GA nominations page''']] or the [[Talk:USS Monitor/GA1|'''USS Monitor GA review page''']]. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 17:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

== Summary style ==

The article is currently at 63 kB of prose. That's a very big article. Yes, the ''Monitor'' was highly influential, but the ship itself doesn't seem notable enough for such a massive treatment. This is a very informative, well-researched article, but it could use a lot of trimming (per [[WP:SUMMARY]]).

For example, the treatment of the two battles is almost as long as the actual battle articles themselves. There's an almost excruciating amount of detail in some cases. If you look at &quot;Final voyage&quot;, there's a very long paragraph on waves crashing, pumps failing and orders being handed out. Even a dramatic sinking can become fairly dreary with a blow-by-blow recount. All those minor details make for even less encyclopedic reading when it comes to presidential hand shaking, the receiving of one-dollar dinners and rudder realignments.

::Thanks for your comments. Most naval historians agree that the USS ''Monitor'' is among the most notable ships in U.S. naval history and marked a turning point in naval history altogether. You can ask for other opinions at [[WP:SHIP|WikiProject ships]] and elsewhere if you feel strongly about this. There are plenty of GA and FA articles that exceed 63 kb becasue the subject involves itself with many things. You are the first person to come along and regard some of the coverage as &quot;dreary&quot;. The USS ''Monitor'' involved many people and events (not just battles) during the Civil War, and as lengthy as you may feel it is, it is still a summary as there are entire books written about this vessel and its history. After it passes GA review it will be nominated for FA, the requirements of which demand a well written and well covered account. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:48, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Well, even 100 printed pages (this would be around 30-35) would of course be a &quot;summary&quot; of all the available literature. But also completely unreadable. ''Monitor'' is primarily well-known because of it's influence, not it's extended career or anything like that. And the only person who is genuinely notable due to ''Monitor'' is Ericsson. Compare this article with ship-related FAs about far broader topics: it's as long as [[dreadnought]], longer than [[ironclad warship]] or [[battleship]] and ''twice'' the size of [[pre-dreadnought battleship]].
:::At the very least, the finer details of the two battles should be moved to separate articles, because the amount of information here can't really be considered a summary.

:::::I'm afraid I disagree entirely with everything you say here. The ''Monitor'' was and is known because of the epic battle she fought 'and' because her role in it changed the course of naval history. The two ideas are inseparable. Ericcson and the ship's commander, Worden, and even some others, are also fairly well known, albeit not as much as Lincoln. And like the dreadnought, ''Monitor'' became its own class of ship. The article is a well written summary with excellent scope. The dedicated articles covering the battles ''Monitor'' was involved in need to be longer and better written, which is why the battle sections in this article rival them in size and coverage. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 02:27, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::'''Add :'''The [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] article is more than ten pages long while the section covering that battle in this article is less than a page, so comparing the section here to that article in terms of length was not very appropriate. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 01:45, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

== Definite article in ship names ==

I see that someone went through a couple years ago and added definite article to all ship names, in the interest of consistency. Unfortunately this clashes with [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships)]]. I fixed the first sentence of the lead but refrained from fixing the rest (just the ones with USS or CSS prefixes) pending discussion.
