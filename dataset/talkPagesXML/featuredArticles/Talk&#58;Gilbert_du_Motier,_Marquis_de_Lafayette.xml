== Flag in infobox ==

The infobox shows the tricolor flag for the Kingdom of France during the Bourbon restoration, but it did not use that.  It brought back the fleur-de-lys.  [[User:Funnyhat|Funnyhat]] ([[User talk:Funnyhat|talk]]) 22:29, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
:{{ping|Funnyhat}}. If you mean [[:File:Pavillon royal de France.svg]], it says in the image description that its use as the flag of the Kingdom of France from 1815-1830 is contested. I corrected the template parameters in the article to Kingdom of France during the Bourbon restoration, but that uses [[:File:Royal Standard of the King of France.svg]] and I am not sure if that is the correct flag. I think to get a change to the template you need to bring this up at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Flag Template]] to discuss changing [[:Template:Country data Kingdom of France]]. [[User:Richard-of-Earth|Richard-of-Earth]] ([[User talk:Richard-of-Earth|talk]]) 11:58, 17 May 2016 (UTC)
:: The Bourbon brought back the white flag of the Ancien Régime, and the tricolour came back in 1830 with the constitutional monarchy. That is the whole point of paintings such as Delacroix' ''Liberty Leading the People '', or Cogniet's [[:File:Lar7 cogniet 001z.jpg|''Scenes of July 1830'']] (the latter even has documentary value to answer your question). Cheers! [[User:Rama|Rama]] ([[User talk:Rama|talk]]) 13:01, 17 May 2016 (UTC)
:::I would suggest the tricolor, as Lafayette is closely associated with the creation.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 13:27, 17 May 2016 (UTC)

== America's Favorite Fighting Frenchman ==
:: If the article's semi-protection has not been lifted yet, I propose it does so. [[User:Chicbyaccident|Chicbyaccident]] ([[User talk:Chicbyaccident|talk]]) 19:28, 27 September 2016 (UTC)
:I have removed it per your request.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 18:49, 28 September 2016 (UTC)

:: Thank you! [[User:Chicbyaccident|Chicbyaccident]] (&lt;small&gt;Please notify with {{SUBST:[[Template:re|re]]}}&lt;/small&gt; ([[User talk:Chicbyaccident|Talk]]) 12:33, 12 October 2016 (UTC)

:::I've had to revert another &quot;America's Favorite Fighting Frenchman&quot;, which is how he is referred to in ''Hamilton''.  How do people feel about this?  If people want it included in the article, I'm prepared to accept that.  Can we have a discussion?  I'm prepared  to accept things either way. The public certainly has a voice in this article and if it's clear this is what the public wants, I'll source it, possibly annotate it, and we go on.  If people feel it should go, well, then I'd have that behind me when removing it.  I started out opposed, but now I'm indifferent.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 20:20, 28 September 2016 (UTC)
::::Does anyone have an opinion on this?  Should I start a RfC?--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 20:55, 11 October 2016 (UTC)

== Surname etymology ==

It would be good if the article were to present an explanation of what the name &quot;La Fayette&quot; means, especially with so many things and places named after the Marquis.  I have yet to find a source that is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, but I did find an excellent explanation so I will post it here, and hopefully someone will be able to get this info up to the standard where we can add it to the article:

:French surnames often go back to a place where people or a family used to live. For instance the surname &quot;Dumont&quot; or &quot;Lamont&quot; meant that a family lived on a hill or a mountain. The &quot;Lapierre&quot; and &quot;Delpierre&quot; families originated from an area that was stony. &quot;Delamare&quot; lived near the sea or a mere, &quot;Dulac&quot; lived near a lake.,The &quot;Dubois&quot; came from a wood and the &quot;Laforêt&quot; or &quot;Laforest&quot;&quot; from a forest.
:In the case of Lafayette the etymology goes back to middle French &quot;la faillette&quot;.&quot;La faille&quot; means &quot;the crack&quot; and the &quot;ette&quot; ending indicates something small. So it is likely that the original families bearing that name originated in a place where there was a crack on a hillside or a small cave near by.
:Until spellings were formalised, they were approximate, hence the variations.

:That came from here:  [https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071022220217AArxpnO https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071022220217AArxpnO]
:There are other references that give an explanation that Lafayette means &quot;little fairy&quot;.  It might be best to present both versions, and then give qualifiers regarding the level of veracity of both.--[[User:Cy Maddox|Cy Maddox]] ([[User talk:Cy Maddox|talk]]) 18:29, 28 September 2016 (UTC)

::If you can find a source that satisfies everyone, I will be happy to polish the prose.  It might be best to put it as a footnote, but I could see it either way.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 18:45, 28 September 2016 (UTC)

== Semi-protected edit request on 28 October 2016 ==

{{edit semi-protected|Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|answered=y}}

Hello, can you add &quot;The Hero of the Two Worlds&quot; under nicknames?

[[User:Zotronic|Zotronic]] ([[User talk:Zotronic|talk]]) 18:32, 28 October 2016 (UTC)
:[[File:Red information icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] '''Not done:'''&lt;!-- Template:ESp --&gt; as you have not cited [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to back up your request, without which no information should be added to, or changed in, any article. - [[User:Arjayay|Arjayay]] ([[User talk:Arjayay|talk]]) 20:53, 28 October 2016 (UTC)

::Why is the article protected? [[User:Chicbyaccident|Chicbyaccident]] (&lt;small&gt;Please notify with {{SUBST:[[Template:re|re]]}}&lt;/small&gt; ([[User talk:Chicbyaccident|Talk]]) 11:58, 3 November 2016 (UTC)

:::Please see the above sections.  As I understand it, the article is protected because people keep adding &quot;America's Favorite Fighting Frenchman&quot;, which is what he is called in the play ''Hamilton'' and nowhere else.  I eliminated the nickname field from the infobox to reduce temptation; the request by Zotronic is reasonable.  I will happily abide by a community discussion on the point, but as you can see above, no one seems inclined to engage.  I should note that although I have protected the article in the past, another admin has put on the present protection; I had removed the protection I had laid on it when you earlier requested it. So.  To ''Hamilton'' or not to ''Hamilton'', that is the question.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 21:16, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
:::: OK, but can we unlock the article to find out if that is still the case, please? [[User:Chicbyaccident|Chicbyaccident]] ([[User talk:Chicbyaccident|talk]]) 09:48, 20 November 2016 (UTC)
::::: I ping {{u|Favonian}}.  I am neutral on the matter.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 10:10, 20 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::: Unprotecting the article would only result in renewed edit-warring. Promoting this nickname from &quot;in popular culture&quot; to the infobox will require talk page consensus and most likely a [[WP:RFC|request for comments]].
