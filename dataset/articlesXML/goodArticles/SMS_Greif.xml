'''SMS ''Greif''''' was an [[aviso]] built by the [[Imperial German Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine''), the only ship of her class. She was built at the [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]]; her [[keel]] was laid in 1885, she was launched in July 1886, and she was commissioned in July 1887. Unlike the other avisos built by Germany, ''Greif'' was equipped only with a gun armament. ''Greif'' served with the fleet from 1887 until 1911, though she was not a particularly successful design and so saw little active service, having spent most of her time in reserve. In 1912, she was reduced to a training ship for engine-room personnel. In 1917, she was [[hulk (ship)|hulked]] for minelayers in Kiel. She was ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921 in [[Hamburg]].

==Design==

===General characteristics===
''Greif'' was {{convert|99.5|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|102.6|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.75|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.22|m|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|4.34|m|abbr=on}} aft. The ship was designed to displace {{convert|2050|MT|sp=us}}, and at combat loading, she displaced {{convert|2266|MT|abbr=on}}. Her hull was constructed with transverse steel frames and it contained twelve [[watertight compartment]]s.&lt;ref name=G93&gt;Gröner, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

''Greif'' was a mediocre sea boat and was moderately handy. She [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|pitched]] slightly but rolled significantly more. Her transverse [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|.48|m|abbr=on}}. The ship had a crew of seven officers and 163&amp;nbsp;enlisted men, though the latter later increased to 178. ''Greif'' carried several smaller boats, including one picket boat, two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], one [[yawl]], and one [[dinghy]].&lt;ref name=G93/&gt;

===Machinery===
''Greif''{{'}}s propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2-cylinder [[double expansion engine]]s built by [[AG Germania]], which drove a pair of four-bladed screws that were {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} wide in diameter. Steam for the engines was provided by six cylindrical, double-ended, coal-fired [[water-tube boiler]]s split in three boiler rooms. In 1906, she was reequipped with eight new cylindrical boilers in two boiler rooms, which slightly improved her performance. She was equipped with a pair of generators for electrical power; they had a combined output of {{convert|20|kW|lk=in}} at 67&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s. Steering was controlled with a single rudder.&lt;ref name=G93/&gt;

The ship's propulsion system was rated at {{convert|5400|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}. On trials, ''Greif'' reached {{Convert|5431|ihp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|18.2|kn|abbr=on}}. With the new boilers, her engines could reach {{convert|5795|ihp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19.1|kn|abbr=on}} on speed trials. She could carry up to {{convert|350|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, which provided a range of approximately {{convert|2180|nmi|lk=in}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|12|kn|abbr=on}}. After her refit, she could carry {{convert|436|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, which increased her range to {{convert|3960|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G93/&gt;

===Armament===
Unlike the other avisos built by the German navy, which carried [[torpedo tube]]s as their primary armament, ''Greif'' was armed only with guns.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 256&amp;ndash;257&lt;/ref&gt; As built, the ship was armed with two [[10.5 cm K L/35 gun|{{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} K L/35]] guns placed in pivot mounts. The ship was also equipped with ten [[machine gun]]s. In 1906, the ship was rearmed with eight [[8.8 cm SK L/34 gun]]s in single mounts and six machine guns. Later in her career, two of the 8.8&amp;nbsp;cm guns and two machine guns were removed. ''Greif'' carried no armor protection.&lt;ref name=G93/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Kaiserliche Marine Greif, Meteor und Jagd spähen bei Brüsterort, Chromo-Lithographie von Willy Stöwer 1894, nr9 aus G. Wislicenus, Unsre Kriegsflotte.jpg|thumb|[[Lithograph]] of ''Greif'' (left), {{SMS|Meteor|1890|2}} (center), and {{SMS|Jagd||2}} (right) by [[Willy Stöwer]]]]
The ship was laid down at the [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]] in 1885 and launched on 29 July 1886. [[Fitting-out]] work followed her launch, and was completed by 9 July 1887, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Following her commissioning, ''Greif'' served with the active duty fleet, though she saw little service, as she was an unsuccessful design.&lt;ref name=G93/&gt;&lt;ref name=G257&gt;Gardiner, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, ''Greif'' was assigned to the II Division of the Maneuver Squadron for the annual summer training exercises in August and September.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett, p. 1182&lt;/ref&gt; After the conclusion of the maneuvers, the II Division returned to its home port in Kiel for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett, p. 1429&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1898, ''Gefion'' returned to service in the II Division.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes'', p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

In August and September 1900, ''Greif'' was assigned to the Maneuver Squadron during the annual summer training exercises. During the maneuvers, she served in the cruiser screen for the hostile squadron, along with the old frigate {{SMS|Carola||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Knepper, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 1911, ''Greif'' was reduced to a special purpose ship for experimentation, and she was [[hulk (ship)|hulked]] on 25 October 1915. She was thereafter used as a training ship for engine room personnel. In 1917, she was converted into a hulk for [[minelayer]]s and based in [[Heikendorf]] outside Kiel. She served in this capacity for the last year of [[World War I]]. In 1921, she was sold for scrapping and broken up in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=G93/&gt;
