He retired from the military on 3 July 2011.

Since then Houston has been appointed to a number of positions, including chairman of [[Airservices Australia]]. In March 2014 he was appointed to head the [[Joint Agency Coordination Centre]] during the search for [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]], and in the Australia Day Honours of 2015, he was knighted for this service.&lt;ref name=AK/&gt;

==Early life==
Houston was born on 9 June 1947 in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland and educated at [[Strathallan School]] in [[Forgandenny]], [[Perthshire]]. He emigrated to Australia in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Chief-Marshals/132/Air-Chief-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Chief Marshals |accessdate=27 July 2010 |work=Air Marshals of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force Air Power Development Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; to work as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]] on a cattle station in north-west [[Western Australia]].  It was there that his workmates dubbed him &quot;Angus&quot;, due to his strong Scottish accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Exjackaroo-passes-muster/2005/04/17/1113676646815.html?from=moreStories |author=Brendan Nicholson |work=[[The Age]] |date=18 April 2005 |title=Ex-jackaroo passes muster in more than a stock career }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service career==
===Early career===
Houston joined the RAAF as a cadet pilot in 1970 and spent the early part of his career flying [[UH-1 Iroquois]] [[helicopter]]s in various parts of Australia, [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=OfficerGentleman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dapin|first1=Mark|title=An Officer and a Gentleman|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=36A724BB01B541D51DBEE159248B2BB3?sy=afr&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=1month&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=brs&amp;cls=70&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SMH1106113I4C96QG04I|accessdate=2 February 2015|work=Good Weekend|agency=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 June 2011|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from Flying Instructors Course in 1975, Houston completed several instructional tours on [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326H]], [[British Aircraft Corporation]] [[Strikemaster]] and Iroquois aircraft. A posting to the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] (RSAF) from 1976–1978 was followed by two years at [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Amberley]]. In late 1979, Houston was posted to [[Hill Air Force Base]], [[Utah]] U.S.A. for exchange flying duties with a [[United States Air Force]] helicopter unit.&lt;ref name=FDI&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeSilva-Ranasinghe |first1=Sergei |title=I See the Indian Ocean to be as Important as the Pacific |url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publications/fdi-feature-interviews/128-fdi-feature-interview-i-see-the-indian-ocean-to-be-as-important-as-the-pacific-air-chief-marshal-angus-houston.html |website=Future Directions International |accessdate=2 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328123027/http://futuredirections.org.au/publications/fdi-feature-interviews/128-fdi-feature-interview-i-see-the-indian-ocean-to-be-as-important-as-the-pacific-air-chief-marshal-angus-houston.html |archivedate=28 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 he was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] for an open sea rescue in gale force winds off the coast of [[New South Wales]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=AFC&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1083965&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour] – Air Force Cross – 14 June 1980&lt;br/&gt;Citation: ''9 Sqn RAAF – Helicopter rescue off Evans Head – For devotion to duty as a pilot of No9 Sqn RAAF''&lt;/ref&gt;

After a further posting to No.&amp;nbsp;9 Squadron as the Executive Officer, and staff training at RAAF Staff College, Houston was posted to the Department of Air (Development Division) where he was involved in the [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopter Project. In 1987, Houston assumed command of No.&amp;nbsp;9 Squadron to introduce the Black Hawk helicopter, to relocate the unit from Amberley to [[Townsville, Queensland]], and to transfer the capability to the [[Australian Army]].&lt;ref name=FDI/&gt; In 1989 he served one year in command of the [[5th Aviation Regiment (Australia)|5th Aviation Regiment]].&lt;ref name=FDI/&gt; Houston was admitted as a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] in 1990 for his work in the transfer of responsibility for Blackhawk operations.&lt;ref name=AM&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=879614&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour] – Member of the Order of Australia – 26 January 1990&lt;br/&gt;Citation: ''For service to the RAAF as CO No9 Sqn and subsequently Officer Commanding 5th Aviation Regiment''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation from [[Joint Services Staff College (Australia)|Joint Services Staff College]], Houston was posted to the Joint Operations staff at Headquarters [[Australian Defence Force]] and was involved in strategic planning during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] of 1990–1991.&lt;ref name=FDI/&gt;

On promotion to [[group captain]] in July 1992, he assumed the post of Director Air Force Policy and negotiated the establishment of the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|RSAF]] Flying School at [[RAAF Base Pearce]].&lt;ref name=FDI/&gt; After completing a [[C-130|C-130H Hercules]] conversion in 1993, Houston commanded [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No. 86 Wing]] from 1994 to 1995.&lt;ref name=FDI/&gt;
