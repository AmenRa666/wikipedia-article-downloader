'''''Oriflamme''''' was a 56-gun [[ship of the line]] of the [[French Navy]]. She was built at [[Toulon]] and launched on 1743 by engineer and builder Pierre Blaise Coulomb. The ship was named for the [[oriflamme|long, multi-tailed red banner that was historically the battle standard]] of the [[Capetian dynasty|medieval French monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm |title=In Search of the Oriflamme

&lt;/ref&gt; She narrowly survived one encounter with the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], but was captured during a later engagement, in 1761. She was not taken into British service but was used as a merchant ship, ending her days in Spanish service. She sailed on her last voyage in 1770, but her crew apparently succumbed to a plague and the ship was lost at sea.

==French career==
[[File:Oriflamme.svg|thumb|left|60px|The ''[[oriflamme]]'' of the Capetian dynasty.]]
''Oriflamme'' served during the [[Seven Years' War]], and had an encounter with a superior British squadron in late February 1758, when she was chased off the Spanish coast by the 60-gun {{HMS|Montagu|1757|6}}, under Captain [[Sir Joshua Rowley, 1st Baronet|Joshua Rowley]] and the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1747|6}} under Captain [[John Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|John Montagu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobson, p.47&quot;&gt;Dobson, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; They chased ''Oriflamme'' onshore, but owing to Spain's neutrality at the time, did not attempt to destroy her, and ''Oriflamme'' was later salvaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobson, p.47&quot;/&gt;

''Oriflamme'' again encountered the British, this time when she was chased by the 50-gun {{HMS|Isis|1747|6}}, under Captain Edward Wheeler, off the Mediterranean coast of Morocco on 1 April 1761.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cust&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cust |title=Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two engaged at 6pm, with Wheeler being killed early in the exchange of fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cust&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Charnock&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Charnock |title=Biographia Navalis|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Command then devolved to Lieutenant Cunningham, who on seeing that the French ship was trying to escape towards Spain, ran aboard her, and soon forced her to [[striking the colours|strike her colours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cust&quot;/&gt; ''Oriflamme'', which had been armed ''[[en flûte]]'' and was carrying between 40 and 50 guns during the action, had 50 killed and wounded from her complement of around 370.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dull&quot;&gt;Dull, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isis'' had four killed, including Wheeler, and nine wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714–1792|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captured ''Oriflamme'' was brought into [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[London Chronicle]]|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish career==
''Oriflamme'' was not brought into the Royal Navy, but was instead sold into mercantile service. She appears to have then entered Spanish service, and was sold at auction to the company of Juan Baptista de Uztaris, Bros &amp; Co.

She set sail on her final voyager on 18 February 1770, departing [[Cadiz]] under the command of Captain Joseph Antonio de Alzaga, with Joseph de Zavalsa as Master and Manuel de [[Buenechea]] as [[maritime pilot|pilot]].  On 25 July she was sighted by the ''Gallardo'', whose captain, Juan Esteban de Ezpeleta, knew de Alzaga. The ''Gallardo'' signalled to her with a cannon shot, but it went unanswered.  The first officer of the ''Gallardo'', Joseph de Alvarez, was sent to investigate and found that the ''Oriflama'' had been swept by a mysterious plague.  Half the crew had already died, and the rest were dying, with only thirty men barely able to haul a sail.

De Alvarez returned to his ship and a boatload of supplies was prepared, but bad weather drove the ships apart and it was impossible to catch up with the ''Oriflama''.  It was reported that as the crew of the ''Gallardo'' prayed for the safety of the men of the ''Oriflama'', a ghostly light illuminated the latter's sails and she was seen to sail away into the night. On 28 July wreckage of the ''Oriflama'' and some bodies were washed up on the coast of [[Chile]] near the mouth of the [[Huenchullami River]].

The following spring  [[Manuel de Amat y Juniet]], the [[Viceroy of Peru]], sent Juan Antonio de Bonachea, apparently a relative of the pilot of the ''Oriflama'' (Buenechea and Bonachea were interchangeable spellings), with trained divers to search for the wreck, but the search was abandoned in January 1772.
