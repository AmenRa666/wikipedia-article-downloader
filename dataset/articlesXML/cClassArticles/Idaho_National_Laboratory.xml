'''Idaho National Laboratory''' ('''INL''') is an {{convert|890|sqmi|km2|-1|sing=on}} complex located in the [[desert|high desert]] of [[Eastern Idaho|eastern]] [[Idaho]], between the town of [[Arco, Idaho|Arco]] to the west and the cities of [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]] and [[Blackfoot, Idaho|Blackfoot]] to the east. It lies within [[Butte County, Idaho|Butte]], [[Bingham County, Idaho|Bingham]], [[Bonneville County, Idaho|Bonneville]], and [[Jefferson County, Idaho|Jefferson]] counties. The lab currently employs approximately 4,000 people.

==History==
The federal research facility was established in 1949 as the &quot;National Reactor Testing Station&quot; (NRTS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strong |first=Jane |title=Idaho National Laboratory History |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy - Idaho National Laboratory |url=http://www.inl.gov/history |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219045001/http://www.inl.gov/history/ |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) was divided into the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] (ERDA) and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC).  The Idaho site was for a short time named ERDA and then subsequently renamed to the &quot;Idaho National Engineering Laboratory&quot; (INEL) in 1977 with the creation of the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) under [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]].  After two decades as INEL, the name was changed again to the &quot;Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory&quot; (INEEL) in 1997.  Throughout its lifetime, there have been more than 50 one-of-a-kind [[nuclear reactor]]s built by various organizations at the facility for testing; all but three are out of service.

On Feb. 1, 2005, [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] Energy Alliance took over operation of the lab from [[Bechtel]], merged with [[Argonne National Laboratory]]-West, and the facility name was changed to &quot;Idaho National Laboratory&quot; (INL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MENSER |first=PAUL |title=Site of impact: Cleaning house and charting a future at INL |publisher=Idaho Falls Post Register |date=January 27, 2008 |url=http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008 |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020138/http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008 |archivedate=November 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time the site's clean-up activities were moved to a separate contract, the [https://idahocleanupproject.com/ Idaho Cleanup Project], which is currently managed by Fluor Idaho, LLC. Research activities were consolidated in the newly named Idaho National Laboratory.

==Access==
In the [[Snake River Plain]], most of INL is desert [[Shrubland|with scrub vegetation]] and a number of facilities scattered throughout the area; the average [[elevation]] of the complex is {{convert|5000|ft|-1}} [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]].  A few publicly accessible highways go through the vast INL, but most of the area (except [[EBR-I]]) is restricted to authorized personnel and requires appropriate [[security clearance]].  The tiny town of [[Atomic City, Idaho|Atomic City]] is on the INL's southern border, and the [[Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve|Craters of the Moon National Monument]] is to the southwest.

==Current Research==

===Nuclear Energy Projects===

====Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP)====
{{main|Next Generation Nuclear Plant}}
One part of this program to develop improved nuclear power plants is the “[[Next Generation Nuclear Plant]]” or NGNP, which would be the demonstration of a new way to use nuclear energy for more than electricity. The heat generated from nuclear fission in the plant could provide process heat for [[hydrogen production]] and other industrial purposes, while also generating electricity. And the NGNP would use a high-temperature gas reactor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehresman |first=Teri |author2=Nicole Stricker |title=INL develops safer, more efficient nuclear fuel for next-gen reactors |publisher=U. S. Department of Energy, DOE Office of Nuclear Energy |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1269&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_528176 |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729062741/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1269&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_528176 |archivedate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have redundant safety systems that rely on natural physical processes more than human or mechanical intervention.

INL is working with private industry to design, plan and eventually build the NGNP. It was commissioned to lead this effort by the U.S. Department of Energy as a result of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehresman |first=Teri |title=Next Generation of Reactors |publisher=U.

====Fuel Cycle Research &amp; Development (FCRD)====
[[File:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|One representation of a conventional [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. INL is researching ways to improve it.]]The Fuel Cycle Research &amp; Development program aims to help expand nuclear energy’s benefits by addressing some of the issues inherent to the current life cycle of nuclear reactor fuel in the United States. These efforts strive to make nuclear energy's expansion safe, secure, economic and sustainable.

Currently, the United States, like many other countries, employs an “open-ended&quot; nuclear fuel cycle, whereby nuclear power plant fuel is used only once and then placed in a repository for indefinite storage. One of the primary FCRD goals is to research, develop and demonstrate ways to “close” the fuel cycle so fuel is reused or recycled rather than being shelved before all of its energy has been used. INL coordinates many of the FCRD's national research efforts, including:
* Continuing critical fuel cycle research and development (R&amp;D) activities
* Pursuing development of policy and regulatory framework to support fuel cycle closure
* Developing deployable technologies
* Establishing advanced modeling and simulation program elements
* Implementing a science-based R&amp;D program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehresman |first=Teri |title=DOE Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative |publisher=U. S. Department of Energy, DOE Office of Nuclear Energy |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/nuclear_energy/277/afci_home_page/1358 |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729053227/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/nuclear_energy/277/afci_home_page/1358 |archivedate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program====
[[File:CO2&amp;NPPs.png|thumb|right|150px|Graph showing effect removing nuclear power plants would have on American CO2 emissions]]
The [[Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program]] supports national efforts to do the research and gather the information necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and prudent to apply for extensions beyond 60 years of operating life.

The Program aims to safely and economically extend the service lives of the more than 100 electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the United States. The program brings together technical information, performs important research and organizes data to be used in license-extension applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnard |first=Cathy |title=Light water reactor sustainability program: introduction |publisher=U.

====Advanced Test Reactor National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF)====
INL’s Advanced Test Reactor is a unique research reactor located approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} from Idaho Falls, Idaho.

The Department of Energy named [[Advanced Test Reactor]] (ATR) a National Scientific User Facility in April 2007. This designation opened the facility to use by university-led scientific research groups and gives them free access to the ATR and other unique resources at INL and partner facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atrnsuf.inl.gov/Home/tabid/118/Default.aspx |title=Atr Nsuf - Home |publisher=Atrnsuf.inl.gov |date=2012-12-13 |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921032241/http://atrnsuf.inl.gov/Home/tabid/118/Default.aspx |archivedate=September 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a rolling proposal solicitation with two closing dates each year, INL holds an annual &quot;Users Week&quot; and summer session to familiarize researchers with the user facility capabilities available to them.

====Nuclear Energy University Programs (NEUP)====
DOE's Nuclear Energy University Programs provides funding for university research grants, fellowships, scholarships and infrastructure upgrades.

For example, in May 2010, the program awarded $38 million for 42 university-led R&amp;D projects at 23 U.S. universities in 17 states. In FY 2009, the program awarded about $44 million to 71 R&amp;D projects and more than $6 million in infrastructure grants to 30 U.S. universities and colleges in 23 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nuclear Energy University Program | publisher = U. S. Department of Energy, DOE Office of Nuclear Energy | url = http://www.energy.gov/ne/nuclear-reactor-technologies/nuclear-energy-university-program | accessdate = 2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; INL's [https://web.archive.org/web/20151019054022/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=281&amp;mode=2 Center for Advanced Energy Studies] administers the program for DOE. CAES is a collaboration between INL and Idaho's three public research universities: Idaho State University, Boise State University and University of Idaho.

====Multiphysics Methods Group (MMG)====
The Multiphysics Methods Group (MMG) is a program at Idaho National Laboratory (under the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]) begun in 2004. It uses applications based on the [[multiphysics]] and modeling framework [[MOOSE (software)|MOOSE]] to simulate complex [[nuclear chemistry|physical and chemical reactions]] inside [[nuclear reactor]]s . The ultimate goal of the program is to use these simulation tools to enable more efficient use of [[nuclear fuel]], resulting in lower electricity costs and less [[radioactive waste|waste products]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |archivedate=January 21, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MMG focuses on problems within nuclear reactors related to its fuel and how heat is transferred inside the reactor. &quot;Fuel degradation&quot; refers to how uranium pellets and the rods they are encased in (several rods bundled together is what makes a &quot;fuel assembly&quot;) eventually wear out over time due to high heat and irradiation inside a reactor. The group states three main objectives: &quot;The mission of the MMG is to support the INL goal to advance the U.S. nuclear energy endeavor by:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Multiphysics Methods Group! |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=2693&amp;parentname=Gateway&amp;parentid=None&amp;mode=2&amp;in_hi_userid=200&amp;cached=true |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121014256/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=2693&amp;parentname=Gateway&amp;parentid=None&amp;mode=2&amp;in_hi_userid=200&amp;cached=true |archivedate=2009-01-21 |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory | accessdate = 2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Furthering the state of computational nuclear engineering
* Developing a robust technical basis in multidimensional multiphysics analysis methods
* Developing the next generation of reactor simulation codes and tools&quot;

The work done by the group directly supports programs such as the [[Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program]]'s research into advanced [[nuclear fuel]]s.

===National and Homeland Security Projects===
INL's National and Homeland Security division focuses on two main areas: protecting critical infrastructure such as electricity transmission lines, utilities and wireless communications networks, and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

====Control Systems Cybersecurity====
For nearly a decade, INL has been  conducting vulnerability assessments and developing innovative technology to increase infrastructure resiliency. With a strong emphasis on industry collaboration and partnership, INL is enhancing electric grid reliability, control systems cybersecurity and physical security systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Infrastructure Protection |publisher=U. S. Department of Energy, DOE Office of Nuclear Energy |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/national_and_homeland_security/273/critical_infrastructure_protection/1275 |accessdate=2014-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729045958/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/national_and_homeland_security/273/critical_infrastructure_protection/1275 |archivedate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

INL   conducts advanced cyber training and oversees simulated competitive exercises for national and international customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TITLE NEEDED |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/document/53858/cyber_security_4_pdf_%283%29 |registration=yes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511083629/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/document/53858/cyber_security_4_pdf_%283%29 |archivedate=May 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lab supports cyber security and control systems programs for the departments of [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]], [[United States Department of Energy|Energy]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]]. INL staff members are frequently asked to provide guidance and leadership to standards organizations, regulatory agencies and national policy committees.

In January 2011, it was reported by the [[New York Times]] that the INL was allegedly responsible for some of the initial research behind the [[Stuxnet]] virus which allegedly crippled Iran's nuclear centrifuges. The INL, which teamed up with [[Siemens]], conducted research on the P.C.S.-7 control system to identify its vulnerabilities. According to the Times, that information would later be used by the American and Israeli governments to create the Stuxnet virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first1=William J. | last1=Broad | first2=John | last2=Markoff | first3=David E. | last3=Sanger | title=Stuxnet Worm Used Against Iran Was Tested in Israel | date=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Times article was later disputed by other journalists—including Forbes blogger Jeffrey Carr—as being both sensational and lacking verifiable facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Carr | first = Jeffrey   | title = Idaho National Lab: Homeland Security or Homeland Conspiracy? | publisher = Forbes | date = January 20, 2011 | url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreycarr/2011/01/20/idaho-national-lab-homeland-security-or-homeland-conspiracy/?boxes=Homepagechannels | accessdate = 2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Vanity Fair Magazine's cover story on Stuxnet carried INL's official response stating, &quot;Idaho National Laboratory was not involved in the creation of the stuxnet worm. In fact, our focus is to protect and defend control systems and critical infrastructures from cyber threats like stuxnet and we are all well recognized for these efforts. We value the relationships that we have formed within the control systems industry and in no way would risk these partnerships by divulging confidential information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross |first=Michael Joseph |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104 |title=STUXNET WORM: A Declaration of Cyber-War |work=culture |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=April 2011 |accessdate=2014-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713082739/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104 |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear nonproliferation====
Building on INL's nuclear mission and legacy in reactor design and operations, the lab's engineers are developing technology, shaping policy and leading initiatives to secure the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Nonproliferation |publisher=U.

Others have applied their knowledge to the development of detection technologies that scan and monitor containers for nuclear materials.

The laboratory's expansive desert location, nuclear facilities and wide range of source materials provide an ideal training location for military responders, law enforcement and other civilian first responders. INL routinely supports these organizations by leading classroom training, conducting field exercises and assisting in technology assessments.

===Energy and Environment Projects===

====Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity====
INL’s Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity  gathers information from more than 4000 plug-in-hybrid vehicles. These vehicles, operated by a wide swath of companies, local and state governments, advocacy groups, and others are located all across the United States, Canada and [[Finland]]. Together, they’ve logged a combined 1.5 million miles worth of data that is analyzed by specialists at INL.

Dozens of other types of vehicles, like hydrogen-fueled and pure electric cars, are also tested at INL. This data will help evaluate the performance and other factors that will be critical to widespread adoption of plug-in or other alternative vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity | publisher = Idaho National Laboratory, U.

==Unique Facilities==

===Advanced Test Reactor (ATR)m Complex===
{{main|Advanced Test Reactor}}
INL’s [[Advanced Test Reactor]] is much smaller than the more common electricity-producing reactors  — the reactor vessel measures {{convert|12|ft|m}} across and {{convert|36|ft|m}} high, with the core a mere {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall and 50&amp;nbsp;inches across, and it does not generate electricity. As a special feature,  it allows scientists to simultaneously test materials in multiple unique experimental environments. Research scientists can place experiments in one of the more than 70 test positions in the reactor. Each can generate unique experimental conditions.

Some have called the reactor a “virtual time machine,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1555&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_110120 |title=University nuclear experiments selected for Idaho National Laboratory testing |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 1, 2008 |website=Idaho National Laboratory |publisher=U. S.

The ATR allows scientists to place a great variety of materials in an environment with specified intensities of radiation, temperature and pressure. Specimens are then removed to examine how the time in the reactor affected the materials. The U.S. Navy is the facility's primary user, but the ATR also produces medical isotopes that can help treat cancer patients and industrial isotopes that can be used for radiography to x-ray welds on items such as skyscrapers, bridges and ship holds.

Many ATR experiments focus on materials that could make the next generation of nuclear reactors even safer and longer lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1555&amp;mode=2&amp;featurestory=DA_330512 |title=INL engineers tackle graphite challenge with innovative new device |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 1, 2009 |website=Idaho National Laboratory |publisher=U.

===Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC)===

====Hot Fuel Examination Facility====
The Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF) gives INL researchers and other scientists the ability to examine and test highly radioactive irradiated reactor fuel and other materials.

HFEF provides 15 state-of-the-art workstations known as hot cells. For windows, each cell has leaded glass panes layered {{convert|4|ft|m}} thick and separated by thin layers of oil. Remote manipulators allow users to maneuver items inside the hot cell using robotic arms. And special filtered exhaust systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/hfef/597/hot_fuels_examination_facility/7056 |title=Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Idaho National Laboratory |publisher=U.

At these stations, scientists and technicians can better determine the performance of irradiated fuels and materials. Scientists can also characterize materials destined for long-term storage at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.

====Space and Security Power Systems Facility====
The [[New Horizons]] mission to [[Pluto]], which launched in 2006, is powered by a device fueled at the INL Space and Security Power Systems Facility. The Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) uses nonweapons-grade plutonium to produce heat and electricity for deep space missions such as this one.

Using the RTG on the New Horizons mission is a more practical power source for the satellite than solar panels because the satellite will travel to such a great distance that energy from the sun would provide insufficient power for the craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/space___security_power_systems_facility/302/space___security_power_systems_facility/1488 |title=Space &amp; Security Power Systems Facility |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Idaho National Laboratory |publisher=U.

====Fuel Conditioning Facility====
INL's Fuel Conditioning Facility uses electrolysis to separate certain components from used nuclear fuel rods. Unlike traditional aqueous reprocessing techniques, which dissolve the fuel rods in acid, &quot;pyroprocessing&quot; melts the rods and uses electricity to separate components such as uranium and sodium out of the mix. INL is using this technique to remove the sodium metal from [[EBR-II]] fuel rods so they can be safely stored in a national repository.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===== Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) =====

The [[Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT)]] is a reactor designed specifically to test new reactor fuels and materials.

===Critical Infrastructure Test Range Complex (CITRC)===
The Critical Infrastructure Test Range at INL's {{convert|890|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} Site allows researchers to conduct resiliency exercises and experiments from conceptual design to full-scale demonstration. INL also has access to a utility-scale power grid, substations, unique real-time modeling and simulation systems, and vendor-supplied Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for demonstration and deployment exercises.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In addition, INL owns and operates a communications network designed to research and test cellular, mobile and emerging Internet communication protocols and technology, with  both fixed and mobile 3-G platforms that allow testing and demonstration within a range of experimental frequencies in a low-background environment.

===Research &amp; Education Campus in Idaho Falls===

====Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES)====
This unique partnership between INL and Idaho's three public research universities — [[Idaho State University]], [[University of Idaho]] and [[Boise State University]] — boasts a wealth of research expertise. Its researchers, who have access to each partner institution’s equipment and infrastructure, have competed for and won millions of dollars in national funding for their projects. CAES possesses capabilities and infrastructure unique to the region and nation. The center’s laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art research instruments and tools, including a Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) and a Computer Assisted Virtual Environment (CAVE).

====Matched Index of Refraction (MIR) facility====
The Matched Index of Refraction facility is the largest such facility in the world. Using light mineral oil, the facility allows researchers to use fused quartz models built to scale to study the flow of liquids inside and around objects with complicated geometries, such as the core of a nuclear reactor. The facility is basically a giant loop through which the mostly transparent oil is pumped at variable speeds. Special lasers perform “Doppler velocimetry,” that produces a 3-D image allowing inspection of an object’s flow properties. Observers can also watch the flow themselves through the polycarbonate viewing panes near the laser equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/mir_home/624/mir_home/7326 |title=Matched-Index-of-Refraction (MIR) Flow Facility |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Idaho National Laboratory |publisher=U.

The INL centrifuge is one of fewer than 25 geocentrifuges larger than two meters (about 6 feet) in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;
The centrifuge, located next to the INL Research Center in Idaho Falls, can be operated remotely by computer and is capable of applying 130 times the force of earth’s gravity on a sample.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/geocentrifuge/598/geocentrifuge_main/5802 |title=Geocentrifuge Research Laboratory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Idaho National Laboratory |publisher=U.

Many of the experiments that use the geocentrifuge require it to run for hundreds of hours in order to correctly simulate several years’ worth of gravitational effects. The payload is monitored by an onboard computer and can be relayed to a remote monitoring station outside the centrifuge’s chamber where technicians can observe developments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

==Earlier projects==
Much of current knowledge about how nuclear reactors behave and misbehave was discovered at what is now Idaho National Laboratory. John Grossenbacher, former INL director, said, &quot;The history of nuclear energy for peaceful application has principally been written in Idaho.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ifcityclub.com/archives/100430JohnGrossenbacher.mp3 |title=What was Old is New Again: The Future of Nuclear Energy &amp; the INL |last1= Grossenbacher |first1= John |date= Apr 30, 2010 |website= Idaho Falls City Club - Archives |publisher= NPR Radio |format=mp3 |accessdate = 2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 50 reactors have been built by various organizations at what is commonly called “the Site,” including the ones that gave the world its first usable amount of electricity produced from nuclear power and the power plant for the world’s first nuclear submarine. Although many are now decommissioned, these facilities represent the largest concentration of reactors in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=1311&amp;parentname=CommunityPage&amp;parentid=46&amp;mode=2&amp;in_hi_userid=200&amp;cached=true |title=INL History |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Idaho National Laboratory |publisher=U.

===Naval Proving Ground===
[[File:nautilus core.jpg|125px|left|thumb|Prototype of core for [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)]]]]
What is now Idaho National Laboratory in southeastern Idaho began its life as a U.S. government artillery test range in the 1940s. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the U.S. military needed a safe location for performing maintenance on the Navy’s most powerful turreted guns (16-inch diameter). The guns were brought in via rail to near [[Pocatello, Idaho]], to be re-sleeved, rifled and tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inl.gov/proving-the-principle/chapter_02.pdf |title=Chapter 2 - The Naval Proving Ground |work=Proving the Principal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 6, 2000 |publisher=U.

In 1949, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission established the National Reactor Testing Station or NRTS at the site.

As the Navy began to focus on post-[[World War II threats]], the types of projects worked on in the Idaho desert changed, too. Perhaps the most well-known was the building of the prototype reactor for the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine, the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS Nautilus]]

===Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (EBR-I)===
{{main|EBR-I}}
[[File:First four nuclear lit bulbs.jpeg|thumb|right|The first four bulbs lit by electricity from nuclear power hung near the generator on the second floor of EBR-I]]In the early afternoon of Dec. 20, 1951, [[Argonne National Laboratory]] scientist  [[Walter Zinn]] and a small crew of assistants witnessed a row of four light bulbs light up in a nondescript brick building in the eastern Idaho desert.&lt;ref name=ANS1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/docs/2001-11-2.pdf |title= Fifty years ago in December: Atomic reactor EBR-I produced first electricity |last1= Michal |first1= Rick |date= November 2001 |website= American Nuclear Society: Publications: Magazines |publisher= Nuclear News |accessdate = 2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity from a generator connected to Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (EBR-I) flowed through them. This was the first time that a usable amount of electrical power had ever been generated from nuclear fission.

Only days afterward, the reactor produced all the electricity needed for the entire EBR complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inl.gov/proving-the-principle/chapter_08.pdf |title=Chapter 8 - The Reactor Zoo Goes Critical |work=Proving the Principal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 6, 2000 |publisher=U.

S. Department of Energy, DOE Office of Nuclear Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |accessdate = 2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More central to EBR-I’s purpose than just generating electricity, however, was its role in proving that a reactor could create more nuclear fuel as a byproduct than it consumed during operation. In 1953, tests verified that this was the case.&lt;ref name=ANS1/&gt; The site of this event is memorialized as a Registered [[National Historic Landmark]], open to the public every day [[Memorial Day]] through [[Labor Day]].

===Fatal incident===
{{main|SL-1}}
[[File:US AEC SL-1.JPG|125px|left|thumb|The SL-1 reactor vessel being removed from the reactor building. It had jumped over {{convert|9|ft|m}} during the accident.]] On January 3, 1961, the only fatal nuclear reactor incident in the U.S. occurred at the NRTS.  An experimental reactor called [[SL-1]] (Stationary Low-Power Plant Number 1) was destroyed when a control rod was pulled too far out of the reactor, leading to core meltdown and a steam explosion. The reactor vessel jumped up {{convert|9|ft|1|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=Tucker /&gt; The concussion and blast killed all three military enlisted personnel working on the reactor. Due to the extensive radioactive [[isotope]] contamination, all three were buried in lead coffins. The events are the subject of two books, one published in 2003, ''Idaho Falls: The untold story of America's first nuclear accident'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKeown |first=William |title=Idaho Falls: The Untold Story of America's First Nuclear Accident |isbn=978-1-55022-562-4 |year=2003 |publisher=ECW Press |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another, ''Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History'', published in 2009.&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Todd |title=Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History|isbn=978-1-4165-4433-3 |year=2009 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents: container leaks &quot;plutonium-related-materials&quot;===
On November 8, 2011 in the Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) in the afternoon a container leaked &quot;plutonium-related&quot; materials, when it was opened by one of the workers. All 17 workers at the incident were immediately taken to have testing done by the Idaho Cleanup Project in the form of Whole Body Counts (scans the body for any internal radiation exposure) and were required to submit urine and fecal samples to further test for internal radioisotopes . Six of them proved to be exposed to &quot;low-level-radiation&quot;, two of them fairly extensively. All workers were kept under close observation afterwards with repeated Whole Body Counts and urine and fecal sampling. The Idaho National Laboratory insisted that no radioactivity leaked outside the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/02/f7/2014_ID_Follow-up_of_RPP_Implementation_at_MFC_of_the_Idaho_Site,_January_2014.pdf  |title= Independent Oversight Follow-Up Review of Activity Level Implementation of Radiation Controls and Radiological Work Planning at the Materials and Fuels Complex of the Idaho Site |author=Office of Safety and Emergency Management Evaluations Office of Enforcement and Oversight Office of Health, Safety and Security U.S. Department of Energy |date= January 2014 |publisher = U.

===Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II)===
{{main|EBR-II}}
{{Refimprove section|date= August 2014}}
From 1969 to 1994, [[Argonne National Laboratory]]’s EBR-II produced nearly half of the electricity needed for test site operations.

In 1964, [[Experimental Breeder Reactor II]] and the nearby Fuel Conditioning Facility proved the concept of fuel recycling and passive safety characteristics. So-called “passive” safety includes systems that rely on natural physics laws such as gravity rather than systems that require mechanical or human intervention.

In a landmark test on April 3, 1986, such systems in EBR-II demonstrated that nuclear power plants could be designed to be inherently safe from severe accidents.

De-commissioning of EBR-II began in October 1994 with the removal of the 637 fuel assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dd.anl.gov/projects/ebrII.html |title= Decommissioning Projects - Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) Facility |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= January 30, 2013 |website=  Argonne National Laboratory Decontamination &amp; Decommissioning |publisher=  [[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate = 2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of Fluid Test (LOFT) facility===
[[File:Loss of Fluid Test Reactor.jpg|thumb|right|The Loss-of-Fluid-Test reactor]]
The world’s first Loss-of-Fluid-Test reactor started up at INL on March 12, 1976. It repeatedly simulated loss-of-coolant accidents that could potentially occur in commercial nuclear power plants. Many safety designs for reactors around the world are based on these tests. LOFT experiments helped [[Nuclear fuel response to reactor accidents#LOFT|accident recovery efforts]] after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nuclear.inl.gov/docs/ne_brochure.pdf |title= Powering Nuclear Energy Through the Generations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher= Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratory, Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC |accessdate = 2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test Area North===
In 1949, an area of the fringe of the NRTS property named &quot;Test Area North&quot;, or TAN, was developed by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] and the Atomic Energy Commission to support the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] program's attempt to develop a nuclear-powered aircraft. The programs' Heat Transfer Reactor Experiments (HTRE) were conducted here in 1955 by contractor [[General Electric]], and were a series of tests to develop a system of transferring reactor-heated air to a modified [[General Electric J47]] jet engine. The planned aircraft, the [[Convair X-6]], was to be test flown at TAN, and a large hangar with radiation shielding was built on the site. The program was cancelled, however, before the accompanying {{convert|15000|ft|m|sing=on}} runway was built.

===Naval Reactors Facility (NRF)===
{{main|Naval Reactors Facility}}
In the early 1950s, the very first full-scale prototype nuclear plant for shipboard use, called [[S1W reactor|S1W]] Prototype, was constructed to test the feasibility of using [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear power]] aboard submarines.  It was the predecessor to a similar nuclear plant of [[S2W]] design installed in the first nuclear-powered ship, the submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571}}.  Later, two more prototype plant facilities, [[A1W reactor|A1W]] and [[S5G reactor|S5G]], were built at this location called the [[Naval Reactors Facility]] (NRF for short).  There is also an Expended Core Facility (ECF for short) also at NRF as well as administrative buildings/facilities.  NRF's chemistry lab was located at the S1W prototype. By now, the prototype plants for shipboard use development have been shut down.  Only the Expended Core Facility / Dry Storage Area is in use.

===Materials Test Reactor (MTR)===
When the nuclear industry was just getting started in the early 1950s, it was difficult to predict exactly how different kinds of metals and other materials would be affected by being used in a reactor for prolonged periods of time. MTR was a research reactor jointly designed by [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] National Laboratories that operated until 1970 and provided important data, helping researchers make nuclear power reactors safer and longer lasting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/subtitle/create/x2fls8n_gglass-oil-extractor_tech&lt;/ref&gt;

===BORAX Experiments===
{{main|BORAX}}
[[File:BORAX III.jpg|thumb|right|125px|The BORAX III reactor.]]The Boiling Water Reactors [[BORAX experiments|(BORAX) experiments]] were five reactors built between 1953 and 1964 by [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. They proved that the boiling water concept was a feasible design for an electricity-producing nuclear reactor. One of the BORAX reactors (III) was also the first in the world to power a city ([[Arco, Idaho]]) on July 17, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deq.state.id.us/inl_oversight/about/facilities/borax.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001180624/http://www.deq.state.id.us/inl_oversight/about/facilities/borax.cfm |date=October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/about_inl/259/arco_lighting/7194 |title=Idaho town gets atomic power and light in nuclear power demonstration |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 12, 1955 |website=Idaho National Laboratory - A first-hand account of the lighting of Arco, Idaho |publisher=UNITED STATES ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140314074531/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/about_inl/259/arco_lighting/7194 |archivedate=March 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the news==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in 2005 that a reactor at INL would be used to manufacture [[plutonium|plutonium-238]], most of it for classified national security purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/27/politics/27nuke.html | title= U.S. Has Plans to Again Make Own Plutonium| author=William J.
