'''Sir Thomas Walter White''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|KBE|DFC}} (26 April 1888&amp;nbsp;– 13 October 1957) was an Australian politician and First World War pilot. He was one of the first airmen trained for the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in 1914, and among the first to see action when he deployed to the Middle East with the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]] in 1915. He was captured in November that year but escaped in July 1918. Awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and twice [[mentioned in despatches]], White began his parliamentary career in 1929 when he was elected [[Division of Balaclava|Member for Balaclava]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He served as [[Minister for Trade and Investment (Australia)|Minister for Trade and Customs]] in [[Joseph Lyons]]' [[United Australia Party]] government from 1932 to 1938, but resigned when he was excluded from Lyons' inner [[Cabinet of Australia|cabinet]]. He joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during the Second World War and saw service in Australia and the United Kingdom. Returning to parliament as a member of the newly formed [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] in 1945, he served as [[Minister for Air (Australia)|Minister for Air]] and [[Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Minister for Civil Aviation]] in [[Robert Menzies]]' government from 1949 to 1951. His term coincided with the commitment of RAAF squadrons to the [[Korean War]] and the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Australia's [[List of High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom|High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] from 1951 to 1956, White was [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in 1952 and died in October 1957.

==Early life and First World War==
Thomas Walter White was born on 26&amp;nbsp;April 1888 at Hotham, [[North Melbourne, Victoria|North Melbourne]], the son of Charles James White, a [[brass]]-finisher from England, and Emily Jane Jenkins of Victoria. Educated at Moreland State School, White was commissioned in the [[5th Australian Regiment]], [[Citizen Military Forces]] (CMF), in 1911.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Rickard |first=John |authorlink= |year=2002|id=A160636b|title= White, Sir Thomas Walter (1888–1957) |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1914, two weeks after the outbreak of the First World War, he became one of the first four students to commence training at [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]] as a pilot in the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC).&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; He was later described by a biographer as &quot;pugnacious and impatient for success, with a disdain for authority and a suspicion of elites&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; White recalled flying in the school's [[Bristol Boxkite]] thus: &quot;The senses took the place of the instruments. One's eyes and ears did duty as engine counters; the rush of the air in the face told whether the climb or glide was at the right angle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with his four fellow students, who included future [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (Sir) [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], in November.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A02253Petre1915.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.28|Captain White (second left) with Captain [[Henry Petre]] (far left) and Lieutenant George Merz (far right) of the Mesopotamian Half Flight at Basra, July 1915|alt=Four men in khaki military uniforms, two wearing pith helmets (one of whom has his arm in a sling), seated in front of a boy]]
In April 1915, White was appointed a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] and [[adjutant]] of the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]], the first AFC unit to see active service.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069785--1-.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 1–3]&lt;/ref&gt; Based initially in [[Basra]] and operating primitive [[Maurice Farman]] biplanes, the Half Flight assisted the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] during the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], conducting [[reconnaissance]] and [[sabotage]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; White successfully carried out several operations that involved landing behind enemy lines.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; On a mission in October 1915, he was forced to land owing to engine trouble and, rather than risk attempting repairs, [[taxiing|taxied]] the aircraft some {{convert|24|km|mi|spell=on}} past enemy encampments while his observer kept watch with his rifle at the ready; the &quot;[[Keystone Cops]] adventure&quot;, as historian Alan Stephens described it, culminated in the engine finally powering up and allowing White to take off and fly to the safety of the Australian base.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; White himself touted the feat as &quot;a taxi-ing record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13&amp;nbsp;November 1915, White was captured while attempting to cut telegraph wires near [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He was [[mentioned in despatches]] in July 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29665 |supp=yes|startpage=6959|endpage=6960|date=13 July 1916|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imprisoned in Turkey, he escaped from a train in [[Constantinople]] in July 1918 and managed to stow away on a cargo ship to [[Odessa]], Ukraine, before travelling to London.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; His experience of the [[Soviet]]s in Odessa helped inform his subsequent [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;  White was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] in June 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31378 |supp=yes|startpage=7031|endpage=7032|date=3 June 1919|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, he was again mentioned in despatches, for &quot;valuable services whilst in captivity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31691 |supp=yes|startpage=15613|endpage=15614|date=16 December 1919|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still in London, he met Vera Deakin, daughter of former Australian Prime Minister [[Alfred Deakin]], and promptly became engaged to her. White was discharged from the AIF in January 1920, and married Vera on 22&amp;nbsp;March at St John's Church of England in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], despite the opposition of some of the Deakin family. That year he also became managing director of his father's hardware company, C.J. White &amp; Sons Pty Ltd. From 1926 to 1931, he commanded the [[6th Battalion (Australia)|6th Battalion]], CMF, as a [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; In 1928 he published an account of his wartime exploits as ''Guests of the Unspeakable''.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =White | first =Thomas Walter| title =Guests of the Unspeakable: The Odyssey of an Australian Airman&amp;nbsp;– Being a Record of Captivity and Escape in Turkey | publisher =John Hamilton| year =1928| location =London | isbn = 1-86315-000-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career and Second World War==
White ran unsuccessfully as a [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of Maribyrnong|Maribyrnong]] in the [[Australian federal election, 1925|1925 elections]]. In 1927, he failed to win the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Prahran|Prahran]]. Denied pre-selection as a Nationalist for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] the following year, he won the seat of [[Division of Balaclava|Balaclava]] at a [[Balaclava by-election, 1929|by-election]] held on 3&amp;nbsp;August 1929.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He succeeded retiring member [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51613541 |title=Federal Parliament |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]] |location=Launceston |date=15 August 1929 |accessdate=20 January 2016 |page=7 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Australia Party]] (UAP) came to power in the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 elections]] and in March 1933 he was appointed [[Minister for Trade and Investment (Australia)|Minister for Trade and Customs]] in the [[first Lyons Ministry]], replacing [[Henry Gullett]], who had stood down due to ill-health.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Hill |first=A.J. |year=1983|id=A090132b|title= Gullett, Sir Henry Somer (1878–1940) |accessdate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White had given up the directorship of C.J. White &amp; Sons the previous year. His portfolio was responsible for reducing [[tariff]]s and attempting to increase trade with Britain as opposed to the United States and Japan, and also with book and film censorship; for the latter he established an advisory board, chaired by [[Robert Garran]], to make recommendations to him. In 1934, White became Australian chairman of the [[Royal Life Saving Society]], serving until 1951; he was also an active supporter of such organisations as [[Legacy Australia|Legacy]] and the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|Royal Flying Doctor Service]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

In July 1938, White represented Australia at an [[Évian Conference|inter-governmental conference on Jewish refugees]] held at [[Évian-les-Bains|Évian]], France, to discuss the growing numbers of Jewish emigrants seeking to leave Germany and occupied territories.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;  He expressed remorse after listening to stories from refugees during the conference, but ultimately hedged his offer of support, saying that, &quot;As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration&quot;.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fateful Year |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/crucial_year.asp|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Australia would go on to accept 15,000 refugees over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, ''Cross Roads to Israel'', pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; White's reaction to the Australian government's support for the [[Munich Agreement]] was to diarise: &quot;I think we should hang our heads that we did not stand up to the bully of Europe&amp;nbsp;... It may yet mean peace but at what price?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Robert Menzies: A Life&amp;nbsp;– Volume I'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He called for stronger preparations at home in case of war, including the introduction of [[conscription]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, ''Joseph Lyons'', p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; On 8&amp;nbsp;November 1938, he resigned his portfolio, having discovered that [[Joseph Lyons]] had established an inner [[Cabinet of Australia|cabinet]] from which he was excluded.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Lyons' response in parliament to White's resignation publicly highlighted the divisions in the UAP.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, ''Joseph Lyons'', p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; White stood for the UAP's leadership after Lyons' death the following year but was eliminated early in the balloting, and [[Robert Menzies]] eventually became leader.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

With the outbreak of the Second World War, White became a [[flight lieutenant]] (temporary [[squadron leader]]) in the part-time [[Citizen Air Force]]. He took leave from parliament in April 1940 and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Somers, Victoria|Somers]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he travelled to England, where he administered Australian airmen at [[Bournemouth]], served as [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) Liaison Officer with [[RAF Training Command]], and commanded [[Brighton|RAF Station Brighton]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070475--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 35]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Parliamentary Library of Australia, White also &quot;surreptitiously flew on several [[sortie]]s as a [[co-pilot|second-pilot]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rb/2006-07/07rb10.pdf |author=Parliamentary Library|date=26 March 2007|title=Commonwealth Members of Parliament who have served in war|pages=9–10|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid tribute to the men of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] with the narrative poem ''Sky Saga'' in 1943.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Returning to [[Melbourne]] later that year, White served at [[RAAF Staff College|RAAF Staff School]] until his discharge as an honorary [[group captain]] in October 1944.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1067609|title=White, Thomas Walter|work=World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, he attended the conference that resulted in the establishment of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]; the new party was officially launched in August 1945.&lt;ref name=NLA&gt;{{cite web|author= Ian Hancock|title= The Origins of the Modern Liberal Party |publisher= National Library of Australia |work= Harold White Fellowships |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/ihancock.html |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the election of the Menzies Liberal government in the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 elections]], White was appointed [[Minister for Air (Australia)|Minister for Air]] and [[Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Minister for Civil Aviation]], despite his personal animosity for Menzies, which partly stemmed from the latter's failure to serve in the First World War.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Robert Menzies: A Life&amp;nbsp;– Volume II'', pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1950, White and the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Supply and Development]], [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Richard Casey]], announced that the [[English Electric Canberra]] had been selected to replace the RAAF's [[Avro Lincoln]] bombers and that the new jet would be manufactured by the [[Government Aircraft Factories|Government Aircraft Factory]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18140434 |title=Speedy plane |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=13 January 1950 |accessdate=20 January 2016 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; White's term as Minister for Air saw the deployment of RAAF squadrons to the [[Korean War]] and the [[Malayan Emergency]] in mid-1950, and the establishment of the [[Women's Royal Australian Air Force]], the successor organisation to the wartime [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]], that November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article124616531 |title=1950 a fine year for RAAF |newspaper=[[The Queensland Times]] |location=Ipswich |date=8 January 1951 |accessdate=22 January 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 205, 209, 244&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he gave his approval for the manufacture of a [[CAC Sabre|licensed version]] of the [[North American F-86 Sabre]] jet fighter for the RAAF, and played a major part in the controversial decision to replace the long-serving Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal (Sir) [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], with an RAF officer, Air Vice Marshal (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Donald Hardman]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73, 347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 348–352&lt;/ref&gt; White also sought to strengthen the Citizen Air Force, and personally ordered the establishment of [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;24 (City of Adelaide) Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Mallala|Mallala]], South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
On 21&amp;nbsp;June 1951, White resigned from parliament to become [[List of High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom|Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]], a position he held until 1956.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He was succeeded as the member for Balaclava by Liberal [[Percy Joske]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99522939 |title=20th Parliament to meet for last session on April 6 |newspaper=The Examiner |location=Launceston |date=24 March 1954 |accessdate=20 January 2016 |page=19 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; White was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in January 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39422 |supp=yes|startpage=38|date=1 January 1952|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As High Commissioner he advocated continued British migration to Australia and participated in the renewal of the [[Ten Pound Pom|assisted passage scheme]] between the two countries in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69966194 |title=Immigration pact with UK renewed |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Australia)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tasmania |date=2 April 1954 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27226847 |title=Migrants needed |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart |date=16 August 1954 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from [[emphysema]] and on 13&amp;nbsp;October 1957 died of a heart attack at his home in the Melbourne suburb of [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Survived by his wife and four daughters, he was accorded a [[state funeral]] at [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne]], and interred at [[Point Lonsdale]] cemetery.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91240189 |title=Memorial service to Sir Thomas White |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Canberra |date=17 October 1957 |accessdate=20 January 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughters donated his papers to the [[National Library of Australia]] in 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/ms/findaids/9148.html#bio|title=Papers of Sir Thomas White (1888–1957)|location=Canberra|publisher=National Library of Australia | accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
