[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] '''Sir Alfred Dudley Ward''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|KBE|DSO|DL}} (27 January 1905 – 28 December 1991) was a senior officer of the [[British Army]] who saw service during the [[Second World War]] and later became [[Governor of Gibraltar]]. He served as an ordinary soldier for three years before being sent for officer training in 1926. Slow peacetime career progression saw Ward achieving the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in only 1937 but the Second World War, which began in September 1939, allowed him to demonstrate his high ability as both a [[Staff (military)|staff officer]] and commander in the field. Receiving command of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]] at the unusually young age of 39 years and 3 months, Ward went on to hold staff and field appointments at the highest levels after the war.

==Early life and career==
Educated at [[Wimborne]] Grammar School, Ward went on to serve in the [[British Army]] as an [[Other ranks (UK)|other rank]] for three years before entering the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. From Sandhurst he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Dorset Regiment|Dorsetshire Regiment]] in January 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33462 |startpage=772 |date=1 February 1929|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lh&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/WARD.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1931 he was posted to [[British Raj|India]] to be [[aide-de-camp]] to the Commander of the Lahore District,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33827 |startpage=3280 |date=20 May 1932|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieved promotion to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in January 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33798 |startpage=954 |date=12 February 1932|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and completed his posting in September 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34033 |startpage=1780 |date=16 March 1934 |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College, Quetta]] in 1935. In 1937, Ward was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34374 |startpage=1256 |date=23 February 1937|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferring to the [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)]] for an appropriate vacancy.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead469&quot;&gt;Mead, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1939 he was seconded to India for staff service as a [[Staff (military)|General Staff Officer Grade 3]] (GSO3),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34596|startpage=864|date=7 February 1939|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34610 |startpage=2015 |date=24 March 1939|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was recalled to [[London]] in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34708 |startpage=6874 |date=13 October 1939 |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
By the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in September he was serving as a GSO2 in the Directorate of Military Intelligence at the [[War Office]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, pp. 469–470.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1940 Ward was appointed an instructor at the [[Staff College, Camberley]], returning to the War Office a year later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead470&quot;&gt;Mead, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1941 he was selected for command and was posted to lead [[43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment|43 Reconnaissance Regiment]], previously the 5th Battalion, [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], initially the reconnaissance unit of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial]] [[48th (South Midland) Division|48th (South Midland) Infantry Division]] and then, from November 1941, of [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead470&quot;/&gt;

He became [[Brigadier (United_Kingdom)|Brigadier]] General Staff (BGS) of [[XI Corps (United Kingdom)|XI Corps]] in July 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead470&quot;/&gt; In September 1943 he swapped jobs with [[Roy Urquhart]] to take command of the [[231st Brigade (United Kingdom)|231st Brigade Group]], which had seen recent action in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead470&quot;/&gt; However, within a week of arriving he was ordered to swap jobs once more, this time with [[Gerard Bucknall]], and assumed command of the [[17th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|17th Brigade]], part of the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Division]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead470&quot;/&gt; which he led in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|campaign in Italy]]. The brigade saw action during the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s advance from Foggia, notably on the [[Moro River Campaign|Moro River]] in late 1943, before the 5th Division was switched to Italy's western seabord, on the left flank of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] which itself formed the left wing of [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] on the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead470&quot;/&gt; Ward's brigade conducted an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious crossing]] of the [[Garigliano|Garigliano river]] on 17 January 1944, part of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino#first battle|First Battle of Monte Cassino]], and was involved in heavy fighting until the end of the month. In March 5th Division was moved to the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio beachhead]] and was involved in further heavy fighting in &quot;The Wadis&quot; on the [[beachhead]]s' left flank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead471&quot;&gt;Mead, p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in April 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36456 |startpage=1587 |date=4 April 1944| supp=y| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the [[Acting (rank)|acting rank]] of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|major general]], unusual for someone still under the age of forty,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead469&quot;/&gt; Ward took command of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]] in April 1944.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; Recently arrived in Italy from Egypt, where it had been refitting since the end of the [[Tunisia Campaign]] in May 1943, the division had to be rapidly prepared and brought to peak fitness for the key role assigned to it, together with the [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Infantry Division]], that of creating [[bridgehead]]s across the [[Gari (river)|Gari]] (wrongly referred to as the [[Rapido (river)|Rapido]] in contemporary sources)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studicassinati.it/db1/jupgrade/index.php/archivio/51-anno-ix-n-3-luglio-settembre-2009/577-g-petrucci-1944-la-battaglia-di-s-angelo-in-theodice 1944: la battaglia di S.Angelo in Theodice e la confusione tra i fiumi Rapido e Gari], 1944: the Battle of St. Angelo in Theodice and the Confusion between Rapido and Gari rivers.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fourth [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] the following month. After successfully completing its task, the division was rested until late June when it rejoined the front line on the [[Trasimene Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead471&quot;/&gt;

In August the division found itself once more on the [[Adriatic coast]] taking part in ''Operation Olive'', the Eighth Army's attack on the [[Gothic Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead471&quot;/&gt; In December 1944 the 4th Division was moved to Greece, where it was involved in fighting against [[Communist]] partisans opposed to the new provisional government. By mid-January order was restored and in April Ward handed over command of his division to become [[chief of staff]] to [[Lieutenant general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ronald Scobie]] the British commander in Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead472&quot;&gt;Mead, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his services in Italy Ward was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in April 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37039|startpage=2067 |date=17 April 1945|accessdate=2010-01-28| supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in July of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37161 |date=1945-07-03 |startpage=3490|endpage= |supp=y |accessdate=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[Legion of Merit]] (Degree of Commander) from the United States for his service to the Allied cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38288|startpage=2917 |date=11 May 1948| supp=y| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senior command==
After the war, having demonstrated in the previous five years high competence as both a field commander and staff officer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead472&quot;/&gt; Ward received appointments in both disciplines at the highest levels. He was promoted to substantive major general in 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37986 |startpage=2711|supp=yes|date=13 June 1947|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed in quick succession as Director of Military Operations at the War Office and commandant of the [[Staff College, Camberley]], in 1947 and 1948 respectively.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He assumed command of [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] in Germany in the rank of [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]] and was advanced to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1953 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39732|startpage=7|date=30 December 1952|accessdate=2010-01-28| supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Britain in 1953 as [[Deputy Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff]],&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; relinquishing the post in October 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40893 |startpage=5615  |date=2 October 1956 |supp=y| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward returned to Germany in January 1957 as Commander-in-Chief of [[Northern Army Group]] and the [[British Army of the Rhine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40968 |startpage=144 |date=1 January 1957 | supp=y |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was promoted to [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] in February 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40992 |startpage=799 |date=1 February 1957 | supp=y |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held the post until January 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41923 |startpage=249 |date=5 January 1960| supp=y |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left to become, in May 1960, Commander-in-Chief, British Forces Middle East&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=42022 |startpage=3111 |date=29 April 1960| supp=y|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was re-designated [[Near East Command]] on vacating the appointment in May 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=42714 |startpage=5109 |date=22 June 1962 |supp=y| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in June 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41089 |startpage=3369 |date=4 June 1957| supp=y|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was promoted to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in the new year honours list in 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41589 |startpage=2 |date=30 December 1958 |supp=y| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from December 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41567 |startpage=7497 |date=5 December 1958 |supp=y| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to December 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=42526 |startpage=8689 |date=28 November 1961 |supp=y| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; he held the title of [[Aide-de-Camp General]] to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;

He became [[Governor of Gibraltar|Governor and Commander-in-Chief Gibraltar]] in June 1962,&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=42711 |startpage=5018 |date=22 June 1962 |supp=| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he presided over the introduction of the 1964 constitution. The [[Dudley Ward Tunnel]] is named in his honour. He was also made a knight of the charitable [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=42722 |startpage=5305 |date=3 July 1962 |supp=| accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward retired from the army in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=43809|startpage=10427|supp=yes|date=5 November 1965|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retirement he served as a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Suffolk]] from 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44569 |startpage=4527 |date=19 April 1968|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1984.

Following convention for retired senior officers, Ward maintained links with the British Army through the honorary positions of [[Colonel Commandant]] of the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] and Colonel of the King's Regiment.
