== Soviet version of events ==
It is interesting that the Soviet view: &quot;Fascist, Hitlerite, reactionary, counter-revolutionary hooligans financed by the imperialist west took advantage of the unrest to stage a counter-revolution&quot; sounds remarkably like the line the Kremlin is using with respect to the recent events in Ukraine.[[User:Royalcourtier|Royalcourtier]] ([[User talk:Royalcourtier|talk]]) 22:08, 12 October 2014 (UTC)

:Yes, good point. And it is not coincidental. Russia and in particular Putins regimes, are still living in the power struggles of the Cold War era. It is part of Russia's modern identity as a nation and as a people as well. It does not have much to do with political ideologies any more, even tough that was what started it all. nowadays it is just the power struggle itself that is left. And it is a very important aspect of the mindset and attitudes of Russia and Russian people of today. I do not think we could blame Russia much in this respect, as USA and Europe are still actively proceeding the political agendas of [[containment]] towards Russia, just as they did during the Cold War. Nothing has changed with regard to this continuing power struggle. Now the ideologies are just not there anymore, it is just about money, power and control.

:Lesson: It is always rewarding to understand a conflict from as many viewpoints as possible.

:::Indeed. also sounds remarkably like some American &quot;scholarly&quot; literature on the Vietnam war (defending against &quot;internal aggression&quot;, defending against &quot;Vietcong terror&quot;). This stuff is always taken very seriously at home and laughed at abroad.[[User:Guccisamsclub|Guccisamsclub]] ([[User talk:Guccisamsclub|talk]]) 01:24, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

== 60th anniversary ==
As next year will be the 60th anniversary of the Revolution what should there be on the WP main page? 

Possibly articles on 'one or more of the persons involved' could be suitably developed. [[User:Jackiespeel|Jackiespeel]] ([[User talk:Jackiespeel|talk]]) 22:23, 24 October 2015 (UTC)

A new paragraph or 2 about info on the 60th anniversary. [[User:SwagBucks101101|SwagBucks101101]] ([[User talk:SwagBucks101101|talk]]) 19:40, 21 May 2016 (UTC)

== Death Sentences ==
The Illustrated London News of 1957 June 20, on pg 1052, has a picture titled &quot;Hungarian Patriots Condemned to Death&quot;, showing 3 prisoners in dock with guards. 

&quot;On June 30, in Budapest, the Hungarian Supreme Court confirmed death sentences on three Hungarians convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes and condemned to death three more who had previously been sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Prison sentences on five other Hungarians were increased...&quot; 
The article gives their names as: &quot;Ilona Toth, a woman medical student, Ferenc Gonczi, Miklos Gyongyosi, Gyula Obersovsky, Jozsef Gali, &amp; Ferenc Kovacs.&quot; 

I could find no further info or follow-up. [[User:CFLeon|CFLeon]] ([[User talk:CFLeon|talk]]) 02:29, 4 February 2016 (UTC)

== Over reliance on likely dated UN report ==

About two thirds of the article is based on a 1957 UN report informed  primarily by refugee hearings, report condemned by the Hungarian gvt of the time and boycotted by the Soviet Union (therefore it is naturally one sided, even without taking into account the Cold War context). I'm sure there's enough recent scholarship on the events to supplant it and, with the opening of the archives in the past decades, more reliable information has come to fore. I also take issue with the fact that statements are cherry picked from sources, potentially skewing the NPOV of this article (e.g. the source used to support the drop in purchasing power concludes that, despite the postulated shortcomings of planned economy, Hungary's economy had successfully recovered from the war and had undergone a structural modernization - none of this is reported in the article, which moreover has the section titled &quot;economic decline&quot;). Consequently, unless the article is improved, I'm strongly inclined to propose delisting this article as FA. [[User:Anonimu|Anonimu]] ([[User talk:Anonimu|talk]]) 23:12, 28 October 2016 (UTC)</text>
