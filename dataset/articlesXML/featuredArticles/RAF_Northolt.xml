'''RAF Northolt''' {{airport codes|NHT|EGWU}} is a [[Royal Air Force]] station in [[South Ruislip]], {{convert|2|NM|lk=in}}&lt;ref name=&quot;aip&quot;/&gt; from [[Uxbridge]] in the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]], west London. Approximately {{Convert|6|mi|abbr=on|0}} north of [[London Heathrow Airport]], the station also handles a large number of private civil flights.&lt;ref name=AboutusRAF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafnortholt/aboutus/ |title=RAF Northolt – About us |year=2011 |work=|publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northolt has one runway in operation, spanning {{convert|1687|x|46|m|abbr=on|0}}, with a grooved [[asphalt]] surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;aip&quot;/&gt;

Northolt pre-dates the establishment of the Royal Air Force by almost three years, having opened in May 1915. Originally established for the [[Royal Flying Corps]], it has the longest history of continuous use of any RAF airfield. Before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the station was the first to take delivery of the [[Hawker Hurricane]]. The station played a key role during the [[Battle of Britain]], when fighters from several of its units, including [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron]], engaged enemy aircraft as part of the defence of London. It became the first base to have squadrons operating [[Supermarine Spitfire]] aircraft within German airspace.

During the construction of Heathrow Airport, Northolt was used for commercial civil flights, becoming the busiest airport in Europe for a time and a major base for [[British European Airways]]. More recently the station has become the hub of British military flying operations in the London area. Northolt has been extensively redeveloped since 2006 to accommodate these changes, becoming home to the [[British Forces Post Office]], which moved to a newly constructed headquarters and sorting office on the site. Units currently  based at RAF Northolt are [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron]], the [[Queen's Colour Squadron]], [[No. 600 Squadron RAF|600 (City of London) Squadron]], No 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit, the [[Air Historical Branch]] and the [[Central Band of the Royal Air Force|Central Band of the RAF]]. The station has also been used as a filming location for productions made at [[Pinewood Studios]].

== History ==

===Construction===
Following [[Louis Blériot]]'s first flight across the [[English Channel]] in 1909, the [[British Army]] considered the necessity of defending the United Kingdom from a future air attack. By May 1910, [[Claude Grahame-White]] and other aviation pioneers were flying from the flat areas around [[Ruislip]], although they soon sought an aerodrome for London, which was eventually built at [[Hendon Aerodrome|Hendon]]. A proposal was made in 1912 for the area around where RAF Northolt now stands to be developed as &quot;Harrow Aerodrome&quot;. The company established to develop the site was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] but the idea did not progress any further.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of the [[First World War]] necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major [[Sefton Brancker]] of the [[War Office]] conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in [[Ickenham]], and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station but it was not until January 1915 that the British government officially requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land on the wrong side of the railway line,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow 2005, p.16&quot;&gt;Bristow 2005, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; including the old Hill Farm.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlt 1996, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAF Northolt aerial view 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Easterly view of the aerodrome in 1917]]
Construction of the new aerodrome, to be named &quot;RFC Military School, Ruislip&quot;, began in January 1915. It opened on 3 May 1915, becoming known as Northolt and home to No.&amp;nbsp;4 Reserve Aeroplane Squadron which relocated from [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]]. The airfield became &quot;Northolt&quot; despite being in neighbouring South Ruislip. Most early RAF airfields were named after the nearest railway station, in this case [[South Ruislip station]], known at that time as Northolt Junction and later Northolt Halt. In the same year the airfield was extended westwards and aircraft began flying sorties in defence of London against [[Zeppelin]] raids. [[No. 18 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;18 Squadron]] was formed in the same month as Northolt and equipped with Bleriot Experimental biplanes, whose slow speed led to heavy losses in combat with the German [[Fliegertruppe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow 2005, p.16&quot;/&gt;

In 1916, No.&amp;nbsp;43 Squadron was formed under the command of Major [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]]. Aircraft equipping the squadron included the [[Sopwith 1½ Strutter]], built by the [[Fairey Aviation]] company, then in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]]. The Strutter made its first test flight from Northolt in 1916 with [[Harry Hawker]] at the controls.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey conducted test flights at Northolt from 1917 until 1928 when the [[Air Ministry]] gave the company notice to vacate the aerodrome.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood 1990, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Flights later resumed from the [[Great West Aerodrome]] owned by Fairey in [[Harmondsworth]], which was eventually developed as Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p32&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;43 Squadron went on to fly sorties over France from 17 January 1917, taking part in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] between 4 and 8 April 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No. 600 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;600 Squadron]] and [[No. 601 Squadron RAF|No. 601&amp;nbsp;Squadron]] of the fledgling [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] were formed at Northolt in 1925 under the command of [[Squadron Leader]] Lord Edward Grosvenor. Both squadrons were deployed to [[RAF Hendon]] in 1927, although 600 Squadron would return in 1939. The [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], later King Edward VIII and subsequently the [[Duke of Windsor]], made his first flight in a [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] from Northolt on 27 April 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Britain and the Second World War ===
[[File:Dywizjon 303 3.jpg|thumb|303 Squadron pilots (May 1942, RAF Northolt){{Ref label|a|a|none}}]]
Northolt became an active base during the Second World War for Royal Air Force and [[Polish Air Forces in Great Britain|Polish Air Force]] squadrons in their defence of the United Kingdom. It was the first RAF station to operate the Hawker Hurricane, with [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;111 Squadron]] receiving the first four aircraft in December 1937,&lt;ref name=RAFhistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafnortholt/aboutus/history.cfm |title=RAF Northolt – History of RAF Northolt |year=2011 |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching its full complement by February 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bickers&quot;&gt;Townsend Bickers 1990, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to war, the RAF implemented a policy of adding concrete runways to important airfields. As a result, by 1939 Northolt had a new {{Convert|800|by|50|yd|adj=on}} concrete runway.&lt;ref&gt;Birtles 2010, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1939 RAF Hendon became one of its satellite airfields.&lt;ref&gt;Birtles 2010, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Polish pilots were taught English at RAF Uxbridge, where they also practised formation flying using tricycles with radios, compasses and speed indicators.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Battle of Britain Day|On 15 September 1940]] during the [[Battle of Britain]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]], [[No. 229 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;229 Squadron]], [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron]], [[No. 504 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;504 Squadron]], and part of [[No. 264 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;264 Squadron]] were based at the station, all under the control of [[No. 11 Group RAF]], headquartered at [[RAF Uxbridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bickers&quot;/&gt; All flew Hawker Hurricanes except No.&amp;nbsp;264 Squadron's contingent, which operated the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]].&lt;!--orphan? - No. 303--&gt; During the Battle of Britain, the Polish Squadron downed the highest number of enemy aircraft with its Czech pilot Sergeant Josef Frantisek scoring the most &quot;kills&quot;.&lt;ref name=RAFhistory/&gt; The [[Luftwaffe]] bombed the airfield in August 1940 as well as other sector airfields in the area, including [[RAF Biggin Hill|Biggin Hill]], [[RAF Hornchurch|Hornchurch]] and [[RAF North Weald|North Weald]], as part of a concentrated effort against the airfields and sector stations of No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group RAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bickers&quot;/&gt; A total of 4,000 bombs were recorded as falling within two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) of the airfield over a fifteen-month period, although only two were recorded as hitting the airfield itself.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1987, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of the station commander, [[Group Captain]] [[Stanley Vincent]], the airfield was camouflaged to resemble civil housing. Vincent had been concerned that camouflaging the airfield as open land would look too suspicious from the air; Northolt was surrounded by housing and so a large open area would draw attention. A fake stream was painted across the main runway while the hangars were decorated to look like houses and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlt 1994, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; The result was so effective that pilots flying to Northolt from other airfields often struggled to find it.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polish War Memorial, Northolt - geograph.org.uk - 18610.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Polish War Memorial near RAF Northolt]]
Thirty [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airmen including servicemen from Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, New Zealand, Poland and the United Kingdom were killed flying from RAF Northolt during the Battle of Britain, of whom ten were Polish.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Polish War Memorial]] dedicated to all Polish airmen who lost their lives during the Second World War stands near the southeastern corner of the airfield. Its name is also commemorated at the adjacent eponymous junction on [[Western Avenue (London)|Western Avenue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WarMemorial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/200622/historic_buildings/800/war_memorials/3 |title=Polish War Memorial |date= |publisher=London Borough of Ealing |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squadrons based at RAF Northolt during the battle shot down a total of 148 Luftwaffe aircraft and damaged 52. A further 25 were claimed by pilots and recorded as &quot;probables&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;  Group Captain Vincent became one of the few RAF airmen to shoot down an enemy aircraft in both World Wars. Vincent was a long-serving RAF man who had claimed an aerial victory over the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the First World War. By the time of the Battle of Britain he was too old for operational flying. Nevertheless, he took to the skies during one raid and succeeded in bringing down a German aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Birtles 2010, pp.50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AVM Stanley F Vincent.jpg|thumb|150px|Group Captain Stanley Vincent brought down a German aircraft while serving as station commander in 1940]]
After the Battle of Britain, the station remained a base for daytime fighter operations, with [[No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron]], [[No. 229 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;229 Squadron]] and [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;615 Squadron]] all arriving before 3 November 1940. [[No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron]] and [[No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron]] later joined No.&amp;nbsp;303 during 1941 to form the No.&amp;nbsp;1 Polish Fighter Wing. Polish Fighter Squadrons based at Northolt in 1942 took part in [[Operation Jubilee]] (the raid on Dieppe) on 19 August alongside Nos.&amp;nbsp;302 and 308 from nearby [[RAF Heston]]. Reconnaissance squadrons [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;16 Squadron]] and [[No. 140 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;140 Squadron]] operating Supermarine Spitfires and [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s moved to Northolt in 1944. [[No. 69 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;69 Squadron]] with their [[Vickers Wellington]]s modified for photographic reconnaissance arrived later. All three reconnaissance squadrons were combined to form No.&amp;nbsp;34 (PR) Wing.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the station became the first to fly sorties using [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk IXs in German airspace in support of bomber operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://on-target-aviation.com/RAF%20Northolt%2008.html |title=RAF Northolt Visit – 22nd&amp;nbsp;October 2008 |last1=Thompson| first1=Pete |year=2008 |publisher=On Target Aviation |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March, [[RAF Ferry Command]] became [[RAF Transport Command]] and thereafter used Northolt as a London base for the transfer of new aircraft from factories to airfields. Runway 26/08 was extended in February that year to accommodate the larger transport aircraft required by the Command. Northolt continued as a Sector Fighter Station until February 1944. As a result of this and the new larger runway, the smaller 02/20 runway closed in April 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

RAF Northolt became home to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]'s personal aircraft, a modified [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]], in June 1944. The aircraft was used to fly him to meetings with other Allied leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; Between 20 and 21 July 1944, a converted [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bomber named &quot;Marco Polo&quot; made the first non-stop intercontinental flight, flying from London to Washington, DC, then returning to Northolt from [[La Guardia Airport]] within 18 hours. In November of the same year, an [[Avro York]] flew non-stop from Northolt to Cairo in 10&amp;nbsp;hours and 25&amp;nbsp;minutes. A new runway, 31/13, was surveyed the following month and built in March 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war civil and military use===
Starting in 1946 the airfield was used by civil aviation during the construction of nearby Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref name=RAFhistory/&gt; During this period, Northolt became a major base for [[British European Airways]], which used the nearby Bourne School as its headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.77&quot;&gt;Bristow 2005, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Other airlines including [[Aer Lingus]], [[Alitalia]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] and [[Swissair]] used the airfield for scheduled services across Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.77&quot;/&gt;

In December 1946, after taking off during a heavy snowstorm, a [[Douglas DC-3]] operated by British European Airways, flying from Northolt to [[Glasgow]], crashed onto the roof of a house in [[South Ruislip]]. All the crew and passengers escaped unharmed by climbing through the loft of the house and leaving via the front door.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.79&quot;/&gt; No residents were injured, even though the owner of the house next door was standing at her front gate when the aircraft came down. The owners of the house had not moved in at the time of the crash as they were due to be married a few days later. The house was later named &quot;Dakota Rest&quot; after the Douglas DC-3's wartime operational name, and still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlt 1994, pp.130–132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAF Northolt hangar.JPG|thumb|left|311 hangar at RAF Northolt was used for the opening sequence in the 1983 [[James Bond (film series)|Bond]] film ''[[Octopussy]]'']]
During 1952 a total of 50,000 air movements were recorded, making the airfield the busiest in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt; By then the only scheduled airlines were BEA and Aer Lingus. The RAF maintained a presence throughout its use by civil airlines, making it the longest continually used airfield in the history of the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.79&quot;&gt;Bristow 2005, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; En route from Northolt to [[Dublin]], on 10 January 1952, a civil [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] operated by Aer Lingus and named &quot;St. Kevin&quot; flew into an area of extreme turbulence caused by a [[Lee wave|mountain wave]] generated by [[Snowdon]]. As a result, the plane crashed into a peat bog near [[Llyn Gwynant]] in [[Snowdonia]], killing all 20 passengers and three crew in the company's first fatal accident.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19520110-0 10 January 1952 Douglas C-47B-35-DK Dakota 3].&quot; ''Aviation Safety Network''. Retrieved 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil flights ceased when the central area at Heathrow opened in 1954 with Northolt reverting to sole military use in May that year.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Northolt's operations became constrained by its proximity to the new much larger civil airport at Heathrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.90&quot;/&gt; No. 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit (AIDU) moved to the station in 1956 from the neighbouring [[RAF West Ruislip]] station.&lt;ref name=RAFhistory/&gt; The unit had been established in 1953 to provide information on airfields, communications and navigational aids for the benefit of aircraft safety. AIDU was originally under the command of RAF Transport Command but this was moved to Home Command in March 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 1960, an [[Avro Anson]] aircraft suffered engine failure soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed on top of the nearby [[Express Dairies]] plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.90&quot;&gt;Bristow 2005, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, on 25 October, a [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Boeing 707]], heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abpic.co.uk/photo/1001607/ |title=Boeing 707–321, N725PA, Pan American World Airways (PA / PAA) |last1=Trussell |first1=George |date=25 October 1960 |work=|publisher=George Trussell Collection |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Lufthansa]] Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as [[Instrument Landing System|instrument landing systems]] (ILS) and the [[Global Positioning System|global positioning system]] (GPS) were available, the letters ''NO'' (for Northolt) and ''LH'' (for Heathrow) were painted on two [[gasometer]]s on the approach to each airfield, one at [[Southall]] for the approach to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.90&quot;/&gt; By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft.

Northolt received its first [[gate guardian]], a Spitfire F.[[Mark (designation)|Mk]] 22, in September 1963. Purchased from the RAF in 1969 for use in the film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'', it was replaced by a Spitfire Mk XVI on 2 June 1970. This aircraft remained at the station until its removal on 8 September 1989 for restoration to full flying condition. The [[Kermit Weeks]]' [[Fantasy of Flight]] Museum in [[Polk City, Florida|Polk City]], Florida, purchased the aircraft whereupon the station received a [[fibreglass]] replica of a Spitfire Mk IX as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Servicing of [[No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron RAF|No. 32 Squadron]] passed from the RAF to the private company Fields Aviation Services in April 1985, then to Lovaux Aircraft Servicing in 1990. In 1991, the Station Flight was established, taking delivery of two [[Britten-Norman Islanders]] in December which entered service in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; No. 32 Squadron celebrated its [[Diamond Jubilee]] in 1991, at a time when personnel became involved in operations during the [[Gulf War]]. [[No. 38 Group RAF]] assumed control of RAF Northolt on 2 November 1992 following a wider restructuring of the RAF. On 16 December 1994, the new southside Operations Building opened, replacing the old Northolt Airport Terminal building. With the reorganisation of [[RAF Strike Command]] on 1 April 2000, No. 38 Group was disbanded and Northolt came under the control of [[No. 2 Group RAF]].&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern use===
In August 1996, a Spanish [[Learjet]] operated by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and collided with a van heading eastward on the [[A40 road|A40]] Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in [[Buckinghamshire]]. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/uxbridge-history/2008/06/16/when-the-learjet-came-down-it-really-was-a-case-of-hold-the-front-page-113046-21082526/

Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]-filled safety pits were installed at each end of the runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another [[business jet]] or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Transport Select Committee]] considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1998/jun/30/raf-northolt |title=RAF Northolt |date=30 June 1998 |publisher=Hansard |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These suggestions were opposed by then [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ruislip-Northwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Ruislip-Northwood]], [[John Wilkinson (British politician)|John Wilkinson]], and eventually progressed no further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centreforaviation.com/news/2011/02/11/britains-endangered-airports/page1 |title=Britain's airports battle for passengers, airlines ... and survival |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much media attention focused on the airfield when the body of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], arrived there from [[Villacoublay]] airfield, in Paris, France, after [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death]] in a car crash in the city on 31 August 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/DianaPrincessofWales/Death.aspx |title=Diana, Princess of Wales |date= |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Queen's Colour Squadron]], then based at neighbouring RAF Uxbridge, acted as the bearer party, while the flight was met by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Greater London]], [[Secretary of State for Defence]], the RAF Northolt station commander and the RAF Chaplain-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention was high again in 2001 when [[Ronnie Biggs]], the seriously ill, fugitive [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robber]], was flown from Brazil to the airfield to be arrested by waiting police officers. Biggs had escaped from custody in 1965; upon his return he was taken to [[Belmarsh Prison]] to complete the remainder of his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1316917.stm |title=Biggs sent back to jail |date=7 May 2001 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 June 1998, station commanders have served as [[aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] to Her Majesty the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; The station received the Freedom of Entry to the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] on 11 May 2000. This allowed military personnel to march through the borough in full uniform, an honour granted by the council in light of 2000 being the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and the 85th anniversary of the opening of RAF Northolt. The neighbouring RAF Uxbridge station had received the same honour in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2005, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of a Hawker Hurricane flown by Flying Officer Ludwik Witold Paszkiewicz, the first pilot in No.&amp;nbsp;303 Squadron to shoot down an enemy aircraft, were donated to the station in June 2008. During the Battle of Britain, Paszkiewicz became a flying ace and received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] after shooting down six aircraft.

Scenes of the [[James Bond]] films ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' and ''[[Octopussy]]'' were filmed at Northolt, and station personnel served as extras in the ''Octopussy'' hangar fly-through stunt scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.101&quot;&gt;Bristow 2005, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; The mini-series ''[[The Winds of War]]'' and ''[[The Bill]]'' and the BBC shows ''[[Waking the Dead (TV series)|Waking the Dead]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' have all used Northolt to represent various fictional airfields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow p.101&quot;/&gt; In early 2010 the station was used for action scenes in the final episode of the BBC's final series of ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iwcp.co.uk/news/news/the-iw-might-be-but-its-car-is-a-star-in-finale-32929.aspx |title=The IW might be **** but its car is a star in finale |last1=Neville |first1=Martin |date=21 May 2010 |work= Isle of Wight County Press |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
