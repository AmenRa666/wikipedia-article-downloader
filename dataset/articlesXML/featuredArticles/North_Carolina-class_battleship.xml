The '''''North Carolina'' class''' was a [[ship class|class]] of two [[fast battleship]]s, ''[[USS North Carolina (BB-55)|North Carolina]]'' and ''[[USS Washington (BB-56)|Washington]]'', built for the [[United States Navy]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The navy was originally uncertain whether the ships should be fast enough to counter the Japanese {{sclass-|Kongō|battlecruiser|4}}, which was believed by the United States to be capable of 26&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]] (30&amp;nbsp;mph; 48&amp;nbsp;km/h), or should sacrifice speed for additional firepower and armor. The [[Second London Naval Treaty]]'s requirement that all [[capital ship]]s have a [[displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]] of under 35,000&amp;nbsp;[[long ton]]s (35,560&amp;nbsp;[[tonne|metric tons]]) prevented the desired objectives from being fully realized within its limits, and the navy considered over fifty designs before one was chosen.

Towards the end of this lengthy design period the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] declared its preference for a battleship with a speed of {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h}}, faster than any in US service or under construction, with a [[main battery]] of nine [[14&quot;/50 caliber gun|14-inch (356 mm)/50 caliber Mark B guns]]. The board believed that such ships could fulfill a multitude of roles, as they would have enough protection to be put into a [[battle line]] while also having enough speed to escort [[aircraft carrier]]s or engage in [[commerce raider|commerce raiding]]. However, the acting Secretary of the Navy authorized a modified version of a different design, which in its original form had been rejected by the General Board. This called for a {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h|adj=on}} ship with twelve 14-inch guns in quadruple turrets and protection against guns of the same caliber. In a major departure from traditional American design practices, this design accepted lower speed and protection in exchange for maximum firepower. After construction had begun, the United States became concerned over Japan's refusal to commit to the caliber limit of the Second London Naval Treaty, so they invoked the &quot;escalator clause&quot; of that pact and increased the class' main armament to nine [[16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 gun|{{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}}/45&amp;nbsp;Mark&amp;nbsp;6 caliber guns]] from the original twelve 14-inch guns.

Both ''North Carolina'' and ''Washington'' saw extensive service during the Second World War in a variety of roles, primarily in the Pacific theater where they escorted fast carrier task forces and conducted shore bombardments. ''North Carolina'' shot down between seven and fourteen Japanese aircraft in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], and later sustained a torpedo hit from a Japanese submarine. During the [[naval battle of Guadalcanal]], which was a chaotic night engagement, ''Washington's'' radar-directed main batteries fatally damaged the Japanese battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}} causing it to sink the next day. In February 1944, ''Washington'' crushed its bow in a collision with battleship {{USS|Indiana|BB-58|2}}. Following repairs, ''Washington'' rejoined its [[sister ship|sister]] for the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. After the end of the war, both ships took part in [[Operation Magic Carpet]], the withdrawal of American military personnel from overseas deployments. The vessels were laid up in the reserve fleet until the early 1960s, when ''North Carolina'' was sold to [[North Carolina|its home state]] as a [[museum ship]], and ''Washington'' was [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.

== Background ==
After the end of the First World War, several navies continued and expanded naval construction programs that they had started during the conflict. The United States' 1916 program called for six {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser}}s and five {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|0}} [[battleship]]s; in December 1918, the government of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] called for building an additional ten battleships and six battlecruisers. 1919–20 [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]] proposals planned for slightly smaller, but still significant, acquisitions beyond the 1916 plan: two battleships and a battlecruiser for the [[fiscal year]] 1921, and three battleships, a battlecruiser, four aircraft carriers and thirty destroyers between the fiscal years 1922 and 1924. The United Kingdom was in the final stages of ordering eight capital ships (the [[G3 battlecruiser]]s, with the first's [[keel laying]] in 1921, and [[N3-class battleship]]s, to be laid down beginning in 1922). [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] was, by 1920, attempting to build up to an [[eight-eight fleet|8-8 standard]] with the {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|5}}, {{sclass-|Tosa|battleship|5}}, {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser|5}}, {{sclass-|Kii|battleship|5}} and {{sclass2-|Number 13|battleship|5}} classes. Two ships from these designs would be laid down per year until 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;

With the staggering costs associated with such programs, the United States' [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] invited delegations from the major maritime powers—France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom—to come together in [[Washington, D.C.]] to discuss, and hopefully end, the naval arms races. The subsequent [[Washington Naval Conference]] resulted in the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. Along with many other provisions, it limited all future battleships to a [[displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]] of {{convert|35000|LT|t}} and a maximum gun caliber of {{convert|16|in|mm|0}}. It also decreed that the five countries could not construct another capital ship for ten years and could not replace any ship that survived the treaty until it was at least twenty years old.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 3, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1936 [[Second London Naval Treaty]], while superseding the 1922 agreement, nonetheless kept many of the same requirements, though it restricted gun size on new warships to {{convert|14|in|mm|0}}. These treaties heavily influenced the design of the ''North Carolina'' class, as can be attested to in the long quest to find a ship that incorporated everything considered necessary while remaining under 35,000&amp;nbsp;long tons.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 243&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

=== Early ===
The General Board began preparations for a new [[ship class|class]] of battleships in May–July 1935. Three design studies were submitted to them: &quot;A&quot; would be {{convert|32150|LT|t|abbr=on}} armed with nine {{convert|14|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns in triple [[gun turret|turrets]]—all forward of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]—capable of {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h}}, and armored against 14-inch shells; &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; would both be over {{convert|36000|LT|t|abbr=on}}, able to reach {{convert|30.5|kn|mph km/h}} and armored against 14-inch shells—the major difference between the two was the planned [[main battery]], as &quot;B&quot; had twelve 14-inch guns in triple turrets, while &quot;C&quot; had eight [[16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 gun|{{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}}/45-caliber guns]] in dual turrets. &quot;A&quot; was the only one to remain within the {{convert|35000|LT|t|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] limit set in the Washington Naval Treaty and reaffirmed in the Second London Naval Treaty. When the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] introduced a &quot;super-heavy&quot; 16-inch shell, the ships were redesigned (&quot;A1&quot;, &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;C1&quot;) in an attempt to provide protection against it, but this introduced severe weight problems: &quot;A1&quot; was only {{convert|500|LT|t|abbr=on}} below the 35,000-ton limit, while the other two were close to {{convert|40000|LT|t|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 244&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|This article uses Friedman's designations for the multitude of design proposals.}}

Although these original three studies were all [[fast battleship]]s, the General Board was not definitively committed to the higher maximum speeds. It posed questions to the [[Naval War College]], asking for their opinion as to whether the new class should be a &quot;conventional&quot; {{convert|23|kn|mph km/h|adj=on}} ship with an eight-nine, 16-inch main battery, or rather one akin to &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 248&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS North Carolina overhead.jpg|thumb|left|''North Carolina'' seen from the air on 17 April 1942|alt=A large battleship steams through choppy seas. Three floatplanes are located on the stern.]]
Five more design studies were produced in late September 1935, which had characteristics of 23–30.5 knots, eight or nine 14- or 16-inch guns, and a standard displacement between {{convert|31500|LT|t|abbr=on}} and {{convert|40500|LT|t|abbr=on}}. &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; were attempts at fast battleships with 16-inch guns and protections against the same, but their displacement was greater than the Washington Naval Treaty allowed. &quot;F&quot; was a radical attempt at a hybrid battleship-carrier, with three catapults mounted [[bow (ship)|fore]] and eight 14-inch guns [[aft]]. It was reportedly favored by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], but as aircraft launched from catapults were necessarily inferior to most carrier- or land-based aircraft because of the [[Floats (nautical)|floats]] used to land, nothing came of the design. &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; were slower 23-knot ships with nine 14-inch guns; in particular, &quot;H&quot; was thought to be a very well balanced design by the Preliminary Design section of the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. However, the General Board finally decided to use faster ships, which &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; were not.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 246–250&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies demonstrated the difficulty the designers faced. With a displacement of 35,000 tons, there were two basic choices: a ship similar to &quot;A1&quot; which was faster (30 knots) but more lightly armed and armored than contemporary battleships or one which was slower but armed with heavier guns—although fitting in protection against 16-inch guns would be extremely difficult. Preliminary Design drew up five more studies in October, based upon either &quot;A&quot; with additional armor or a scaled-down &quot;B&quot;; all utilized 14-inch guns and called for 30 or 30.5&amp;nbsp;knots. Two called for four turrets, but this would be too heavy and mount less armor. Another, &quot;K,&quot; {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} [[belt armor|belt]] and {{convert|5.25|in|mm|adj=on}} [[deck armor|deck]] and a {{convert|19000|–|30000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} [[immune zone]] against the United States' super-heavy 14-inch shell. While &quot;K&quot; was liked by the naval constructors, its designed standard displacement of 35,000&amp;nbsp;tons left little room for error or any modifications and improvements to the design. A final two, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;M,&quot; would use quadruple turrets to save weight (similar to the French {{Ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}}) while still mounting 12 guns.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 247, 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;

Many officers in the United States Navy supported the construction of three or four [[battlecruiser]]-type ships for carrier escorts and to counter Japan's {{sclass-|Kongō|battlecruiser|4}}. These included the acting [[Secretary of the United States Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] and [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[William Harrison Standley|William Standley]], the president of the Naval War College Admiral [[William S. Pye]], a small majority (9–7) of senior officers at sea, and five of six line officers engaged in strategic planning as part of the [[War Plans Division]], although at least one officer believed that an aerial attack would also be capable of sinking the ''Kongō''s. With the above recommendations, the General Board selected &quot;K&quot; to undergo further development.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final ===
[[File:USS North Carolina fires over bow.jpg|thumb|right|''North Carolina'' fires a three-gun salvo from its number one turret.|alt=Six large guns in two turrets are aimed directly forward; the far trio are elevated extremely high and have a large amount of smoke emanating from them]]
At least 35 different final designs were proposed. All numbered with [[Roman numeral]]s (&quot;I&quot; through &quot;XVI-D&quot;), the first five (&quot;I&quot;–&quot;V&quot;, variations upon &quot;K&quot;) were completed on 15 November 1935. They were the first to employ so-called &quot;paper&quot; weight reductions: not counting certain weights in the ship's 35,000&amp;nbsp;long ton limit that were not specifically part of the definition of [[standard displacement]]. In this case, even though there was designed storage room for 100&amp;nbsp;shells per main battery gun and an extra 100&amp;nbsp;rounds, the weight of the rounds did not figure toward the treaty-mandated limit.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 252&lt;/ref&gt;

These designs varied greatly in everything but their standard displacements and speeds. &quot;II&quot; called for {{convert|35743|LT|t|abbr=on}}, every other design called for 35,000&amp;nbsp;long tons, and only five planned for a top speed of under {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h}}; of those, only one was lower than {{convert|26.5|kn|mph km/h}}: &quot;VII&quot;, with {{convert|22|kn|mph km/h}}. &quot;VII&quot; returned to a lower speed to obtain more firepower (twelve 14-inch guns in triple turrets) and protection; as such, the design called for only 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[shaft horsepower]] (shp){{efn-ua|The next lowest were &quot;X-A&quot;, &quot;XI-A&quot; and &quot;XI-B&quot;, with 112,500&amp;nbsp;shp.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;}} and a length of only {{convert|640|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Most other plans called for {{convert|710|ft|m|abbr=on}} or {{convert|725|ft|m|abbr=on}}, although six had lengths between {{convert|660|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|690|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The first eight designs (&quot;I&quot;–&quot;IV-C&quot;) carried nine 14-inch guns, but many other combinations were tried, including eight 14-inch in two quadruple turrets (one design, &quot;V&quot;, even planned for two quadruple 16-inch), eight 14-inch guns in four dual turrets (&quot;VIA&quot; and &quot;VIB&quot;), and ten, eleven or twelve 14-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 254–255, 259&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] remarked in annoyance that they were being asked to design a ship equal to Britain's {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} but on more than {{convert|5000|LT|t|abbr=on}} less displacement. This was resulting in some of the normal safety margins being lowered or dropped, among other issues. Friedman 259--&gt;

The &quot;XVI&quot; version of 20 August 1936 was a 27-knot, {{convert|714|ft|m|abbr=on}}-long ship that the Bureau of Ordnance found many problems in. Model tests showed at high speeds, waves generated by the design of the hull would leave some lower parts of the ship uncovered—including the magazines. To complicate the issue, the Bureau found low or underwater shell hits could be a serious problem when fighting at ranges between 20,000&amp;nbsp;yd ({{convert|10|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}) and 30,000&amp;nbsp;yd ({{convert|15|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}). Other problems included the design's defense against aircraft-dropped bombs, as the Bureau thought the formula used to calculate its effectiveness was not realistic; and the tapering of a fore bulkhead below the waterline could worsen underwater shell hit problems because the mostly unarmored bow could easily be penetrated. The solutions for these issues were all impractical; added patches of armor around the magazines could neutralize the torpedo-defense system's effectiveness, and deepening the belt near the bow and stern would put the ships over the 35,000&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;ton limit. The General Board detested this design, saying it was &quot;not ... a true battleship&quot; due to its speed and armor problems.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 261–263&lt;/ref&gt;

To address these problems, a final set of designs, &quot;XVI-B&quot;–&quot;XVI-D&quot;, was presented by Preliminary Design in October 1936. They were modifications of the &quot;XVI&quot; plan for a ship that was 714&amp;nbsp;ft. long, had twelve {{convert|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns in three quadruple turrets, a belt of {{convert|11.2|in|mm|1|adj=on}} [[sloped armor|sloped]] at {{formatnum:10}}°, and a deck {{convert|5.1|in|mm|1|adj=on}} to {{convert|5.6|in|mm|1|adj=on}} thick. In the final set, length was fixed at {{convert|725|ft|m|abbr=on}} for greater speed, but this meant only eleven 14-inch guns could be mounted with a thin {{convert|10.1|in|mm|adj=on}} belt. Alternatively, one gun could be traded for a {{convert|13.5|in|mm|1|adj=on}} belt, and another could be swapped for a 30-knot speed and one more tenth of an inch of belt armor; this became design &quot;XVI-C&quot;. The General Board liked &quot;XVI-C&quot; very much, seeing in it a ship that had enough protection to fight—and survive—in a [[battle line]] formed with the older battleships while also having enough speed to operate in a detached wing with, for example, aircraft carrier or cruiser [[commerce raider|commerce raiding]] groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman263&quot;&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 263&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one member of the Board, Admiral [[Joseph M. Reeves|Joseph Reeves]]—who had previously been one of the principal developers of the United States' aircraft carrier strategy—disliked &quot;XVI-C&quot; because he believed that it was not fast enough to work with the {{convert|33|kn|mph km/h|adj=on}} fast carriers, and it was not powerful enough to justify its cost. Instead, he advocated a development of the previously rejected &quot;XVI&quot;, adding additional underwater protection and patches of armor within the ship to make the magazines immune to above- and below-water shell hits from 19,000&amp;nbsp;yd ({{convert|9.5|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} and beyond. The immune zone's outer limit was increased from 28,200&amp;nbsp;yd ({{convert|14|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}})) to 30,000&amp;nbsp;yd ({{convert|15|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}). After further revisions, Reeves went to Admiral [[William Harrison Standley|William Standley]], the Chief of Naval Operations, who approved &quot;XVI&quot; in its newly modified form over the hopes of the General Board, who still thought that &quot;XVI-C&quot; should be built. Standley's only addition to the characteristics was provision for a switch from quadruple 14-inch to triple {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} turrets if the &quot;escalator clause&quot; in the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] was invoked.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 263, 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McBride, &quot;The Unstable Dynamics of a Strategic Technology,&quot; 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The &quot;escalator clause&quot; ===
{{quotebox|align=right|width=33%|quote=The point of this rather long and erratic design history is that, although one might see the ''North Carolina''s [as actually built] in several of these designs, that was not in fact so. The General Board was never entirely sure of what it was willing to give up to achieve some kind of ship within the treaty-limited displacement. As its membership changed, moreover, so did its ideas. The fast capital ship with nine guns, and a speed of 30&amp;nbsp;knots, yet having good protection, was ultimately rejected in favor of a ship that sacrificed both speed ''and'' protection for firepower, a combination unprecedented in American capital ship development.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 262–263&lt;/ref&gt;|source=—[[Norman Friedman]]}}
Although the Second London Naval Treaty stipulated that warship guns could be no larger than 14 inches, a so-called &quot;escalator clause&quot; was included at the urging of American negotiators in case any country that had signed the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] refused to adhere to this new limit. The provision allowed signatory countries of the Second London Treaty—France, the United Kingdom and the United States—to raise the limit from 14 to 16 inches if Japan or Italy still refused to sign after 1 April 1937. When figuring potential configurations for the ''North Carolina''s, designers focused most of their planning on 14-inch weaponry; Standley's requirement meant that a switch from 14- to 16-inch, even after the ships' [[keel]]s had been laid, was possible. Japan formally rejected the 14-inch limit on 27 March 1937, meaning that the &quot;escalator clause&quot; ''could'' be invoked. There were hurdles that still needed to be overcome, though: Roosevelt was under heavy political pressure and, as a result, was reluctant to allow the 16-inch gun.&lt;ref name=Muir25/&gt;{{efn-ua|The political pressures were not just from within the United States. When rumors that the United States was going to adopt 16-inch guns reached Japan in January 1937, Tokyo newspapers had immediately printed them alongside drawings of American warships aiming their guns at Japan. In addition, if the use of the &quot;escalator clause&quot; touched off another international naval arms race—this one featuring larger and larger ships—the United States would find itself at a huge disadvantage in one of two ways. Either their battleships would be built to have a [[Panamax]] capability, rendering them inferior to the new ships of other nations, or they would be designed to be on par with the other nations' ships, meaning that they would have to sail around [[Cape Horn]] if they desired to reach the other side of the United States.&lt;ref name=Muir25&gt;Muir, &quot;Gun Calibers and Battle Zones,&quot; 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I am not willing that the United States be the first naval power to adopt the 16 in. gun. ... Because of the international importance of the United States not being the first to change the principles laid down in the Washington and London Treaties, it seems to me that the plans for the two new battleships should contemplate the ... 14-inch gun.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Roosevelt to Secretary of the Navy [[Claude A. Swanson]], 8 April 1937. President's Secretary File, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. Hyde Park, New York. Quoted in Muir, &quot;Gun Calibers and Battle Zones,&quot; 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Admiral Reeves also came out strongly in favor of the larger weapon. In a two-page letter to Secretary of the Navy [[Claude A. Swanson]] and indirectly to Roosevelt, Reeves argued that the 16-inch gun's significantly greater armor penetration was of paramount importance, drawing examples from the [[World War I|First World War]]'s [[Battle of Jutland]], where some battleships were able to survive ten or twenty hits from large guns, but other battlecruisers were blown up in three to seven hits because the shells were able to cut through the armor protecting magazines and turrets. Reeves also argued that the larger gun would favor the &quot;indirect method&quot; of shooting then being developed, where airplanes would be used to relay targeting information to allied battleships so that they could bombard targets that were out of their sight or over the horizon, because new battleships being built by foreign powers would have more armor. Reeves believed that if the 14-inch gun was adopted, it would not be able to penetrate this larger amount of protection, whereas the 16-inch would be able to break through.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Reeves to Swanson, 17 May 1937. President's Secretary File, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. Hyde Park, New York. Reproduced in Muir, &quot;Gun Calibers and Battle Zones,&quot; 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a final vain attempt, Roosevelt's [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] sent a telegram on 4 June to the Ambassador to Japan [[Joseph Grew]] instructing him that the United States would still accept a cap of 14-inch guns if he could get Japan to as well. The Japanese replied that they could not accept this unless the number of battleships was also limited; they wanted the United States and the United Kingdom to agree to having an equal number of battleships with Japan, but this was a condition that the two countries refused to accept. On 24 June, the two ''North Carolina''s were ordered with the 14-inch weapons, but on 10 July, Roosevelt directed that they be armed with triple 16-inch instead.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, &quot;Gun Calibers and Battle Zones,&quot; 28, 35&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|This change meant that the Bureau of Construction and Repair had to modify the design of the ''North Carolina''s to accommodate the larger and heavier weaponry. As part of this, the ship's longitudinal center of gravity had to be shifted forward; the solution was to move many internal components of the ship forward two [[frame (nautical)|frames]], or {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Summations of all of the weights in the ship were not complete until October, and additional planning took until February, so the Secretary of the Navy authorized a one-month extension to the building period of both ships on 15 January 1942, moving the Bureau of Engineering's estimated date of completion to 1 February 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, &quot;Gun Calibers and Battle Zones,&quot; 28, 34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

|File:North Carolina class scheme A.jpg|alt1=A line drawing of a ship with three gun turrets on the centerline forward, a tall superstructure, and a large funnel at the rear.|The {{convert|32250|LT|t|adj=on}} design &quot;A&quot; was one of the first proposals. Unlike &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, it was far below the treaty-mandated limit of {{convert|35000|LT|t|abbr=on}}. It would have carried nine {{convert|14|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns in its main battery; although all of the turrets were forward of the superstructure, the guns could still fire forward provided that they were elevated to 4.5&amp;nbsp;degrees or more. The secondary battery planned was twelve {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} were unusually arranged in triple mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;
|File:North Carolina class scheme F.jpg|alt2=A line drawing of a ship with two stern gun turrets, both on the centerline, and catapults and a crane forward for aircraft|&quot;F&quot; was an attempt to create a viable combination of an aircraft carrier and a battleship. With regards to the treaty limits, the design had an extremely comfortable margin with a [[displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]] of {{convert|31750|LT|t ST}}. Three [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] were mounted on the bow, while a hangar located under that would contain ten [[bomber]]s with wings folded. Two non-[[superfire|superfiring]] turrets would be mounted aft, both holding four 14-in guns.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 250&lt;/ref&gt;
|File:North Carolina class scheme VII.jpg|alt3=A line drawing of a ship with four gun turrets—two mounted each fore and aft—a large superstructure with two high masts, and a catapult over the third turret.|&quot;VII&quot; harked back to the days of the slow battleships; with a top speed of {{convert|22|knot|mph km/h}}, it would have been only {{convert|1|knot|mph km/h}} faster than the old &quot;[[Standard type battleship|&quot;standard&quot;]] battleships. The weight gained from reducing the speed was added back in firepower and protection: &quot;VII&quot; would have had twelve 14-inch/50 caliber guns in four triple turrets and an [[immune zone]] against its own 14-inch gun between 21,400 and 30,000 yards (12.2&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;17.0 mi; 19.6&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;27.4 km).&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 258&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a few major differences between this and the final plan. For example, all exhaust was eventually trunked into two funnels as opposed to one, and the 5-in/38 caliber secondary battery was composed of all dual-mounted guns (no single).&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman263&quot;/&gt;

=== Armament ===
The two ''North Carolina''s were principally armed with nine [[16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 gun|{{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}}/45]] [[caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|caliber]] (cal) Mark 6 and twenty [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}}/38]] cal Mark 28 Mod 0 guns. Their lighter armament consisted of varying numbers of [[1.1&quot;/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|mm|adj=on}}]], [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 caliber]] machine guns, [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40&amp;nbsp;mm]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&amp;nbsp;mm]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 276–277 and 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Main battery ====
Mounted on both the ''North Carolina'' class and the follow-up {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1939)|4}}, the nine 16&amp;nbsp;in/45 were improved versions of the guns mounted on the {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|1}}s, hence the designation of &quot;Mark 6&quot;. A major alteration from the older guns was the Mark 6's ability to fire a new {{convert|2700|lb|kg|abbr=off|adj=on}} [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing (AP) shell]] developed by the Bureau of Ordnance. At full charge with a brand-new gun, the heavy shell would be expelled at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 2,300&amp;nbsp;feet per second (701&amp;nbsp;m/s); at a reduced charge, the same shell would be fired at 1,800&amp;nbsp;f/s&amp;nbsp;(549&amp;nbsp;m/s). Barrel life—the approximate number of rounds a gun could fire before needing to be [[relined]] or replaced—was 395&amp;nbsp;shells when using AP, although if only practice shots were used this figure was significantly higher: 2,860. Turning at 4&amp;nbsp;degrees a second, each turret could [[wikt:train|train]] to 150&amp;nbsp;degrees on either side of the ship. The guns could be elevated to a maximum inclination of 45&amp;nbsp;degrees; turrets one and three could depress to −2&amp;nbsp;degrees, but due to its [[superfire|superfiring]] position, the guns on turret two could only depress to 0&amp;nbsp;degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;16/45&quot;&gt;DiGiulian, &quot;16&quot;/45 (40.6&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 6&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Each gun was {{convert|736|in|mm}} long overall; its [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] and [[rifling]] length were {{convert|720|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|616.9|in|mm|adj=on}}, respectively. Maximum range with the heavy AP shell was obtained at an inclination of 45&amp;nbsp;degrees: {{convert|36900|yd|mi km}}. At the same elevation a lighter {{convert|1900|lb|kg|abbr=off|adj=on}} [[high capacity shell|high capacity (HC) shell]] would travel {{convert|40180|yd|mi km|abbr=off}}. The guns weighed 192,310&amp;nbsp;lb (87,230&amp;nbsp;kg; 86&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;tons) not including the breech; the turrets weighed slightly over 3,100,000&amp;nbsp;lb (1,410,000&amp;nbsp;kg; 1400&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;tons).&lt;ref name=&quot;16/45&quot;/&gt;

When firing the same shell, the 16&amp;nbsp;in/45 Mark 6 had a slight advantage over the [[16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|16&amp;nbsp;in/50 Mark 7]] when hitting deck armor—a shell from a 45&amp;nbsp;cal gun would be slower, meaning that it would have a [[Plunging fire|steeper trajectory]] as it descended. At {{convert|35000|yd|mi km|abbr=off}}, a shell from a 45&amp;nbsp;cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45.2&amp;nbsp;degrees, as opposed to 36&amp;nbsp;degrees with the 50&amp;nbsp;cal.&lt;ref name=&quot;16/45&quot;/&gt;

==== Secondary battery ====
The ''North Carolina''s carried ten twin enclosed base ring mounts supporting [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|5&amp;nbsp;in/38 caliber]] Mark 28 Mod 0 guns. Originally designed to be mounted upon destroyers built in the 1930s, these guns were so successful that they were added to a myriad of American ships during the Second World War, including every major [[ship classification|ship type]] and many smaller warships constructed between 1934 and 1945. They were considered to be &quot;highly reliable, robust and accurate&quot; by the Navy's [[Bureau of Ordnance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;5/38&quot;&gt;DiGiulian, &quot;5&quot;/38 (12.7&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 12&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5&amp;nbsp;in/38 functioned as a [[dual purpose gun]]; that is, it was able to fire at both surface and air targets with reasonable degrees of success. However, this did not mean that it possessed inferior anti-air abilities; as established during 1941 gunnery tests conducted on board ''North Carolina'', the gun possessed the ability to consistently shoot down aircraft flying at {{convert|12000|–|13000|ft|mi km|abbr=off}}, which was twice as far as the effective range of the earlier single purpose [[5&quot;/25 caliber gun|5&amp;nbsp;in/25]] anti-air gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;5/38&quot;/&gt;

Each 5&amp;nbsp;in/38 weighed almost {{convert|4000|lb|kg}} without the breech; the entire mount weighed {{convert|156295|lb|kg|abbr=off}}. It was {{convert|223.8|in|mm}} long overall, had a bore length of {{convert|190|in|mm}}, and had a rifling length of {{convert|157.2|in|mm}}. The gun could fire shells at about 2,500–2,600&amp;nbsp;ft/s (762–792&amp;nbsp;m/s); about 4,600 could be fired before the barrel needed to be replaced. Minimum and maximum elevations were −15 and 85&amp;nbsp;degrees, respectively. The guns' elevation could be raised or lowered at about 15&amp;nbsp;degrees per second. The mounts closest to the bow and stern could aim from −150 to 150&amp;nbsp;degrees; the others were restricted to −80 to 80&amp;nbsp;degrees. They could be turned at about 25&amp;nbsp;degrees per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;5/38&quot;/&gt;

==== Smaller weaponry ====

The remaining weaponry on board the two ''North Carolina''s was composed of differing numbers of [[1.1&quot;/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=off|adj=on}}]], [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 caliber]] machine guns, [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40&amp;nbsp;mm]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&amp;nbsp;mm]] guns. Although the ships were originally designed to carry only four quadruple 1.1&amp;nbsp;in and twelve .50&amp;nbsp;caliber, this was greatly increased and upgraded during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;friedman276-277&quot;&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 276–277&lt;/ref&gt;

On both ships, two more quadruple sets of 1.1&amp;nbsp;in guns were added in place of two searchlights amidships. After it was torpedoed in 1942, ''North Carolina'' had these removed and ten quadruple sets of 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns added. Fourteen were present by June 1943, while a fifteenth mount was added on top of the third main turret that November. ''Washington'' retained its six 1.1&amp;nbsp;in quads until the middle of 1943, when ten quad 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns replaced them. By August, it had fifteen. The two ships carried these through to the close of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;friedman276-277&quot;/&gt;

The .50&amp;nbsp;caliber machine guns did not have the range or power needed to combat modern aircraft and were scheduled for replacement by equal numbers of 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns, but nothing immediately came of the proposal. In fact, both ''North Carolina'' and ''Washington'' carried 20&amp;nbsp;mm and .50&amp;nbsp;caliber guns for most of 1942. In April, ''North Carolina'' had, respectively, forty and twelve, while ''Washington'' had twenty and twelve. Two months later, the number of 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns remained the same, but twelve .50&amp;nbsp;caliber guns had been added. By September, ''Washington'' had twenty more 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns added, for a total of forty, but five were removed—along with all of the .50&amp;nbsp;caliber guns—shortly thereafter when two quadruple sets of 1.1&amp;nbsp;in guns were added. In its refit after being torpedoed, ''North Carolina'' had an additional six 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns added and all of its .50&amp;nbsp;caliber weapons removed. ''Washington'' had sixty-four 20&amp;nbsp;mm weapons by April 1943, prior to one single mount being replaced by a quadruple mount, and ''North Carolina'' had fifty-three by March 1944. In April 1945, ''North Carolina'' was assigned to have fifty-six 20&amp;nbsp;mm, while ''Washington'' was assigned seventy-five. In August 1945, the ships both had eight twin 20&amp;nbsp;mm mounts; ''North Carolina'' also carried twenty single, while ''Washington'' carried one quad and sixty-three single.&lt;ref name=&quot;friedman277&quot;&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 277&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Washington (BB-56) tower foremast view.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Washington''{{'}}s tower foremast, seen on 18 August 1942 at the New York Navy Yard; note the SG surface search radar located on the forward face|alt=The tower is dominated by a large radar set; two long arms protrude from the side of the tower.]]
Both ''North Carolina'' and ''Washington'', designed prior to [[radar]], were originally fitted with many [[Fire-control system|fire-control]] and navigational optical range-finders. The former lasted until 1944, when it was replaced by a Mark 27 microwave radar—though it was supplemented by a Mark 3 main armament fire control radar. The range-finders were removed in favor of additional 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns sometime between the end of 1941 and mid-1942. In addition, the ships were commissioned with two [[Ship Gun Fire Control Systems#MK 38 Gun Fire Control System|Mark 38 directors]] and were originally fitted with a [[CXAM radar|CXAM]] air search, two Mark 3s and three Mark 4 secondary armament.&lt;ref name=Friedman276&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 276&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 1942, ''North Carolina'' had an additional Mark 4 and a SG surface search radar added. The normal battleship configuration was present aboard ''North Carolina'' in April 1944, with SK and SG radars (air and surface search, respectively), a backup SG, and Mark 8s to direct its main battery. All of the Mark 4s remained for the secondary battery, and one of the older Mark 3s was still present, possibly as a backup for the Mark 8s. An SK-2 dish replaced the older SK radar and Mark 12s and 22s superseded the Mark 4s in September of that year. Aside from never receiving an SK-2, ''Washington'' was the recipient of similar upgrades.&lt;ref name=Friedman276/&gt;

Both ships underwent extensive refits near the end or after the war; ''North Carolina'' received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At the end of the war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, ''Washington'' had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).&lt;ref name=Friedman276/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D56&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propulsion ===
The ships in the ''North Carolina'' class were equipped with four General Electric geared [[steam turbine|turbines]] and eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox three-drum express type boilers. The ships' powerplant incorporated several recent developments in turbine equipment, including double helical reduction gears and high-pressure steam technology. ''North Carolina''{{'}}s boilers supplied steam at 575&amp;nbsp;[[pounds per square inch]] and as hot as {{convert|850|F|C}}.{{efn-ua|For comparative purposes, the boilers fitted to the most recently designed heavy cruisers provided steam at 300&amp;nbsp;psi and {{convert|572|F|C}}.&lt;ref name=Whitley291/&gt;}} To meet the design requirement of 27&amp;nbsp;knots, the engine system was originally designed to supply 115,000&amp;nbsp;[[shaft horsepower]] (shp), but the new technologies increased this output to 121,000&amp;nbsp;shp. Despite this increase, the maximum speed for the ships did not change, since the modifications to the powerplant were incorporated later in the design process. The turbines that had already been installed could not fully take advantage of the higher pressure and temperature steam, and so the level of efficiency was not as high as it should have been. When going astern, the engines provided 32,000&amp;nbsp;shp.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D65&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitley291&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 291&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No.2 machinery space of USS North Carolina (BB-55) during construction.jpg|220px|thumb|left|''North Carolina'''s No.&amp;nbsp;2 machinery space under construction, seen from the port side of the ship on 16 January 1939; the No.&amp;nbsp;4 boiler has just been installed|alt=A cavernous steel room, with two large rectangular boilers inside; a number of men are working on the machines.]]
The engine system was divided into four engine rooms, all on the centerline. Each room contained a turbine and two boilers, without any division between the boilers and turbines. This was done to limit the risk of capsizing should the ship sustain heavy flooding in the engine rooms. The engine rooms alternated in their layout: the first and third engine rooms were arranged with the turbine on the starboard side and its corresponding boilers on the port, this was reversed in the second and fourth rooms. The forward-most engine room powered the starboard outer shaft, the second turbine drove the outer screw on the port side, the third engine supplied power to the inner starboard propeller, and the fourth turbine drove the port-side inner screw. All four screws had four blades; the two outer propellers were 15&amp;nbsp;ft 4&amp;nbsp;in (4.674&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter and the inner pair were 16&amp;nbsp;ft 7.5&amp;nbsp;in (5.067&amp;nbsp;m) wide. Steering was controlled by a pair of rudders.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D65&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitley291/&gt;

At the time of their commissioning, the ships had a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h}}, though by 1945, with the addition of other equipment, such as anti-aircraft weaponry, their maximum speed was reduced to {{convert|26.8|kn|mph km/h}}. The increases in weight also reduced the ships' cruising range. In 1941, the ships could steam for {{convert|17450|nmi|lk=in}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}}; by 1945, the range at that speed was reduced to {{convert|16320|nmi|abbr=on}}. At {{convert|25|kn|mph km/h}}, the range was considerably lower, at {{convert|5740|nmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D65&quot;/&gt;

Electrical power was supplied by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250&amp;nbsp;kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850&amp;nbsp;kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200&amp;nbsp;kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total electrical output was 8,400&amp;nbsp;kilowatts, not including the emergency generators, at 450&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s on an [[alternating current]].&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D65&quot;/&gt;

=== Armor ===
[[File:USS Washington (BB-56) turret installation.jpg|thumb|right|upright|One of ''Washington''{{'}}s main [[gun turret]]s is installed upon the ship; note how thick the [[barbette]] is, ranging from {{convert|11.5|to(-)|16|in|mm}}|alt=A large object is being maneuvered by crane into a large metal circle]]
''North Carolina'' and ''Washington'' incorporated &quot;[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]&quot; armor which weighed 41% of the total displacement; it consisted of an &quot;armored raft&quot; that extended from just forward of the first gun turret to just aft of the rear gun turret.&lt;!--Garzke &amp; Dulin 53, Whitley290--&gt; They had a main [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} thick amidships, inclined at 15°, and backed by {{convert|0.75|in|mm|adj=on}} Special Treatment Steel (STS). This tapered down to {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} on the lower edge of the belt.&lt;!--ref Garzke &amp; Dulin 64--&gt; The ships had three armored decks; the main deck was {{convert|1.45|in|mm|adj=on}} thick, the second, thickest deck was {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}}, and the third and thinnest deck was {{convert|0.62|in|mm|adj=on}} thick. The first deck was designed to cause delay-fuzed projectiles to detonate, while the thicker second belt would protect the ships' internals. The third deck was intended to protect against shell splinters that might have penetrated the second deck; it also acted as the upper support for the [[torpedo bulkhead]]s. The [[conning tower]] was connected to the armored citadel by a {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} thick communications tube. Armor thickness for the conning tower itself ranged from {{convert|16|in|mm}} on both sides to {{convert|14.7|in|mm}} on the front and rear. The roof was {{convert|7|in|mm}} thick and the bottom was {{convert|3.9|in|mm}} thick.&lt;!--ref Garzke and Dulin 53--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 52–53, 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitley290&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The main battery turrets were heavily armored: the turret faces were {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} thick, the sides were {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on}} thick, the rear sides were {{convert|11.8|in|mm|adj=on}} thick, and the roofs were {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} thick. {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} armor was the maximum width factories were able to produce at the time of the ships' design; by 1939, however, it was possible to create 18&amp;nbsp;in-thick plates. These were not installed because it was estimated that the conversion would delay completion of the ships by 6 to 8 months. The [[barbette]]s that held the turrets were also strongly protected. The front portion was {{convert|14.7|in|mm}}, the sides increased to {{convert|16|in|mm}}, and the rear portion reduced to {{convert|11.5|in|mm|adj=on}}. The 5-inch gun turrets, along with their ammunition magazines, were armored with {{convert|1.95|in|mm|adj=on}} STS plates.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The side protection system incorporated five compartments divided by [[torpedo bulkhead]]s and a large [[anti-torpedo bulge]] that ran the length of the &quot;armored raft&quot;. The outer two compartments, the innermost compartment and the bulge would remain empty, while the third and fourth compartments would be filled with liquid. The system was reduced in depth at either end by the forward and rear gun turrets. In these areas, the fifth compartment was deleted; instead, there was an outer empty compartment and two liquid-filled spaces, backed by another empty compartment. To compensate for the reduced underwater protection system, these sections received additional armor plating, up to {{convert|3.75|in|mm|adj=on}} in thickness. The complete system was designed to withstand warheads of up to {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Underwater protection was rounded out by a triple bottom that was {{convert|5.75|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep. The bottom layer was {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick and was kept filled with fluid, while the upper {{convert|2.75|ft|m|adj=on}} thick layer was kept empty. The triple bottom was also heavily subdivided to prevent catastrophic flooding should the upper layer be penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===
Two ships, each to cost about [[United States dollar|$]]50&amp;nbsp;million, were authorized in January 1937. Five shipyards submitted bids to build one of the two planned ships. Three were privately run corporations: [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Shipbuilding]], [[New York Shipbuilding]] and [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]]. The other two, the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|New York Naval Shipyard]] and [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], were run by the government. When bids were reviewed, the privately run shipyards' submissions ranged from $46 to 50&amp;nbsp;million, while their government counterparts came in at $37&amp;nbsp;million. Newport News was unique among these in refusing any fixed monetary value in favor of a &quot;cost-plus {{frac|3|1|2}}%&quot; price, but this led to the rejection of their bid out of hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Muir, &quot;Gun Calibers and Battle Zones,&quot; 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The bids from private companies were heavily influenced by the legislation of the [[New Deal]]. The [[Carl Vinson|Vinson-Trammell Act]] limited profit from a ship's construction to 10&amp;nbsp;percent, while the [[Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act]] specified a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]] and required working conditions for workers. The latter act greatly affected the ability of the navy to acquire steel, as the text of the law caused friction between executives in the industry, who greatly disliked the forty-hour work week and minimum wage requirements, and their workers—who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers, the [[American Federation of Labor]], against the union of the unskilled, the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]]. Amid the unrest, the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18&amp;nbsp;million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;McBride, &quot;The Unstable Dynamics of a Strategic Technology,&quot; 417–418&lt;/ref&gt;

The private shipyards, however, had their own labor problems, so much so that one author described the navy's issues as &quot;minimal&quot; compared to their shipbuilding counterparts. This increased the price of the battleships to $60&amp;nbsp;million each, so the [[Bureau of Steam Engineering]] and [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] recommended to their superiors that the $37&amp;nbsp;million tenders from the two navy yards be accepted. This was confirmed by Roosevelt, as the private shipyards' bids were seen as unjustly inflated. The contracts for ''North Carolina'' and ''Washington''—names had been officially chosen on 3 May 1937—were sent to the New York and Philadelphia yards, respectively, on 24 June 1937. Shortly after this announcement, Roosevelt was bombarded with heavy lobbying from citizens and politicians from [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] and the state of New Jersey, in an ultimately futile attempt to have the construction of ''North Carolina'' shifted to Camden's New York Shipbuilding; such a contract would keep many men employed in that area. Roosevelt refused, saying that the disparity in price was too great. Instead, the company was awarded two [[destroyer tender]]s in December 1937, {{USS|Dixie|AD-14|2}} and {{USS|Prairie|AD-15|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Construction of the ''North Carolina'' class was slowed by the aforementioned material issues, the changes made to the basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the [[slipway]]s already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding and an increase in the time of construction made it impractical.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D35&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 35&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''North Carolina'' ===
{{USS|North Carolina|BB-55}} was laid down on 27 October 1937, the first battleship begun by the United States since the never-completed {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|4}} of the early 1920s. Although ''North Carolina'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 13&amp;nbsp;June 1940 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 9 April 1941,&lt;!--refDANFS--&gt; it did not go on active duty because of acute longitudinal vibrations from its [[propeller shaft]]s. A problem shared with its sister ''Washington'' and some other ships like {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}, it was only cured after different propellers were tested aboard ''North Carolina'', including four-bladed and cut-down versions of the original three-bladed. This testing required it to be at sea, and the many resulting trips out of [[New York Harbor]] to the Atlantic Ocean caused it to be [[nickname]]d &quot;The [[Showboat]]&quot;.&lt;!--refFriedman--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D35&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;&gt;&quot;''North Carolina''&quot; in the ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman274-275&quot;&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCMiramar&quot;&gt;&quot;6112175&quot; in the ''Miramar Ship Index''&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[shakedown cruise]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and participation in war exercises, ''North Carolina'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] ''en route'' to the [[Pacific War]]. Joining [[Task Force 16|Task Force (TF) 16]], the battleship escorted the aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}} during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|invasions of Guadalcanal]] and [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo|Tulagi]] on 7&amp;nbsp;August 1942, and continued to accompany the carrier when it moved to be southeast of the Solomons. The [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] began when Japanese carriers were spotted on 24 August; although American planes were able to strike first by sinking the [[light carrier]] {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūjō||2}}, a strike group from a different force, formed around the fleet carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}, attacked TF 16. In an intense eight-minute battle, ''North Carolina'' shot down 7–14 aircraft and was relatively undamaged, though there were seven near-misses and one crewman was killed by [[strafing]]. ''Enterprise'' took three bomb hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Torpedo damage on USS North Carolina (BB-55), .October 1942.jpg|left|thumb|240px|{{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-15||2}}{{'}}s torpedo opened a gaping hole in ''North Carolina''{{'}}s hull|alt=The explosive force tore and dished in the steel side plating. A wooden scaffold has been erected to the right for repair work.]]
''North Carolina'' then joined the carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}{{'}}s screen, and protected it while support was rendered to American troops fighting on Guadalcanal. Although it dodged one torpedo on 6&amp;nbsp;September, it was not able to avoid another on the 15th.&lt;!--refDANFS, Friedman277, G&amp;D38 --&gt; Out of a six-torpedo salvo from a Japanese submarine, three hit the carrier {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}}, one hit {{USS|O'Brien|DD-415|2}}, one missed, and one struck ''North Carolina''.&lt;!--refWhitley294--&gt; A {{convert|660|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[warhead]]&lt;!--refFriedman--&gt; hit on the port side {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the [[waterline]] at a point that was just behind the number one turret.&lt;!--refDANFS--&gt; It created a 32&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;18 ft (9.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;5.5&amp;nbsp;m) hole, allowed about {{convert|970|LT|t|abbr=on}} of water into the ship—which had to be offset with counter-flooding, meaning that another {{convert|480|LT|t|abbr=on}} entered—killed five men, and wounded twenty.&lt;!--ref Friedman and G&amp;D38--&gt; Although ''North Carolina'' could steam at {{convert|24|kn|mph km/h}} soon after the explosion, it was later forced to slow to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} to ensure that temporary [[shoring]] did not fail. Structural damage beneath the first turret rendered it unable to fire unless in absolute need, and the main search [[radar]] failed. As this was the first torpedo to strike a modern American battleship, it elicited a large amount of interest from various officers and bureaus within the navy. It was seen as a vindication by some who believed that too much had been sacrificed in the design of the ships—the torpedo defense system had come close to breaking near one of the most important areas of the ship (a magazine), after all—and the General Board called for the fifth and sixth {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|1}}s, {{USS|Illinois|BB-65|2}} and {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66|2}}, to have a [[torpedo bulge]] added outside its magazines. However, the new [[Bureau of Ships]] opposed this on the basis that the system performed as it was supposed to; in any case, no modifications were made.&lt;!--refFriedman--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 277 and 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 35, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitley293-294&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 293–294&lt;/ref&gt;

Repaired and refitted at the facilities in [[Pearl Harbor]], ''North Carolina'' operated as a carrier escort for ''Enterprise'' and ''Saratoga'' for the remainder of 1942 and the majority of 1943 while they provided cover for supply and troop movements in the Solomons. In between, it received advanced [[Fire-control system|fire control]] and radar gear in March, April and September 1943 at Pearl Harbor. In November, ''North Carolina'' escorted ''Enterprise'' while the carrier launched strikes upon [[Makin Atoll|Makin]], [[Tarawa]] and [[Abemama]]. On 1–8 December it bombarded [[Nauru]] before returning to carrier screening; it accompanied {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2}} while that carrier launched attacks on [[Kavieng]] and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D39&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining [[Fast Carrier Task Force|Task Force 58]] in January 1944, ''North Carolina'' escorted aircraft carriers as the [[flagship]] of Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]] for much of the year, providing support for airborne strikes on [[Kwajalein]], [[Roi-Namur|Namur]], [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] (twice), [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], [[Guam]], [[Palau]], [[Woleai]], and [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] in January–April. Also in April, ''North Carolina'' destroyed defensive installations on [[Pohnpei|Ponape]] before setting course for Pearl Harbor for repairs to a damaged rudder. With repairs completed, the battleship joined with ''Enterprise'' on 6 June for assaults within the [[Marianas]]; as part of these, ''North Carolina'' used its main battery to bombard Saipan and [[Tanapag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D39&quot;/&gt;

In late June, ''North Carolina'' was one of the American ships which took part in the so-called &quot;[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Marianas Turkey Shoot]]&quot;, where a majority of attacking Japanese aircraft were shot down out of the air at little cost to the American defenders. Problems with its propeller shafts then caused the battleship to sail to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] to receive an [[wikt:overhaul|overhaul]]. It returned to active duty in November and to its carrier escort tasks in time to be hit by a typhoon. ''North Carolina'' protected carriers while they provided air cover for invasion fleets and launched attacks on [[Leyte]], [[Luzon]], and the [[Visayas]]. Surviving [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|another typhoon]], one which sank three [[destroyer]]s, ''North Carolina'' continued escort duty when naval aircraft struck [[Formosa]], [[Indo-China]], China, the [[Ryukyus]] and [[Honshu]] in January and February 1945. During the [[invasion of Iwo Jima]], the battleship provided bombardment support for troops ashore.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[invasion of Okinawa|assault on Okinawa]], ''North Carolina'' screened carriers and bombarded targets ashore. Although it was able to shoot down three [[kamikaze]]s on 6 April, it also was struck by a {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} shell during that time in a [[friendly fire]] incident; three were killed and forty-four injured. The battleship shot down a plane on the 7th and two on the 17th. After receiving another overhaul from 9 May to 28 June, this one in the naval yard at Pearl Harbor, ''North Carolina'' operated as both a carrier escort and shore bombardier for the remainder of the war. Of note was a [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|17 July bombardment]] of the industrial area in [[Hitachi, Ibaraki]] in company with fellow battleships {{USS|Alabama|BB-60|2}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}} and {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, along with smaller warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D40&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, members of ''North Carolina''{{'}}s crew and [[United States Marines|Marine]] contingent were sent ashore to assist in [[Occupation of Japan|occupying Japan]]. After the [[surrender of Japan|official surrender]], these men were brought back aboard and the battleship sailed to Okinawa. As part of [[Operation Magic Carpet|Operation &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;]], soldiers were embarked to be returned to the United States. Passing through the locks of Panama Canal on 8 October, it weighed anchor in [[Boston]] on the 17th. After an overhaul in the New York Naval Yard, it participated in exercises off [[New England]] before beginning a [[midshipman]] training cruise in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;

''North Carolina'' was [[ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]] on 27 June 1947; it remained in the [[reserve fleet]] in until 1 June 1960, when it was [[wikt:struck|struck]] from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. Instead of the scrapping that faced most of the United States' battleships, ''North Carolina'' was sold to the [[North Carolina|state of North Carolina]] for $250,000 on 8 August 1961 to be a [[museum ship]]. it was dedicated in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] on 29 April 1962 as a [[memorial]] to the citizens of the state who died in the Second World War. Listed on the United States' [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 1 January 1986, it remains there today, maintained by the USS ''North Carolina'' Battleship Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCNVR&quot;&gt;&quot;''North Carolina''&quot; in the Naval Vessel Register.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

{{USS|Washington|BB-56}} was laid down on 14 June 1938, launched on 1 June 1940 and commissioned on 15 May 1941 at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]]. Although commissioned, its engine had not been run at full power—like its sister, ''Washington'' had major problems with longitudinal vibrations, which were only tempered after many tests conducted aboard ''North Carolina''. The fixes made it possible to run [[builder's trials]], which ''Washington'' did on 3 August 1941; loaded at about {{convert|44400|LT|t|abbr=on}}, the propulsion plant was run up to 123,850&amp;nbsp;shp, and repeated the performance again in February 1942, achieving 127,100 and 121,000&amp;nbsp;shp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman274-275&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;&gt;&quot;''Washington''&quot; in the ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D41&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 41&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942 Rear Admiral [[John W. Wilcox, Jr.|John W. Wilcox]] chose ''Washington'' as the flagship of [[Task Force 39]]. On 26 March 1942, ''Washington'', along with {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}}, {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|2}}, {{USS|Tuscaloosa|CA-37|2}} and various smaller ships, sailed to bolster the British [[Home Fleet]]. During the voyage, Wilcox fell into the ocean; he was seen soon after by the destroyer {{USS|Wilson|DD-408|2}}, face down in the water, but due to rough seas was unable to retrieve the body. It is not known what exactly happened; he could have simply been caught by a wave and washed overboard, but there has been speculation that he suffered a heart attack. The force reached the main anchorage of the Home Fleet, [[Scapa Flow]], on 4 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley295&quot;&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 295&lt;/ref&gt;

''Washington'' and the other ships of TF&amp;nbsp;39 participated in exercises with the Home Fleet until late April. Along with certain British units, the task force departed the British Isles as TF&amp;nbsp;99. They escorted some of the Arctic convoys which were carrying vital cargo to the Soviet Union. While carrying out this duty, an accompanying British battleship, {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, accidentally rammed a destroyer, cutting it in two. Directly behind ''King George V'', ''Washington'' passed through the same stretch of sea and received damage from exploding [[depth charge]]s. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on board the ship were damaged, including main battery range finders, circuit breakers, three fire-control and the search radars. The American ships then put in at an Icelandic port, [[Hvalfjörður]], until 15 May; they returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June. On 4 June, ''Washington'' hosted the commander of naval forces in Europe, Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark]], who set up a temporary headquarters on the ship for the next few days. On 7 June, [[King George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] of the United Kingdom inspected the battleship.&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley295&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 41 and 44&lt;/ref&gt;

''Washington'' left the North Sea bound for the United States on 14 July with an escort of four destroyers; upon arrival at the New York Naval Yard on the 23rd, it was given a full overhaul which took a month to be completed. it set sail for the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean on 23 August and reached its destination, [[Tongatapu|Tonga Island]], on 14 September, where it became the flagship of Admiral [[Willis Augustus Lee|Willis &quot;Ching&quot; Lee]]. Over the coming months, ''Washington'' would be focused upon the safe arrival of supply convoys to the men fighting on Guadalcanal. On 13 November, three formations of Japanese ships were discovered on course for Guadalcanal, one of them aiming to bombard Henderson Field while night gave them protection from aircraft. The first Japanese bombardment force was [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, November 13|driven back]] by an American cruiser-destroyer force. On 14 November, the Japanese organized another sortie to neutralize the airfield. ''Washington'', {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}}, and four destroyers were sent to [[Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|intercept the Japanese force]] that night. The Japanese, composed of the [[fast battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}, two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and nine destroyers, initially sank three US destroyers and inflicted significant topside damage to ''South Dakota''. However, ''Washington'' remained undetected and at midnight fired on ''Kirishima'' from {{convert|5800|yd|m}}, point blank range for ''Washington's'' 16-inch/45-caliber guns.&lt;ref name=schom424&gt;Schom, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; ''Washington'' fired seventy-five 16-inch and one hundred and seven 5-inch rounds during the melee, scoring 20 main and seventeen secondary battery hits, knocking out its steering and main battery and causing uncontrollable progressive flooding.&lt;ref name=Lundgren&gt;{{cite web|last1= Lundgren|first1= Robert| title = Kirishima Damage Analysis| url = http://www.navweaps.com/index_lundgren/Kirishima_Damage_Analysis.pdf| website = www.navweapons.com| publisher= The Naval Technical Board| accessdate = 20 September 2015 |pages=5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kirishima'' capsized at 03:25 on the morning of 15 November 1942, with 212 crewmen lost.&lt;ref name=stille20&gt;Stille, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Radar-directed fire from ''Washington's'' secondary battery also damaged destroyer ''[[Japanese destroyer Ayanami (1929)|Ayanami]]'' so severely it had to be scuttled. Soon after the battle, the Japanese began evacuating Guadalcanal.&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley296&quot;&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Until April 1943, ''Washington'' stayed near its base in [[New Caledonia]], providing protection for convoys and battle groups that were supporting the [[Solomons campaign]]. Returning to Pearl Harbor, it practiced for battle and underwent an overhaul before returning to the combat zone in late July. From August to the end of October, ''Washington'' operated out of [[Efate]]. it then joined with four battleships and six destroyers as [[Task Group|Task Group (TG)]]&amp;nbsp;53.2 for exercises; ''Enterprise'', {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}} and {{USS|Independence|CV-22|2}} also participated. TG&amp;nbsp;52.2 then voyaged to the [[Gilbert Islands]] to add additional firepower to the strikes currently hitting them. Departing in late November, ''Washington'' steamed to first [[Makin (islands)|Makin]] to provide protection for ships there, then [[Banaba Island|Ocean Island]] to prepare to bombard [[Nauru]] with its sister ''North Carolina'', all four {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1939)|0}} battleships, and the carriers {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2}} and {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26|2}}. All of the capital ships struck before dawn on 8 December; the aircraft carriers struck again soon after. The ships then sailed back to Efate, arriving on 12 December. On [[Christmas]], ''Washington'', ''North Carolina'', and four destroyers left Efate for gunnery practice. By late January, it was made part of TG&amp;nbsp;50.1 to escort the fast carriers in that group as they launched strikes on [[Taroa]] and [[Kwajalein]]. it also moved in to hit Kwajalein with its guns on 30 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D46&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 46&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller warship is visible in the distance.]]
Before [[dawn]] on 1 February, with the sky still shrouded in darkness, ''Washington'' collided with {{USS|Indiana|BB-58|2}} when the latter left formation to fuel four destroyers. ''Indiana'' had radioed that it was going to make a turn to port out of the formation, but soon after starting the turn, its captain ordered a reversal, back to starboard. About seven minutes later, it came into view of lookouts aboard ''Washington'' at a range of {{convert|1000|yd|ft m|abbr=on}}. Although crews on both ships frantically tried to avoid the other, it was to no avail; ''Washington'' gave ''Indiana'' a glancing blow, scraping down a large aft portion of the ship's starboard side. ''Washington''{{'}}s fore end was severely damaged, with about {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} of its bow hanging down and into the water. Ten men, six from ''Washington'', were killed or listed as missing. After temporary reinforcements to the damaged section, it was forced to sail to Pearl Harbor to be fitted with a [[false bow]] to make possible a voyage to Puget Sound. Once there, it received a full overhaul, along with a new bow; this work lasted from March until April. ''Washington'' did not enter the war zone again until late May.&lt;ref name=&quot;friedman277&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D46&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marshall Islands Campaign,&quot; Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/ref&gt;

''Washington'' next participated in the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], serving again as a carrier escort ship, though it was detached on the 13th to fire on Japanese positions on [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]]. With the sortie of a majority of the remaining ships in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] spotted by American submarines, ''Washington'', along with six other battleships, four heavy cruisers and fourteen destroyers covered the aircraft carriers of [[Task Force 58|TF&amp;nbsp;58]]; on the 19th, with the attack of many aircraft, the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] began. Able to beat off the attacks, ''Washington'' refueled and continued escorting carriers until she, with three battleships and escorts, formed a new task group. After a lengthy stop at [[Enewetak Atoll]], it supported troops assaulting [[Peleliu]] and [[Angaur]] before returning to screening duties. This duty lasted from 10 October to 17 February 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D47&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, ''United States Battleships'', 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The battleship bombarded Iwo Jima from 19–22 February in support of the invasion there before escorting carriers which sent aircraft raids against Tokyo and targets on the island of [[Kyūshū]]. On 24 March and 19 April, ''Washington'' bombarded Okinawa; it then departed for Puget Sound to receive a refit, having been in action for the majority of the time since its refit in March–April 1944. This lasted through [[V-J Day]] and the subsequent formal ceremony aboard {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, so ''Washington'' received orders to voyage to Philadelphia, where it arrived on 17 October. Here it was modified to have an additional 145 bunks, so that it could participate in [[Operation Magic Carpet]]. Sailing to [[Southampton]] with a reduced crew of 84&amp;nbsp;officers and 835&amp;nbsp;crew, it brought 185&amp;nbsp;army officers and 1,479&amp;nbsp;enlisted men back to the United States; this was the only voyage it would make in support of the operation. The battleship was placed into reserve at Bayonne, New Jersey on 27 June 1947, after only a little more than six years of service. ''Washington'' was never reactivated. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960—exactly 21 years to the day since its launch—she was sold on 24 May 1961 to be [[ship breaking|scrapped]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WANVR&quot;&gt;&quot;''Washington''&quot; in the Naval Vessel Register&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D47&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAMiramar&quot;&gt;&quot;6112726&quot; in the ''Miramar Ship Index''&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|While the official ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' entry on ''Washington'' and Garzke and Dulin's ''United States Battleships'' state that the ship was sold on 24 May 1961, the [[Naval Vessel Register]] and the Miramar Ship Index give a date of 6 June 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;WANVR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washdanfs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D47&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAMiramar&quot;/&gt;}}

== Post-war alterations and proposals ==
[[File:USS Washington (BB-56) in Puget Sound, 10 September 1945.jpg|240px|thumb|right|''Washington'' steaming at high speed in [[Puget Sound]] during post-overhaul trials, 10 September 1945|alt=A large gray warship plows through the sea, creating a large frothy wake.]]
''North Carolina'' and ''Washington'' remained in active duty in the years immediately after the war, possibly because they were more comfortable and less cramped than the four ''South Dakota''s. The ships received alterations during this period; the [[Ship Characteristics Board]]&amp;nbsp;(SCB) directed in June 1946 that four of the quadruple-mounted 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns be removed, though only two were actually taken off each ship. The 20&amp;nbsp;mm weapons were also reduced at some point so that both ships were decommissioned with sixteen twin mounts. ''North Carolina'' and ''Washington'' were decommissioned on 27 June 1947 and subsequently moved to the [[reserve fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 389–390, 421&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1954, SCB created a class improvement plan for the ''North Carolina''s which included twenty-four [[3&quot;/50 caliber gun|3&amp;nbsp;in/50]] guns directed by six [[Ship Gun Fire Control Systems#MK 56 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS)|Mark&amp;nbsp;56s]]. A month later, the SCB chairman voiced his belief that the ''North Carolina''s and ''South Dakota''s would be excellent additions to task forces—if they could be faster. The Bureau of Ships then considered and discarded designs that would move these ships at {{convert|31|kn|mph km/h}}, four knots faster than their current attainable speed. In order for a ''North Carolina'' to obtain 31&amp;nbsp;knots, 240,000&amp;nbsp;[[shaft horsepower]] (shp) would be required. This, in turn, would necessitate the installation of an extremely large power plant, one which would not fit into the ship even if the third turret was removed. If the outer external [[belt armor]] were removed, 216,000&amp;nbsp;shp would still be required. However, no matter if the belt was taken off or not, all of the hull form aft would have to be greatly modified to accept larger propellers. The last strike against the project was the high estimated cost of $40&amp;nbsp;million—which did not include the cost of activating battleships that had been out of commission for ten years.&lt;ref name=Friedman397&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 397&lt;/ref&gt;

Later calculations proved that the ''North Carolina''s could be lightened from 44,377 to around {{convert|40541|LT|t|abbr=on}}, at which 210,000&amp;nbsp;shp would suffice. At the trial displacement figure of {{convert|38400|LT|t|abbr=on}}, even 186,000&amp;nbsp;shp would be enough; the 210,000 figure was derived from a 12.5% overestimation to account for a [[Foul (nautical)|fouled bottom]] or bad weather. A similar power plant to the one used in the ''Iowa'' class (generating 212,000&amp;nbsp;shaft horsepower) would be enough, and if the third turret was removed there would be no problems with weight, but there was not enough space within the ''North Carolina''s. When compared, the current power plant measured 176&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;70&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;24, but the ''Iowa''{{'}}s was 256&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;72&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;26. Lastly, there would be an issue with the propellers; the ''Iowa'' class' were {{convert|19|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, while the ''North Carolina''{{'}}s were {{convert|17|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In the end, no conversions were undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 397–398&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs for [[helicopter carrier]]s also contained a plan for a conversion of the ''North Carolina''s. At a cost of $30,790,000, the ships would have been able to embark 28 helicopters, 1,880 troops, {{convert|530|LT|t|abbr=on}} of cargo and {{convert|200000|USgal|L|abbr=on}} of oil. All of the 16-inch and 5-inch guns would have been removed, though the number one turret would have remained so that weights added on the stern half of the ship could be balanced. In place, the ships would have received sixteen 3-inch guns in twin mounts. Displacement would be lowered slightly to a fully loaded weight of about {{convert|41930|LT|t|abbr=on}}, while speed would not have changed. It was estimated that the ships could serve for about fifteen to twenty years at a cost of about $440,000 a year for maintenance. However, it was found that a purpose-built helicopter carrier would be more economical, so the plans were shelved.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 401&lt;/ref&gt;
