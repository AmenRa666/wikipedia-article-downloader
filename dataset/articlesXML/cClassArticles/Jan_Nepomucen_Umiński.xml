'''Jan Nepomucen Umiński''' of [[Cholewa coat of arms|Cholewa]] (1778-1851) was a [[Poland|Polish]] military officer and a [[generał brygady|brigadier general]] of the [[Army of the Duchy of Warsaw]]. A veteran of the [[Kościuszko Uprising]], [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[November Uprising]], he died in exile in [[Wiesbaden]].

== Biography ==

=== Napoleonic period ===
Jan Nepomucen Umiński was born to a [[szlachta|Polish gentry]] family in [[Czeluścin, Gostyń County|Czeluścin]] in [[Greater Poland]] on 5 February 1778.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;&gt;Umiński, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Army of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Republic of Poland]] early in his life and took part in the failed [[Kościuszko Uprising]] of 1794 as an [[adjutant]] to General [[Antoni Madaliński]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; Following the Polish defeat, he escaped Russian-held Poland and briefly settled in [[Dresden]], where he served as an emissary of the Society of Polish Republicans and General [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt;

When [[Napoleonic Wars]] started he joined the French and took part in the fights of the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; notably the [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|1807 siege of Danzig]] and the [[battle of Tczew]]. Taken captive by the Prussians, he was set free after the armistice and joined the French cavalry, where he quickly rose to the rank of Major. He was soon transferred to the [[Army of the Duchy of Warsaw]], where he served in [[Poznań]] as the commanding officer of a cavalry honour guard squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; He took part in the brief [[Polish–Austrian War]]; as part of the forces under General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, Umiński took part in, among other battles, the taking of the town of [[Sandomierz]].

In 1812 Umiński took part in [[French invasion of Russia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; where he fought [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|at Smolensk]] and the [[Battle of Borodino]]. His unit of [[hussars]] was the first to enter the city of [[Moscow]]. Following Borodino, in the [[Battle of Mozhaysk]], he was promoted to the post of a brigade commanding officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; After the French retreat and the subsequent Russian capture of Poland, Umiński remained loyal to Napoleon and remained in Prince [[Józef Poniatowski]]'s corps, with which he took part in the disastrous [[Battle of Nations]]. Wounded, he was taken prisoner of war but was released by the coalition forces in 1815.

=== Imprisonment, escape and the November Uprising ===
He returned to the newly established [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and joined [[Army of Congress Poland|its armed forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; On 20 January 1815 he became the commanding officer of the 1st Mounted Rifles Regiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; However, already in December of that year he retired,&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; and settled in his family estate of [[Smolice, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Smolice]] and Czeluścin in Prussian-held Greater Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-3&quot;&gt;Umiński, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; A founder of a secret patriotic Scythemen Association, soon he joined [[Walerian Łukasiński]]'s [[National Patriotic Society|Patriotic Society]]. Under close observation by Prussian secret police, Umiński was considered an &quot;incorrigible traitor of the state&quot; and &quot;zealous and criminal [[chauvinism|chauvinist]] due to his earlier involvements in Polish patriotic uprisings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-37&quot;&gt;Umiński, pp. 3 and 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, his activities remained unknown to the Prussians for some time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-3&quot;/&gt;

His situation became much more complicated after the Russians had arrested Walerian Łukasiński and his closest associates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-4&quot;&gt;Umiński, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Denounced to Prussian authorities by Łukasiński and [[Ignacy Prądzyński]], he was finally arrested in 1826, together with Count [[Maciej Mielżyński]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-4&quot;/&gt; Despite protests by the youth of Poznań and other towns of the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-56&quot;&gt;Umiński, pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Umiński was charged with high treason and conspiracy, and sentenced to 6 years in a prison in [[Głogów|Glogau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1-8&quot;&gt;Umiński, pp. 1 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; His village of Czeluścin was confiscated by Prussian authorities and sold to a new owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-9&quot;&gt;Umiński, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[November Uprising]] broke out, Umiński's situation became more complicated. Already in mail contact with various factions throughout Europe, he was put under closer surveillance by the Prussian authorities. In front of his cell two guards were posted at all times, and an officer was stationed in his cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-10-11&quot;&gt;Umiński, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the discipline within the fortress was lacking, on 17 February 1831 Umiński organised in his cell a party for numerous officers stationed in the fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-10-11&quot;/&gt; When at 20:00 the gates of the fortress were closed, it turned out that Umiński had escaped, leaving a group of drunk German officers behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-10-11&quot;/&gt; [[Eduard Heinrich von Flottwell]] ordered a complete blockade of all major roads leading towards Poland and dispatched hundreds of patrols in search of the fugitive, but the pursuit proved fruitless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-10-11&quot;/&gt; Umiński had a relay of horses and assistants organised for him. Through [[Siedlnica]], [[Książęcy Las]] (where Prince [[Antoni Paweł Sułkowski|Antoni Sułkowski]] provided him with money), [[Rawicz]], [[Chwałkowo, Gostyń County|Chwałkowo]], [[Konary, Rawicz County|Konary]], [[Grąbkowo, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Grąbkowo]] and [[Rusko, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Rusko]] reached the Polish border.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-10-11&quot;/&gt; In the afternoon of 18 February Umiński arrived to [[Kalisz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-10-11&quot;/&gt; Despite a lengthy investigation, the Prussian authorities never learned of the true extent of the conspiracy that made Umiński's escape possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-13&quot;&gt;Umiński, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 1831 Umiński rejoined the Polish Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; Initially in the rank of an ordinary soldier, Umiński took part in the [[First Battle of Wawer]] and the bloody [[Battle of Olszynka Grochowska]]. Soon he was discovered by his former colleague, General [[Henryk Dembiński]], who promoted him to a Colonel, then a Division General, and gave him command over the I Cavalry Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; His Corps took part in the [[Battle of Jędrzejów|battles of Jędrzejów]] and the [[Battle of Ostrołęka (1831)|Battle of Ostrołęka]], one of the bloodiest battles of the uprising, plagued by indecisiveness and bad command decisions on the side of the Polish Commander-in-Chief General [[Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki]]. Critical of his superiors, Umiński nevertheless remained in the army until the very end of the uprising, taking part in the lengthy [[Battle of Warsaw (1831)|battle of Warsaw]]. Following the Polish defeat, he led the remaining Polish forces to [[Modlin Fortress|Modlin]] and [[Płock]], where on 23 September 1831 he was nominated to the post of the Polish Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; Opposed by many generals, he held it for only a single day and ceded his duties to General [[Maciej Rybiński]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt;

After the fall of Poland, Umiński went into exile in [[Paris]]. A close associate to Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], he was one of the founders of the [[Literary Society of Paris]], one of the most important Polish cultural and scientific associations of the 19th century. He then moved to [[Wiesbaden]] in Germany, where he died on 15 June 1851.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uminski-1&quot;/&gt; He is a patron of streets and schools in numerous towns, as well as the 5th Reconnaissance Battalion of the [[Polish Army]].
