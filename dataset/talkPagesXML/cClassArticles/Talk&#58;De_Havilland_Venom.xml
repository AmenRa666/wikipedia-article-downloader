== Uncertain ==
Uncertain why No. 60 Squadron under RNZAF heading - the RNZAF has never had a 60 Squadron.  Can anyone clarify this?

:I have no idea why and i've now deleted it. Thanks! [[User:SoLando|SoLando]] ([[User talk:SoLando|Talk]]) 11:56, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

== Aquilon? ==

The page has two translations for the French 'Aquilon' license-name. (North Wind and Sea Eagle) Someone who knows french language could confirm either one?

:Only given as the Sea Eagle by Gunston, fixed and referenced. [[User:Nimbus227|Nimbus227]] ([[User talk:Nimbus227|talk]]) 19:28, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

== Venom photo in opening para ==

Note to bzuk - the photo is a Vampire, whoever owns it! Clues - intakes are too rounded, 'Thick' wing, and lack of tailplane extensions. I will go find a decent picture of a Venom for you, and that can go in! HTH, Bruce  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Brucewgordon|Brucewgordon]] ([[User talk:Brucewgordon|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Brucewgordon|contribs]]) 06:22, 7 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::Bruce, you may be perfectly right, but check the source page for the photo below: [[Image:Vampire F3 restoration.jpg|thumb]]. The photographer has made a note that he is taking a picture of his father's Venom jet. FWIW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] 06:30, 7 October 2007 (UTC).

Yes, I saw that - its not an aircraft I know, but 'looks' like it might be an ex Canada F3 Vampire. Whatever he says, its a Vampire!! Regards, Bruce [[User:Brucewgordon|Brucewgordon]] 06:32, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

:A quick search around and it looks like Vampire F3 registered N6878D to Wings of Flight Incorporated, Rochester, New York (former Canadian 17072). [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] 08:58, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

:: Yes, thats the one I though it was, but was checking my references. Thanks all! [[User:Brucewgordon|Brucewgordon]] 09:49, 8 October 2007 (UTC)
==Not sure what this means==
::''&quot;.....NF 2 night fighter........ To accommodate the necessary two man crew (pilot and navigator/radar operator) it was structurally different – the two crew were positioned side-by-side......&quot;''
But, they were in the Vampire as well. What does this mean?[[User:Moriori|Moriori]] ([[User talk:Moriori|talk]]) 21:57, 21 July 2012 (UTC)
:Not the clearest wording but it means different from the Mark 1 single-seat fighter which was before it. The two-seat Vampires were later I think but I have not got the dates handy. [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] ([[User talk:MilborneOne|talk]]) 22:05, 21 July 2012 (UTC)
::Okay. The first two-seat Venom, the NF 2, was a Vampire NF.10 airframe fitted with an improved wing design. Incidentally, we don't say much about introduction of bang seats on Vampires, single seaters or duals. Maybe someone can oblige. Cheers.

== Terrorists ==
&quot;They also saw much action in the Middle East, supporting operations against terrorists in Aden and Oman, losing some aircraft in the process.&quot; I note that a number of articles which refer to former British colonies speak of &quot;terrorists&quot;. This is a weasel word, particularly in light of the various anti-colonial wars in various colonies. Using aircraft to bomb or strafe could also be called &quot;terrorism&quot;. I would suggest that a more neutral term be found for this. [[User:An Muimhneach Machnamhach|An Muimhneach Machnamhach]] ([[User talk:An Muimhneach Machnamhach|talk]]) 11:03, 25 July 2012 (UTC)

== FB.4 stated with wrong engine ==

Just to mention the FB.4 mentioned in the article is using the wrong engine, the Pilot's Notes state it used the Ghost 103 (along with 2 other sources stating the same), I cannot confirm where the Ghost 105 part came from as I've only found records of it being used on the Sea Venom FAW.22
Here is a clip from the Pilot's Notes, if anyone wants the whole manual please let me know.

[[User:MizunoJames|MizunoJames]] ([[User talk:MizunoJames|talk]]) 18:17, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

Updated the article to reflect the data from the sources above, if anyone has got info on where an FB.4 got a Ghost 105 it would be news to me as not found anything reliable that says it ever had one fitted.
