Palmer 'pulled every string he could to gain a battlefield posting' and in 1944 assumed Command of [[No. 5 Squadron RAAF]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt; The Squadron was operating in Dutch New Guinea&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt; and Palmer flew over 100 sorties in 1944 and 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt;

He was awarded the DFC on [[Bougainville Island|Bouganville]] where he led an operation that destroyed 3 or 4 Japanese tanks in a [[CAC Boomerang]] fighter. The tanks were sighted by a [[New Zealand]] [[Vought F4U Corsair]] pilot which returned to [[Piva Airfield]]. Squadron Leader Palmer then led other Corsairs to the target and directed the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Australia_In_The_War&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Wirraway to complete the work, said a message from R.A.A.F. Headquarters. The Kiwis were led in by Squadron Leader Beau Palmer, of Brisbane, Queensland, in a Wirraway, with Flying Officer F. Meadows, of Mount Lawley, W.A., as observer. They blasted the area with bombs. After the smoke had cleared, Squadron Leader Palmer flew down to observe the damage. To his surprise a hut 60 ft. by 20 ft. had survived the attack, the rest being demolished. He had a phosphorus bomb, usually used to indicate targets, so came down to 50 ft., and let it go as a parting gesture to the Japs. It was a direct hit, the hut immediately catching fire and blazing for 20 minutes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM_5_Sqn&quot;&gt;{{cite web
