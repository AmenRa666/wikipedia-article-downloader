The '''French invasion of Switzerland''' (French: ''Campagne d'Helvétie'', German: ''Franzoseneinfall'') occurred from January until May 1798 as part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. The independent [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] collapsed, both by this foreign invasion and simultaneous internal revolts, termed the &quot;Helvetic Revolution&quot;. Its [[Ancien Régime]] institutions were abolished and replaced by the centralised [[Sister Republic|pro-French]] [[Helvetic Republic]].

== Background ==
Before 1798, the modern region of [[Vaud]] belonged to the [[Canton of Bern]], to which it had a dependent status. Moreover, the majority of Francophone Catholic Vaudese felt oppressed by the German-speaking Protestant majority of Bern. Several Vaudese patriots such as [[Frédéric-César de La Harpe]] advocated for independence. In 1795, La Harpe called on his compatriots to rise up against the Bernese aristocrats, but his appeal fell to deaf ears, and he had to flee to [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]], where he resumed his activism.

In late 1797, French general [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had just successfully [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars#Bonaparte's war|conquered northern Italy]] and founded the [[Cisalpine Republic]], pressed the [[French Directory]] to occupy Switzerland; soon 10,000 troops gathered near the city of [[Genève]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nappey&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nappey |first=Grégoire |date=2012 |title=Swiss History in a Nutshell |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9V4aCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43 |location=Basel |publisher=Bergli Books |page=43 |isbn=9783905252453 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valtellina]], [[Chiavenna]] and [[Bormio]], dependencies of the [[Three Leagues]], revolted and with French support seceded from the Confederacy to join the Cisalpine Republic on 10 October 1797. In December, the southern part of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Basel]] was occupied and annexed to France.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9797.php |title=Helvetische Republik. §1.1 - Die politische Umwälzung |author=Andreas Fankhauser |work=[[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]] |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere inside Switzerland had changed significantly due to these developments, and many pro-French patriots hoped, and anti-French conservatives feared, that the Revolution would now spread to the rest of the Confederacy, with or without direct French military intervention. France used the dissatisfaction of the rural elites in the dependencies and the Enlightened citizenry in the cantons to stimulate revolutionary excitement.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDS&quot;/&gt;

The first event of what would become known as the &quot;Helvetic Revolution&quot; happened with a patriot uprising in [[Liestal]] in the [[Canton of Basel]] on 17 January. The rebels demanded legal equality, erected a [[Liberty pole|liberty tree]] and burnt down three [[Vogt (Switzerland)|Vogtei]] castles by 23 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D17217.php |title=Helvetische Revolution §2. Die Helvetische Revolution vor dem französischen Angriff |author=Andreas Fankhauser |work=Historical Dictionary of Switzerland |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 1798, the urban elite of Vaud proclaimed the Lemanic Republic (French: ''République lémanique'')&lt;ref&gt;The word ''lémanique'' referred to the French name of [[Lake Geneva]], ''Lac Léman''. This followed the practice of Revolutionary France to erase the traditional toponymy of the Ancien Régime, and replace it with natural units such as rivers.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lausanne]], which became its seat of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hug |first1=Lina |last2=Stead |first2=Richard |date=1890 |title=The Story of Switzerland |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=FLcgAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT210 |location=United States |publisher=Library of Alexandria |page=210 |isbn=9781465597243 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, citizens and subjects in countless Swiss cities, cantons and their dependencies rebelled, and after the example of Vaud, more than 40 other short-lived republics were proclaimed in February, March and April throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nappey&quot;/&gt;

== Invasion ==
At the invitation of French-speaking factions in Vaud, 12,000 French troops under general Ménard invaded Vaud on 28 January. An alleged incident, in which French soldiers were killed by Swiss soldiers, was cited as an pretext.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nappey&quot;/&gt; They occupied Vaud without resistance and were cheered on by the population. A second army under general [[Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg|Schauenburg]] advanced from [[Mont-Terrible]], the former [[Prince-Bishopric of Basel]], towards Bern and demanded its government to put pro-French Revolutionary parties in power. The Bernese refusal to do so was used by the French to justify war. On 3 February, the ''Légion fidèle'' or &quot;Loyal Legion&quot; was formed out of French-speaking volunteers from Vaud who wished to stay loyal to Bern and recapture the Lemanic Republic.

[[File:Schlacht bei Neuenegg 1798.jpg|thumb|Contemporary drawing of the battle of Neuenegg, 5 March 1798.]]
There were minor skirmishes on 2–5 March 1798, leading to the swift collapse of the Old Confederacy. On 5 March, the French attained a clear victory in the [[Battle of Grauholz]] over the Bernese forces, confirming Vaud's secession. It led to even more dependencies across Switzerland declaring themselves independent republics. However, the Directory desired a single central republican state at France's eastern border, not dozens of small ones, and steered towards (re)establishment of national unity, though this time with equality for all its subdivisions. A new Constitution had already been written in Paris by [[Peter Ochs]] and approved by the Directory. Many Swiss rebels detested it, and the National Convention in Basel passed a modified version, which was then adopted by many other entities, but the French government insisted on the original. A proposal by Supreme Commander [[Guillaume Brune]] on 16 and 19 March to divide Switzerland into three republics was also overruled; Paris enforced its design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D17217.php |title=Helvetische Revolution §3. Die Entwicklung nach dem französischen Einmarsch |author=Andreas Fankhauser |work=Historical Dictionary of Switzerland |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 1798, 121 cantonal deputies proclaimed the Helvetic Republic, &quot;One and Indivisible&quot;. The new régime abolished cantonal sovereignty and feudal rights. The occupying forces established a centralised state based on the ideas of the [[French Revolution]]. The clashes of April and May represent the last pockets of resistance against the recently established Helvetic Republic. The Nidwalden uprising (''Schreckenstage von Nidwalden'') in September was more serious, with 435 dead, including 118 women and 25 children. Its repression confirmed the new political situation.

== Aftermath ==
The invasion strained the recently concluded [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (18 October 1797) that had ended the [[War of the First Coalition]] against France. Now, the European monarchies once again feared republican France was expanding its grip on the continent, and had to be opposed and driven back. The French conquest of Switzerland, which had maintained its neutrality ever since the outbreak of the French Revolution, was one of the reasons for the formation of the [[Second Coalition]], and would see an Austro-Russian army conduct the [[Italian and Swiss expedition]] in 1799 and 1800.
