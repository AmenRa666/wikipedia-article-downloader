'''John Thornton Augustine Washington''' (May 20, 1783 – October 9, 1841) was a prominent [[Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]) [[landowner]], [[farmer]], and [[politician|statesman]] and a member of the Washington family. Washington was a grandnephew of [[George Washington]], first [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|McGee|1973|p=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayland7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wayland|1998|p=237.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Washington was born on May 20, 1783 at &quot;Berry Hill&quot; [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], [[Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]) and was the eldest son of [[Thornton Washington|Thornton Augustine Washington]], a nephew of [[George Washington]], with his first wife Mildred Berry Washington.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wayland2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wayland|1998|p=352.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2005|p=1438.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Cooper&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper County, Missouri Genealogical Web (GenWeb) Project|2011|p=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had one younger brother, Thomas Berry Washington (born c. 1792), who died in childhood, and a younger half-brother from his father's second marriage, Samuel Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison2&quot;/&gt;

==Military and political career==
Unlike other prominent members of the Washington family, John Washington was not fond of public life. According to his son, Washington had a preference for &quot;the quiet and congenial occupation of a country gentleman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|1951|p=108.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[War of 1812]], Washington was offered the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Captain (United States)|captain]] and the command of a [[Company (military unit)|company]] of [[Cavalry (United States)|cavalry]] in the [[United States Army]], but turned down the offer in order to participate in the fighting as a [[Private (rank)|private]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace7&quot;/&gt; Following the war, Washington served one term as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], but declined to run for a second term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace7&quot;/&gt; Washington was then appointed to the position of [[Sheriffs in the United States|High Sheriff]] of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County]], but he refused the appointment and it was then offered to a deputy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace7&quot;/&gt;

==Land holdings==
Washington inherited his parents' &quot;Berry Hill&quot; plantation, where in 1825 he built the present [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] dwelling on the property he renamed &quot;[[Cedar Lawn]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wayland5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wayland|1998|p=354.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his &quot;Cedar Lawn&quot; estate, Washington also owned lands along Bullskin Run, a small [[tributary]] stream of the [[Shenandoah River]], near &quot;Cedar Lawn&quot; and also on the [[Kanawha River]] in [[Mason County, West Virginia|Mason County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayland7&quot;/&gt;

==Marriage and children==
On September 2, 1810 at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]], Washington married Elizabeth Conrad Bedinger, the daughter of Daniel Bedinger and Sarah Rutherford Bedinger.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2005|p=1943.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's father was an officer in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and her maternal grandfather [[Robert Rutherford (congressman)|Robert Rutherford]] was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] representing the lower [[Shenandoah Valley]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee7&quot;/&gt; Her brother, [[Henry Bedinger|Henry Bedinger III]], was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and later served as [[United States Ambassador to Denmark|Chargé d'Affaires]] and [[United States Ambassador to Denmark|Minister to Denmark]] for [[United States President]] [[Franklin Pierce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee7&quot;/&gt;

Washington and his wife Elizabeth produced a large family including five sons and eight daughters:&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayland7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Harrison4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2005|pp=1943–1945.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Washington's wife Elizabeth died on October 21, 1837 at &quot;Cedar Lawn&quot; and Washington himself died at &quot;Cedar Lawn&quot; four years later on October 9, 1841.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison15&quot;/&gt; Washington's children had departed the homestead for other areas or moved to nearby estates by the time of his death, and the &quot;Cedar Lawn&quot; property passed from the Washington family.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee7&quot;/&gt; Washington had finished drafting his will on July 16, 1840 and it was proved nine days after his death in Charles Town on October 18, 1841.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayland7&quot;/&gt; Washington and his wife were interred at &quot;[[Harewood (West Virginia)|Harewood]],&quot; the estate formerly owned by his grandfather Colonel [[Samuel Washington]] and from which &quot;Cedar Lawn&quot; was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;FrankzuDöfering1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|von Frank zu Döfering|1967|p=56.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Family Bible (book)|family bible]] acquired by Washington on September 1, 1818 in which he inscribed a record of the dates and locations of his family's births, deaths, and weddings was passed down through his descendants and is currently in the possession of the Bedinger family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt;

==Theoretical American royal succession==
According to a May 1908 article in ''The Scrap Book'' entitled &quot;If Washington Had Been Crowned&quot; and a February 1951 article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' entitled &quot;If Washington Had Become King: A Carpenter or an Engineer Might Now Rule the U.S.,&quot; John Thornton Augustine Washington would have likely succeeded his great uncle [[George Washington]] as &quot;king&quot; of the United States had Washington accepted the position of monarch rather than that of president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacon2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bacon|1908|p=755.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the laws of male preference [[primogeniture]] [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] recognized by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] at the time of [[American Revolution|American independence]], John Thornton Augustine Washington would have been the lawful [[heir presumptive]] to Washington as the eldest son of Thornton Washington, who in turn was the eldest son of [[Samuel Washington]], Washington's eldest full brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacon2&quot;/&gt; A theoretical &quot;King John I of the United States&quot; would have had a lengthy reign spanning from Washington's death in 1799 until 1841.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace7&quot;/&gt;
