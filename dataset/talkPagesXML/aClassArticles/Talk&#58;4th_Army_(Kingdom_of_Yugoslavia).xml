==Pre-war career==
Are there any details about the division before 1941? Surely, it must have existed throughout the 1930s. If not, this must be clarified. Cohen (1996) p. 14 says the &quot;Fourth Army District&quot; in Croatia was, on paper, commanded by General [[Božidar Janković]] in 1920, but since Janković was &quot;old and infirm&quot;, the real power lied with [[Milan Nedić]]. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 15:56, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
:It appears that there was a 4th Army District (territorially-based) going back to at least 1931, but no 4th Army per se. Each Army District apparently had a deputy commander who was responsible for the district, for the 4th Army District it was apparently Jevrem Damjanović between 1931 and 1936, then Đorđe Arandjelović, who retired in 1940 but was designated as deputy commander 4th Army when it was mobilised in 1941. That makes sense, because Yugoslavia did not have the money to be mobilising whole armies (really corps) for manoeuvres in peacetime. I've added in a sentence using Krzak to explain the deal.

== Declension? ==

Can you explain the difference between Geografskom institutu and Geografski institut? Naturally, the change screws up the referencing, so I just want to make sure I understand. Thanks, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 05:29, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
: Geografski institut - [https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominativ Nominativ (first)], Geografskom institutu - [https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dativ Dativ (third)]--[[User:Gorran|Gorran]] ([[User talk:Gorran|talk]]) 05:50, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
::I never could get those grammatical distinctions in languages other than English. Latin wasn't a crowning achievement for me. Thanks, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 06:17, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
:::By the way, a friend of mine who is a lawyer - so, a person who should know that matter - explained to me some points about copyright in Yugoslavia. In short, according to him, this map, and everything published before 1992-25=1977, is public domain, and free for use. The law at that time stipulated the 25-year long protection of copyright, starting with the day of the publication. And, once expired, it can not be established again.--[[User:Gorran|Gorran]] ([[User talk:Gorran|talk]]) 06:31, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
::::I wonder how that conforms to Template:PD-Yugoslavia? [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 07:40, 19 June 2014 (UTC)

== Serbo-croatian literature ==

Two books by Velimir Terzić: SLOM KRALJEVINE JUGOSLAVIJE; uzroci i posledice poraza - [http://znaci.net/00002/366.htm book 1] and [http://znaci.net/00002/367.htm book 2] are the most appreciated books on April War 1941 among serbo-croatian speaking military historians.--[[User:Gorran|Gorran]] ([[User talk:Gorran|talk]]) 06:03, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks, I'll take a look. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 06:21, 19 June 2014 (UTC)

== PD Yugoslavia ==
Well, it was some poor math, in addition to poor English on my side. 1992-25 is not, of course 1977. In any case, this might be useful: [https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Autorska_prava_na_podru%C4%8Dju_biv%C5%A1e_Jugoslavije Wikipedia:Autorska prava na području bivše Jugoslavije], [https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ablon:JD-Jugoslavija Šablon:JD-Jugoslavija].--[[User:Gorran|Gorran]] ([[User talk:Gorran|talk]]) 13:27, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
:My (albeit crappy) reading of that is that there are two things of particular interest to me, photographs taken in WWII expired under the 25 year rule in 1970 at the latest, and work by govt employees is not copyrighted at all. Am I reading that right? [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 13:40, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
:::It is stated explicitly that copyright on photograph, or work produced in similar manner, and on work of applied art, ceased after 25 years from the publication of the work. And it is concluded that all photographs published in Yugoslavia before 1 January 1970 are PD, and in some countries-successors even after that - for example, in Serbia before 1 January 1973. For work made by govt employees and/or state or public institution, I am not sure I understand the available explanation. In any case, I'll ask for clarification, and endeavor to apply the result.--[[User:Gorran|Gorran]] ([[User talk:Gorran|talk]]) 14:16, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
::::The map being 1952 would have expired in 1977, so not expired unless govt employee caveat applies, by my reading at least. Cheers, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 14:50, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::No, the condition is that publication date + 25 (copyright protection lasting) &lt; 1995 (new law in Slovenia), or &lt; 1998 for Serbia. For picture published in 1952, copyright expired and it become PD in 1977, according to [https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Autorska_prava_na_podru%C4%8Dju_biv%C5%A1e_Jugoslavije#Zakon_iz_1968. 1968 law], in force in 1977.--[[User:Gorran|Gorran]] ([[User talk:Gorran|talk]]) 15:06, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
::::::OK, that's good. There are a lot of good maps in that collection. Cheers, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 15:10, 19 June 2014 (UTC)</text>
