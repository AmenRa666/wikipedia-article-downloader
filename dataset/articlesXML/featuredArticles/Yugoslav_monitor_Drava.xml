The '''Yugoslav monitor ''Drava''''' was a [[river monitor]] operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. She was originally built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as the [[lead ship|name ship]] of the [[Enns-class river monitor|''Enns''-class]] river monitors. As '''SMS ''Enns''''', she was part of the [[Danube Flotilla (Austria-Hungary)|Danube Flotilla]] during [[World War I]], and fought against the [[Serbian Army|Serbian]] and [[Romanian Land Forces#World War I|Romanian]] armies from Belgrade to the lower [[Danube]]. In October 1915, she was covering an amphibious assault on Belgrade when she was holed below the waterline by a direct hit, and had to be towed to Budapest for repairs. After World War I she was provided to the newly created [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and renamed ''Drava''. She remained in service throughout the [[interwar period]], but was not always in full commission due to budget restrictions.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, ''Drava'' spent six days shelling airfields near [[Mohács]] in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] and fought off a small flotilla of Hungarian gunboats. On 12 April, she was attacked by [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' [[dive bomber]]s of the [[Luftwaffe]]. The anti-aircraft gunners on the ship claimed three enemy aircraft, but nine of the ''Stukas'' scored hits. Most of these had little effect, but the last bomb dropped straight down ''Drava''{{'}}s funnel and exploded in her engine room, killing 54 of the crew, including her captain, [[Aleksandar Berić]]. Only 13 of the crew survived. She was raised and scrapped by Hungary during their [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|occupation of parts of Yugoslavia]]. Berić was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Karađorđe's Star]] for his sacrifice, and the base of the [[Serbian River Flotilla]] at [[Novi Sad]] is named after him.

==Description and construction==
SMS ''Enns'' was constructed for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as the [[lead ship|name ship]] of the [[Enns-class river monitor|''Enns''-class river monitor]]s by [[Schiffswerft Linz]] and [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT). She was laid down by Schiffswerft Linz at [[Linz]] on 21 November 1913,{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=66}} as part of the Austro-Hungarian 1912 Naval Program.{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=315}} She was named after the [[Enns (river)|River Enns]], a tributary of the [[Danube]]. When [[World War I]] broke out in July 1914, construction of ''Enns'' was well advanced, but after Schiffswerft Linz was taken over by STT, her machinery was ordered from the STT works near [[Trieste]]. On 2 August, the machinery was dispatched by train to Linz and installation began without delay.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=66}} She was launched in September 1914, and completed on 17 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=142}} Despite the requirement that ''Enns'' and {{SMS|Inn}} be constructed as [[sister ship]]s, and the fact that their size and armament were identical, there were significant design differences between the two vessels, as they were constructed by completely independent shipbuilding companies. ''Enns'' had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|60.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}},{{refn|group=lower-alpha|According to Greger, her overall length was {{convert|57.9|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=141}}}} a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|10.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Her [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]] was {{convert|536|t|LT}}, and her crew consisted of 95 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|pp=66–67}} She had two [[Marine steam engine|triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was provided by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=66}} and her engines were rated at {{convert|1500|ihp|lk=in}}, with a maximum of {{convert|1700|ihp|abbr=on}}. She was designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}},{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=141}} and carried {{convert|70|t|LT}} of [[fuel oil]].{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=315}}

''Enns'' was armed with one twin [[gun turret]] of {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}}L/45{{refn|L/45 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/45 gun is 45 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 45 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns mounted forward, and three single {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} L/10 [[howitzer]] turrets mounted on the aft deck. On the upper deck there were two single {{convert|66|mm|abbr=on}} L/50 [[anti-air warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns, one on the port side forward of the funnel, and one on the starboard side to the rear of the funnel. She was also equipped with six {{convert|8|mm|abbr=on}} machine guns.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|pp=67 &amp; 69}} The maximum range of her [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} L/45 guns was {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}}, and her howitzers could fire their {{convert|20|kg|abbr=on}} shells a maximum of {{convert|6.2|km}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=9–10}} Her armour consisted of [[Armor belt|belt]] and [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s  {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick and [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armour {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and her [[conning tower]] and gun turrets were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=142}}

The original plans called for open anti-aircraft mounts, but the experience of the existing monitors in the first battles on the Danube against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] demonstrated that the mounts needed protection from small arms fire, so armoured [[barbette]]s were added. These modifications prevented the crew in the conning tower from viewing directly aft of the ship, so a {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}} high rectangular platform was placed on top of the conning tower that afforded a view aft. To avoid any increase in her draught from these modifications, her hull was lengthened. Due to the urgent need for the ship to be put into service, the planned telescopic mast was not installed, and an alternative mast was constructed using angle iron lattice.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=66}} ''Enns'' was launched on 29 July 1914 and commissioned on 17 October 1914.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=66}}

==Career==

===World War I===
{{see also|Serbian Campaign of World War I|Romania during World War I}}
Soon after ''Enns'' was commissioned into the [[Danube Flotilla (Austria-Hungary)|Danube Flotilla]] she was in action against Serbian forces at Belgrade,{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=265}} under the command of ''[[Linienschiffsleutnant]]''{{refn|Equivalent to a Austro-Hungarian Army ''Hauptman'' ([[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]).{{sfn|Deak|1990|loc=Introduction}}|group = lower-alpha}} (LSL) Richard Funk.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=67}} French artillery support arrived in Belgrade in November, endangering the monitor's anchorage, with ''Enns'' being the only monitor in the flotilla with the range to match the French guns.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=265}} On 21 November, ''Enns'' engaged the French battery in an artillery duel at a range of {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=67}} This stalemate continued until the following month when the Serbs briefly evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. After less than two weeks, the Austrians had to withdraw from Belgrade, and it was soon re-occupied by the Serbs, reinforced by the Russians and French. ''Enns'' continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until late December, when the monitor base was withdrawn to [[Petrovaradin]] for the winter.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=265–266}}

In January 1915, British artillery arrived in Belgrade, further bolstering its defences.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=266}} In mid-February, the monitors redeployed to an anchorage at [[Zemun]].{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=67}} Following the commencement of the [[Gallipoli campaign]], munitions supply to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] became critical, and despite the failure of an earlier attempt to ship arms and ammunition down the Danube, another attempt was planned. On 30 March, the steamer ''Belgrad'' left Zemun, escorted by ''Enns'' and the monitor {{SMS|Bodrog}}. The convoy was undetected as it sailed past Belgrade at night during a storm, but after the monitors returned to base, the steamer struck a mine near [[Vinča]], and after coming under heavy artillery fire, exploded near [[Ritopek]].{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=267}} On 22 April 1915, a British picket boat that had been brought overland by rail from [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun, firing two torpedoes without success.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=270–271}} In September 1915, the [[Central Powers]] were joined by [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and the Serbian Army soon faced overwhelming Austrian and German ground troops. In early October, the [[Third Army (Austria-Hungary)|Austro-Hungarian Third Army]] attacked Belgrade, and ''Enns'', along with the majority of the flotilla, was heavily engaged in support of the crossings near the [[Belgrade Fortress]] and [[Ada Ciganlija]] island.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=272}} During the final river crossing and support of the resulting [[bridgehead]], ''Enns'' was near [[Great War Island|Grosser Krieg]] Island on 8 October when she received a direct hit below the [[waterline]] and her {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]] flooded. She was towed out of danger by the armed steamer ''Almos'', and was eventually hauled to Budapest where she was repaired.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=273}} During repairs, the barbettes on her upper deck were replaced with turrets for the anti-aircraft guns. Although the howitzers had not been particularly successful, a plan to replace the aft howitzer mount with a turret similar to that used on SMS ''Bodrog'' was not carried out.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=66}}

[[File:Great War Island panorama.jpg|1000px|thumb|centre|View from the Belgrade Fortress over Grosser Krieg Island. ''Enns'' was supporting the October 1915 crossings of the Danube near the island when she received a direct hit and was put out of action|alt=a colour photograph of a large island in the middle of a river, with a city in the background]]

When she returned to the flotilla after repairs, she saw action at [[Oryahovo|Rjahovo]] in early October 1916, where she contributed to the defeat of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] [[Flămânda Offensive]].  The Romanian attempt to cross the Danube to attack the rear of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]''{{refn|Equivalent to a British Army [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]].{{sfn|Mombauer|2001|p=xv}}|group = lower-alpha}} [[August von Mackensen]]'s Austro-Hungarian Third Army was thwarted,{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=281}} and a force consisting of ''Enns'', the monitors {{SMS|Leitha}}, {{SMS|Temes (II)}} and {{SMS|Szamos}}, the patrol boat ''Viza'' and the armed steamer ''Balaton'' destroyed a [[pontoon bridge]] near Rjahovo. After forays against [[Giurgiu]] to secure trains loaded with coal and oil, in November ''Enns'' and other ships supported the crossing of the Danube by von Mackensen's army at [[Svishtov|Sistow]]. The following month, ''Enns'' bombarded [[Căscioarele]], driving enemy troops out of the village. From late December 1916 to mid-March 1917, ''Enns'' and other ships of the flotilla wintered at [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu Severin]].{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=67}}

In March 1917, ''Enns'' relocated to [[Brăila]] in eastern Romania, where it remained until July 1918. Sent to Linz and Budapest for an [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|overhaul]] in [[dry dock]], ''Enns'' then returned to eastern Romania and was stationed at [[Reni, Ukraine|Reni]] where she met a group of monitors and patrol boats that had been operating against [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=67}} In October 1918, the Danube Flotilla was under serious threat of being cut off in the lower Danube by [[French Army in World War I|French]] forces after the Bulgarians concluded an armistice with the British and French. After the steamer ''Croatia'' was fired on by the French as it tried to get past [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]], she cut her tow line, releasing seven [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]], which ran aground on a sandbank. ''Croatia'' was hit, suffered casualties and grounded on the Romanian side of the river. The French retrieved three of the lighters and towed them into the anchorage at Lom. The following day, ''Enns'' and two other monitors managed to release three of the remaining lighters while under heavy French fire, and towed them upstream.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=285}} The flotilla continued to retreat up the Danube, running the gauntlet of French and Serbian forces. With the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in early November, the [[South Slavs]] went ashore at [[Vukovar]]. The Austrian, Hungarian and Czech crew members of the flotilla continued on their journey, arriving in Budapest on 6 November,{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=285–286}} and ''Enns'' began flying the Hungarian flag. On 8 December, the monitors were seized by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and less than two weeks later ''Enns'' was towed to Belgrade where she was handed over to Serbia to be maintained on behalf of the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia).{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=67}}

===Interwar period and World War II===
Immediately after the armistice, ''Enns'' was crewed by sailors of the KSCS in 1918–19. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] concluded in September 1919, ''Enns'' was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=422}} and was officially handed over to the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|KSCS navy]] and renamed ''Drava'' in 1920.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=426}} Her sister ship ''Inn'' was transferred to Romania and renamed ''Besarabia''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=142}} In 1925–26, ''Drava'' was refitted, but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-646-5188-17, Flugzeuge Junkers Ju 87.jpg|thumb|Ju 87 ''Stuka'' dive bombers of ''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' 77 sank the ''Drava'' near Čib on the morning of 12 April 1941|alt=a black and white photograph of seven aircraft in flight over a smoky battleground]]
''Drava'' was based at [[Bezdan]] under the command of [[Aleksandar Berić]],{{refn|group=lower-alpha|His rank was ''Poručnik bojnog broda'', equivalent to a [[United States Navy]] [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2013b}}}} when the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] began on 6 April 1941. She was assigned as flagship of the 1st Mine Barrage Division,{{sfn|Niehorster|2013a}} and was responsible for the Hungarian border on the Danube, under the operational control of the [[30th Infantry Division Osiječka|30th Infantry Division ''Osiječka'']],{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=168}} which was part of the [[2nd Army (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|2nd Army]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=375}} ''Drava'' steamed upstream to [[Mohács]] in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] to shell the airfield there on 6 and 8 April,{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=224}} but was subjected to daily attacks by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''.{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1977|p=843}} On 10 April, ''Drava'' and her fellow monitor {{ship|Yugoslav monitor|Morava||2}} were ordered to sail downstream to conform with the withdrawals of the [[1st Army (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|1st]] and 2nd Army's from [[Bačka]] and [[Baranja]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=375}} About 14:00 the following day, a Yugoslav lookout near [[Batina]] signalled ''Drava'' that a group of four Hungarian patrol boats, armed with {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}} guns, was coming down the Danube from the direction of Mohács. ''Drava'' engaged the patrol boats at a range of {{convert|6|–|7|km|abbr=on}}, and drove the small Hungarian flotilla north again. Berić followed this up at 16:00 by once again shelling the airfield at Mohács. Morale on the ship was good, but when Berić met with Army elements later that day he became aware of the situation elsewhere, and nine crew deserted.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=392}}

Early on 12 April, with the other three monitors having been scuttled the night before, ''Drava'' was attacked by [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' [[dive bomber]]s of [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 77|''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' 77]] flying from [[Arad, Romania]]. The anti-aircraft gunners on the ship claimed three enemy aircraft, and nine of the ''Stukas'' scored hits on her, most of which had little effect. However, the last bomb dropped straight down her funnel and exploded in her engine room, killing 54 of the crew. Only 13 survived,{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=224}} and she sank off [[Čelarevo|Čib]].{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1977|p=843}} Having ordered the burning of [[Cryptography|codes]] before she sank, Berić and his first officers were among the dead, but two of the successful anti-aircraft gunners, Rade Milojević and Miroslav Šurdilović, were among the survivors.{{sfn|Vujičić|15 August 2014}} During their [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|occupation of parts of Yugoslavia]], ''Drava'' was raised and then scrapped by Hungary.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} Berić was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Karađorđe's Star]] for his sacrifice. In April 2015, a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Berić was unveiled at the village of [[Belegiš]], near [[Stara Pazova]].{{sfn|Radio Television of Serbia|6 April 2015}} The barracks of the [[Serbian River Flotilla]] in [[Novi Sad]] are also named after him.{{sfn|Vujičić|15 August 2014}}
