He died in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBM&quot;/&gt; Kennard had one son by his first wife, Jeremy, and a further son, Julian by his third wife.

==Career==

===RAF career===
Kennard joined the [[Royal Air Force]] on a short-service commission in January 1938 as an acting [[pilot officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34476|supp=yes|startpage=517|date=25 January 1938|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His commission was confirmed in October 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34566|supp=yes|startpage=6820|date=1 November 1938|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1938, he bought the [[prototype]] [[SS 90|Jaguar SS 90 roadster]], registered [[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom|ARW295]].&lt;ref name=SS90/&gt; He served with [[No. 66 Squadron RAF]] and [[No. 610 Squadron RAF|610 Squadron]] between until 1940. In early 1940, he flew missions over [[Dunkirk]] during the [[evacuation of Dunkirk|evacuation]] and, in mid-1940, was engaged in combat missions over southern England.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesoutheastecho.co.uk/Pilots/Kennard_HC.htm|title=F/Lt. H. C. Kennard|publisher=The South East Echo|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1940, Kennard was promoted to [[flying officer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34960|supp=yes|startpage=5832|date=4 October 1940|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assigned to [[No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron]] as a flight commander in the [[Hawker Hurricane]] squadron formed by the Polish government at [[RAF Church Fenton]] in Yorkshire. The squadron became active towards the end of the [[Battle of Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBM&quot;/&gt; Kennard sold the SS 90 some time after his marriage in November 1940.&lt;ref name=SS90/&gt;

In 1941, Kennard was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36514|supp=yes|startpage=2230|date=12 May 1944|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assisted in the formation of [[No. 121 Squadron RAF]], a Hurricane squadron composed of American volunteer pilots, based at [[RAF Kirton in Lindsey]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. The squadron became operational in two months. After converting from Hurricanes to [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s, Kennard led the American squadron on missions across the English Channel. The station commander at the time purchased a five-gallon tin of [[peanut butter]] from [[Harrods]] in order to make the American personnel feel more at home. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the declaration of war by the United States, Kennard is reputed to have proposed a toast with the words &quot;You're all in it now, Yanks!&quot; He was made squadron commander in early 1942 and was shot down and wounded in July while participating in a bomber-escort mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBM&quot;/&gt; Having flown 58 missions since taking command, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for a combat operation in May 1942 in which he engaged eight enemy aircraft, shooting down two, with a third claimed as probable and a fourth damaged. Later that month Kennard led his flight in a successful attack on a [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] and later still attacked and sank an [[naval trawler|armed trawler]] off the Dutch coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35614|supp=yes|startpage=2870|date=26 June 1942|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flight160742&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Service Aviation |magazine=Flight |issue=16 July 1942 |page=78 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1942/1942%20-%201506.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennard relinquished command of the squadron in September 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBM&quot;/&gt; In October 1942, Kennard was wounded in action.&lt;ref name=Flight151042&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Service Aviation |magazine=Flight |issue=15 October 1942 |page=432 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1942/1942%20-%202186.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to acting [[squadron leader]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36092|supp=yes|startpage=3206|date=13 July 1943|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
After relinquishing command of 121 Squadron, Kennard was assigned to the Directorate of Fighter Operations in the [[Air Ministry]] and then to a role overseeing troop movements. He returned to operations in May 1945, having been confirmed as a squadron leader,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37074|supp=yes|startpage=2480|date=8 May 1945|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took command of a Spitfire squadron – [[No. 74 Squadron RAF]]. He commanded a station until he left the RAF in 1946 and then served with the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] from 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38588|supp=yes|startpage=1938|date=19 April 1949|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1952, commanding [[No. 500 Squadron RAF]] and flying [[Gloster Meteor]]s. He was granted the rank of [[wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38588|supp=yes|startpage=1942|date=19 April 1949|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took [[Anthony Eden]], the squadron's [[honorary air commodore]], for a ride in a Meteor.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBM&quot;/&gt; In 1949, Kennard was to have taken part in a Royal Auxiliary Air Force Race based at [[RAF Elmdon]]. He was due to fly a Meteor 3,&lt;ref name=Flight210749&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=The National Air Races |magazine=Flight |issue=21 July 1949 |page=75 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1949/1949%20-%201422.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the aircraft was unable to participate in the race because of the weather at its base,&lt;ref name=Flight040849&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=The National Air Races |magazine=Flight |issue=21 July 1949 |page=133 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1949/1949%20-%201369.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RAF West Malling]].&lt;ref name=Flight310850&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=South Coast Air Race Entries |magazine=Flight |issue=31 August 1950 |page=253 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1950/1950%20-%201645.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from active service and was appointed to the reserve in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39539|supp=yes|startpage=2578|date=9 May 1952|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relinquished his commission in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41636|supp=yes|startpage=1160|date=13 February 1959|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civilian aviation===
After he left the Royal Air Force, Kennard became an entrepreneur in civilian aviation. He founded or became director of, several airlines and aviation-related companies, including [[Air Kruise]], which ran [[Ramsgate Airport]], and [[Silver City Airways]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBM&quot;/&gt; In 1946, Kennard formed Air Kruise at [[Lympne Airport]]. In August of that year, Kennard took delivery of the first civilian [[Miles Messenger]], G-AHZS, from [[Miles Aircraft|Miles Aircraft Ltd]].{{sfn|Collyer|1992|p=141}} The handover was made at [[Heston Aerodrome]].&lt;ref name=Flight050946&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Civil Aviation News |magazine=Flight |issue=5 September 1946 |page=251 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201741.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Kruise operated [[Airspeed Consul]]s, [[Auster Autocrat]]s, [[Miles Messenger]]s, [[Miles Gemini]]s and [[Percival Proctor]]s.&lt;ref name=Flight280449&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Air Charter Guide |magazine=Flight |issue=28 April 1949 |page=504 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1949/1949%20-%200765.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also operated [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]]s.{{sfn|Collyer|1992|p=143}}

Kennard and his wife came second in the 1946 Folkestone Trophy Air Race, the first to be held at Lympne after the war.&lt;ref name=Flight120946&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=With 'Flight's Camera at Folkestone ...' |magazine=Flight |issue=12 September 1946 |page=285 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201817.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1948, Kennard formed the Kent Coast Flying Club, which was based at Lympne and replaced the Cinque Ports Flying Club, which had folded on 1 October.&lt;ref name=Flight141048&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Civil Aviation News ... |magazine=Flight |issue=14 October 1948 |page=457 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1948/1948%20-%201713.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the aircraft operated was [[Miles Magister]] G-AKJX.{{sfn|Collyer|1992|p=117}} In 1953, Air Kruise moved from Lydd to [[Ramsgate Airport|Ramsgate]].{{sfn|Collyer|1992|p=143}} In 1958, Kennard formed Aircraft Engineering and Maintenance Ltd at Ramsgate.

Invicta became &quot;British Midland – Invicta Cargo.{{sfn|Finnis|2006|pp=76–92}} The merger was forced by London merchant bank Minster Trust. In July, the air cargo operation was sold back to Kennard,&lt;ref name=FI170769&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Invicta out of BMA consortium |magazine=Flight International|issue=17 July 1969 |page=236 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%202436.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who formed a new company, Invicta Airways (1969) Ltd.{{sfn|Finnis|2006|pp=76–92}} In February 1973, European Ferries Group acquired a 76% holding of Invicta.{{sfn|Finnis|2006|pp=133–54}} On 30 September 1975, Invicta ceased operations as a result of European Ferries decision to cease airline operations.{{sfn|Finnis|2006|pp=169–79}} In February 1976, the assets of Invicta were bought by Universal Air Transport Sales, which Kennard had set up.&lt;ref name=FI140276&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Invicta Flies Again |magazine=Flight International |issue=14 February 1976 |page=326 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200236.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invicta was sold in 1980, Kennard left the company and established a business at [[Canterbury]] restoring classic cars.{{sfn|Finnis|2006|pp=213–20}}
