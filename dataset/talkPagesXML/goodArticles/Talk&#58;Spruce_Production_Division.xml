==My ears were burning==
Like magic, eventually the psychic pull of Wikipedia pixels and the collective energy of WP:ORE somehow alerted me I should log into Wikipedia today. I guess my tinfoil hat stopped working. Nicely done! [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] ([[User talk:Valfontis|talk]]) 21:31, 20 November 2010 (UTC)
:The development seems to be going pretty quickly. Move to mainspace soon, after moving the notes into article info.? [[User:Jsayre64|&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Rockwell&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jsayre64&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Jsayre64|&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Rockwell&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(talk)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:49, 20 November 2010 (UTC)
::Now that the article has been reviewed by Valfontis, I'm much more confident it may be ready for primetime. [[User:Tedder|tedder]] ([[User talk:Tedder|talk]]) 16:47, 21 November 2010 (UTC)
:::I didn't actually review it, but it did pass a spellcheck! [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] ([[User talk:Valfontis|talk]]) 17:51, 21 November 2010 (UTC)
:::OK, it's now copyedited. I need to reread it for sense--I get the impression there is some unnecessary repetition. [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] ([[User talk:Valfontis|talk]]) 18:50, 21 November 2010 (UTC)
::::I have a couple things I want to put in about the LLLL and [[Maurice Crumpacker|my fave old dead guy]] but I can always do that in the mainspace if we want to move this over soon.

::::And of course, we can just move the notes to the talk page if we don't get them all incorporated.

::::We do also need to have some fancy commemorative banner on the talk page. Here's a start. It should be more fancy pantsy, like [[WP:AUNTBETTY|Aunt Betty's]]  bloomers. Candles, cake, etc? --[[User:Esprqii|Esprqii]] ([[User talk:Esprqii|talk]]) 20:02, 21 November 2010 (UTC)

(moving left). Yes, we need candles on a cake. Valfontis- the &quot;notes&quot; section are references that I parsed that need to be integrated. I think you've dealt with those in a previous life. I'm hoping someone who is good at writing text will do so. Otherwise, I think it needs to be resectioned. [[User:Tedder|tedder]] ([[User talk:Tedder|talk]]) 20:59, 21 November 2010 (UTC)
:[[:File:Nuvola apps cookie.svg|This image]] or [[:File:Nuvola apps cookie.png|this one, slightly different]] have a candle on a cake. But that might associate this milestone with a birthday. We're treating it like one, though! :-) This is more casual/common, but maybe it would work:

:::[[User:Steven Walling]] sent an email out to the PDX Wiki group about the Wikimedia Foundation's 10th anniversary coming up on January 15. Since it's their 10th...and our 10,000th article...what if we held off until January and released it then as our special present? Might be kind of a cool tie-in. Maybe we can try and get some peer review/good article review/featured status?? before then? I'm sure that in honor of the anniversary people could look at it in the project space. I dunno.

==Notes==
Colonel Charles Van Way &quot;returned to Vancouver in about 1920 for a job of several years in charge of disposing of the logging camps owned by the Spruce Production Division in Oregon and Washington. From about 1920 to 1922, the family lived in what is now called the O.O. Howard House. One of the colonel's daughters, Dorothy, was married there to a 1919 West Point graduate, Lt. C.B. Ferenbaugh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Meals, With Meat|last=Van Arsdol|first=Ted|date=March 7, 1999|work=[[The Columbian]]|page=D7|location=Vancouver, Washington|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-Colonel [[Brice Disque]] wanted &quot;10,000,000 feet of perfect Oregon and Washington aeroplane spruce to win the war&quot;. HQ in Portland, per the Oregonian. &quot;It is the plan not to commandeer any milling or logging plants or to use any but civilians in the woods unless it is absolutely necessary to change the program in these respects.&quot; &quot;Colonel Disque anticipates little, if any, trouble with the IWW or other labor organizations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Output of Spruce is to be Pushed|date=December 14, 1917|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|page=7|accessdate=November 1, 2010|publisher=[[Christian Science Publishing Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods division &quot;abolished&quot; by Major General [[George Owen Squier|George O. Squier]] December 23, 1917. Chairman of the aircraft board was Howard E. Coffin, a &quot;well-known furniture manufacturer, residing at Grand Rapids, Mich.&quot;. The division head as Major [[Charles R. Sligh]], a &quot;reserve officer&quot;. &quot;The woods division was charged with responsibility of purchasing all wood required for the big American aircraft program and in part coordinating the lumber requirements of the United States and the allies.&quot; &quot;There have been numerous reports that all was not working harmoniously in the woods division.&quot; Rumors began even before Sligh was involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Squier Cuts Out Woods Division in Signal Corps|date=December 24, 1917|work=[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]|page=3|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prose==

At the end of the Production section:


&quot;And all wire rope manufactured in the west, as well as anything shipped in, was controlled by the spruce division per Colonel Disque. &quot; 'There was a serious shortage of wire rope when Col. Disque took charge of the spruce production campaign,' he declared.&quot;&quot;


The &quot;and&quot; at the beginning of the sentence doesn't really work. It seems like there are some transitional words missing here. Also, who is the 'he' who declared that there was a shortage of wire rope? [[User:ManfromButtonwillow|ManfromButtonwillow]] ([[User talk:ManfromButtonwillow|talk]]) 06:40, 13 February 2011 (UTC)

:Good find. I replaced the &quot;And&quot; with &quot;Furthermore,&quot; as that sentence seems to support the one before it. The last sentence was quoting a quote in a newspaper article, and I just eliminated the double-quote.

:Great find, Pete! This gives data for the number of board feet produced during each (well, almost each) month the division was working. And when I saw that, having not made some population graphs recently due to others' concern about doing so, I thought: line graph! So [[:commons:File:SPD production graph.png|here's what I've got]]. Again, maybe a table would be more appropriate, so I'll wait before putting this in the article right away. Besides, it seems pretty crowded with images. --[[User:Jsayre64|&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Rockwell&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jsayre64&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Jsayre64|&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Rockwell&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(talk)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:22, 5 April 2011 (UTC)
::Well, I'm going to [[WP:BOLD|be bold]] and add the graph as a link.

== FA? ==

Does anyone think this article might even meet the [[WP:FA?|FA criteria]]? I've never dealt with a featured article review before, but the GA review went pretty smoothly.

I'm surprised the nickname isn't mentioned. I'd just stick it in without a source but since it's a good article I'll just mention it here because this is a drive-by and I got not time for refs.
