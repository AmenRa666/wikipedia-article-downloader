==Political career==
Nance moved to Nebraska in 1871 to homestead and practice law, eventually settling in [[Osceola, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;/&gt; He divided his time between farming and his law practice. He soon gave up farming, for his law practice and large real estate business. In 1874, Nance was nominated by the state [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican Party]] to run for the [[Nebraska House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;/&gt; During his election, in 1875, Nance married Sarah White.&lt;ref name=&quot;D&quot;/&gt; He won the election and served as a member of the [[Nebraska Legislature]] from 1875 to 1878, and served as the [[Nebraska Legislature|Speaker of the Nebraska House of Representatives]] from 1877 to 1878. Nance was also a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]] in 1876.&lt;ref name=&quot;D&quot;/&gt;

His administration was described in ''The Public Men of Today'' in 1882, &quot;The distinguishing feature of his administration has been an unassuming but inflexible determination to execute the laws with fidelity to the best interests of the people of Nebraska.&quot;&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://genealogytrails.com/neb/governoralbunusnance.htm The Public Men of Today (1882)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nance was renominated for the governorship, in 1880. He won the election, with an overwhelming majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;/&gt;

He is known for calling in the Nebraska state militia to subdue the strikers in the [[Camp Dump Strike]]; one striker was killed by the militia.

==Death==
After being governor, Nance retired to civilian life.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;/&gt; He owned large parts of numerous banks. He eventually retired altogether from business life. Nance died in [[Chicago]], on December 7, 1911.&lt;ref name=E&gt;Raimo's pg. 893&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nance County, Nebraska]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=F&gt;Bulletin, Issues 196-201 pg. 197&lt;/ref&gt;
