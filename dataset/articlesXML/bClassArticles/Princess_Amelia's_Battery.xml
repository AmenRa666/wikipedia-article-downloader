'''Princess Amelia's Battery''' is an [[artillery battery]] in the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It is located on Willis's Plateau at the northern end of the [[Upper Rock Nature Reserve]], adjacent to Gun No. 4 of [[Princess Anne's Battery]]. It was named after [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain]], the second daughter of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. It was formerly referred to as the 2nd Willis's Battery. The plateau and its batteries had previously been named after an artillery officer by the name of Willis who was outstanding during the [[capture of Gibraltar]] in 1704.  Princess Amelia's Battery saw action during the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]], during which it sustained substantial damage. Little remains of the original site, aside from two derelict buildings. The battery is listed with the [[Gibraltar Heritage Trust]].
