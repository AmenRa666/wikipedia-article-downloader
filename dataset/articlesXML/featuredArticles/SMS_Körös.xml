'''SMS ''Körös''''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈkørøʃ|pron}}) was the [[name ship]] of the [[Körös-class river monitor|''Körös''-class]] [[river monitor]]s built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. Completed in 1892, the ship was part of the [[Danube Flotilla (Austria-Hungary)|Danube Flotilla]], and fought various [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]] from [[Belgrade]] down the [[Danube]] to the [[Black Sea]] during [[World War I]]. After the war, she was transferred to the newly created [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and renamed '''''Morava'''''. She remained in service throughout the [[interwar period]], although budget restrictions meant she was not always in full commission.

During the [[World War II]] [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, ''Morava'' was the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division, and operated on the River [[Tisza]]. She fought off attacks by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', and shot down one enemy aircraft, but was forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigating monitors was difficult, and she was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] by her crew on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, but most surrendered on 14 April. The remainder made their way to the [[Bay of Kotor]], which was captured by the Italian [[XVII Corps (Italy)|XVII Corps]] on 17 April. She was later raised by the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]], an Axis puppet state, and continued in service as '''''Bosna''''' until June 1944, when she struck a mine and sank.

==Description and construction==
The [[name ship]] of the [[Körös-class river monitor|''Körös''-class]] [[river monitor]]s was built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] by [[Ganz Works|H. Schönichen]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=138–139}} She was [[Keel laying|laid down]] at [[Budapest]] on 30 March 1890.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=44}} ''Körös'' and her [[sister ship]] {{SMS|Szamos}} doubled the size of Austria-Hungary's [[Danube Flotilla (Austria-Hungary)|Danube Flotilla]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=87}} The two monitors each had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|54|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Her [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|448|t|LT}},{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=138–139}} and her crew consisted of 77 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=44}} The ship was powered using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler]]s driving two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]],{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=138–139}} and carried {{convert|54|t|LT}} of coal.{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=315}} Her engines were rated at {{convert|1200|ihp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and she was designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=139}}

''Körös'' was armed with two single [[gun turret]]s of {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}}/L35{{refn|L/35 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/35 gun is 35 calibre, meaning that the gun was 35 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} [[Bow (ship)|fore]] and [[aft]], two [[superfiring]] {{convert|66|mm|abbr=on}}/L42 [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns protected by [[gun shield]]s on the superstructure fore and aft, and two [[machine gun]]s.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=44}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=139}} Her main guns fired a {{convert|26|kg|abbr=on}} [[Armor-piercing shell|armour-piercing]], high explosive, [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] or [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] shell to a maximum range of {{convert|8.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} at an [[Elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] of 20°. They could depress to −6° and elevate to +25°.{{sfn|Friedman|2011|p=290}} Her armour consisted of a [[Armor belt|belt]] and [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick, [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armour {{convert|19|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and [[conning tower]] and gun turret armour {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} thick.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=44}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=139}} The armour was produced by the [[Vítkovice (Ostrava)|Witkowitz]] steel works, in [[Moravia]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=126}} She was launched on 5 February 1892 and commissioned on 21 April of the same year.{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=44}} Her sister ship ''Szamos'' was completed in 1893, and was identical except for {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} armour on her conning tower.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=139}}

==Career==

===Commissioning and World War I===

====Serbian campaign====
At the start of [[World War I]], ''Körös'' was based at [[Zemun]], just upstream from [[Belgrade]] on the Danube. Her commander was ''[[Linienschiffsleutnant]]''{{refn|Equivalent to an Austro-Hungarian Army ''Hauptman'' ([[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]).{{sfn|Deak|1990|loc=Introduction}}|group = lower-alpha}} (LSL) Josef Meusburger,{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=44}} and she was accompanied by another three monitors and three [[patrol boats]].{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=262}} Austria-Hungary declared war on [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] on 28 July 1914, and that night the flotilla fired the first shots of the war against fortifications at the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the river [[Sava]] and on the [[Topčidersko Brdo|Topčider Hill]], although ''Körös'' was not initially involved. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians. This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns and the establishment of river obstacles and [[Naval mine|mines]].{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=263–265}}

The Austro-Hungarian base at Zemun was briefly evacuated due to a Serbian [[counterattack]] in September.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=263}} On 28 September, Körös, along with the monitor {{SMS|Temes}}, a patrol boat and a [[minesweeper]], broke through the minefields on the Sava near Belgrade and pushed upstream to join the fighting near [[Šabac]].{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=263–264}} In November, French artillery support arrived in Belgrade, endangering the monitor's anchorage.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=265}} The stalemate continued until December 1914 when the Serbs briefly evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro-Hungarian assault, although ''Körös'' did not support this action. After less than two weeks, the Austro-Hungarians had to withdraw from Belgrade, and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French assistance. ''Körös'' continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December, when the base of the Danube Flotilla was withdrawn north to Petrovaradin for the winter.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=265–266}}

In January 1915, British artillery arrived in Belgrade, further bolstering its defences.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=266}} On 22 April 1915, a British [[picket boat]] that had been brought overland by rail from [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun, firing two [[torpedo]]es without success.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=270–271}} [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the [[Central Powers]] in September 1915, and the Serbian Army soon faced an overwhelming Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian ground invasion. On 7 October, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army attacked Belgrade, and ''Körös'', along with the majority of the flotilla, was heavily engaged in support of the crossings near the [[Belgrade Fortress]] and [[Ada Ciganlija]] island.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=272}} During the final river crossing and support of the resulting [[bridgehead]], the ship provided close support, during which her [[Funnel (ship)|stack]] was hit and damaged. The following day, ''Körös'' assisted [[Yugoslav monitor Drava|SMS ''Enns'']] when the latter took a direct hit and began to take on water.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=273}}

Following the capture of Belgrade, the flotilla sailed downstream to [[Orșova]] near the Hungarian–Romanian border and waited for the lower Danube to be swept for mines. It then escorted a series of munitions convoys down the Danube to [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]], from where they were transferred to the Bulgarian railway system for shipment to the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=274}}

====Romanian campaign====
In November 1915, ''Körös'' and the other monitors were assembled at [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruschuk]], Bulgaria.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=274}} The position of Romania was uncertain; the Central Powers were aware that the Romanians were negotiating to enter the war on the opposing side of the [[Triple Entente|Entente]]. To protect the Danube's {{convert|480|km|abbr=on}} border between Romania and Bulgaria, the flotilla established a sheltered base in the [[Belene Island|Belene Canal]].{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=275}} When the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916, the monitors were again at Rustschuk, and were immediately attacked by three improvised [[torpedo boats]] operating out of the Romanian river port of [[Giurgiu]]. The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors but struck a [[Lighter (barge)|lighter]] loaded with fuel. The Second Monitor Division, consisting of ''Körös'' and three other monitors, was tasked with shelling Giurgiu. This bombardment set fire to oil storage tanks as well as the railway station and [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]], and sank several Romanian lighters. While the attack was underway, the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. The ''Körös'' and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised [[minelayer]] on their way back to Belene. This was followed by forays of the monitors both east and west of Belene, during which both [[Turnu Măgurele]] and [[Zimnicea]] were shelled.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=277}}

In April 1918, ''Körös'', along with three other monitors, two patrol boats and a [[Tugboat|tug]], were formed into ''Flottenabteilung Wulff'' (Fleet Division Wulff) under the command of ''Flottenkapitän'' ([[Fleet Captain]]) Olav Wulff. ''Flottenabteilung Wulff'' was sent through the mouth of the Danube and across the [[Black Sea]] to [[Odessa]], where it spent several months supporting the Austro-Hungarian troops enforcing the peace agreement with Russia. It returned to the Danube at the end of August, and was anchored at [[Brăila]] on 12 September. On 16 October, ''Körös'' and the rest of the First Monitor Division sailed from Brăila to Belene. For several weeks the Danube Flotilla was engaged in protecting Austro-Hungarian troops retreating towards Budapest, fighting French and irregular Serbian forces as they withdrew; the flotilla arrived in Belene on 6 November.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=284–286}}

===Interwar period and World War II===

====1919–41====
[[File:Yugoslav monitor Morava.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Morava'' in 1924|alt=a black and white photograph of a ship tied up at a berth]]
Immediately after the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] signed by the Austro-Hungarians on 3 November 1918, ''Körös'' was crewed by sailors of the newly created [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in 1918–19. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] concluded in September 1919, ''Körös'' was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, but was officially handed over to the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|KSCS Navy]] and renamed ''Morava'' in 1920.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=426}} Her sister ship ''Szamos'' was dismantled and used as a [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=139}} In 1925–26, ''Morava'' was refitted, but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

====1941–45====

On 6 April 1941, when the [[World War II]] [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] began, ''Morava'' was based at [[Kanjiža|Stara Kanjiža]] on the [[Tisza]] river, as the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013a}} This force was responsible for the Hungarian border, and came under the operational control of the [[7th Infantry Division Potiska|7th Infantry Division ''Potiska'']].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=168}} The remainder of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division consisted of the river tug ''R-XXI'', the river transport ''Senta'', and a few mobilised [[customs]] motorboats,{{sfn|Niehorster|2013a}} based further south on the Tisza at [[Senta]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=168}} On 7 April, ''Morava'' withdrew to Senta, where she was attacked by German aircraft. According to her commander, ''Poručnik bojnog broda''{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Equivalent to a [[United States Navy]] [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2013b}}}} Božidar Aranđelović, her crew shot down one German aircraft and captured a ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ''[[Oberstleutnant]]''.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=313}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''Oberstleutnant'' was equivalent to a [[United States Army]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]].{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=295}}}} On 10 April, ''Morava'' was ordered to withdraw to conform with the retreat of the [[2nd Army Group (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|2nd Army Group]] of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] from [[Bačka]] and [[Baranja]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=375}} On the evening of 11 April, ''Morava'' anchored at the [[confluence]] of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade, along with her fellow monitors ''[[Yugoslav monitor Vardar|Vardar]]'' and ''[[Yugoslav monitor Sava|Sava]]'', and Aranđelović took command of the flotilla. The three captains conferred, and decided to [[scuttling|scuttle]] their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, demolition charges on the bridge exploded prematurely and the bridge fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|pp=391–392}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}

After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 officers and men from the ''Morava'' and various other riverine vessels gathered at [[Obrenovac]], and armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels, started towards the [[Bay of Kotor]] in the southern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] in two groups. {{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=432}} The larger of the two groups only made it as far as [[Sarajevo]] on 14 April before they surrendered.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|pp=432 &amp; 405}} The smaller group made their way to the Bay of Kotor, and was captured by the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] [[XVII Corps (Italy)|XVII Corps]] on 17 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=457}}

''Morava'' was later raised and repaired by the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia|navy]] of an Axis [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]], in which she served as ''Bosna''. She served alongside her fellow monitor ''Sava'', which had also been raised and repaired, but retained her name. Along with six captured motorboats and ten [[Auxiliary ship|auxiliary vessels]],  they made up the riverine police force of the Croatian state.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|pp=357 &amp; 359}} ''Bosna'' was part of the 2nd Patrol Group of the River Flotilla Command, headquartered at Zemun.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013c}} She struck a mine near [[Novi Grad, Republika Srpska|Bosanski Novi]] on the [[Una (Sava)|River Una]] and sank in June 1944.{{sfn|Naval Records Club|1968|p=333}} The following year she was raised and [[Ship breaking|broken up]].{{sfn|Pawlik|Christ|Winkler|1989|p=44}}
