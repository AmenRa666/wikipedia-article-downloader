}}'''David Edgar Herold''' (June 16, 1842 – July 7, 1865) was an accomplice of [[John Wilkes Booth]] in the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] on April 14, 1865. After the shooting, Herold accompanied Booth to the home of [[Samuel Mudd|Dr. Samuel Mudd]], who set Booth’s injured leg. The two men then continued their escape through Maryland and into Virginia, and Herold remained with Booth until the authorities cornered them in a barn. Herold surrendered but Booth was shot and died a few hours later. Herold was sentenced to death and hanged with three other conspirators at Washington Arsenal.

==Biography==

===Early life===
David E. Herold was born in [[Maryland]], the sixth of eleven children of Adam George Herold (June 6, 1803 – October 6, 1864)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/herold-adam-george |title=Herold, Adam G. |publisher=Historic Congressional Cemetery |date= |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/obituary-herold-adam-g-0 |title=Obituary - Herold, Adam G. |publisher=Historic Congressional Cemetery |date=December 28, 2009 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Ann Porter (January 8, 1810 – February 16, 1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressionalcemetery.org/herold-mary-ann |title=Herold, Mary Ann |publisher=Historic Congressional Cemetery |date= |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/obituary-herold-mary-porter-0 |title=Obituary - Herold, Mary Porter |publisher=Historic Congressional Cemetery |date=December 28, 2009 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam and Mary were married on November 9, 1828 in Washington, D. C. David was their only son to survive to adulthood. His father Adam was the Chief Clerk of the Naval Storehouse at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] for over 20 years. Herold's family was well-off financially and lived in a large brick house at 636 Eighth Street S. E. in Washington, D. C. near the Washington Navy Yard. David attended [[Gonzaga College High School]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown College]], [[Charlotte Hall Military Academy]] (at Charlotte Hall, St. Mary's County, Maryland), and the Rittenhouse Academy. In 1860 Herold received a certificate in pharmacy from Georgetown College. He then worked as a pharmacist's assistant and as a clerk for a doctor, and was an avid hunter. He became acquainted with [[John Surratt]] while attending classes at Charlotte Hall Military Academy in the late 1850s. A few years later, in December 1864, Surratt introduced him to John Wilkes Booth.

For a time in 1864, Herold was employed in [[Brooklyn, New York]], by [[Francis Tumblety]], a quack &quot;Indian Herb&quot; doctor who would be arrested in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in the manhunt following the Lincoln assassination and released for lack of evidence. Years later, Tumblety would be named as one of the [[Jack the Ripper suspects]].

===Assassination plot===
[[File:Lincoln conspirators execution2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Execution of [[Mary Surratt]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]], David Herold, and [[George Atzerodt]] on July 7, 1865 at [[Fort McNair]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Digitally restored.]]

Herold and a group of co-conspirators had originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln, but later planned to kill him, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] in a bid to help the Confederacy's cause.&lt;ref&gt;Hamner, Christopher. &quot;[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24242 Booth's Reason for Assassination].&quot; [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of April 14, 1865, Herold guided [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]] to Seward’s house. Inside, Powell attempted to kill Seward, severely wounding him and other members of his household. The ensuing commotion frightened Herold and he rode off, leaving Powell to fend for himself. He then met with Booth outside of Washington, D.C., and they proceeded to Surrattsville, Maryland (now Clinton, Maryland) where they picked up weapons that Mary Surratt had left earlier for them at her property. Another conspirator, [[George Atzerodt]], was supposed to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson, but never made the attempt.

It was at this point that John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln at [[Ford's Theater]]. When Booth jumped onto the stage of the Ford's theater, he broke his fibula.When Booth was first across the bridge into Maryland, he met Herold there. They retrieved their weapons cache and proceeded to the home of Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]], who set Booth's leg. Herold remained with Booth and continually aided him until Union cavalry caught up with them.

Herold and Booth were trapped by authorities on April 26, 1865, after taking refuge in a barn on the property of Richard Henry Garrett. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused to lay down his arms and was shot by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] through a crack in the barn wall. He died a few hours later. Corbett was ratified in his actions, as orders to hold fire had not been given. Herold was tried before a military tribunal. As he had already admitted his involvement in the assassination conspiracy, the only defense his lawyer [[Frederick Stone]] (February 7, 1820 – October 17, 1899) could offer was that David was feeble-minded and under undue influence from Booth. His defense being unsuccessful, Herold was convicted and sentenced to death. He was hanged in [[Washington City]] on July 7, 1865.

On February 15, 1869, David's mother and 5 of his sisters interred his remains in [[Congressional Cemetery]] ( Washington, D. C. ) in an unmarked grave, next to the grave of his father Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/herold-david-edgar |title=Herold, David Edgar |publisher=Historic Congressional Cemetery |date= |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obituary - Herold, David |publisher=Historic Congressional Cemetery |date=December 28, 2009 |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/obituary-herold-david |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gravestone memorializing David now present in Congressional Cemetery was placed there in July 1917, at the time of the burial of his sister Mary Alice ( Herold ) Nelson (October 16, 1837 – July 1, 1917) in the cemetery. Mary Alice was the wife of Frederick Massena Nelson (January 1827 - May 11, 1909) of Pomonkey, Charles County, Maryland.

==Cultural references==
[[Gore Vidal]]'s fictionalized account of Lincoln's presidency, ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]'', includes a heavy focus on David Herold. In the Afterword, where Vidal explains the extent to which his novel is true to fact, he writes, &quot;As David's life is largely unknown until Booth's conspiracy, I have invented a low-life for him.&quot;

In the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'', David Herold appears in the song &quot;The Ballad of Booth&quot;, where Booth forces Herold at gunpoint to write why Booth killed Lincoln. However, when soldiers surround the barn where they hide, Herold runs.
