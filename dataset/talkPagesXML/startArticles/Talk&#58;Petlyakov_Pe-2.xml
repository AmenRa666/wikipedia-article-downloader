==Untitled==
I don't know if the Pe-2 could really be considered a medium bomber, as the main article suggests.  It's really a WWII Soviet version of the modern-day A10 Warthog.  It was fast, handled well, tooks large amounts of damage, and if it had ever gotten a large caliber cannon installed in the nose, the A10 manufacturers would probably say they based the Warthog off it.

&quot;...some of the women pilots were not sufficiently strong enough to get the airplane airborne by themselves. When such a situation occurred, the procedure was to have one of the crew get behind the pilot's seat and wrap her arms around the control wheel and help the pilot force the wheel back....&quot;
  
An urban myth, surely?  The Russians had heard of trim-tabs!--[[User:Ndaisley|Ndaisley]] 19:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

:Not an urban myth at all.  It's on the Wings of the Red Star series (Discovery Wings-narrated by Peter Ustinov), but I can't remember which one.

:As far as the second crew member helping the pilot, it's true. I've read memoirs of female Pe-2 pilots who talked about this. Also, the UBT machine gun often had to be cocked on the ground because many gunners were not strong enough to do it in the air. - [[User:Emt147|Emt147]] [[User_talk:Emt147|&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Burninate!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 04:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

Powerplant: 2× Klimov M-105PF liquid-cooled V-12, 1,880 kW (2,520 hp) each -&gt; This is wrong, it's half that I guess. [[User:84.77.148.244|84.77.148.244]] 11:16, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

:You are correct, M-105PF was rated for 903 kW (1,210 hp) for takeoff. I'll fix the article.

== Korolev and Glushko's involvement with Pe-2 ==

Vetrov's book on Korolev shows photos of the Pe-2I with the reactive installation RU-1.  As opposed to claim that it was a Pe-2K that was modified.  WHo knows which is correct.  Glushko built the RD-1 engine, and [[Sergei Korolev]] built the airplane installation called RU-1.  The project was ultimate not successful because of frequent hard starts (engine explosions) of the RD-1.

==Soviet Operational History?==
The article deals extensively with Finland's use of 6 Pe-2s, but contains no information on the Soviet's use of their own aircraft.  Can someone with sources please elaborate on this rather important information?
[[User:Dpenn89|Dpenn89]] ([[User talk:Dpenn89|talk]]) 20:04, 12 September 2010 (UTC)

== Ethell? ==

In the references section there is the following:

&quot;Ethell 1996, pp. 152-153.&quot;

That's it.  No reference of Ethell anywhere else in the article or in the bibliography.  No title given for the work being cited.

Checking the edit history, I see that this is not the case of a bibliography entry being accidentally deleted.  Rather, no further information has ever been provided.

So: who is Ethell and where precisely was the statement being referenced made?

-- [[User:G026r|g026r]] ([[User talk:G026r|talk]]) 21:28, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

A really odd reference. Pe-2 was never considered a superior aircraft in comparision with nearly any of WWII dive bombers. Even Arkhangelsky Ar-2 was at least as good as Pe-2, and Tupolev Tu-2 was definitely better [[Special:Contributions/88.147.243.239|88.147.243.239]] ([[User talk:88.147.243.239|talk]]) 21:17, 12 July 2016 (UTC)

== Heavy bomber ==

Can someone confirm the source used in the lede, about this aircraft being described as a heavy bomber. Lack of range, engines, and payload make this a somewhat puzzling description of the aircraft.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/204.116.217.75|204.116.217.75]] ([[User talk:204.116.217.75|talk]]) 00:33, 26 November 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Exclusively a &quot;dive bomber&quot;? ==

:Although fitted with dive brakes etc, the machine appears to have been used more as a multi purpose light bomber. Dive bombing at night is rather risky. I have changed pipe to light bomber in the lede, as it does not appear to have been its primary tactical role. H.T.D.

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Petlyakov Pe-2]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=680149861 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20111019102241/http://luftfart.museum.no/Utstillinger/petlyakov_pe2_snute.htm to http://www.luftfart.museum.no/Utstillinger/petlyakov_pe2_snute.htm

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' to let others know.

{{sourcecheck|checked=false}}
