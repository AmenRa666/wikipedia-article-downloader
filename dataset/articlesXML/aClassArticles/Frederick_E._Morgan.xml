[[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] '''Sir Frederick Edgworth Morgan''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCB}} (5 February 1894 – 19 March 1967) was a senior [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the [[British Army]] who fought in both [[world war]]s. He is best known as the [[chief of staff]] to the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] (COSSAC), the original planner of [[Operation Overlord]].

A graduate of  the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], Morgan was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Field Artillery]] in 1913. During the First World War he served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as an artillery subaltern and staff officer. Afterwards he served two long tours with the British Army in [[British Raj|India]].

Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Morgan was promoted to [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]], which he led during the [[Battle of France]]. In May 1942 he became a lieutenant-general and given command of [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]]. Morgan's headquarters was designated Force 125, and given the task of dealing with a German thrust through Spain to [[Gibraltar]] that never occurred. In March 1943 he was appointed chief of staff to the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] (Designate), or COSSAC. As COSSAC he directed the planning for [[Operation Overlord]]. When [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] became Supreme Allied Commander, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Walter Bedell Smith|Bedell Smith]] became chief of staff at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF), while Morgan became deputy chief of staff.

After the war, Morgan served as Chief of Operations for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) in Germany until his position in Germany was eliminated following publication of &quot;off the record&quot; comments concerning incompetence and corruption within UNRRA, including diverting the resources of UNRRA to support of Zionist ambitions in Palestine. In 1951, Morgan became Controller of Atomic Energy, and was present for [[Operation Hurricane]], the first [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|British atomic weapons]] tests at the [[Montebello Islands]] in 1952. His position was abolished in 1954 with the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] but he remained as Controller of Nuclear Weapons until 1956.

==Early life==
Morgan was born in [[Paddock Wood]], [[Kent]] on 5 February 1894, the eldest son among nine children of Frederick Beverley Morgan, a timber importer, and his wife Clare Elizabeth née Horrocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bond|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised at Mascall's Manor. Paddock Wood. He commenced his education at Hurstleigh, a private school in [[Tunbridge Wells]] in 1902. At an early age it was decided that Frederick would become a [[British Army]] officer, and in 1907 he entered [[Clifton College]], a school noted for its connections with the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. At Clifton he played [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[cricket]], and served in the School Cadet Corps, which became the [[Officers' Training Corps]] in 1908. As a cadet [[sergeant]], he was one of many who lined the route to [[Buckingham Palace]] for the [[Coronation of George V of the United Kingdom]] in 1911. He eventually rose to the rank of [[second lieutenant]]. Morgan duly passed the entrance examination for Woolwich, which he entered in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan was commissioned second lieutenant in the [[Royal Artillery]] on 17 July 1913,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; and joined 41st Battery, [[42nd Brigade Royal Field Artillery|42nd Brigade]], [[Royal Field Artillery]] at [[Aldershot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He volunteered for service in [[India]], and in January 1914 departed on the [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] troopship ''[[HMHS Rewa|Rewa]]'', joining the 84th Battery, 11th Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, which was stationed in [[Jabalpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Morgan's battery departed for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in October 1914 as part of the [[3rd (Lahore) Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan suffered a near-miss from a German [[15 cm sFH 13|5.9-inch gun]] which blew him into the air and buried him in a shell hole, and he was evacuated to hospital in [[Boulogne]] with [[shell shock]]. He was granted a short sick leave in England only to be present when news reached his family that his brother had been killed in action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, pp. 49-51&quot;/&gt; On returning to the front, Morgan became [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Brigadier General]] Edward Spencer Hoare-Nairne, the commander of the Lahore Divisional Artillery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, pp. 49-51&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADC&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29298|startpage=9201|supp=yes|date=16 September 1915|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artillery remained on the Western Front when the bulk of the division departed for the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]. As it took longer to train artillery than infantry, the Lahore divisional artillery acted in turn as the artillery of the [[2nd Canadian Division]], [[3rd Canadian Division]], [[4th Australian Division]] and finally the [[4th Canadian Division]] until their own artillery was sufficiently trained to take over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, pp. 49-51&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan became a staff captain in February 1916,&lt;ref name=&quot;SC1&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29466|startpage=1469 |supp=yes|date=7 February 1916|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to the temporary rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in May 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAPT&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29580|startpage=4823 |supp=yes|date=12 May 1916|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lahore divisional artillery was broken up in mid-1917 and Morgan was posted to the [[42nd (East Lancashire) Division]] as a staff captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, pp. 49-51&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SC2&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30379|startpage=11767|supp=yes|date=14 November 1917|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 1917, he married Marjorie Cecile Whaite, the daughter of Colonel Thomas du Bédat Whaite of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; The couple had met on board the ''Rewa'' en route to India in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage produced two daughters and a son.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; During the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] he served as [[brigade major]] of the 42nd Divisional Artillery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, pp. 49-51&quot;/&gt; During the war he was twice [[mentioned in dispatches]], on 15 May 1917,&lt;ref name=&quot;MID1&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30072|startpage=4750|supp=yes|date=15 May 1917|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on 5 July 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;MID2&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31435|startpage=8497|supp=yes|date=5 July 1919|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
In 1919, Morgan volunteered for a six-year tour of India and joined the 118th Field Battery, [[26th Brigade Royal Field Artillery|26th Field Brigade]], at [[Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut|Deepcut]], where it was forming and training for service in the subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the brigade moved to its new station at [[Jhansi]]. After three years Morgan was posted to [[Attock]], where he commanded the Divisional Ammunition Column. In 1924 he accepted a temporary staff posting as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (DAAG) of Major-General Sir [[Herbert Uniacke]]'s [[1st (Peshawar) Division]] at [[Murree]]. This was followed in 1925 by a year's secondment to the headquarters of Lieutenant-General Sir [[Claud Jacob]]'s [[Northern Command (India)|Northern Command]], where Morgan helped plan and direct large-scale manoeuvres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=64–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan returned to England in 1926, and assumed command of the 22nd Heavy Battery. Equipped with a mixture of [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX – X|9.2 inch guns]], [[BL 6 inch Mk VII naval gun|6 inch guns]], [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12 pounders]] and [[QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun|6 pounders]], it was responsible for the coastal defences of [[Weymouth, Dorset]]. Still a captain, Morgan hoped that his next career move would be to attend the [[Staff College, Camberley]], having narrowly passed the entrance examination. Instead, he was offered a place at the [[Staff College, Quetta]], requiring a return trip to India. Morgan's classmates at Quetta in 1927 and 1928 included [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]], [[John Crocker]], [[Kenneth Arthur Noel Anderson|Kenneth Anderson]], [[David Tennant Cowan|David Cowan]], [[George Alan Vasey]] and [[E. L. M. Burns|Tommy Burns]]. After graduation, Morgan was posted to the 70th Field Battery at [[Lucknow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then was artillery staff officer at headquarters [[Western Command (India)|Western Command]], under [[Brigadier]] [[Henry Karslake]]. When Karslake became major-general, Royal Artillery, at [[India Command|GHQ India]] in 1931, he brought Morgan to [[Delhi]] to serve with him as General Staff Officer (Grade 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=100–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan was finally promoted [[major]] in 1932 and brevet [[lieutenant-colonel]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

Returning to England in 1934, Morgan assumed command of the 4th Anti-Aircraft Battery, which was deployed to [[Malta]] during the diplomatic crisis that accompanied the [[Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=117–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[War Office]] from 1936 to 1938. Here he became increasingly disturbed at the lack of urgency that the government displayed in the face of a war that Morgan and his fellow staff officers felt was inevitable and imminent. That year he was promoted [[colonel]] and became General Staff Officer (Grade 1) of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]], in which Brigadier [[Bernard Montgomery]] commanded a brigade.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

==Second World War==

|quote=I had won notable victories on paper and the map with the aid of greaseproof pencils and a typewriter. In the course of this very campaign, if one may dignify the disaster thus, I had seen French generals create imaginary &quot;masses of manoeuvre&quot; with strokes of the crayon and dispose of hostile concentrations, that unhappily were on the ground as well as on the map, with sweeps of the eraser.

}}
In 1939, Morgan was promoted brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; When the 1st Support Group was shipped to France in May 1940, following the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions. As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of [[Royal Engineers]] and a [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial]] battalion of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], which was in the process of converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce [[51st (Highland) Infantry Division|51st (Highland) Division]] south of the river [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. During a confused retreat most of the Support Group was captured along with the 51st Division at [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]] but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead, pp. 310-311&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mead|2007|pp=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st Armoured Division was subsequently reformed, and became a mobile reserve in south eastern England. It was tasked with counter-attacking an invading German army, and the 1st Support Group was given two Canadian infantry battalions for this purpose. In November 1940 Morgan was appointed Brigadier General Staff at [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]], based in [[Norfolk]]. Morgan was promoted major-general in 1941 and given command of the [[Devon and Cornwall County Division]], a static formation created for coastal defence. In October he assumed command of the [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division]], a second line territorial formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead, pp. 310-311&quot;/&gt;

In May 1942 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general and given command of the I Corps District, which included [[Lincolnshire]] and the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. In October of that year his headquarters became a mobile formation, was redesignated [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] and placed under [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Morgan's corps headquarters was designated Force 125. It was given command of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]] and [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]]s, and the task of dealing with a [[Germany|German]] thrust through [[Spain]] to [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead, pp. 310-311&quot;/&gt;

This operation proved unnecessary, and Morgan's two divisions were sent to North Africa, while he was directed to plan the invasion of [[Sardinia]]. In time this was abandoned in favour of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. I Corps headquarters remained in the United Kingdom the whole time, located at 1 Cumberland near [[Marble Arch]], with the headquarters [[mess]] in the [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons Marble Arch Corner House]]. However, it gained considerable experience in operational planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the Bath]] on 2 June 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;CB&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36033|startpage=2419|supp=yes|date=16 September 1915|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===COSSAC===
At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] agreed to establish a staff to plan operations in north west Europe in 1944. It was envisaged that the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] would be British, and the usual practice was for the commander and the chief of staff to be of the same nationality, so it was decided to appoint a British officer for the role of [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate) (COSSAC), with an American deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1943 Morgan became COSSAC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;  Brigadier General [[Ray Barker]] became his American deputy. Initially, Morgan's staff consisted of an aide, two [[Batman (military)|batmen]] and a driver with a car purloined from I Corps headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, p. 156&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan established his headquarters in [[Norfolk House]] at 31 [[St James's Square]]. However, by October 1943, it was clearly too small for COSSAC needs, which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks. In November and December part of the staff moved to the [[Marsham Towers|South Rotunda]], a bombproof structure that had originally been fitted up as an anti-invasion base, which was connected to the various ministries by the [[Military citadels under London|Whitehall Tunnel]]. Other staff were accommodated at [[Schomberg House|80 Pall Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|U.S. Army|1944|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COSSAC was charged with planning three operations: [[Operation Cockade]], a [[deception]] operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; [[Operation Rankin]], a plan for measures to be taken in the case of a sudden German collapse; and [[Operation Overlord]], a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pogue|1954|pp=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, a group of the COSSAC staff, headed by Barker, travelled to [[Washington D.C.]] to present the Overlord plan to the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and to confer with the U.S. [[United States Department of War|War Department]] about the troop basis for the operation and issues related to its [[civil affairs]] and [[logistics]] aspects. Missions were also exchanged with Eisenhower's [[Allied Force Headquarters]] in [[Algiers]] to coordinate the plans of offensive action in the Mediterranean and north western Europe in 1944. In October and November, Morgan went to Washington, to discuss the operation with the Combined Chiefs of Staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|U.S. Army|1944|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied only by Major General [[Nevil Brownjohn]] and an aide. Morgan met with General [[George Marshall]], who instructed him to proceed with planning on the basis that Marshall would be Supreme Allied Commander and Morgan his chief of staff. Morgan met with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the [[White House]]. Roosevelt turned down Morgan's request for the services of [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr.]] to assist with civil affairs, and also cast doubt on whether Marshall could be spared to become Supreme Allied Commander. While in the United States Morgan visited the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] and the training camps at [[Camp Carrabelle]], [[Fort Benning]], [[Camp Mackall]] and [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|pp=167–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Combined Chiefs of Staff authorised Morgan to issue orders in the name of the Supreme Allied Commander to the [[Commander in Chief|Commanders in Chief]] of the Air, Naval and Land Forces, even though they outranked him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pogue|1954|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Montgomery was appointed Commander in Chief Land Forces for the invasion, in December 1943, he declared that Morgan's original plans were unworkable; they had originally been limited by the availability of landing craft, but Montgomery insisted it would require more men attacking over a wider front. Ultimately, more landing craft were obtained and the invasion was scaled up to Montgomery's satisfaction, at the cost of a month's delay and a reduction in the [[Operation Dragoon|Southern France operation]]. However, all the key features of Morgan's plan remained; the choice of [[Normandy]] as the assault area, the use of [[Mulberry harbour]]s, the deployment of American forces on the right and British on the left, the use of airborne troops to cover the flanks, and some form of diversionary operation in Southern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mead|2007|pp=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SHAEF===
When Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander the COSSAC team was absorbed into [[SHAEF]]. Eisenhower brought his chief of staff for [[Allied Forces Headquarters]], Major General [[Walter Bedell Smith|Bedell Smith]], and moved the headquarters to [[Bushey Park]]. Morgan was offered command of a [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|corps in Italy]] but declined in favour of becoming one of Smith's three deputies. His responsibilities covered Intelligence and Operations. Morgan coordinated the work of various SHAEF divisions and deputised for Bedell Smith when he was absent.&lt;ref name =&quot;Pogue, pp. 63-64&quot;/&gt;

Morgan was also called upon on occasion to deal with Montgomery, with whom his professional relationship as deputy chief of staff was similar to that before the war when Montgomery was a brigade commander. On one occasion Morgan was summoned to Smith's office to find him white with rage at a telephone receiver. &quot;That's your bloody marshal on the other end of that,&quot; Smith explained. &quot;I can't talk to him any more. Now you go on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;As the campaign progressed,&quot; Morgan later wrote, &quot;it became more difficult for us British at SHAEF to provide explanation, as we were continually called upon to do, for the attitude and behaviour of the British authorities as exemplified by their chosen representative in the field.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior British officers at SHAEF, notably Morgan, [[Kenneth Strong]] and [[John Whiteley (British Army officer)|Jock Whiteley]] remained loyal to Eisenhower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mead|2007|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cast a pall over their careers after the war, when Montgomery became [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mead|2007|p=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Smith described Morgan as his British alter ego, &quot;a man I wouldn't willingly have dispensed with&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;Pogue, pp. 63-64&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pogue|1954|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan served in this role until SHAEF was dissolved in June 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in August 1944 &quot;in recognition of distinguished services in connection with the invasion of Normandy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCB&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36668|startpage=3917|supp=yes|date=22 August 1944|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government awarded him the [[Legion of Merit]] in April 1945,&lt;ref name=&quot;LM&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37027|startpage=1947|supp=yes|date=16 April 1945|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1948 for his services.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38178|startpage=401|supp=yes|date=16 January 1948 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==

===UNRRA===
In September 1945 Morgan became the Chief of Operations for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) in Germany. He applied his energy and planning skills to the problem of providing relief to millions of refugees and displaced persons in Europe in the wake of the war. However he became frustrated with the inefficiency of the United Nations organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

Events in the [[British–Zionist conflict]] in the [[British Mandate for Palestine]] made Morgan feel conflicted between his role in assisting Jewish refugees at UNRRA, whom he regarded as special victims of the Nazis for being persecuted solely for their race, and supporting British policy as a British Army officer. In January 1946 he created an uproar by claiming at a press conference that there was a secret [[Zionist]] organisation that was attempting to facilitate an &quot;exodus&quot; of Jewish people from Europe to a new state in Palestine with [[USSR|Soviet]] encouragement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; He later wrote:{{quote|I had been able to piece together a reasonably comprehensive picture of the way in which the UNRRA set up was being most skilfully used to promote what was nothing less than a Zionist campaign of aggression in Palestine. In defiance of the prohibition by the British Mandatory power, reluctant as ever to employ decisive means, the admirably organised Zionist command was employing any and every means of forcing immigration into the country irrespective of the hardship and sufferings of the immigrants, few of whom seemed to have spontaneous enthusiasm for the Zionist cause. The whole project evidently had Russian connivance, if not actual support, since its success would conduce to the elimination of British authority in a vital area of the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, p. 245&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A correspondent reported that Morgan made &quot;casual observations based on what he saw&amp;nbsp;... but the controversial remarks were taken out of the context and put together by correspondents.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=21 January 1946 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934400,00.html |title=The Press: The Morgan Mess |accessdate=30 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UNRRA expected that Morgan would offer his resignation but he did not do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan, p. 245&quot;/&gt; An attempt to clarify his position &quot;off the record&quot; failed, and Morgan's position in Germany was eliminated by UNRRA Director [[Fiorello La Guardia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyman, pp. 144-145&quot;/&gt;

Morgan's statements caused a furore in the press, which portrayed them as anti-Semitic and distasteful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyman, pp. 144-145&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wyman|1989|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Morgan's comments were factual, based on military intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the time in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] that: &quot;Observers here [in Berlin]&amp;nbsp;... are positive of [Morgan's] sincerity, and know he had no intention of feeding the fires of anti-Semitic propaganda.&quot; [[Archibald MacLeish]], a former [[Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs]], stated that when the press had finished with Sir Frederick, &quot;..the sum total effect was a lie and a disastrous and evil lie.  This brings up the question of journalistic standards. In a world as closely integrated as this one is, the question must be asked: what is the standard of truth in journalism? When the journalist is dealing with an inflammatory subject and so reports it that verbally his story is true, but the overall effect is false, are the standards of truth satisfied?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;

With his military background, Morgan was appalled at the corruption, inefficiency and political diversion of UNRRA. A member of his staff said that &quot;to serve such an outfit is degradation beyond description.  In fact, [Morgan wrote], to have been rejected for such service I have always felt to have been a high honour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1961|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic Energy===
Morgan was appointed [[Colonel-Commandant]] of the Royal Artillery in 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; In 1951, he succeeded [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Lord Portal]] as Controller of Atomic Energy. The position had been created in January 1946 as &quot;Controller of Production, Atomic Energy&quot; when the [[Ministry of Supply]] had assumed responsibility for [[nuclear weapon]]s. The job, the title of which was changed to &quot;Controller Atomic Energy&quot; in 1950,  had no written terms of reference, but carried broad responsibility for the coordination of all aspects of nuclear weapons production. Although located within the Ministry of Supply, the controller had direct access to the Prime Minister; Portal rarely exercised this, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely believed that Morgan, who was, in the words of [[Margaret Gowing]], &quot;amiable but not adequate to the task&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gowing &amp; Arnold, p. 4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  had been appointed by mistake, having been confused with his namesake, General Sir [[William Duthie Morgan]]. The latter had greatly impressed Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] as Army member of the Joint Staff Mission to the United States from 1947 to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan therefore relied heavily on his key subordinates, Sir [[John Cockcroft]], [[William Penney, Baron Penney|William Penney]], and [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Christopher Hinton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gowing &amp; Arnold, p. 4&quot;/&gt;

In his role as Controller of Atomic Energy, Morgan was present for [[Operation Hurricane]], the first [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|British atomic weapons]] tests at the [[Montebello Islands]] in October 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; His position was gradually reduced to a figurehead, with his authority largely supplanted by the Atomic Energy Board, which was chaired by [[Lord Cherwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was abolished in 1954 with the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]]. Morgan then became Controller of Nuclear Weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|Smith|1987|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was still an important figure in the push for higher-yield weapons. He pressed for the testing of the [[Green Bamboo]] [[boosted fission weapon]] during [[Operation Mosaic]]. This resulted in Mosaic becoming a two-test series, although Green Bamboo could not be made available in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|Smith|1987|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Green Bamboo assembly was subsequently taken to [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] for [[Operation Grapple]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|Smith|1987|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was deleted from the test series to save money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|Smith|1987|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan was also instrumental in putting the case for the development of the [[H-bomb]] on operational grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan retired in 1956, although he remained Colonel Commandant of the Royal Artillery until 1958. He published his memoirs, entitled ''Peace and War: A Soldier's Life'' in 1961. He died at [[Mount Vernon Hospital]] on 19 March 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;
