The '''Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.8''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] single-seat [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] of [[World War I|the First World War]] designed at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Royal Aircraft Factory]]. Although a clean and well designed little aeroplane for a pusher, it could not escape the drag penalty imposed by its tail structure and was no match for the [[Albatros D.I|Albatros]] fighters of late 1916.  

==Design and development==
With the [[Airco DH.2|D.H.2]], the '''F.E.8''' was  one of the first so-called [[Scout (aircraft)|&quot;scout&quot; aircraft]] designed from the outset as a single-seat fighter. In the absence of a [[synchronization gear]] to provide a forward firing machine gun for a [[Tractor configuration|tractor]] scout such as the [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.2|S.E. 2]], it was given a [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] layout.

On the whole the new design, produced by a team led by [[John Kenworthy]] followed the conventional &quot;Farman&quot; layout, as did the competing [[Airco DH.2]] designed by [[Geoffrey de Havilland]], who had also previously worked at the Royal Aircraft Factory - but it had some novel features.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hare p87&quot;&gt;Hare 1990, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nacelle was, most unusually for the time, an all-metal structure – being framed in steel tube and covered with [[duralumin]]. The prototypes were fitted with large streamlined spinners on the propellers, although these were removed, and the production F.E.8s were built without them. The wings had a narrow chord, giving them a high aspect ratio. They featured dihedral outboard of the wide centre section, and the [[ailerons]] were of unusually long span - occupying the entire wing trailing edge outboard of the tail booms. The booms themselves were attached to the main spar of the tailplane, rather than the rudder post, giving them taper in side elevation rather than in plan, as more usual in a &quot;Farman&quot; style pusher. This allowed the fitting of a variable incidence tailplane, although this was not adjustable in flight, but only on the ground. A single 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Gnome Monosoupape|Gnome 9 &quot;Type B2&quot; ''Monosoupape'']] [[rotary engine]] driving a four-bladed propeller powered the aircraft,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hare p227&quot;&gt;Hare 1990, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; with the capability of taking the lower-powered [[Le Rhône 9C]] 80&amp;nbsp;hp, nine-cylinder rotary.

The new aircraft made its maiden flight on 15 October 1915, flown by Frank Gooden, who was happy with the aircraft's handling.  The aircraft was then armed with a single [[Lewis gun]], which was originally fitted on a movable mount within the nose of the nacelle, with the machine gun's breech almost at the pilot's feet. This proved awkward in practice, and in production machines the gun was mounted directly in front of the pilot, in the manner of the D.H.2. Other changes required before the aircraft entered production included extra fuel to counter criticism from [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]], commander of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in France, that the F.E.8's endurance was too short.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hare p228&quot;&gt;Hare 1990, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new fighter was not a great improvement on the D.H.2 – although a little faster it was rather less manoeverable. It was nonetheless ordered into production from [[Darracq Motor Engineering Company]] and Vickers. Neither manufacturer delivered their F.E.8s particularly quickly, so that the type ended up reaching the front in numbers six months later than the D.H.2.&lt;ref&gt;Cheesman 1960, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The second prototype, serial no. 7457, had a spinner mounted when it was sent  to [[No. 5 Squadron RAF|No. 5 Squadron RFC]] at [[Abeele]] for evaluation on 26 December 1915; this spinner was removed before mid-January 1916. No. 7457 became the nearly exclusive mount of Captain [[Frederick Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;Guttman 2009, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few early production F.E.8s were briefly used by the D.H.2 equipped  [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|No. 29 Squadron RFC]] in June 1916, but it was not until August that [[No. 40 Squadron RAF|No. 40 Squadron]]  became fully operational on the type.  The only other unit to be completely equipped with the type, [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|No. 41 Squadron]], arrived in France in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce RFC p434-5&quot;&gt;Bruce 1982, pp. 434–435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce British p406&quot;&gt;Bruce 1957, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a fairly good start, the F.E.8 units quickly ran into problems with the new German fighters. The only [[flying ace|ace]] on the type was [[Edwin Benbow]]. On 6 March 1917 he was credited with shooting down an Albatross D.III, very probably that of [[Manfred von Richthofen]], who force landed with a holed fuel tank, narrowly escaping incineration.&lt;ref&gt;Guttman 2009, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just three days later, on 9 March, 40 squadron was again involved with [[Jagdstaffel 11]], when nine F.E.8 were engaged by five [[Albatros D.III]]s led by the Baron himself. Four F.E.8s were shot down, four others badly damaged, and the survivor caught fire when landing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce v2 p58&quot;&gt;Bruce 1968, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; After this disaster No. 40 Squadron was re-equipped with [[Nieuport 17|Nieuports]] but No. 41 kept their pushers until July 1917 – becoming the last single-seat pusher fighter squadron in France, using them for [[ground attack]] duties during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce RFC p436&quot;&gt;Bruce 1982, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Two F.E.8s were sent to Home Defence units in 1917, but the type was not adopted as a home defence fighter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce RFC p436&quot;/&gt;

==Reproductions==
[[File:Cole Palen's RAF FE-8-1.jpg|thumb|Cole Palen's F.E.8 reproduction in flight at Old Rhinebeck.]]
[[Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome]]'s founder, [[Cole Palen]], built the first known flyable reproduction of an F.E.8, which is believed to have first flown in 1970 at Old Rhinebeck with a [[Le Rhône 9C]] 80&amp;nbsp;hp rotary engine. It flew in the weekend air shows at Old Rhinebeck for a number of years, before being retired.  It is currently on loan at the [[National Air and Space Museum]].

The Owl's Head Transportation Museum in Maine has another F.E.8 reproduction in its collection, powered by a modern air-cooled, horizontally [[opposed piston|opposed engine]].  It was built in California, before being flown cross country and donated to the Museum upon arrival.
