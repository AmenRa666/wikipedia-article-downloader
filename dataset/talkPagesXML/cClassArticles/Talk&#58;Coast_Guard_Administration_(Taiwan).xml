==(Taiwan)==
''Republic of China Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)'' does not make any sense at all. (Taiwan) should be added right after the ''Republic of China''.--[[User:Jerrypp772000|Jerry]] 22:30, 12 June 2007 (UTC)
:I did that to make it clearer. (Taiwan) may not even be needed because it says that this coast guard is only in charge of Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu. Then it is obvious that this is not the PRC counterpart. [[User:Luden|Luden]] 00:13, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
::But it should appear immediately after ROC.--[[User:Jerrypp772000|Jerry]] 00:53, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
The Taiwan is included for your purposes only. it does not help readers and disambiguate since its very clear that this is not for PRC. [[User:Luden|Luden]] 01:08, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
:Not really, Taiwan should be added after ROC because it serves as the common name, and I'm not asking it to be linked, so it does not cause any confusion at all, I believe.--[[User:Jerrypp772000|Jerry]] 16:08, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

Not moved. The proposal to move to [[:Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)]] would need to be a new nomination. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 08:24, 7 November 2009 (UTC)

* [[:Coast Guard Administration (Republic of China)]] → [[Coast Guard Administration]] — - As far as I can see this organisation's official name is &quot;Coast Guard Administration&quot;. I have done a google search for this term and it comes up as the top result. Having &quot;Republic of China&quot; in brackets is superfluous. [[User:John Smith&amp;#39;s|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] ([[User talk:John Smith&amp;#39;s|talk]]) 19:47, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
* Many nations have coastguards. We need to specify which nation here. [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] ([[User talk:Anthony Appleyard|talk]]) 21:14, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' have to agree with Anthony.  We need to disambiguate between the possible different countries.  '''[[User:GB fan|&lt;span style='color: #ffac2c;background-color: #00422f;'&gt;~~&amp;nbsp;GB&amp;nbsp;fan&amp;nbsp;~~&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:GB fan|&lt;span style='color: #FFA500;'&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:02, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' many regions have ''coast guard''s, and those coast guards have administrations. [[Special:Contributions/70.29.209.91|70.29.209.91]] ([[User talk:70.29.209.91|talk]]) 06:07, 30 October 2009 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - While there are no other aricles with the title &quot;Coast Guard Administration&quot;, it is ambiguous and confusing. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 16:34, 30 October 2009 (UTC)

*How about a move to '''Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)'''? If it's to make it clear whose coastguard it is, use of the word &quot;Taiwan&quot; would be better than Republic of China. ROC just confuses people. [[User:John Smith&amp;#39;s|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] ([[User talk:John Smith&amp;#39;s|talk]]) 19:39, 30 October 2009 (UTC)
**Taiwan/ROC issues are never ''simple''!  I really think it might cause more trouble than it's worth. Taiwan is not the official name of the country, so others may oppose it on that grounds. -[[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 21:02, 30 October 2009 (UTC)
***We can't let potential objections hold the project to ransom. If they have a problem, let them speak. We have articles on Commmunications in Taiwan, Economy of Taiwan, etc - there's no problem there. [[User:John Smith&amp;#39;s|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] ([[User talk:John Smith&amp;#39;s|talk]]) 11:58, 31 October 2009 (UTC)
:''The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the proposal.  &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Please do not modify it.'''&lt;/span&gt; Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on this talk page.

The result of the move request was '''move to [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)]]'''.

----

[[:Coast Guard Administration (Republic of China)]] → [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)]] — If we need a name in brackets to ensure people know where we're talking about, I suggest &quot;Taiwan&quot; for absolute clarity. Most people don't know what the ROC is and as ROC isn't part of the organisation's title there's no need to confuse them. After all we already have articles on [[Economy of Taiwan]], etc. --[[User:John Smith&amp;#39;s|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] ([[User talk:John Smith&amp;#39;s|talk]]) 13:48, 15 November 2009 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. In general I also think that Taiwan is clearer for most readers than Republic of China. It's a better disambiguator. [[User:WikiLaurent|Laurent]] ([[User talk:WikiLaurent|talk]]) 22:48, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
:''The above discussion is preserved as an archive of a [[WP:RM|requested move]].  &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Please do not modify it.'''&lt;/span&gt; Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on this talk page. No further edits should be made to this section.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Template:RM bottom --&gt;

Oops! I think my browser stopped loading the rest of the page, as I didn't see this minimal-participation discussion when I reverted the move. While I am opposed to the move on the basais that the nation is called the Republic of China, and the CGA covers other islands besides Tawain. However, I missed this proposal at the time because I had lost my watchlist - It is consensual, if barely so, therefore it should be at [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)]] per the MOS. I am considering proposing moving it back to the name of the actual country/government, and will probably do so in a few days. Thanks. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 22:48, 15 December 2009 (UTC)
:In the meantime, if you don't mind I'm going to move it back to [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)]]. If you wish to open another move request, please feel free to do so. [[User:WikiLaurent|Laurent]] ([[User talk:WikiLaurent|talk]]) 22:56, 15 December 2009 (UTC)

::No problem. I did state that, but not explicitly, nor did I make a move request ot undo my move. I waould have done so later today if someone did not discover it in the meantime, which you did do. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 23:26, 15 December 2009 (UTC)
