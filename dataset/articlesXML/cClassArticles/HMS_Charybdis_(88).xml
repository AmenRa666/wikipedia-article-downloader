'''HMS ''Charybdis''''' was a {{sclass-|Dido|cruiser}} of the [[Royal Navy]]. She served during the [[Second World War]] and was sunk with heavy loss of life by German [[torpedo boat]]s in an action in the [[English Channel]] in October 1943.

==Design and construction==

''Charybdis'' was intended to fulfill a primarily [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft role]] and was designed with a primary armament of ten [[QF 5.25 inch gun]]s. This gun had also been selected as the secondary armament for the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|0}} [[battleship]]s also under construction at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ireland184&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ireland|title=The Illustrated Guide to Cruisers|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delays in the delivery of the turrets, prioritised for the battleships after the outbreak of the Second World War, resulted in several of the ''Dido'' class being fitted with different primary armament. ''Charybdis'' and another ''Dido''-class cruiser, {{HMS|Scylla|98|6}}, were armed with four twin [[QF 4.5 inch naval gun|QF 4.5&amp;nbsp;in Mk.III guns]] instead of the 5.25 inch guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=|title=Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships 1922–1946|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 4.5 inch guns had originally been intended for the {{sclass-|Danae|cruiser}}s as part of an upgrade programme. ''Scylla'' and ''Charybdis''{{'}}s armament put them on a par with the {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1936)|0}} destroyers for surface action, but with much superior high angle capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ireland184&quot;/&gt; ''Charybdis'' differed from ''Scylla'' in having a single [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF 4 inch Mk V gun]] mounted. Her armament changed during her time in service, with the 4 inch Mk V gun removed in an early 1943 refit and ten [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm guns]] added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways&quot;/&gt; As originally fitted, ''Charybdis'' also had eight [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2 pounder guns]] arranged in two quadruple mountings, and six 21&amp;nbsp;inch torpedo tubes arranged above water in two triple banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways&quot;/&gt;

Like the other ships of the class, ''Charybdis'' was named after a character in [[Greek mythology]]. [[Charybdis]] is the name of a sea monster, usually mentioned alongside [[Scylla]], the name given to another ''Dido''-class ship, in the idiom &quot;[[between Scylla and Charybdis]]&quot;. She was laid down at the yards of [[Cammell Laird]] at [[Birkenhead]] on 9 November 1939, and launched on 17 September 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Colledge &amp; Warlow|title=Ships of the Royal Navy|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; After fitting out and undergoing trials, she was completed for service on 3 December 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}

==Service==

===Home waters and Mediterranean===
After trials ''Charybdis'' joined the [[Home Fleet]] and in December 1941 escorted the 1st Minelaying Squadron during Operation SN81, the laying of [[naval mine|mines]] in the [[Northern Barrage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CL-Charybdis.htm|title=HMS Charybdis (88): Light cruiser of the Dido class|accessdate=3 August 2012 |author=Gordon Smith|work=Service Histories of Royal Navy Warships in World War 2|date=3 June 2011|publisher=naval-history.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained with the Home Fleet into 1942, and in March was adopted by the civil community of Birkenhead, [[Cheshire]], where she had been built, after a [[Warship Week]] savings campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt; On 30 March ''Charybdis'' sailed as an escort for another minelaying operation, SN87.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt; In April 1942 she was assigned to join [[Force H]] at [[Gibraltar]], and sailed for there as an escort for the aircraft carrier {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|6}}  and battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}. ''Charybdis'' joined Force W at Gibraltar and escorted ''Wasp'' into the Mediterranean to deliver aircraft to [[Malta]] as part of [[Operation Calendar]]. After the aircraft had been successfully flown off, ''Charybdis'' returned to Gibraltar with ''Wasp'', and escorted her part of the way into the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt; Deployed for the next few months with Force W, ''Charybdis'' escorted a number of aircraft carriers on journeys into the Mediterranean to a point where their aircraft could be flown off to reinforce Malta. As one of the escorting ships, ''Charybdis'' screened ''Wasp'' and the British carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}} for [[Operation Bowery]] in early May, and ''Eagle'' and {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} at the end of the month in Operation LB.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;  Aircraft carrier operations continued into June 1942, with ''Charybdis'' supporting Operation Style and then Operation Salient.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;

On 11 June Force W, including ''Charybdis'', joined the carriers ''Eagle'' and ''Argus'', with further escort provided by the battleship {{HMS|Malaya}}, the cruisers {{HMS|Kenya|14|6}} and {{HMS|Liverpool|C11|6}} and a number of destroyers to screen [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]]. The convoy in Operation Harpoon was run in conjunction with a convoy from Egypt, Operation Vigorous, both of which tried to supply food and [[matériel]] by splitting enemy forces. In July 1942 ''Charybdis'' covered Operations Pinpoint and Insect, two more carrier deliveries of aircraft to Malta. By August 1942 ''Charybdis'' joined Force Z to provide an escort for HMS ''Eagle'' in the Malta convoy [[Operation Pedestal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;

===Operation Pedestal===
[[File:HMS Charybdis screening.jpg|thumb|left|[[Operation Pedestal]]: 12 August 1942: {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} on fire after being bombed. HMS ''Charybdis'' is screening the carrier.]]
Operation Pedestal was built around a 15-ship convoy of merchantmen, escorted by a powerful force consisting of two battleships, four aircraft carriers, seven cruisers and twenty six destroyers. The convoy came under heavy air and U-boat attack, sustaining high losses. HMS ''Eagle'' was sunk by torpedoes from German submarine {{GS|U-73|1940|2}}, and only five merchant ships, including the damaged tanker {{SS|Ohio}}, survived to reach Malta. After ''Eagle''{{'}}s sinking, ''Charybdis'' launched a series of [[depth charge]] attacks in an unsuccessful hunt for ''U-73''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAC136&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Moses|title=At All Costs|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then stood by the damaged carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} and provided anti-air defence while salvage operations were carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAC155&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Moses|title=At All Costs|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July the taskforce's commander, Admiral [[Edward Neville Syfret]], sent her to join Force X, in company with {{HMS|Eskimo|F75|6}} and {{HMS|Somali|F33|6}}, as the merchants came under heavy air attack while passing through the [[Strait of Sicily]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AAC171&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Moses|title=At All Costs|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Charybdis'' took the place of the crippled {{HMS|Manchester|15|6}} for this, before returning to Force Z on 14 July and continuing to engage enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;

===Atlantic and return to the Mediterranean===
The focus of ''Charybdis''{{'}}s operations changed in September 1942, and she was assigned to patrol in the Atlantic, searching for German [[blockade runner]]s attempting to reach Atlantic ports from the Far East.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt; At the end of October she took part in Operation Train, escorting the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} with further aircraft reinforcements for Malta. On 25 November 1942 she was allocated to the 12th Cruiser Squadron in Force H and sailed from Gibraltar for [[Algiers]] to take part in [[Operation Torch]] - the landings in [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt; She escorted the invasion convoys and provided bombardment support for the land forces, as well as anti-air defence. On 12 December 1942 ''Charybdis'' sailed for the [[United Kingdom]] to undergo a refit.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;

''Charybdis'' joined the Home Fleet after the completion of the work and trials in March 1943. Initially based at [[Scapa Flow]], she covered minelaying operations and patrolled the [[North Sea]] until April 1943, when she was transferred temporarily to the [[Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth|Plymouth Command]]. There she was assigned to escort allied convoys and patrol in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. ''Charybdis'' was again back in Gibraltar in August 1943 and from there escorted Mediterranean convoys.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;

In September ''Charybdis'' was part of Force V covering Operation Avalanche, the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|landings at Salerno]]. During her time off the Italian coast she carried US General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to Salerno. She returned to Plymouth the following month and resumed patrols in the [[Bay of Biscay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;

==Operation Tunnel and sinking==
{{Main|Battle of Sept-Îles}}
In late 1943, the British authorities were aware of the approach of the German [[blockade runner]], ''Münsterland'', which was carrying an important cargo of [[latex]] and strategic metals. The Germans had a well-rehearsed procedure for escorting such vessels. The British reacted by executing [[Operation Tunnel]], a standard operation whereby available ships would attempt to intercept. ''Charybdis'' was assigned to the operation on 20 October, and on 22 October the British force put to sea. With ''Charybdis'' were the fleet destroyers {{HMS|Grenville|R97|6}} and {{HMS|Rocket|H92|2}} and four {{sclass2-|Hunt|destroyer}}s; {{HMS|Limbourne|L57|2}}, {{HMS|Wensleydale|L86|2}}, {{HMS|Talybont|L18|2}} and {{HMS|Stevenstone|L16|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt; ''Münsterland''{{'}}s escorts consisted of five {{sclass-|Elbing|torpedo boat}}s, comprising the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, commanded by [[Franz Kohlauf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NH2&quot;/&gt;

''Charybdis'' picked up the convoy on its radar at 7 miles distance, but did not intercept radio transmissions, HMS ''Limbourne'' heard radio transmissions but could not pick up the ships on radar as ''Charybdis'' was blocking its view. At 1:38am German torpedo boat ''T-23'', under the command of [[Friedrich-Karl Paul]], spotted ''Charybdis'', which was hit on the port side by two torpedoes out of a salvo of six fired by ''T-23'' and ''T-27''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;WFTLR&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Fowler |first=Will |title=The Last Raid: The Commandos, Channel Islands and Final Nazi Raid |publisher=The History Press |ISBN=978-0750966375}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}} ''Limbourne'' was also hit during this action and was later scuttled by HMS ''Rocket''. The German force escaped unharmed. ''Charybdis'' sank within half an hour, in position {{coord|48|59|N|3|39|W|display=inline, title|type:event}}, with the loss of over 400 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} Four officers and 103 ratings survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NH2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW2Ships-CharybdisAsr.htm|title= H.M.S.  Charybdis: A Record of Her Loss and Commemoration|accessdate=3 August 2012 |author=Charybdis Association|work=World War 2 at Sea|date=1 December 2010|publisher=naval-history.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Münsterland'' was eventually forced ashore and destroyed west of [[Cap Blanc Nez]] on 21 January 1944 by fire from British coastal artillery after she ran aground.&lt;ref name=WFTLR/&gt;{{rp|131}}

==Legacy and commemoration==
[[File:St Helier War Cemetery Howard Davis Park 3.jpg|thumb|A number of bodies washed ashore from the sunken ''Charybdis'' were buried in the war cemetery in [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]], [[Jersey]]]]
''Charybdis'' gained six battle honours during her service: [[Malta Convoys]] 1942, [[Operation Torch|North Africa]] 1942, [[Operation Avalanche (World War II)|Salerno]] 1943, [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] 1943, [[English channel#Second World War|English Channel]] 1943 and Biscay 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Warlow|title=Battle Honours of the Royal Navy|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the sinking, the bodies of 21 Royal Navy and Royal Marine men were washed up in [[Guernsey]]. The [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation]] authorities buried them with full military honours. The funerals became an opportunity for some of the islanders to demonstrate their loyalty to Britain and their opposition to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupiers: around 5,000 islanders attended the funeral, laying some 900 wreaths - enough of a demonstration against the Nazi occupation for subsequent military funerals to be closed to civilians by the German occupiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH2&quot;/&gt; Every year a commemoration service is held, which is attended by survivors of the action and their relatives, the Guernsey Association of Royal Navy and Royal Marines, [[Sea Cadets]], [[St. John Ambulance|St John's Ambulance Brigade]], the Police, the [[Red Cross]] and representatives of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NH2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guernsey/content/articles/2004/10/06/hms_charybdis_feature.shtml|title= Local History: HMS Charybdis|accessdate=3 August 2012 |author=|date= 7 October 2008|publisher=BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodies of other men are buried in Jersey at St Helier (38), and in France at Dinard  (96), St Brieuc (47), Ile de Brehat (1), St Germain sur Ay (1) and St Charles de Percey (2).

The wrecks of ''Charybdis'' and ''Limbourne'' have been located. ''Charybdis'' was found in 1993, lying in 83 metres of water.
