{{Campaignbox Battle of Aleppo}}

The '''October–December 2013 Aleppo offensive''' or '''Operation Northern Storm'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-hezbollah-advance-in-southern-and-eastern-aleppo-latest-map-update/|title=Syrian Army and Hezbollah Advance in Southern and Eastern Aleppo – Latest Map Update|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|date=11 November 2015|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a campaign during the [[Syrian civil war]] launched by the [[Syrian army]] in the [[Aleppo Governorate]] to reopen a key supply route linking central Syria to the largest city, [[Aleppo]]. The offensive began when the [[Syrian Army]] attacked the strategic town of [[Khanasir]].

== Background ==
In June 2013, after their strategic [[Battle of al-Qusayr (2013)|capture of al-Qusayr]], government forces launched an offensive called Northern Storm in Aleppo Province aimed at securing supply lines between disparate patches of control in the province. However, increased rebel pressure in [[Homs Governorate|Homs Province]] led the government to abandon the offensive and redeploy its troops there, leaving its supply lines to Aleppo city vulnerable to attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;adiyat dabha&quot;/&gt;

Later in the summer, rebels capitalised on this strategic weakness. In late July, rebels launched an offensive west of Aleppo city culminating in the capture of several suburbs and [[Khan al-Assal massacre|a massacre of captured government soldiers]], and on 5 August, the long-besieged Menagh Airbase in the north of the province [[Siege of Menagh Air Base|fell to the rebels]]. On 26 August, rebels captured the strategic town of Khanasir, thus cutting the government's last land supply route to the contested city of Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013826124946176888.html|title=Syria rebels take control of strategic town|date=26 August 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebels then turned their sights to the government-controlled southern countryside of Aleppo. On 20 September, a coalition of at least ten rebel groups led by [[Ahrar ash-Sham]] and the [[Tawhid Brigade]] launched an offensive called [http://quran.com/100 ''wal-'Adiyat Dabha''] against government positions between the southern edge of the city and the defence factories outside of rebel-held [[Al-Safira]]. In the first six days of the offensive, rebels made significant advances, claiming to have captured at least 25 villages.&lt;ref&gt;Names of villages (from The Institute for the Study of War): Kafr Hout, al-Zaraa, Kafr Kar, Banan al-Has, Sarj Far'a, Balouza, Burj 'Azawi, Madrasa village, Im Jaran, Qanatrat, Samaria, Maghriyat al-Shebli, al-Mayan, al-Manatir, Rasm al-Safa, Rasm Humud, Mazraa Ali Hussein, Diyman, Sada’aya, Rasm al-Shih, Mazraa al-Ayoub, Rasm al-Hilwa, Tayeba, Rasm 'Akirish, and al-Sufayrah&lt;/ref&gt; In response, government forces from [[Aleppo International Airport]] redeployed south to counter the rebel offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;adiyat dabha&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iswsyria.blogspot.com/2013/09/offensives-in-aleppo-from-july.html|title=The wal-'Adiyat Dabha Offensive in Southern Aleppo|last=Caris|first=Charlie|author2=Isabel Nassief|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Institute for the Study of War|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The offensive ==

=== Capture of Khanasir and reopening of the highway ===
To reopen supply lines to Aleppo city, the government launched a counteroffensive along the so-called &quot;Desert Road&quot; between Aleppo and [[al-Salamiyah]], dispatching a large convoy from the latter backed with heavy air support. Khanasir, captured by rebels in August, was the first major objective of the Army as it occupies a critical chokepoint on the road.

On 1 October, the shelling of Khanasir and fighting between the Army and rebels in the vicinity of the town killed at least 20 rebel fighters. The village of Jub al-Ghaws, near of Khanasir was bombed by helicopters while, according to SOHR, rebel fighters hit a fighter airplane above Khanasir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/tuesday-1-october-2013/ |title=Tuesday 1 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October, according to SOHR, the Syrian Army progressed in Khanasir, taking control of parts of the city while a large number of rebel positions were hit by the Air Force in the province; al-Atareb, Khan al-A'sal, Kafrnaha and Minnegh military airport.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

On 3 October, the Army took back control of Khanasir, with at least 25 rebel fighters and 18 pro-government militiamen being killed between 1 and 2 October. However, the military had not yet reopened the highway to Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/in-focus/syria/syria-army-retakes-northern-strategic-town-1.1238911 |title=Syria army retakes northern strategic town |publisher=Gulfnews.com |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/wednesday-2-october-2013/ |title=Wednesday 2 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October, eight rebels were killed during fighting with the Army in the al-Hmeira mountain, near [[al-Safira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/friday-4-october-2013/ |title=Friday 4 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=5 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October, the Army managed to reopen the supply route between Aleppo and Khanasir, capturing many surrounding villages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Syria_Live_Blog/92310948 |title=Syria Live Blog |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=7 October 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Rasm Okeiresh, Rasm al-Sheikh, Rasm al-Helou, Rasm Bakrou, al-Wawiyeh, Rasm al-Safa, Barzanieh, Jalagheem, Zarraa, and Kafar Akkad,&lt;ref name=&quot;english.al-akhbar.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/syrian-army-ends-opposition-siege-aleppo |title=Syrian Army Ends Opposition Siege on Aleppo |publisher=[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)]] |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; breaking the siege of Aleppo. According to a governorate source, convoys carrying flour, food supplies, and fuel, went to Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;english.al-akhbar.com&quot;/&gt;

On 9 October, rebels massacred government soldiers in a village that had only just been captured by the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;rage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Dagher |first=Sam |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303382004579127881524159704.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011071222/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303382004579127881524159704.html |archivedate=11 October 2013 |title=Battles Rage Around Syria Chemical Weapons Sites |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the governorate, the Army took the control of other villages; Al-Hamam, Al-Qurbatiy and rebels retreating to Al-Qintein and Al-Bouz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syrianewsdesk.com/en/2013/10/09/news-regime-forces-control-hama-aleppo-highway |title=Regime forces control the Hama-Aleppo highway |publisher=Syria Newsdesk |date= |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capture of al-Safira and Tell Aran ===

On 10 October, heavy Army shelling and air-strikes of the rebel-held town [[al-Safira]] killed 16-18 civilians. One of the areas that was hit was the town's market. According to one rebel, if opposition forces lost control of al-Safira everything they had accomplished over the previous year in Aleppo would be lost in a matter of days.&lt;ref name=&quot;rage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/thursday-10-october-2013/ |title=Thursday 10 October 2013 |publisher=Supportkurds.org |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October, after clashes, the Army captured the village of Abu Jurayn, in the south of al-Safira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/837206/syrie-violents-combats-pres-dun-site-chimique-presume.html |title=Syrie: violents combats près d'un site chimique présumé |publisher=L'Orient-Le Jour |date= |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 and 18 October, heavy Army shelling of the rebel-held Kurdish town of [[Tell Aran]] left 21 civilians dead. 11 others were also injured. The town had been captured from Kurdish militants by jihadist rebels earlier in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;friday&quot;/&gt;

By 25 October 76 people had been killed in the shelling of al-Safira since 8 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambush&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/world/229227061.html |title=Syrian media say troops ambush, kill 40 rebels near Damascus; Kurdish fighters battle jihadis |publisher=Startribune.com |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130,000 people fled the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msf.org/article/syria-civilians-forced-flee-al-safira-under-heavy-bombardment |title=Syria: Civilians forced to flee Al Safira under heavy bombardment |publisher=Msf.org |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October, the Syrian army entered al-Safira and took over several buildings in the southern part of the city and also advanced on the eastern side the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2013/Nov-01/236453-government-pushes-ahead-with-campaign-in-aleppo-damascus.ashx#axzz2jayn9oCh |title=Government pushes ahead with campaign in Aleppo, Damascus |publisher=Dailystar.com.lb |date= |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the morning of 1 November, the Army captured the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2013/Nov-01/236495-syrian-forces-capture-town-near-chemical-weapons-site-activists.ashx#axzz2hs2ziHUm|title=Syrian forces capture town near chemical weapons site: Activists|publisher=Daily Star|date=1 November 2013|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November, the Army, supported by [[Hezbollah]] officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriahr.net/en/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=1081&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews#.Up4m58RDufU |title=the Regular forces took hold of the al-A'ziziya village |publisher=Syriahr.net |date=2 November 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; captured the village of Aziziyeh on the northern outskirts of Safira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/warplanes-strike-rebel-area-near-damascus-monitor-143404251.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104234935/http://news.yahoo.com/warplanes-strike-rebel-area-near-damascus-monitor-143404251.html |archivedate=4 November 2013 |title=Air raids on rebel areas near Damascus, Kurds advance: NGO|work=Agence France Presse|publisher=Yahoo!

On 4 November, following the loss of Al-Safira, the [[Free Syrian Army]] commander for the province of Aleppo, [[Abdul Jabbar al-Oqaidi]], resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailystar.com.lb&quot;/&gt;

On 6 November, the Army captured most of the Kurdish town of [[Tell Aran]] forcing opposition fighters out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/nowsyrialatestnews/519409-sana-bomb-blast-kills-8-in-central-damascus |title=Deadly bomb rocks central Damascus |publisher=[[NOW News]] |date= |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Syria_Live_Blog/95403606 |title=A bomb explosion rocked the heart of the Syrian ca... |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fighting was still occurring in Tell Aran as of 10 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dominic |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/10/us-syria-crisis-conflict-idUSBRE9A90D620131110 |title=Syrian army retakes northern military base in third day of clashes |publisher=Reuters.com |date=10 November 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Army secured the town by the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;reopen&quot;/&gt;

=== Battle of Base 80 ===

On 8 November, before sunrise, the Syrian Army launched an attack against &quot;[[Base 80]]&quot;, controlled by the rebels since February 2013, near the Aleppo airport. The Army, backed up by tanks and heavy artillery, unleashed &quot;the heaviest barrage in more than a year&quot; according to residents in Aleppo. A rebel fighter said, &quot;We did not see it coming.
