First established in May 1947 as a fitting resting place for Filipino military personnel from privates to generals who served during [[World War II]], it eventually became designated as the official place of burial for deceased [[President of the Philippines|Philippine Presidents]], national heroes, patriots, [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artists]] and [[National Scientist of the Philippines|National Scientists]].

Among those buried in the cemetery are Filipino soldiers who died during the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|Philippine Campaign]] and the [[Philippines campaign (1944–45)|Allied Liberation of the Philippines]] in World War II from 1941 to 1945.

==History==
[[File:Libingan Ng Mga Bayani.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Libingan ng mga Bayani at ng mga Dating Pangulo or Heroes' Cemetery]] 
The cemetery was first established in May 1947 as the Republic Memorial Cemetery. It was first established as a tribute and final resting place for the 33,520 Filipino soldiers who died during the Philippine Campaign (1941–42) and the Allied Liberation of the Philippines (1944-45) in World War II.&lt;ref name=Libingan1&gt;{{cite web|last=La Putt|first=Juny|title=Libingan ng mga Bayani (Cemetery of the Heroes)||url=http://corregidorisland.com/bayani/libingan.html|publisher=CorregidorIsland.com|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libingan ng mga Bayani |work=Taguig Landmarks|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/tourism/taguig-landmarks/|publisher=City Government of Taguig|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established as the Filipino counterpart to the [[Manila American Cemetery and Memorial]], which houses the remains of [[United States]] personnel who died during the same war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodell|first=Paul A.|title=Culture and customs of the Philippines|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|page=93|isbn=0-313-30415-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=libingan+ng+mga+bayani&amp;lr=|accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 1948, Philippine President Elpidio Quirino signed into law the Republic Act 289, also known as ''An Act Providing for the Construction of a National Pantheon for Presidents of the Philippines, National Heroes, and Patriots of the Country''.&lt;ref name=Libingan2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno289.html |title=Republic Act No. 289-An Act Providing for the Construction of a National Pantheon for Presidents of the Philippines, National Heroes, and Patriots of the Country |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1 of the Act cites the purpose of creating such pantheon: 

{{quotation|&quot;''To perpetuate the memory of all the Presidents of the Philippines, national heroes and patriots for the inspiration and emulation of this generation and of generations still unborn...''&quot;&lt;ref name=Libingan2/&gt;}} 

While such National Pantheon was never established during Quirino's lifetime,&lt;ref name=Libingan3&gt;{{cite web|title=Why not Libingan ng mga Pangulo instead? |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/30/11/why-not-libingan-ng-mga-pangulo-instead|publisher=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; several decrees and laws passed under succeeding administrations led to the eventual use of the Republic Memorial Cemetery as a national pantheon described in Republic Act 289.

On 27 October 1954, President [[Ramon Magsaysay]] renamed the Republic Memorial Cemetery as the Libingan ng mga Bayani.&lt;ref name=Libingan1/&gt; On 28 May 1967, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] issued Presidential Proclamation No. 208 ordering the reservation of 142 hectares of land within Fort Bonifacio in consideration for the Libingan to serve not only as a cemetery for military personnel but also as a national shrine for fallen heroes. He ordered it placed under the administration of the Military Shrines Services of the [[Philippine Veterans Affairs Office]], an agency under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]].&lt;ref name=Libingan1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Libingan4&gt;{{cite web|title=Libingan ng mga Bayani |work=Our Heritage and the Departed: A Cemeteries Tour |url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/undas-2012-a-cemeteries-tour/|publisher=Presidential Museum and Library|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 1986, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff [[Fidel Ramos]] and President [[Corazon Aquino]] issued Armed Forces Regulations G 161-373, also known as &quot;''The allocation of Cemetery Plots at the LNMB''&quot;. This military-issued regulation established the internment policy that would become the basis for the burial of personalities at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.&lt;ref name=Libingan6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/77188-quick-facts-about-the-presidency/ |title=Quick facts about the Presidency |publisher=Presidential Museum and Library |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Libingan7&gt;{{cite web|last=D.

In 2007, due to overcrowding at the Fort Bonifacio site, the cemetery's administration started exploring sites for Libingan ng mga Bayani annexes in [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. Only one has been completed so far, the [[Philippine peso|₱]]24-million, five-hectare extension at Camp Hernandez in [[Dingle, Iloilo|Dingle]], [[Iloilo province|Iloilo]].&lt;ref name=Libingan5&gt;{{cite web|last=Dizon |first=Nikko |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&amp;dat=20071104&amp;id=i1Q1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YiUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2231,14937628&amp;hl=en |title=Burial space for soldiers running out |date=4 November 2007 |publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Libingan ng mga Bayani.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tombstones of fallen Filipino soldiers at the Heroes' Cemetery]]
The first structure that visitors will see upon entering the grounds of the cemetery complex is the Heroes Memorial Gate, a large concrete tripod with a stairway leading to an upper view deck with a metal sculpture at the center.&lt;ref name=Libingan1/&gt; Erected on opposite sides of the main entrance road near the Heroes Memorial Gate are two 12-foot high black stone walls which bear the words that [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]] uttered during a journey to the Philippines in 1961: &quot;I do not know the dignity of his birth, but I do know the glory of his death.&quot;&lt;ref name=Libingan1/&gt;

The main structure, located at the center of the cemetery, is the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], where wreath laying ceremonies are held when Philippine government officials and foreign dignitaries visit the cemetery. Inscripted on the tomb are the words: &quot;Here lies a Filipino soldier whose name is known only to God.&quot; Behind the tomb are three marble pillars representing the three main island groups in the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.&lt;ref name=Libingan1/&gt;

There are several pylons as well commemorating the gallantry of Filipino soldiers who died in various wars in world history. These include the Korean Memorial Pylon, which honors 112 Filipino officers and men who were members of the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea|Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK)]] who perished during the [[Korean War]]; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Pylon, which was dedicated to the members of the Philippine contingent and Philippine civic action groups (PHILCON-V and PHILCAG-V) that were sent to [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1964 to 1971; and the Philippine World War II Guerrillas Pylon, which was erected by the Veterans Federation of the Philippines as a testimony to the indomitable spirit and bravery of the Filipino guerrillas of World War II.&lt;ref name=Libingan1/&gt;
