'''Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge''' (July 27, 1904 – July 14, 1996) was an American physicist at [[Harvard University]] who did work on [[cyclotron]] research. His precise measurements of mass differences between nuclear isotopes allowed him to confirm [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass-energy equivalence]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pound, Robert V.|authorlink=Robert Pound|title=Obituary: Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge|journal=[[Physics Today]]|date=January 1997|volume=50|issue=1|pages=80–82|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v50/i1/p80_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.881651|bibcode = 1997PhT....50a..80P }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Director of the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Trinity nuclear test]], which took place July 16, 1945. Bainbridge described the Trinity explosion as a &quot;foul and awesome display&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;/&gt; He remarked to [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] immediately after the test, &quot;Now we are all sons of bitches.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;/&gt; This marked the beginning of his dedication to ending the testing of nuclear weapons and to efforts to maintain civilian control of future developments in that field.

==Early life==
Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge was born in [[Cooperstown, New York]], the second of three sons of William Warin Bainbridge and Mary Grinnell Tompkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geni.com/people/Kenneth-Bainbridge/6000000008114148523 |title=Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge   (1904 - 1996)|publisher=Geni.com |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=4}} He was educated at [[Horace Mann School]] in New York. While at high school he developed an interest in [[ham radio]] which inspired him to enter [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1921 to study [[electrical engineering]]. In five years he earned both [[bachelor of science]] (S.B.) and [[master of science]] (S.M.) degrees. During the summer breaks he worked at [[General Electric]]'s laboratories in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] and [[Schenectady, New York]]. While there he obtained three patents related to [[phototube|photoelectric tubes]].{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|1901577|Photo-electric tube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|1901578|Method of preparing photo-electric tubes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|2206713|Photoelectric apparatus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally this would have been a promising start to a career at General Electric, but it made Bainbridge aware of how interested he was in [[physics]].  Upon graduating from MIT in 1926, he enrolled at [[Princeton University]], where [[Karl T. Compton]], a consultant to General Electric, was on the faculty.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=5}} In 1929, he was awarded a Ph.D. in his new field, writing his thesis on &quot;A search for [[element 87]] by analysis of positive rays&quot; under the supervision of [[Henry DeWolf Smyth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.nd.edu/chemistry/resources/genealogy/physics/documents/BainbridgeKT.pdf |publisher=[[Notre Dame University]] |title=Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge (1904–1996) Ph.D. Princeton 1929 |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Bainbridge enjoyed a series of prestigious fellowships after graduation. He was awarded a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], and then a Bartol Research Foundation fellowship. At the time the [[Franklin Institute]]'s Bartol Research Foundation was located on the [[Swarthmore College]] campus in Pennsylvania, and was directed by [[W. F. G. Swann]], an English physicist with an interest in [[nuclear physics]].{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=6}} Bainbridge married Margaret (&quot;Peg&quot;) Pitkin, a member of the Swarthmore teaching faculty, in September 1931.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=6}} They had a son, Martin Keeler, and two daughters, Joan and Margaret Tomkins.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|pp=7, 9}}

In 1932, Bainbridge developed a [[mass spectrometer]] with a resolving power of 600 and a relative precision of one part in 10,000.&lt;ref name='Audi 2006'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The history of nuclidic masses and of their evaluation|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry |date=April 1, 2006 |first=Georges|last=Audi|volume=251|issue=2–3|pages=85–94|doi= 10.1016/j.ijms.2006.01.048|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VND-4JKRWJX-2/2/628018a7bf50a32b4cdba32b77f181c8|format=|accessdate=April 11, 2008 |arxiv = physics/0602050 |bibcode = 2006IJMSp.251...85A }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this instrument to verify [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass-energy equivalence]], E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Equivalence of Mass and Energy|journal=Phys. Rev.|date=July 1933|first=Kenneth T.|last=Bainbridge|volume=44|issue=2|pages=123|doi= 10.1103/PhysRev.44.123.2|url=|format=|accessdate= |bibcode = 1933PhRv...44..123B }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis William Aston]] wrote that:{{quote|By establishing accurate comparisons of the masses of the light particles concerned in nuclear disintegrations, particularly that of &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, discovered by Cockcroft and Walton, he achieved a noteworthy triumph in the experimental proof of the fundamental theory of Einstein of the equivalence of mass and energy.{{sfn|Aston|1933|p=85}} }}

In 1933, Bainbridge was awarded a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which he used to travel to England and work at [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at [[Cambridge University]]. While there he continued his work developing the mass spectrograph, and became friends with the British physicist [[John Cockcroft]].{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=6}}

When his Guggenheim fellowship expired in September 1934, he returned to the United States, where he accepted an associate professorship at [[Harvard University]]. He started by building a new mass spectrograph that he had designed with at the Cavendish Laboratory. Working with [[J. Curry Street]], he commenced work on a [[cyclotron]].{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=6}} They had a design for a {{convert|37|in|adj=on}} cyclotron provided by [[Ernest Lawrence]], but decided to build a {{convert|42|in|adj=on}} cyclotron instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;oral&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/31507_1.html |title=Oral History Transcript — Dr. Kenneth T. Bainbridge |publisher=American Institute of Physics |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bainbridge was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in mass spectroscopy led naturally to an interest in the relative abundance of [[isotopes]]. The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in [[uranium-235]] led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a [[Holweck pump]] to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted [[George B. Kistiakowsky]] and [[E. Bright Wilson]] to help. There was little interest in their work because research was being carried out elsewhere.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=7}} In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by [[Edwin McMillan]] for use by the U. S. Army. It was packed up and carted off to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=6}}&lt;ref name=&quot;oral&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
In September 1940, with [[World War II]] raging in Europe, the British [[Tizard Mission]] brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a [[cavity magnetron]], a high-powered device that generates [[microwave]]s using the interaction of a stream of [[electron]]s with a [[magnetic field]]. This device, which promised to revolutionize [[radar]], demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. [[Alfred Lee Loomis]] of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] established the [[Radiation Laboratory]]  at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to develop this radar technology.{{sfn|Conant|2002|pp=209–213}} In October, Bainbridge became one of the first scientists to be recruited for the Radiation Laboratory by Ernest Lawrence.{{sfn|Conant|2002|p=201}} The scientists divided up the work between them; Bainbridge drew [[pulse modulator]]s.{{sfn|Conant|2002|p=213}} Working with the Navy, he helped develop high-powered radars for warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Trinity test.ogg|Video of Trinity test|thumb|right|Video of the [[Trinity nuclear test]] ]]
In May 1943, Bainbridge joined [[Robert Oppenheimer]]'s Project Y at Los Alamos.&lt;ref name=&quot;oral&quot;/&gt; He initially led E-2, the instrumentation group, which developed X-ray instrumentation for examining explosions.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=142}} In March 1944, he became head of a new group, E-9, which was charged with conducting the first nuclear test. In Oppenheimer's sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory in August 1944, the E-9 Group became X-2.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=174}}

On July 16, 1945, Bainbridge and his colleagues conducted the [[Trinity nuclear test]]. &quot;My personal nightmare,&quot; he later wrote, &quot;was knowing that if the bomb didn't go off or hangfired, I, as head of the test, would have to go to the tower first and seek to find out what had gone wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;/&gt; To his relief, the explosion of the first [[atomic bomb]] went off without such drama, in what he later described as &quot;a foul and awesome display&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name='LANL Trinity'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/history/atomicbomb/trinity.shtml |title=Los Alamos National Laboratory: History: Building the Atomic Bomb: Trinity |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827110442/http://www.lanl.gov/history/atomicbomb/trinity.shtml |archivedate=August 27, 2010  |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert |last=Pound |authorlink=Robert Pound |first2=Richard |last2=Wilson |first3=Norman |last3=Ramsey |authorlink3=Norman F. Ramsey, Jr. | title=Memorial Minute -- Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge | date=May 7, 1998 | publisher= | url =http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/05.07/MemorialMinute-.html | work =Harvard University Gazette | pages = | accessdate = July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to Oppenheimer and said, &quot;Now we are all sons of bitches.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;/&gt;

Bainbridge was relieved that the Trinity test had been a success, relating in a 1975 [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] article, &quot;I had a feeling of exhilaration that the 'gadget' had gone off properly followed by one of deep relief. I wouldn't have to go to the tower to see what had gone wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin &quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=&quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; |title='All in Our Time' — A Foul and Awesome Display |date=May 1975 |volume=31 |issue=5 |issn=0096-3402 |publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Bulletin+of+the+Atomic+Scientists+Bainbridge+1975&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s6j4UuH8IYrIkQXIkoD4Bg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bulletin%20of%20the%20Atomic%20Scientists%20Bainbridge%201975&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work on the [[Manhattan Project]], Bainbridge received two letters of commendation from the project's director, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]].  He also received a [[Presidential Certificate of Merit]] for his work at the MIT Radiation Laboratory.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|p=14}}

==Postwar==
Bainbridge returned to Harvard after the war, and initiated the construction of a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Richard |url=http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/cyclotron/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Harvard University Cyclotrons |publisher=Harvard University Press |accessdate=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|pp=11-12}}

Throughout the 1950s, Bainbridge remained an outspoken proponent of civilian control of [[nuclear power]] and the abandonment of [[nuclear testing]]. In 1950 he was one of twelve prominent scientists who petitioned [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the [[hydrogen bomb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; Bainbridge retired from Harvard in 1975.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|pp=11-12}}

Bainbridge's wife Margaret died suddenly in January 1967 from a blood clot in a broken wrist. He married Helen Brinkley King, an editor at [[William Morrow (publisher)|William Morrow]] in New York City, in October 1969.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|pp=12-13}} She died in February 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;FG&quot; &gt;{{Find a Grave | grid = 28338378 | name = Helen Gayle Brinkley King Bainbridge| date = February 8, 1989 | accessdate = February 8, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarship was established at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slc.edu/offices-services/financial-aid/undergraduate/returning-students/UG_Financial_Aid_Scholarship_Funds.html |title=Endowed and Sponsored Undergraduate Scholarship Funds |publisher=[[Sarah Lawrence College]] | accessdate = February 8, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], on July 14, 1996. He was survived by his daughters from his first marriage, Joan Bainbridge Safford and Margaret Bainbridge Robinson.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/18/us/kenneth-bainbridge-91-chief-of-first-test-of-atomic-bomb.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Kenneth Bainbridge, 91, Chief Of First Test of Atomic Bomb |first=Karen |last=Freeman |date=July 18, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the Abel's Hill Cemetery on [[Martha's Vineyard]], in a plot with his first wife Margaret and his son Martin.{{sfn|Pound|Ramsey|1999|pp=12-13}} His papers are in the Harvard University Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua23003 |title=Bainbridge, Kenneth T.
