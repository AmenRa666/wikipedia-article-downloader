'''Stojan Čupić''' ({{IPA-sh|stɔ̌jan tʃûpitɕ|pron}}, {{lang-sr-cyr|Стојан Чупић}}; ca. 1765–1815) was a Serbian revolutionary general (''vojvoda''), one of the most important commanders of the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. He was active in the [[Mačva]] region.
__NOTOC__
==Early life==
Born in [[Piva, Montenegro|Piva]], in the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (now in [[Montenegro]]), his original surname was '''Dobrilović''' (Добриловић).{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=657}} He was brought up in [[Salaš Crnobarski]] (at that time known as Ali-Agin Salaš{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=834}}) in [[Mačva]] in the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] (now in [[Serbia]]), where he was schooled.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} He lived with his grandfather, Todor &quot;Toda&quot;, his parents being dead.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} His grandfather was a chieftain in his home village, but moved for an unknown reason to Serbia, leaving his sons back home.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=834}} The sons died, so Stojan and his three older sisters went to live with grandfather Toda.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=835}} Strahinja Čupić, a rich man without children from [[Salaš Noćajski]], adopted Stojan when he was a boy, and brought him up &quot;as though he was of his own blood&quot;.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} His adoptive father found a girl for him, and he married, so that he could inherit.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=835}} Stojan worked in trade.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}}

==Career==
{{further|First Serbian Uprising}}
Stojan Čupić first met [[Karađorđe]], a pig trader and [[Serbian Free Corps|Austrian veteran]], somewhere in the [[Valjevo]] ''[[nahija]]'' in 1804.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} In 1805, Stojan began assembling his own band (among whom were [[Zeka Buljubaša]]{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=111}}), which closed off roads in Mačva by the [[Drina]] river, and dug trenches from [[Zasavica (bog)|Zasavica]] to the [[Sava (river)|Sava]] – from where he attacked Turks crossing the Drina.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} He quickly became a local hero, feared by the Turks.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}}

At the end of July 1806, the Vizier with 45,000 soldiers dispatched from [[Šabac]] heading for [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} At the same time, Karađorđe had left the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] with 8–9,000 soldiers and awaited the Ottoman force on the field of [[Mišar]].{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} The Serb rebels destroyed the Ottomans [[Battle of Mišar|in the battle]]; the decimated Ottoman troops were forced to retreat to Šabac, from where they would leave for Bosnia.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} Čupić, who participated in the battle, hurried to Mačva to intercept the fleeing Ottoman troops; near [[Drenovac, Šabac|Drenovac]] he cut down acclaimed Mula of Sarajevo.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}}

Along with Karađorđe and other notable commanders, he participated at the bloody [[Battle of Loznica]] (1810), which left many Turks dead.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} He was wounded during battle, but still managed to save [[Cincar-Janko]]'s life, about to be slewn by an armoured Turk soldier.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}}

In the beginning of September 1813, the Serbian rebels were defeated at Ravnje, by a strong Ottoman force commanded by French officers.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} The rebels were forced to retreat; Čupić swam over the Zasavica and arrived at Šabac, where he together with his [[Blood brother#Southeastern Europe|blood brother]], ''vojvoda'' [[Luka Lazarević]], started organizing the defence of the city.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} When the Ottomans assembled a very large force outside the city, the rebel soldiers run asunder, leaving the commanders, who concluded that it was impossible to defend the city.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=658}} Luka Lazarević sent his family to [[Syrmia]], while he, Čupić, and their men descended the Sava to [[Zabrežje]], from where they crossed the Sava into Austrian territory ([[Military Frontier]]), in order to save their lives.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|pp=658–659}} As other commanders, he found refuge in Syrmia.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}} However, after a short period of time, he returned to Mačva, staying in the forests.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}}

There are several stories about his death:{{sfn|Milošević|1999}}
*Ahead of the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] (1815), Čupić had returned to Serbia and raised the people against the Turks; according to Konstantin Nenadović he came into conflict with [[Miloš Obrenović]], another ''vojvoda''; Obrenović ordered that he be betrayed to the Turks, who then murdered him.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}}
*According to [[Milan Milićević]], he met with Obrenović, who then had him sent to rise up Mačva.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}} Some [[serfs]] and others in Mačva (listed by Milićević) were not ready to break peace, thus conspired against Čupić, whom they thought was the only one planning to raise a rebellion.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}} They contacted the Turks in Bosnia, and promised his head.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}} [[Marashli Ali Pasha]] and his men waited in ambush at the given place, where the serfs took him, having told him that they would meet up with an ammunition dealer who he knew.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}} He was taken to Vizier Rushid Pasha, where he was nicely received, then sent to [[Zvornik]].{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=838}} There, he was thrown into jail bound in cuffs.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=838}} He died after a month.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=838}} A Dimitrije Nogić learnt of the conspiracy and killed several of the serfs.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=838}}

==Aftermath==
Obrenović became the supreme leader of the Second Serbian Uprising. Čupić left a son, Toma, and two daughters, Vasilija and Tomanija &quot;Toka&quot;, after him.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}} His son had seven children, all of whom died before him.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}} The daughters married in Šabac.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}} According to [[Konstantin Nenadović]], contemporary authors, such as [[Petar Nikolajević Moler|Moler]], Radič and Cukić, tried to hide the truth about Čupić's death, and fabricated a story that Čupić had turned himself over to the Turks.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}}

==Character==
Čupić was tall, with a slender waist, wide shoulders, mid-boned, and had strong muscles and long fingers.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}} He had a long face, and a large brown moustache.{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}} At the time of his death he was about 50 years old, without [[Human hair color#Gray and white hair|gray hair]].{{sfn|Nenadović|1903|p=659}} He was very talkative, and held long speeches on many assemblies in Belgrade.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=838}} He was just in trials, and a friend of the poor.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=838}} He wore armour and a steel helmet.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=838}} He rode the best horses, his favourite being a dark [[bay horse]] called &quot;Pejza&quot; (who is also the theme of a poem).{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=839}} He was described as usually quick, both in thinking and execution, and undeniably heroic.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}}

==Legacy==
 [[File:Salas Nocajski orthodox church.jpg|thumb|Statue in front of a Serbian Orthodox church in [[Salaš Noćajski]].]]
Stojan Čupić distinguished himself at the battles of Mišar (1806); Glavica in Bosnia, where he also saved Cincar-Janko's life; [[Klenje]]; [[Bajina Bašta]], when he also dueled ''beg'' Zulumbić in Bosnia; and [[Crnobarski Salaš]], about which [[Filip Višnjić]] authored a poem.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=836}} He was dubbed &quot;'''the Dragon of Noćaj'''&quot; (Zmaj od Noćaja; {{IPA-sh|zmâj ɔd nɔ̌tɕaja|pron}}) in the [[Serbian epic poetry|epic poetry]] due to his quick-thinking and heroism.{{sfn|Milićević|1888|p=837}}

A statue has been erected in his honour in front of the church in [[Salaš Noćajski]]. There are several streets named after him, such as in Belgrade, Niš, and others. An annual cultural festival named after him is held at Salaš Noćajski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tosmomi.rs/strana/1432}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relative of his has planned to recreate the church he founded in 1811 in the village (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/99738/Zaduzbina-Zmaju-od-Nocaja}}&lt;/ref&gt; His clothing and weapons are at display in the Museum in Šabac.

One of his few remaining descendants is [[Matija Čupić]].
