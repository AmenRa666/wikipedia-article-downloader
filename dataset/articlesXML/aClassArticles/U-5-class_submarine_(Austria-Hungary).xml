The '''''U-5'' class''' was a [[ship class|class]] of three [[submarine]]s or [[U-boats]] that were operated by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) before and during [[World War I]]. The class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs.

The design of the boats was based upon [[John Philip Holland]]'s submarine design and featured a single, [[teardrop hull]], which resembled the design of modern nuclear submarines.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21&gt;Sieche, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The class members were just over {{convert|105|ft|m}} long and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|240|MT|ST}} surfaced and {{convert|273|MT|ST}} submerged. All were originally equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The first two boats, ''U-5'' and ''U-6'', built specifically for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, to the same design as the [[United States C class submarine]] were partially constructed in the [[United States]] and completed at [[Whitehead &amp; Co.]] at [[Rijeka|Fiume]]. The third was completely constructed by Whitehead's at Fiume and purchased by [[Austria-Hungary]] to bolster their U-boat fleet after the outbreak of World War I.

All three boats had successes during World War I; between them they sank five ships with a combined tonnage of 22,391. In addition they captured seven ships as [[prize (law)|prize]]s and damaged {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}}, a French [[dreadnought]] of 22,189 tons displacement. All three boats were sunk during the war, though ''U-5'', the [[lead boat]] of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, ''U-5'', the only survivor of the class, was ceded to Italy as a [[war reparation]] and was broken up in 1920.

== Design and construction ==
In 1904, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments, the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by [[Simon Lake]], [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], and [[John Philip Holland]] for a competitive evaluation. The two Holland submarines comprised the ''U-5'' class.&lt;ref name=Con-340&gt;Gardiner, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Lake design became the [[U-1 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-1'' class]] while the Germaniawerft design became the [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy authorized two boats, ''U-5'' and ''U-6'', from [[Whitehead &amp; Co.]] of [[Fiume]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=Gib-384&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''U-5'' class was built to the same design as [[United States C class submarine|the C class for the US Navy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenoy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =  Fontenoy| first1 =  Paul E.| title = Submarines: An Illustrated History of Their Impact| date =  2007| publisher =  ABC-CLIO| location =  | isbn = 978-1-85109-563-6 | pages =  156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was built by [[Robert Whitehead]]'s firm of Whitehead &amp; Co. under license from Holland and his company, [[Electric Boat]].&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; Components for the first two Austrian boats were manufactured by the Electric Boat Company and assembled at Fiume, while the third boat was a speculative private venture by Whitehead that failed to find a buyer and was purchased by Austria-Hungary upon the outbreak of World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenoy&quot;/&gt;

The ''U-5'' class boats had a single-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed design with a [[teardrop hull|teardrop-shape]] that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt; The boats were just over {{convert|105|ft|m}} long and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|240|t|ST}} surfaced, and {{convert|273|t|ST}} submerged.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; The torpedo tubes featured unique, cloverleaf-shaped design [[hatch (nautical)|hatch]]es that rotated on a central axis.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; The ships were powered by twin 6-cylinder [[gasoline engine]]s while surfaced, but suffered from inadequate ventilation which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew.&lt;ref name=Con-340 /&gt; While submerged, they were propelled by twin [[electric motor]]s.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt;

The first two boats, ''U-5'' and ''U-6'', were ordered by the Austro-Hungarian Navy for evaluation and were partially assembled in the United States, shipped to Fiume, and riveted together by Whitehead &amp; Co., which, author Edwin Sieche reports, &quot;caused a lot of trouble&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt; ''U-5'' was launched in February 1909 and was followed in June by the launch of ''U-6''.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; Both boats were [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] by April 1910.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21_22&gt;Sieche, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third boat, originally named ''SS-3'', was built on speculation entirely at Whitehead's in Fiume. The boat's design featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems&lt;!-- source does not detail what those improvements were --&gt;.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; Gibson and Prendergast report that, when built, ''SS-3'' was powered by electric motors for both surface and submerged running. When the surface performance of the electric motors proved disappointing in trials, ''SS-3''{{'}}s power-plant was rebuilt to match the gasoline/electric combination used in ''U-5'' and ''U-6''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 384–85.&lt;/ref&gt; ''SS-3'' was launched in March 1911 and was offered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because the evaluation of the first two ''U-5''-class boats was still underway, they declined to purchase.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt;

As built, the ''U-5''-class boats were armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry a supply of four torpedoes.&lt;ref name=Sieche-17 /&gt; By 1915, all had received a 3.7&amp;nbsp;cm/23 (1.5&amp;nbsp;in) [[deck gun]].&lt;ref name=Sieche-21_22 /&gt;

== Service career ==
''U-5'' and ''U-6'' were both [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] by April 1910, and served as training boats through 1914, making as many as ten training cruises per month. During their early years, each boat was demonstrated to a foreign naval delegation; ''U-5'' to a [[Peru]]vian detachment in 1911, ''U-6'' to a [[Norway|Norwegian]] group in 1910.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21_22 /&gt; At the beginning of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''U-5'' and ''U-6'' comprised half of the operational U-boat fleet of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.&lt;ref name=Con-341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the three years after ''SS-3''{{'}}s March 1911 launch, Whitehead's attempted to sell the boat to the navies of [[Peru]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Brazil]], and [[Bulgaria]], before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet.&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt; Although provisionally commissioned as ''U-7'', she was commissioned as ''U-12'' in August 1914.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21_22 /&gt;

By late December 1914, all three of the ''U-5''-class boats were based at the naval base at [[Cattaro]] and all took part in combat patrols.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; Between the three boats, they sank five ships with a combined tonnage of 22,391,&lt;ref group=Note name=tonnage&gt;Merchant ship tonnage is in [[gross register ton]]s. Warship tonnage is in tons of [[displace (ship)|displacement]].&lt;/ref&gt; captured seven ships, and damaged one dreadnought.&lt;ref name=U5-ships&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Ships hit by KUK U5 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/search.php?boat=KUK+U5 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | accessdate = 24 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=U6-ships&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Ships hit by KUK U6 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/search.php?boat=KUK+U6 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | accessdate = 24 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=U12-ships&gt;{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Guðmundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Ships hit by KUK U12 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/search.php?boat=KUK+U12 | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | accessdate = 24 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-6'' was the least successful, sinking a single ship of {{GRT|756}};&lt;ref name=U6-ships /&gt; ''U-5'' was the most successful, sinking four ships with of a combined {{GRT|21,604}},&lt;ref name=U5-ships /&gt; including the French [[armoured cruiser]] [[French armoured cruiser Léon Gambetta|''Léon Gambetta'']].&lt;ref name=Sieche-22&gt;Sieche, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-12'' damaged, but did not sink, the largest ship torpedoed by any of the ''U-5'' class when she hit the French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}} on 21 December 1914.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt;

Of the three boats of the class, only ''U-5'' survived the war intact.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; ''U-12'' was sunk with the loss of all hands when she hit a [[naval mine|mine]] near [[Venice]] in August 1915,&lt;ref name=Grant-162&gt;Grant, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Grant (p. 162), Gibson and Prendergast (p. 73), and Halpern (p. 150) report ''U-12''{{'}}s loss in August 1915, while Sieche (p. 23) and Gardiner (p. 343) report the loss in August 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''U-6'' was scuttled by her crew in May 1916 after becoming trapped in an [[anti-submarine net]] that was a part of the [[Otranto Barrage]].&lt;ref name=Grant-162 /&gt; ''U-5'' herself sank after hitting an Austro-Hungarian mine during a training exercise, but was raised, repaired and recommissioned before the war's end.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; ''U-5'' was ceded to Italy as a [[war reparation]] and scrapped in 1920.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt;

=== SM ''U-5'' ===
{{main|SM U-5 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-5'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in April 1907 and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in February 1909. She was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in April 1910, and served as a training boat—sometimes making as many as ten cruises a month—through the beginning of the First World War in 1914.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; The submarine scored most of her wartime successes during the first year of the war while under the command of [[Georg Ritter von Trapp]]. The French armoured cruiser [[French armoured cruiser Léon Gambetta|''Léon Gambetta'']], sunk in April 1915, was the largest ship sunk by ''U-5''.&lt;ref name=U5-ships /&gt; In May 1917, ''U-5'' hit a [[mine (naval)|mine]] and sank with the loss of six men. She was raised, rebuilt, and recommissioned, but sank no more ships. At the end of the war, ''U-5'' was ceded to Italy as a [[war reparation]], and scrapped in 1920.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; In all, ''U-5'' sank four ships totaling 21,604 tons.&lt;ref name=U5-ships /&gt;

=== SM ''U-6'' ===
{{main|SM U-6 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-6'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in February 1908 and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed the following June. She served as a training boat after her July 1910 [[commission (ship)|commission]]ing into the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She served in that capacity through the beginning of World War I in 1914, making as many as ten training cruises a month. ''U-6'' scored only one wartime success, sinking a French [[destroyer]] in March 1916. In May that same year, she became entangled in [[anti-submarine net]]ting deployed as part of the [[Otranto Barrage]]. Coming under fire from [[Naval drifter|drifters]] running the nets, ''U-6'' was abandoned and sunk. All of her crewmen were rescued and were held in captivity through the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt;

=== SM ''U-12'' ===
{{main|SM U-12 (Austria-Hungary)}}
SM ''U-12'' was built on speculation by [[Whitehead &amp; Co.]] of [[Fiume]] under the name ''SS-3''. She was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1909 and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in March 1911 and featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems from the Holland design of her older sister boats, ''U-5'' and ''U-6''. Whitehead's tried selling ''SS-3'' to several different navies, but she was finally bought by the Austro-Hungarian Navy after the outbreak of World War I, despite having been rejected twice before. She was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed as ''U-12'' in August 1914.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21_22 /&gt; She sank only one ship during the war, a Greek [[cargo ship]] in May 1915, but had earlier captured six [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] sailing vessels as [[prize (law)|prize]]s in March.&lt;ref name=U12-ships /&gt; ''U-12'' also damaged, but did not sink, the French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}} in December 1914.&lt;ref name=Gib-69&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; While searching for targets in the vicinity of [[Venice]] in August 1915, ''U-12'' struck a mine that blew her stern off, and sank with all hands,&lt;ref name=Grant-162 /&gt; becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war.&lt;ref name=Halp-150&gt;Halpern, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred the bodies of ''U-12''{{'}}s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.&lt;ref name=Sieche-23&gt;Sieche, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
