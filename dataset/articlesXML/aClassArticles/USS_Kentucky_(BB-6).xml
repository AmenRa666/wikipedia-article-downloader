'''USS ''Kentucky'' (BB-6)''' was the second and final {{sclass-|Kearsarge|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built for the [[United States Navy]]. The Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Virginia laid down her keel on 30 June 1896. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 March 1898, sponsored by Miss Christine Bradley, daughter of [[Kentucky]] Governor [[William O'Connell Bradley]]. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 May 1900.

In her twenty years of service, ''Kentucky'' participated in no major combat. Between 1901 and 1904, she served in East Asia, and from 1904 to 1907 she cruised the Atlantic. In 1907, she joined the [[Great White Fleet]], returning in 1909. She was modernized in 1910, but did not operate again until 1915, when she sailed to the Mexican coast, where she stayed until 1916. From 1917 until her decommissioning on 29 May 1920, she served as a training ship. She was sold for scrap on 24 March 1923.

== Design ==
{{main|Kearsarge-class battleship}}

The ''Kearsarge''-class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=12}} They had a displacement of {{convert|11540|ST}}, an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|375|ft|4|in}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|72|ft|3|in}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|23|ft|6|in}}.{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}} The two 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] and five [[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch boilers]], connected to two propeller shafts, produced a total of {{convert|12179|ihp|lk=in}}, and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|16.897|kn|mph km/h}}.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=94}} ''Kentucky'' was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men, a total of 554 crew.{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=22}}

[[File:USS Kentucky LOC det.4a14322.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A smaller turret on top of a bigger turret.|''Kentucky'''s double turret, circa 1900–1901]]
''Kentucky'', like {{USS|Kearsarge|BB-5|6}}, had two double [[Gun turret|turrets]], with two [[13&quot;/35 caliber gun|{{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/35 caliber guns]] and two [[8&quot;/40 caliber gun|{{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/40 caliber guns]] each, stacked on two levels.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=30–32}} The guns and turret armor were designed by the [[Bureau of Ordnance]], while the turret itself was designed by the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. The configuration caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret, making the ports very large. Admiral [[William Sims]] claimed that as a result of the gun mounting, a shell fired into the port could reach the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] below, disabling the guns.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=17}} In addition to these guns, ''Kentucky'' carried fourteen [[5&quot;/40 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/40 caliber guns]], twenty [[6-pounder gun|6-pounder]] ({{convert|57|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) guns, eight [[QF 1 pounder pom-pom|1-pounder]] ({{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) guns, four {{convert|.30|in|mm|abbr=on}} machine guns, and four {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s.{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}} ''Kentucky'' had a very low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], often making her guns unusable during bad weather.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=92}}

The ship's [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] was {{convert|5|-|16.5|in}} thick. Her main gun turrets were protected by {{convert|15|-|17|in}} of armor, while the secondary turrets had {{convert|6|-|11|in}} of armor. The [[barbette]]s were {{convert|12.5|-|15|in}} thick, and the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|10|in}} of armor.{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}} The ship's armor was made of [[Harvey armor|harveyized steel]].{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=94}}

== Construction ==
''Kentucky'' was authorized on 2 March 1895.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=83}} The contract for her construction was awarded on 2 January 1896,{{sfn|NVR Kentucky (BB 6)}} and her keel was laid down on 30 June 1896 by [[Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company]] in [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}}{{sfn|''Houston Daily Post'' 25 March 1898}} The total cost was $4,998,119.43.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=94}} In preparation for the ''Kentucky''{{'}}s christening, the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] asked [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[William O'Connell Bradley]] to select a member of his family to perform the ceremony. Bradley chose his daughter, Christine, who was attending school in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|''Houston Daily Post'' 25 March 1898}} The Bradleys were a family of [[teetotalers]],{{sfn|Clark|Lane|2002|p=65–66}} so Governor Bradley sent a bottle of water from Lincoln Spring in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]], for Christine to use during the ceremony.{{sfn|''Houston Daily Post'' 25 March 1898}} ''Kentucky'' was christened on 24 March 1898, the same day as her [[sister ship]], ''Kearsarge''.{{sfn|''Houston Daily Post'' 25 March 1898}} Soon after Miss Bradley broke the bottle of water over the ''Kentucky''{{'}}s bow, a delegation from the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], led by [[Frances Beauchamp]], presented the Governor's daughter with a gift of a silver tray, a water pitcher, and two goblets. The inscription read, &quot;Kentucky Christian Temperance Union to Miss Christine Bradley, as a tribute to her loyalty to conviction in the christening of the Battleship ''Kentucky'' with water. March 10, 1898.&quot;{{sfn|Clark|Lane|2002|p=65–66}} ''Kentucky'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 May 1900, under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Colby Mitchell Chester]].{{sfn|''Alexandria Gazette'' 15 May 1900}}

== Early service history ==
During the summer of 1900, ''Kentucky'' was fitted out in the [[New York Navy Yard]].{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} On 26 October, during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], she left [[Tompkinsville, Staten Island]] for China,{{sfn|''The Honolulu Republican'' 8 November 1900}} passing through [[Gibraltar]]{{sfn|''The Weekly Messenger'' 17 November 1900}} and the [[Suez Canal]].{{sfn|''The San Francisco Call'' 22 December 1900}} On 5 February 1901 she arrived at [[Manila]],{{sfn|''The Bee'' 7 February 1901}} and on 23 March she replaced the {{USS|Newark|C-1|2}} as the flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Louis Kempff]].{{sfn|''Evening Star'' 23 March 1901}}

Between 1901 and 1904, ''Kentucky'' visited numerous ports in China and Japan, including [[Chefoo]],{{sfn|''The Saint Paul Globe'' 15 October 1901}} [[Wusong]],{{sfn|''The Saint Paul Globe'' 15 October 1901}}{{sfn|''The San Francisco Call'' 29 October 1901}}{{sfn|''Evening Star'' 3 June 1901}} [[Nanking]],{{sfn|''The San Francisco Call'' 29 October 1901}} [[Taku Forts]],{{sfn|''The Washington Times'' 24 July 1902}} Hong Kong,{{sfn|''Evening Star'' 14 November 1901}} [[Xiamen]],{{sfn|''Evening Star'' 3 June 1901}} [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]],{{sfn|''The Washington Times'' 29 June 1902}} [[Kobe]],{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} and [[Yokohama]].{{sfn|''The Washington Times'' 13 April 1902}}

In 1902, ''Kentucky'' became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Frank Wildes]], although he moved his flag to the [[distilling ship]] {{USS|Rainbow|AS-7|2}} on 12 April 1902.{{sfn|''The Washington Times'' 13 April 1902}} In November 1902, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Robley D. Evans]].{{sfn|''Evening Bulletin'' 8 November 1902}} On 13 March 1904 she sailed from Manila, passing through the Suez Canal and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and arriving at New York City on 21 May.{{sfn|''Daily Public Ledger'' 26 May 1904}}

After receiving upgrades at the New York Navy Yard, including the addition of smoke ejectors,{{sfn|''Palestine Daily Herald'' 26 October 1904}} ''Kentucky'' joined the [[North Atlantic Squadron]].{{sfn|''The Salt Lake Tribune'' 31 October 1905}} The battleship participated in the welcome of the British North Atlantic Squadron at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], in October 1905.{{sfn|''The Salt Lake Tribune'' 31 October 1905}} During the [[History of cuba#Cuba in the early 20th century|1906 Cuban Insurrection]], she carried [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to Cuba, embarking them from [[Provincetown]] on 23 September, and landing them at [[Havana, Cuba]], on 1 October.{{sfn|''The Sun'' 26 September 1906}} She remained there until 9 October, and then returned to New England.{{sfn|''The Bemidji Daily Pioneer'' 9 October 1906}} ''Kentucky'' attended the [[Jamestown Exposition]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 15 April 1907,{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=22}} and then participated in exercises off the [[New England]] coast.{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}}

==Great White Fleet==

[[File:USS Kentucky, built in Newport News, VA, launched in 1898.jpg|thumb|The ''Kentucky'', painting of marine painter [[Alexander Kircher]], about 1908]]

In 1907, the [[Great White Fleet]] was ordered by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to circle the world, as a demonstration of the might of the United States Navy.{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=26}} ''Kentucky'' was attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron,{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=46}} and was commanded by Captain [[Walter C. Cowles]],{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=177}} while the fleet as a whole was commanded by Rear Admiral Evans, ''Kentucky''{{'}}s former [[flag officer]].{{sfn|Yarsinske|1999|p=107}} On 16 December 1907, the fleet saluted the presidential yacht {{USS|Mayflower|PY-1|2}},{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=39}} and left from [[Hampton Roads]].{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=181}} The fleet then sailed south, passing [[Trinidad]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]],{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=54}} and going through the [[Straits of Magellan]].{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=66}} From there she passed the west coast of South America, visiting [[Punta Arenas]]{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=64}} and [[Valparaíso]], Chile,{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=67}} [[Callao]], Peru,{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=69}} and [[Magdalena Bay, Mexico]].{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=73}} The fleet arrived at San Diego on 14 April 1908{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=184}} and continued to San Francisco on 6 May.{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=185}} Two months later it arrived at [[Honolulu]],{{sfn|Albertson|2008|pp=90–95}} and from there sailed to [[Auckland]], New Zealand, arriving on 9 August.{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=95}} On 20 August, the fleet reached [[Sydney]], Australia, and a week later sailed for [[Melbourne]].{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=188}}

''Kentucky'' departed [[Albany, Western Australia]], on 18 September, passing through ports in the [[Philippine Islands]], Japan, China, and [[Ceylon]] before traveling through the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=188–190}} The fleet split at [[Port Said]] on 8 January 1909, with ''Kentucky'' visiting [[Tripoli]] and [[Algiers]]{{sfn|Albertson|2008|p=191}} before rejoining the other ships at Gibraltar.{{sfn|Yarsinske|1999|p=109}} She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 February, and was inspected by President Roosevelt.{{sfn|Albertson|2008|pp=191–192}}

==Later service==
As with most of the Great White Fleet ships, ''Kentucky'' was modernized on her return.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=82}} She was decommissioned at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]]{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} on 28 August 1909,{{sfn|Harris|1992|p=489}} and her modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of $675,000.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=82–83}} The ship received [[Lattice mast|cage masts]], new [[water-tube boiler]]s, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=92}} On 4 June 1912, she was recommissioned in the Second Reserve, and on 31 May 1913 she was transferred to the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] in Philadelphia.{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}}

She was recommissioned again at Philadelphia on 23 June 1915.{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} On 11 September that year, following the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]], she sailed to [[Mexico]], arriving at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] on 28 September. She remained there during the [[Mexican Revolution]], staying until 2 June 1916, except for a visit to [[New Orleans]] for the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] festival in March 1916.{{sfn|Bogart|2010}}

The battleship stopped at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]]{{sfn|''The Sun'' 6 June 1916}} and [[Santo Domingo]] on her way back to Philadelphia, arriving there on 18 June 1916.{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} From July until September, she trained militiamen near [[Block Island]] and [[Boston]].{{sfn|''The Ogden Standard'' 25 July 1916}}{{sfn|''The Ogden Standard'' 19 August 1916}}{{sfn|''Kentucky Irish American'' 2 September 1916}} On 2 October ''Kentucky'' returned to New York,{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} and entered the [[New York Naval Shipyard]] on 2 January 1917,{{sfn|''The Sun'' 3 January 1917}} remaining there until the United States [[American entry into World War I|entered]] [[World War I]].{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} She arrived at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] on 2 May, and trained recruits along the Atlantic coast, from [[Chesapeake Bay]] to [[Long Island Sound]].{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} During the war, she trained several thousand men, in 15 groups of recruits.{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}}

''Kentucky'' was overhauled at the [[Boston Navy Yard]], beginning on 20 December 1918.{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} On 18 March 1919, she left for exercises in Guantanamo Bay, Norfolk, and along the New England coast.{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}} Between 29 May and 30 August 1919, ''Kentucky'' trained [[United States Naval Academy]] [[midshipman|midshipmen]].{{sfn|DANFS Kentucky (BB-6)}}

==Fate==
Following World War I, the United States agreed to the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which was aimed at preventing a naval [[arms race]] by limiting the size of the signatories' fleets.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=70}} As a result, many old and obsolete ships were scrapped, including the ''Kentucky''.{{sfn|''New York Tribune'' 15 January 1922}}

''Kentucky'' was decommissioned on 29 May 1920.{{sfn|''New York Tribune'' 15 January 1922}} Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 27 May 1922 and she was sold for scrap to [[Dravo Corporation]] on 24 March 1923.{{sfn|NVR Kentucky (BB 6)}}

==Legacy==
A mast from ''Kentucky'' is located near the [[General George Patton Museum of Leadership|Patton Museum]] at [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky.
