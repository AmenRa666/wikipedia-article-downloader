'''HMS ''Antrim''''' was a {{sclass-|Devonshire|cruiser (1903)|0}} [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]]  in the first decade of the 20th century. She was assigned to the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[Channel Fleet]] upon completion in 1905  and was transferred to the [[2nd Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in 1907. She was assigned to the [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] Third Fleet in 1909 and then became [[flagship]] of the [[3rd Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Cruiser Squadron]] of the reserve Second Fleet in 1913.

Upon mobilisation in mid-1914 her squadron was assigned to the [[Grand Fleet]] and spent much of its time patrolling the northern exits from the [[North Sea]]. ''Antrim'' was sent to [[Arkhangelsk]] in mid-1916 and then to the [[North America and West Indies Station]] for convoy escort duties. She was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] at the end of 1917, but was [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] in mid-1918 as a convoy escort. The ship was in reserve by 1919, but conducted [[radio]] and [[Asdic]] [[Evaluation|trials]] in 1920 before becoming a training ship in 1922. ''Antrim'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] at the end of the year.

==Design and description==
''Antrim'' was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|10850|LT|t}}. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|473|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|68|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|24|ft|m|1}}. She was powered by two 4-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of {{convert|21000|ihp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by seventeen [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] and six cylindrical [[boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=ck8&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|1033|LT|t}} of coal and her complement consisted of 610 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=f6&gt;Friedman 2012, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Her main armament consisted of four [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading (BL)]] [[BL 7.5 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 7.5-inch Mk I guns]] mounted in four single-[[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and one [[wing turret|on each side]].&lt;ref name=f56&gt;Friedman 2012, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The guns fired their {{convert|200|lb|adj=on}} shells to a range of about {{convert|13800|yd}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2011, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; Her secondary armament of six [[BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 6-inch Mk VII guns]] was arranged in [[casemate]]s amidships. Four of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2012, pp. 256, 260–61&lt;/ref&gt; They had a maximum range of approximately {{convert|12200|yd}} with their {{convert|100|lb|adj=on}} shells.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2011, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; ''Antrim'' also carried 18 [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder]] [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and two submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt; Her two [[QF 12-pounder 8-cwt Mk I naval gun|12-pounder 8 cwt guns]]  could be dismounted for service ashore.&lt;ref name=f56/&gt;

At some point in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the ''Devonshire''-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given [[gun shield]]s. Their casemates were plated over to improve [[seakeeping]] and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2012, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armour belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|6|in|0|spell=in}} and was closed off by {{convert|5|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s. The armour of the gun turrets was also five inches thick whilst that of their barbettes was six inches thick. The protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] armour ranged in thickness from {{convert|.75|-|2|in|mm|0}} and the [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|12|in|0|spell=in}} of armour.&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt;

==Construction and service==
''Antrim'', named to commemorate the [[County Antrim|Irish county]],&lt;ref name=s1&gt;Silverstone, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Keel|laid down]] by [[John Brown &amp; Company]] at their [[Clydeside]] shipyard on 27 August 1902 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 8 October 1903. She was completed on 23 June 1905&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt; and was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet together with most of her [[sister ship]]s. She was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in March 1907 and was then assigned to the reserve Third Fleet at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] in April 1909. In December 1912 the ship became the flagship of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the Second Fleet.&lt;ref name=gg3&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet in mid-1914 as the Navy mobilised for war. It spent much of its time with the Grand Fleet reinforcing the patrols near the [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]] and [[Faeroe Islands]] and the Norwegian coast&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Vol. I, pp. 31, 77, 206&lt;/ref&gt; where ''Antrim'' captured a German merchantman on 6 August.&lt;ref name=gg3/&gt; Two months later, she was unsuccessfully attacked by the German [[submarine]] {{SMU|U-16|Germany|2}} on 9 October.&lt;ref&gt;Goldrick, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous sorties with the main body of the Grand Fleet, she did not see combat. The ship was sent to Archangelsk in June 1916 and was then transferred for convoy escort duties to the North America and West Indies Station. ''Antrim'' returned home in December 1917 and was paid off. She was recommissioned in August 1918 and resumed her former duties until the end of the war in November.&lt;ref name=gg3/&gt;

She was in reserve at the [[Nore]] in 1919, but was modified to conduct radio and Asdic trials. She recommissioned in March 1920 for the trials and became a [[cadet]] training ship in 1922.&lt;ref name=gg3/&gt; ''Antrim'' was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922 and was subsequently broken up at [[Blyth, Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=s1/&gt;
