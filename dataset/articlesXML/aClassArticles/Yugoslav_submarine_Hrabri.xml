The '''Yugoslav submarine ''Hrabri''''' was the first of the [[Hrabri-class submarine|''Hrabri''-class]] [[diesel-electric]] [[submarine]]s built by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]] on the [[River Tyne]] in the United Kingdom, for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia). [[Ceremonial ship launching|Launched]] in 1927, her design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and she was built using parts originally assembled for a submarine of that class which was never completed. She was armed with six bow-mounted {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[torpedo tubes]], two {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} guns and one [[machine gun]], and could dive to {{convert|60|m|ft}}.

Prior to [[World War II]] she participated in several cruises to [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ports. During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]]. She was given the number ''N3'' but was not commissioned and was [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] later in 1941 due to her poor condition.

==Description and construction==
Yugoslav naval policy in the [[interwar period]] lacked direction until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} although it was generally accepted that the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of [[submarine]]s, coastal [[torpedo boat]]s, [[torpedo bomber]]s and conventional [[bomber]] aircraft to perform this role. The [[Hrabri-class submarine|''Hrabri''-class]] submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=779}}

''Hrabri'' (Brave) was built for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]] on the [[River Tyne]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Her design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and she was built using parts originally assembled for HMS ''L-67'', which was never completed.{{sfn|Akermann|2002|p=168}} Like her [[sister ship|sister submarine]] [[Yugoslav submarine Nebojsa|''Nebojsa'']], she had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|72.05|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|7.32|m|ftin|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, and a surfaced [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.96|m|ftin|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Her surfaced [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|975|LT}} or {{convert|1164|LT}} submerged, and her crew consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} She had an operational depth of {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}}

The ''Hrabri''-class had two shafts driven by two diesel engines (when surfaced) or two electric motors (when submerged). The [[diesel engine]]s were rated at {{convert|2400|bhp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and the electric motors at {{convert|1600|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}, and they could reach a top speed of {{convert|15.7|kn|lk=in}} under diesel power while surfaced, and {{convert|10|kn}} on their electric motors when submerged. They were armed with six bow-mounted {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[torpedo tubes]], and carried twelve torpedoes.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}} They were also equipped with two {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} [[deck gun]]s (one forward and one [[aft]] of the [[conning tower]]), and one [[machine gun]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Their radius of action was {{convert|3800|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Akermann|2002|p=166}}

==Service career==
''Hrabri'' was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in 1927 as the first submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Along with ''Nebojša'', she left the Tyne in late January 1928.{{sfn|Hood|1928|p=154}} In company with the Yugoslav [[submarine tender]] {{ship|Yugoslav submarine tender|Hvar||2}}, the two submarines arrived in the [[Bay of Kotor]] on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928.{{sfn|Luković|6 April 2013}} In May and June 1929, ''Hrabri'', ''Nebojša'', ''Hvar'' and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'' on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the [[Ionian Sea]], and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. According to the British naval [[attaché]], the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}}

In June and July 1930, ''Hrabri'', ''Nebojša'' and the fleet auxiliary ''Sitnica'' again cruised the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], visiting [[Alexandria]] and [[Beirut]].{{sfn|Radio Tivat|9 July 2014}} In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises or manoeuvres due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}} In 1934, ''Hrabri'' visited [[Valletta]] in Malta and the [[Kelibia]] Roads off the coast of Tunisia,{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=544}} and in August 1935, ''Hrabri'' again visited Malta, this time in company with the more modern French-designed submarine [[Yugoslav submarine Osvetnik|''Osvetnik'']].{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=641}} In August and September 1937, ''Hrabri'', along with the other French-made submarine [[Yugoslav submarine Smeli|''Smeli'']] and the depot ship [[Yugoslav minelayer Zmaj|''Zmaj'']], visited Greece, including the port of [[Piraeus]], and the islands of [[Crete]] and Corfu.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=838}}

When the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] began on 6 April 1941, she was located in the Bay of Kotor along with the three other submarines of the flotilla.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=267}} On 10 April, ''Hrabri'' and ''Osvetnik'' received orders for an operation against the Italian enclave of [[Province of Zara|Zara]] on the [[Dalmatia]]n coastline, but the mission did not proceed.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=374}} She was later captured by the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] [[XVII Corps (Italy)|XVII Corps]] at the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}}{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=457}} She was given the number ''N3'' but was not commissioned and was [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] later that year due to her poor condition.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}}
