[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir James Alexander Gordon''', [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|GCB]] (6 October 1782 – 8 January 1869) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer. As a volunteer, he fought at the [[Battle of Groix]], at the [[Glorious First of June|Battle of the Glorious First of June]] and at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and then, as a [[midshipman]], served under Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]].

Gordon became commanding officer of the 28-gun frigate {{HMS|Mercury|1779|6}} which took part of [[Action of 4 April 1808|a hard-fought action]] between three British ships and the combined forces of a Spanish convoy, 20 gunboats and land artillery off the town of [[Rota, Cádiz|Rota]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He later became captain of the 38-gun frigate {{HMS|Active|1799|6}} which was one of the four ships that successfully defeated a much larger French squadron at the first [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] and was one of three that subsequently defeated three more powerful French frigates off [[Palagruža]].

Gordon also saw action in the [[War of 1812]] leading the successful [[raid on Alexandria]] on the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and taking part in the less successful attack on [[Fort McHenry]] and the [[Battle of Baltimore]]. He went on to be [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Governor of Greenwich Hospital]].

== Early career ==
[[File:The Battle of the Nile.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of the Nile]] at which Gordon was present as a volunteer]]
Born the eldest son of Charles Gordon of Wardhouse, [[Aberdeenshire]], and his wife, a daughter of Major James Mercer, of Auchnacant, Aberdeenshire, Gordon joined the Royal Navy in November 1793.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054?docPos=1|title=Gordon, Sir James Alexander|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the 74-gun {{HMS|Arrogant|1761|6}} in the [[Channel Fleet|Channel Squadron]] and took part in the blockade of [[Brest, France|Brest]].&lt;ref name=heath100&gt;Heathcote p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He spent time on harbour duty in the 74-gun {{HMS|Invincible|1765|6}}, in the 74-gun {{HMS|Ramillies|1785|6}}, the 74-gun {{HMS|Defence|1763|6}} and finally the 24-gun {{HMS|Eurydice|1781|6}} during 1794.&lt;ref name=heath100/&gt; He transferred to the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Révolutionnaire|1794|6}} in 1795 and served under Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]] at the [[Battle of Groix]] in June 1795 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&lt;ref name=heath101&gt;Heathcote p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon moved to the 90-gun ship-of-the-line {{HMS|Namur|1756|6}} in 1796 and served under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] at the [[Glorious First of June|Battle of the Glorious First of June]] in June 1794.&lt;ref name=heath101/&gt; He transferred to the 74-gun {{HMS|Goliath|1781|6}} and served under [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]] at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]] in February 1797 and, having been promoted to [[midshipman]], he served under Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in August 1798 when a crushing defeat was inflicted on the French fleet commanded by [[François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers]].&lt;ref name=heath101/&gt; He became second [[lieutenant]] of the sloop [[Bordelais (1798 ship)|''Bordelais'']] in January 1800 and, while escorting a convoy to the [[West Indies]], fought an action with three French [[brig]]s, capturing one in January 1801.&lt;ref name=heath101/&gt; In the [[Caribbean]] later that year Gordon, on an independent mission, was captured by the Haitian government of [[Toussaint Louverture]] and spent four months in prison before being released by [[cartel (ship)|cartel]].&lt;ref name=heath101/&gt; He was made first lieutenant of the 18-gun brig {{HMS|Racoon|1795|6}} in 1802 and returned to the West Indies. ''Racoon{{'}}''s capture of the French [[corvette]] [[French brig Lodi (1797)|''Lodi'']] in July 1803 led to Gordon's appointment as commanding officer of HMS ''Raccoon'' in October 1803 and his promotion to [[commander]] on 2 March 1804.&lt;ref name=heath101/&gt;

== Frigate captain ==
[[File:Ft. Henry bombardement 1814.jpg|thumb|left|The attack on [[Fort McHenry]] in which Gordon took part as [[commodore (rank)|commodore]]]]
Gordon was promoted to [[post-captain]] on 16 May 1805 and assigned command of the 28-gun frigate {{HMS|Ligaera|1804|6}} but shortly after his arrival in England was taken seriously ill and had to resign his command.&lt;ref name=heath101/&gt; He was without a command until 1807, when he took over the 28-gun frigate {{HMS|Mercury|1779|6}}, engaged in [[blockade]] duties off [[Cádiz]], and took part of [[Action of 4 April 1808|a hard-fought action]] between three British ships and the combined forces of a Spanish convoy, 20 gunboats and land artillery off the town of [[Rota, Cádiz|Rota]] in April 1808.&lt;ref name=heath102&gt;Heathcote, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; He became captain of the 38-gun frigate {{HMS|Active|1799|6}} at [[Gibraltar]] in June 1808 and spent the next three years in operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Adriatic Sea]]. ''Active'' was one of the four ships under the command of [[William Hoste]] that successfully defeated a much larger French squadron at the first [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] in March 1811 and she was one of three that defeated three more powerful French frigates off [[Palagruža]] in November 1811.&lt;ref name=heath102/&gt; In this latter action Gordon’s left knee was shattered by a cannonball and his leg had to be amputated; he used a wooden leg for the remainder of his life. He recuperated in [[Malta]] and was able to take ''Active'' back to England in June 1812.&lt;ref name=heath102/&gt; He took command of the frigate {{HMS|Seahorse|1794|6}} in September 1812, escorting convoys for the West Indies and enforcing the blockade of France. In 1814 she transferred to the American station, where the [[War of 1812]] was still under way. Gordon, with [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] as his second in command, distinguished himself as [[commodore (rank)|commodore]] leading the successful [[raid on Alexandria]] on the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] in August 1814 and also taking part in the less successful attack on [[Fort McHenry]] and the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in September 1814.&lt;ref name=heath102/&gt; He went on to provide logistic support during the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815.&lt;ref name=heath102/&gt; He was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] on 29 June 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=17032|supp=|startpage=1277|date=1 July 1815|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon continued to hold seagoing commands after the cessation of hostilities, becoming commanding officer of the frigate {{HMS|Madagascar|1811|6}} on the [[Home Fleet|Home Station]] in November 1815 and then of the frigate {{HMS|Maeander|1813|6}} in October 1816.&lt;ref name=heath103&gt;Heathcote p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined his old command, HMS ''Active'', in 1819 and was again her commanding officer until 1821.&lt;ref name=heath103/&gt; After this he held no further seagoing command. He was appointed Superintendent of the [[Stonehouse, Plymouth#Notable buildings|Naval Hospital]] at [[Plymouth]] in 1828 and moved on to become Superintendent of [[Chatham Dockyard]] in July 1832.&lt;ref name=heath103/&gt;

The grave lies within an enclosed area of surviving graves within the generally cleared graveyard, now forming a pocket park immediately west of the entrance to [[National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=heath103/&gt;

An obituary in ''Macmillan’s Magazine'' hailed him as &quot;The Last of Nelson’s Captains&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/41407506|title=&quot;The Last of Nelson’s Captains&quot;|publisher=South Australian Register|date=3 June 1869|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a biography by Brian Perrett argued that his career was the principal model for that of [[C. S. Forester]]’s hero [[Horatio Hornblower]].&lt;ref&gt;Perrett, p. 1-160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In August 1812 Gordon married Lydia Ward; they had seven daughters and one son.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
