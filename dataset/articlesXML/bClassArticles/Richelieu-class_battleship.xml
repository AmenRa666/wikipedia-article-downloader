The '''''Richelieu''-class battleships''' were the last and largest [[battleship]]s of the [[French Navy]]. They left service in the 1960s. They remain the largest French-built warships. They were designed in the 1930s to counter the threat of the Italian {{sclass-|Vittorio Veneto|battleship|2}}s. ''Richelieu''-class ships were essentially scaled-up versions of the preceding {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|4}}. They featured a [[main battery]] of eight [[380mm/45 Modèle 1935 gun|{{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on|sigfig=3}}]] guns in two quadruple [[gun turret|turrets]] in forward [[superfiring]] positions.

Four ''Richelieu''-class ships, of three different subclasses, were designed over the course of three construction programs, in 1935, 1936, and 1938. Only three were [[laid down]]. Only the first two, {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}, were completed. They saw service during [[World War II]], first under [[Vichy France|Vichy]] control in [[Battle of Dakar|Dakar]] (1940) and [[Naval Battle of Casablanca|Casablanca]] (1942), then under Allied control. ''Richelieu'' participated in British [[Home Fleet]] and [[Eastern Fleet]] operations and supported French forces' return to [[Indochina]] in late 1945. ''Jean Bart'' was not completed until the 1950s and took part in the operations off [[Port Said]] ([[Egypt]]) during the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956. ''Richelieu'' was scrapped in 1968 and ''Jean Bart'' in 1970.

==Background==

===Washington Naval Treaty===
In 1922, the [[Washington Naval Conference]], concluded by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], limited any battleship construction for the following ten years. It attempted to end a burgeoning naval [[arms race]] among the [[History of the United States Navy|United States of America]], the [[History of the Royal Navy|United Kingdom]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. The Treaty fixed limits for new battleships of {{convert|35000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} [[standard displacement]] and {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the [[main battery]]'s [[Caliber (artillery)|artillery caliber]]. [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[History of the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] each were allowed (after 1927) to replace two old battleships.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=71–72}}

[[Weimar Republic|Germany]] was instead subject to more stringent [[Treaty of Versailles]] restrictions. It was forbidden to build any warship with a displacement greater than {{convert|10000|LT|t|sigfig=5}}.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=76–77}}

The practicality of building battleships came into question since during World War I, no decisive victory had resulted from a major clash between battleships, in contrast to the Japanese victory of [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]] more than 17 years before.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=74}}{{sfn|Masson|1991|p=16}} However, the war experience had clearly shown the problem of ensuring the safety of maritime [[Trade route|commercial routes]] against [[commerce raider]]s, for which [[cruiser]]s appeared better suited than battleships. Thus, by the late 1920s all the countries that had signed the Washington Treaty were building new [[heavy cruiser]] classes.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|pp=3–18}} For France, the priority was the safety of the [[ship transport|waterborne]] connections between France and her African [[French colonies#In Africa|colonies]]/[[Protectorate#French protectorates|protectorates]] (via the [[Marseille]]-[[Algiers]] and [[Bordeaux]]-[[Casablanca]]-[[Dakar]] routes).{{sfn|Masson|1983|pp=324–325}}

In the late 1920s, the most powerful active battleships had been designed before the Treaty and were armed with four double [[gun turret|turrets]] of {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}{{efn|Examples include the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}},{{sfn|Lenton|1972|pp=10–22}} {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|2}},{{sfn|Lenton|1972|pp=23–28}} and {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruiser|2}}.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|pp=37–41}}}} or {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}{{efn|Examples include the {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|2}} and {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|2}}.{{sfn|Lenton|1968|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|Watts|1971|pp=18–21}}}} caliber guns. {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|2}}s, built between 1922–1927 with three triple 16-inch turrets forward, were based on the 1921 [[G3 battlecruiser]] concept.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|pp=43–50}} For most battleships the top speed was {{convert|21|-|25|kn|km/h}}.{{efn|These were the {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|2}}s, {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|2}}s, {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|2}}s, and {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=150, 230, 177 and 141}}}} {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|2}}s could reach {{convert|26.5|kn|km/h mph}}.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p = 347}} The [[fast battleship|fastest Western battleship]]s or [[battlecruiser]]s could exceed {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph}}.{{efn|These were the {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruiser|2}} {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and the two {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|2}}s.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|pp=29–36}}}}

Neither France nor Italy intended to match the most recent American, British, or Japanese designs: very heavily armed and armored. They only wished to modernize their aging fleet, refurbishing the [[Marine propulsion|propulsion machinery]] and upgrading the main artillery; the Treaty of Washington authorized them to undertake much more radical modernizations than the other treaty powers. In the same way, both powers reserved the right to employ their replacement [[capital ship]] tonnage allocation ({{convert|70000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}}) as they saw fit, subject to Treaty limits: not only were two battleships of {{convert|35000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} possible, but also three of {{convert|23000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} or four of {{convert|17500|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}}.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=17}}

===French battleship projects, 1926–1929===
[[File:HMS Nelson (Warships To-day, 1936).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Nelson|28|6}}, commissioned in 1927, which inspired the French battleship designers in the 1920s.]]

The core of  France's ''Statut Naval'' warship building program, adopted in 1924  was to enable the French Navy to counter the navies of Italy and Germany, but it was discovered that hoping to counter both navies was too optimistical.{{sfn|Masson|1991|pp = 327–330}} The Treaty of Washington allowed France to match Italy, who could also field ({{convert|175000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}}), at a level one-third that of the US and UK and 5/9th of Japan. From 1924 to 1932, the annual ''Tranche Navale'' (literally, a &quot;slice&quot; of the ''Statut Naval'') included only cruisers, [[destroyer]]s, [[torpedo-boat]]s and [[submarine]]s.{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=13}}

In 1926–1927 the French Admiralty, under [[Henri Salaun (admiral)|Vice Admiral Salaün]], considered ships designed as cruiser killers that would be able to outgun and outrun the Italian heavy cruisers, which were thought to be the main threat against the waterborne connections between France and North Africa.{{sfn|Masson|1991|pp=13–15}} The first Italian heavy cruiser, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Trento||2}}, had been laid down in 1925 and launched in 1926. French designers considered a displacement of {{convert|17500|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} that would have allowed them to build four units under the maximum limit of {{convert|70000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} (from the Treaty of Washington) for the authorized French replacements. An artillery arrangement of two {{convert|305|mm|in|adj=on}} 55-calibre quadruple turrets forward was examined, {{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=19}} combining the choice of quadruple turrets made by the French designers of the prewar {{sclass-|Normandie|battleship|4}}{{sfn|Labayle-Couhat|1974|pp=37–38}} and the all forward arrangement of ''Nelson''-class battleships.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|pp=46–50}} The top speed would have been {{convert|33|–|34|kn|km/h}}. The armor would have been able to resist {{convert|203|mm|in|adj=on}} shells. Ultimately, however, it was concluded that such warships would succumb to the Italian battleships, while not being fast enough to outrun Italian heavy cruiser.{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|pp=13–15}}{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=19–22}}

In 1927, studies were undertaken of {{convert|37000|t|LT|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} battlecruisers. This trial displacement would have been the equivalent of a standard Washington-Treaty displacement of {{convert|32000|–|33000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}}, near the limit. However, building {{convert|35000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} battleships outstripped the French Navy's technical and financial capacities at the time. The building costs of the required infrastructure{{efn|This infrastructure would have been new building docks or [[slipway]]s, since the longest one the Navy Yards then had was only {{convert|200|m|ft|sigfig=2|sp=us}} long, and [[graving dock]]s.}} for hulls of about {{convert|230|–|250|m|ft|sigfig=2}} length, allowing them to reach a speed of {{convert|27|–|29|kn|km/h}}, would have been enough to buy two more battleships, and would have jeopardized the building program for cruisers, destroyers, and submarines.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan &amp; Dumas_p=24-26&quot;&gt; --&gt;{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=24–26}}

Contemporaneous discussions at the Disarmament Subcommittee of the [[League of Nations]] had begun in Geneva, about the pursuit of naval armaments limitation. The UK was trying to further limit construction, with a displacement limit of {{convert|25000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} and a maximum caliber of {{convert|305|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The French government chose not to jeopardize the negotiations.{{sfn|Masson|1991|p=334}}

===German pocket battleships===
[[File:Panzerschiff Deutschland in 1936.jpg|thumb|1936 picture of the Panzerschiff ''Deutschland'', [[laid down]] in 1929, commonly designated as a pocket battleship.]]

====The {{formatnum:23000}}-tonne battleship====
In February 1929, everything changed when the German [[Reichsmarine]] laid down the keel of the first {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser|2}}, an armored ship (in German, ''Panzerschiff''). They claimed it displaced {{convert|10000|LT|t|sigfig=3}}, following the Treaty of Versailles restrictions; it was actually at least 25% bigger, initially known only  to them. With two [[28 cm SK C/28 naval gun|{{convert|280|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}}]] triple turrets and a top speed of {{convert|26|kn|km/h mph}} could outrun every battleship except the three fastest British units (battlecruisers HMS ''Hood'', {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}}). The German ship outgunned all treaty-abiding cruisers with their {{convert|203|mm|in|adj=on}} guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=286}} ''Deutschland''{{'}}s type was commonly designated as a pocket battleship, although, as her German denomination well-indicated&amp;nbsp;– an armored cruiser.{{sfn|Lenton|1966|p=8}}

The French Admiralty's reaction was to draft a design for a ship that would outclass the German &quot;pocket battleship&quot; in armament, armor and speed. It appeared that the previous French proposals' armament might be retained and that the speed might be no more than {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph}}, but the most important feature was that the armor had to be thicker to resist {{convert|280|mm|in|adj=on}} shells. These considerations lead to a planned displacement of about {{convert|23000|–|25000|t|LT|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}}, which fit the maximum displacement that the United Kingdom proposed in the naval armament limitations negotiations.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=26}}

The 1930 [[London Naval Treaty]] established that the ten-year battleship-building holiday agreed at Washington would be extended for a further five years, until 31 December 1936. France and Italy were, however, authorized to build the replacement tonnage that the Washington Naval Treaty entitled them to lay down. Nevertheless, France and Italy refused to adhere to any qualitative limitations, which were mainly concerning the maximum displacement of cruisers,{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p=5}} as France argued that construction had just started in Germany of the armor-clad ''Deutschland'', and following the new limits' rejection by France, Italy was no longer prepared to accept new restrictions concerning battleships.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=72}}

In order to establish a ceiling for new naval construction, bilateral talks took place between France and Italy, with significant encouragement from the United Kingdom; these talks began at the start of 1931, and a basis of agreement was concluded on 1 March 1931. Until 1936, both countries would be allowed to build only two battleships, each of {{convert|23333|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}}. But it was not possible to go further, as the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] was not satisfied with the {{convert|23333|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} battleship Italian project, with three twin {{convert|381|mm|in|adj=on}} turrets and a profile reminiscent of the heavy cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Pola||2}} (then in construction).{{sfn|Giorgerini|Nani|1973|p=31}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=381–383}} A complete artillery and power plant refit of the {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|2}}s would begin in 1933, and plans for a {{convert|35000|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} Standard displacement battleship would be going on.{{sfn|Giorgerini|Nani|1973|pp=295–302}}

====''Dunkerque''====
In 1931, the French Admiralty explicitly confirmed the choice of a {{convert|23333|LT|t|adj=on}} battleship, since the {{convert|17500|LT|t|adj=on}} battleship would have been too lightly armored and the {{convert|35000|LT|t||sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} battleship would had technical and financial requirements that outstripped France's capabilities. This {{convert|23333|LT|t|adj=on}} battleship would have had a length of {{convert|213|m|ft}} and a {{convert|27.5|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], two quad {{convert|305|mm|in|adj=on}}/55 turrets forward, three quad {{convert|130|mm|in|adj=on}} [[Dual purpose gun|Dual Purpose (DP)]] turrets aft, a {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph|adj=on}} top speed, {{convert|230|mm|in|adj=on}} [[belt armor]], and {{convert|150|mm|in|adj=on}} [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor. However, when in May 1931 this proposal was submitted to the Parliament, discussions continued for two months. Critics wondered why it was necessary to have twice the displacement of the warship to be countered and why it was not preferable to build a {{convert|35000|LT|t||sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}} battleship. Thus, in the July 1931 Estimates, funds were allocated only for further studies and the law required that the final characteristics be subject to a thorough review, to be reviewed by the Parliament before passing any building orders.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=28–29}}

At this point, Vice Admiral Durand-Viel, the new [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]] from January 1931, requested further studies for upgrading the main artillery caliber&amp;nbsp;– from {{convert|305|mm|in}} to {{convert|330|mm|in}}&amp;nbsp;– to outgun the Italian battleships. This upgrade resulted in a displacement increase to {{convert|26500|LT|t|sigfig=5|link=in|adj=on}}, a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on|sigfig=2}} length increase, a {{convert|2.5|m|ft|adj=on}} beam increase, a slight maximum speed reduction to {{convert|29.5|kn|km/h mph}}, the substitution of {{convert|330|mm|in|adj=on}}/52 guns for {{convert|305|mm|in|adj=on}}/55 ones, two more double {{convert|130|mm|in|adj=on}} DP turrets, and a slight thickness increase in the armored belt and deck armor.{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|pp=16–17}}{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=29}} In early 1932, the project was approved by Parliamentary committees and the Minister of Defence ([[François Pietri]]) included it in the 1932 Estimates. This led to orders for {{ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}} on 26 October 1932, laid down on 24 December.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=433}}

After ''Deutschland'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} was laid down in June 1931 and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} was laid down in October 1932.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=287}} The French Navy asked for a second {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|2}} that was included in the 1934 Estimates.{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|p=16}}

===''Scharnhorst'' and ''Littorio''===
[[File:Scharnhorst1.jpg|thumb|right|The battleship ''Scharnhorst'', before she was fitted (in the early months of 1939) with a clipper bow and before her main mast was placed {{convert|27|m|ft}} astern.]]

Originally, the ''Deutschland'' class was intended to have six ships. On 14 February 1934, two more were ordered; officially the fourth and fifth ''Deutschland''-class units, as the [[Third Reich]] had not yet renounced the Treaty of Versailles. However, discussions about their characteristics led to an upgraded design. The new ships emerged as the {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|4}}&amp;nbsp;of small battleship (together with the ''Dunkerque'' class). These were to be faster than the 1920s battleships, with a displacement substantially under the Treaty of Washington limits.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=79}} Heavier than ''Dunkerque''-class battleships, they were {{convert|31800|LT|t|adj=on|sigfig=5}} with the hull dimensions of the {{sclass-|Ersatz Yorck|battlecruiser|2}} (projected in 1915). They were armored with a {{convert|350|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} belt and deck armor equivalent to the later {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|5}} and {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship|5}} battleship classes. However, they were armed with only nine {{convert|280|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} guns, the same caliber as the ''Deutschland'' class.  [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] preferred a heavier caliber for the main artillery. The ''Dunkerque''-class battleships were armed with [[330mm/50 Modèle 1931 gun|{{convert|330|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}}]] guns. When these ships' final design was about to be settled, Germany was negotiating the 1935 [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], and the British government was pressing for limits on the battleship's main artillery caliber. Therefore, an improved gun ([[28 cm SK C/34 naval gun|28 cm SK C/34]]), with a longer barrel and higher muzzle velocity but the same {{convert|280|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} caliber, was reluctantly chosen.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=79}} {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} was laid down on 6 May 1935 and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} on 15 June 1935.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=293}}

Since French Navy [[Naval architecture|ship designers]] thought that the ''Dunkerque''-class battleships' armor was able to resist {{convert|280|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} caliber shells, they should not have needed a heavier battleship class. Italy believed the new French battleships disrupted the balance between the French and Italian Mediterranean battleship fleets. Italy thus designed new battleships that were intended to counter ''Dunkerque''-class battleships and the more heavily armed British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] battleships.{{sfn|Giorgerini|Nani|1973|p=320}} On 26 May 1934 [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] announced Italy's decision  to use its right to build battleships granted in naval limitation treaties. Days later, the Stefani news agency announced the laying down of two {{convert|35000|LT|t|adj=on|sigfig=5}} battleships,{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|pp=16–17}} armed with nine {{convert|381|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} guns;{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=31}} in October 1935 these were named {{ship|Italian battleship|Littorio||2}} and {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}}.{{sfn|Giorgerini|Nani|1973|p=320}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S54286, Italien, Schlachtschiff &quot;Littorio&quot;.jpg|thumb|The Italian battleship ''Littorio'' during speed trials in 1939, without AA battery, fire control directors, or aircraft installations]]

The first French {{convert|35000|LT|t|adj=on|sigfig=5}} battleship used the 1934 naval building plan unchanged. This led to a new ''Dunkerque''-class battleship with improved vertical (belt) armor: {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}}'s laying down was ordered on 16 July 1934.{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|p=17}}

Eight days later (on 24 July 1934), the French Navy Board set the new French battleships' specifications:{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=95}}
* Standard displacement: {{convert|35000|LT|t|sigfig=5}}
* Main armament: eight or nine {{convert|380|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} or {{convert|406|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} guns
* [[Battleship secondary armament|Secondary armament]]: capable of fire against both surface targets and long-range [[anti-aircraft]] fire
* Maximum speed: {{convert|29.5|–|30|kn|km/h mph}}
* Armor: belt {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}}; upper armored deck {{convert|160|mm|in|abbr=on}}; lower armored deck {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}}; underwater protection as with the ''Dunkerque''

Thirteen months later, the ''Service Technique des Constructions navales'' (S.T.C.N.)&amp;nbsp;established a definitive project that was submitted to the Minister on 14 August 1935 and adopted on 31 August. ''Richelieu'' was laid down on 22 October. France thus violated the Washington Treaty and the 1930 London Treaty, since {{convert|88000|LT|t|sigfig=5}} of new battleships (instead of {{convert|70000|LT|t|sigfig=5}}) had been ordered between 1922 and 31 December 1936. However, on 18 June 1935 the Anglo-German Naval Agreement had been signed between the United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– without consulting France&amp;nbsp;– and the Third Reich, ''de facto ''canceling'' ''the Treaty of Versailles limitations concerning the displacements of the various types of warships and allowing Germany to build a war navy within the limit of 35% of the Royal Navy's total tonnage. Having lost the hope of being able to counter both the German and Italian navies, as was allowed by the Versailles and Washington Treaties, France concluded that the ''Dunkerque''-class battleships were the answer to the ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships and the ''Richelieu''-class battleships the answer to the {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship}}.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=98}}

Germany went a step further, laying down two new battleships, ''Bismarck'' in November 1935 and {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} in June 1936. These ships, strongly armored as their protection absorbed more than 40% of their standard displacement, with a very large beam of {{convert|36|m|ft}}, got a very classic design, eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}}]] guns in double turrets (two forward and two aft) and the secondary anti-ship artillery as six double [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}}]] turrets on the sides. Their powerful anti-aircraft artillery in sixteen {{convert|105|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} guns in eight double turrets, plus numerous {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} and {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} mountings, controlled by six high-angle directors was unmatched anywhere;{{sfn|Lenton|1966|p=47}} officially declared as {{convert|35000|LT|t|sigfig=5}}, their displacement was actually more than {{convert|42000|LT|t|sigfig=4}} standard and even nearing {{convert|50000|t|LT|sigfig=4}} full load.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=299–304}}{{sfn|Lenton|1966|p=13}} The French answer was the laying down of the second ''Richelieu''-class battleship, {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}, in December 1936.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=98}}

==Design==
[[File:Richelieu-1.jpg|left|thumb|{{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}}, as designed, before the 1943 refit in New York]]
The ''Richelieu'' class had a planned standard displacement of {{formatnum:35000}} tons, equal to the Washington Treaty limit, with a main armament of eight [[380mm/45 Modèle 1935 gun|{{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}}]] guns in two quadruple turrets. Three ships in two subclasses were laid down, all of these had the main turrets in forward [[superfiring]] positions, while a fourth unit was planned with one turret forward and the other aft. The subclasses differed in their secondary artillery and aircraft installations, as well as minor differences resulting from ''Jean Bart''{{'}}s completion, ten years after ''Richelieu''.{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|pp=73–76}}

===''Richelieu'' and ''Jean Bart''===
Vice Admiral Durand-Viel, the Chief of the Navy's General Staff, was very concerned about continuity between the ''Richelieu'' battleship class and the preceding ''Dunkerque'' battleship class (whose lead ship had been ordered only two years before), to minimize planning and construction delays and to create homogeneous combat groups. They therefore envisaged a similar main and secondary artillery disposition.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=95}}

====Armament====

=====Main artillery=====
The French Navy Board had indicated in July 1934 a minimum caliber of {{convert|380|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;to match the Italians&amp;nbsp;– and a maximum caliber of {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;– the Washington Treaty limit. Eight guns was the minimum for efficiently spotting salvos.{{efn|It was thought, then, that in the early phase of a gun engagement, it was necessary to have quickly straddling salvos, and this was supposed easier with four-shell salvos, than with three-shell ones, as a salvo was generally fired, at this moment of the battle, with half the guns of the broadside}} This was one reason the Italians had not been satisfied by a {{convert|23300|LT|t|adj=on|sigfig=5}} 1931 battleship project, which had only six {{convert|381|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} guns. The maximum of nine guns corresponded to a battery of three triple turrets.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=31}}

An arrangement of two quadruple turrets would save more than a quarter of the turret armor weight (as compared to four double turrets), while retaining the same firepower, but {{convert|380|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on|adj=on}}  was the largest feasible for a quadruple turret. With a {{convert|106|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=4}} beam and {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} guns, the ''Nelson''-class battleships had accommodated only triple turrets. On ''Dunkerque'', with a {{convert|31.10|m|ft|abbr=on}} beam and {{convert|330|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on|adj=on}} guns, the four barrels of each turret were not mounted in separate cradles because this would have meant an unduly large [[barbette]] diameter. Instead, pairs of barrels were placed in common mounts.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=433}} However, the fore and [[aft]] main quadruple turrets of the British ''King George V''-class battleships had independent mountings.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p=54}} These ships had nearly the same beam, {{convert|103|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=4}} versus {{convert|102.25|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|1|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} more for the main guns caliber, {{convert|14|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} versus {{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}}, than on ''Dunkerque''.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p=59}}{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=71}}{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=38}}

The quadruple turret's major drawback was that a single shot might destroy one turret and cripple half the main battery. To help prevent this, the ''Dunkerque''-class battleships' quadruple turrets had been divided internally, with a {{convert|25|-|40|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on|sigfig=2}} [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] to localize damage.{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=69}} This method proved effective at [[Attack on Mers-el-Kebir|Mers-el-Kebir]]. The first British {{convert|381|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} shell to strike ''Dunkerque'' hit the second {{convert|330|mm|in|sigfig=3|adj=on|abbr=on}} turret; this killed the crew in the turret's right half, but the left half remained operational.{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|p=69}}

The all-forward arrangement of two quadruple turrets, and more broadly the proximity between the two main artillery magazines (one for each turret), was the greatest risk: one hit could potentially neutralize the entire main battery, or even cause the ship's loss from an ammunition explosion. On ''Dunkerque'', to avoid this risk the forward turrets had been positioned {{convert|27|m|ft|sp=us}} apart from one another,{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=433}} further apart than on the ''Nelson''-class battleships.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=33}}

The French also studied three-turret designs, such as one quadruple and two double, two triple and one double, or three triple. In every case, three turrets would have increased weight vs two quadruple turrets, reduced propulsion to {{convert|100000|hp|MW|sigfig=3}} and speed by {{convert|2.5|kn|km/h mph}}, for a small benefit of further dispersing the guns.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp = 95–97}} Therefore, following the proposal of STCN's head, the Chief of Navy General Staff chose as early as November 1934 the all-forward arrangement with two quadruple turrets.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|pp = 9–11}}

The solutions used on ''Dunkerque''-class battleships were retained on ''Richelieu'', in a scaled-up version: an all-forward arrangement, in two {{convert|2476|t|LT|adj=on}} 1936-model quadruple turrets built by [[Saint-Chamond (manufacturer)|Saint-Chamond]], weighing {{convert|3096|t|LT}} together with the barbette.

Each ''Richelieu'' turret was divided in two half turrets by a {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} bulkhead. The guns, in the half turrets, were in pairs, and although each gun was in a separate cradle, the relative movement of the pair was limited. The guns were so close ({{convert|1.95|m|ft|sp=us}}, only {{convert|0.30|m|ft|sp=us}} more than on ''Dunkerque'') that a wake effect between shells fired simultaneously by a half turret led to excessive dispersal, which was not corrected before 1948 on ''Richelieu''.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=73}} The turrets were positioned {{convert|32.5|m|ft|sp=us}} apart from one another, {{convert|3.70|m|ft|sp=us}} more than on ''Dunkerque''.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=12}}{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|p=23}}

The barrel weight was {{convert|110|t|LT|sigfig=3}}.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=415}} This weight was: less than the {{convert|181|t|LT}} barrel on ''Yamato'',{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=327}} or the {{convert|130|LT|t|sigfig=3}} barrel on ''Nelson'';{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=106}} nearly the same weight as the {{convert|112|t|LT}} barrel on ''Nagato'',{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=327}} the {{convert|109|t|LT}} barrel on ''Bismarck'',{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=257}} the {{convert|107|LT|t}} barrel on the ''Iowa'',{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=189}} the {{convert|102|t|LT}} barrel on ''Littorio'',{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=369}} or the {{convert|97|LT|t|adj=on}} ''Queen Elizabeth'' barrel; and more than the {{convert|80|LT|t|sigfig=2|adj=on}} ''King George V'' barrel.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=106}}

The maximum angle of elevation of guns on the Model 1936 turret was 35°. Muzzle velocity was {{convert|830|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. The maximum range was theoretically {{convert|41500|m|yards|sp=us}}, practically {{convert|37800|m|yards|sp=us}}. The rate of fire was from 1.3 to 2 rounds per minute. The maximum horizontal turning speed was 5°/s, and the maximum elevating speed 5.5°/s.

The {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} shell was an [[Shell_(projectile)#Armor-piercing|Armor Piercing Capped]] (APC) shell, registered in the French Navy as '''''O'''bus de '''P'''er'''f'''oration'' (''OPf''). The OPf Model 1935 was a further development of the {{convert|330|mm|in|abbr=on}} OPf Model 1935, in use on ''Dunkerque'', except that its molded base formed a &quot;rudder&quot; that assisted in keeping the shell stable in flight. The {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} shell was {{convert|1.905|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighed {{convert|884|kg|lb}}, less than the {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|6}}{{'}} shell ({{convert|1224|kg|lb}}),{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=189}} that glancingly hit ''Jean Bart'' at the battle of Casablanca (1942), and some kilos more than the weight of the [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|{{convert|381|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] shells of {{HMS|Barham|04|6}} or {{HMS|Resolution|09|6}} ({{convert|875|kg|lb}}),{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=106}} that lightly damaged ''Richelieu'' at the 1940 [[Battle of Dakar]].{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=81–83}}

The OPfK Model 1935 incorporated a dye bag and fuze (''dispositif K'') to color{{efn|The color was yellow for  ''Richelieu'' and orange for ''Jean Bart''.}} hits and misses, thereby facilitating [[Artillery observer|spotting]] for ships operating in formation while in combat. No [[Shell_(projectile)#High-explosive|High Explosive]] (HE) variant of the {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} shell was originally provided. A total of 832 APC shells were intended to be provided, slightly fewer than for the ''Dunkerque''-class battleships (896 rounds).{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=102}}

Remote Power Control ([[List of British ordnance terms#RPC|RPC]]) was to be fitted for both horizontal turning and elevation; however, the failure of the Sautter-Harlé-Blondel system on ''Dunkerque''-class battleships prevented its use.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=101–107}}

=====Secondary artillery=====
[[File:Richelieu (cuirassé de 1939) Plage arrière.tif|thumb|right|On the background, the quarter deck (August 14, 1943 picture),{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=184}} with four quad {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} Bofors mountings, and nine {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} Oerlikon AA single mountings, on the former aircraft hangar; On the foreground, two single {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} Oerlikon mountings on the roof of the axial {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret]]

The French Navy had been first to fit a [[dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose (DP) battery]] on a battleship,{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p=52}} in the early 1930s; shortcomings had been seen with the {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} DP turrets and {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} twin automatic AA mountings, the solution of having a low-angle secondary battery and a high-angle tertiary battery was a feature of the new battleships in construction, as in the Italian and German navies.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=97}}{{sfn|Giorgerini|Nani|1973|p=327}}{{sfn|Lenton|1966|p=47}}

For the secondary artillery, all early projects kept the {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} caliber, in five quadruple Dual-Purpose turrets, at the same position as on the ''Dunkerque''-class battleships, but with quadruple turrets amidships, instead of double turrets. A tertiary anti-aircraft {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} ''zénithaux'' battery was considered, to complement the early design sketch's {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} DP battery.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=9}}

At the time [[torpedo]] attacks were considered more damaging than bombing. Thus a heavier caliber was required for the anti-ship battery. Since the ''Nelson''-class battleships, the [[Royal Navy]] had adopted a six {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} double turret battery as the secondary artillery on battleships. The [[Kriegsmarine]] had chosen {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, and the Italian Navy was fitting its {{convert|35000|LT|t|sigfig=5}} battleships with {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} caliber guns. It was decided to use triple {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets, as fitted on the most recent light cruisers, {{ship|French cruiser|Émile Bertin||2}} and the {{sclass-|La Galissonnière|cruiser|4}}s that were then being built. The STCN. proposed three solutions: five {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets and six {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} single mountings; or four {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets, without the fifth turret (central axial); or with two center line aft turrets in a superfiring position, and eight {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} single mountings, but it was difficult to site this AA battery while keeping it out of the blast effects of the main and secondary batteries.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=97}}

The French Naval Board in April 1935 resolved to fit ''Richelieu'' with five {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets in the same placement as for the {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery on ''Dunkerque''. It was decided that these {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets had to be dual-purpose, and that the tertiary {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA battery had to be abandoned, as the substitution of {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} DP turrets, weighing {{convert|306|t|LT}} to the {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets, weighing {{convert|200|t|LT|sigfig=3}},{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=415}} produced excess weight of about {{convert|530|t|LT|sigfig=3}}. It was also decided to install a new lighter propulsion plant, generating the same {{convert|150000|hp|MW}}, but using Sural boilers, which were more compact than ''Dunkerque''{{'}}s. It was therefore possible to reduce the number of boiler rooms from three to two, which allowed a reduction of the armored belt's length of nearly {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us}}, and consequently of its weight. As another weight-reduction measure, the armored belt's thickness was reduced from {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|330|mm|in|abbr=on}} and its inclination increased from 11°30' to 15°24' to [[Sloped armour|compensate for]] the thickness reduction. The armor thicknesses of longitudinal bulkheads, [[conning tower]], and the turrets and barbettes of the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns were also reduced.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=97}}

The triple {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} Model 1936 Dual Purpose turret was a further development of the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} Model 1930 Low-Angle turret. Mounted on separate cradles, the guns were {{convert|1.85|m|ft|sp=us}} apart. The horizontal turning speed was 12°/second, and the elevation speed was 8°/s. The guns' maximum elevation was 90°, with loading at every elevation theoretically possible. The muzzle velocity was {{convert|870|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. The shells to be used against sea targets were Semi Armored Piercing ([[List of British ordnance terms#S.A.P.|SAP]]) shells with a dye bag, registered in the French Navy as OPfK Model 1931, weighing {{convert|56|kg|lb}}, or {{convert|57.1|kg|lb}} for the OPfK Model 1937. Against aircraft, the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}}/55 Model 1930 guns were to fire High Explosive (HE) shells, registered as OEA ('''''O'''bus '''E'''xplosif en '''A'''cier'') Model 1936 and weighing {{convert|54.7|kg|lb}}, or {{convert|49.3|kg|lb}} for the OEA Model 1937. [[Star shell|Starshells]], registered as OEcl ('''''O'''bus '''Ecl'''airant'') Model 1936 and weighing {{convert|47|kg|lb}}, were to be provided for the amidships turrets. The rate of fire was 6.5&amp;nbsp;rounds per minute, against sea targets and 5&amp;nbsp;rpm against aircraft. The maximum range against sea targets, with a 45° elevation, was {{convert|24500|m|ft|sp=us}}. Full RPC was fitted. On the ''Richelieu'', the planned ammunition load was 2000 SAP shells, nearly 1000 HE shells, and 650 illuminating shells, for the three triple turrets fitted.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=106–107}}

The {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} Model 1930 Low-Angle turret proved to be at least comparable to the German single or twin {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun turrets, or the Italian triple {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets Model 1934 or 1936. For anti-aircraft purposes, the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} Model 1936 turret was thought to be complex and fragile, with a too-slow rate of fire against fast-moving aerial targets, with a deficient RPC and with loading jams at angles greater than 45°. These problems were probably due to the too-great weight, {{convert|228|t|LT}} without the barbette, of the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} DP Model 1936 turret; this was nearly {{convert|56|t|LT}} heavier than the {{convert|172|t|LT|adj=on}} {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} Model 1931. During World War II, no other {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns were used as an anti-aircraft battery; however, they were successfully used post-war in two {{sclass-|Worcester|cruiser|0}} U.S. Navy cruisers and three {{sclass-|Tiger|cruiser|2}}s of the Royal Navy, albeit with much better RPC and fire-control devices than the pre-World War II French ones.{{sfn|Preston|1981|pp=164,168 and 171}}

As war began in November 1939, it became evident that the projected {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} ACAD Model 1935 (automatic anti-aircraft twin) mountings would not be provided in time for ''Richelieu''{{'}}s completion; thus, a drastic revision of the AA battery was needed. The midship {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets had to be canceled, and twelve {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}/45 Model 1930 guns in six twin {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} mountings, CAD Model 1931, were instead fitted, as they had been on the last {{convert|10000|LT|t|sigfig=5}} Treaty cruiser ({{ship|French cruiser|Algérie||2}}). To speed the completion of the ''Richelieu'', four mountings had to be removed from the reconstructed battleship {{ship|French battleship|Lorraine||2}},{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=30–31}} and two from a battery near Marseilles.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|pp=9–12}} The {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} amidships turrets were not even mounted on ''Jean Bart''; nor were barbettes installed. The {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} mountings were fitted on ''Richelieu'' in April–May 1940.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=110}}

The {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} CAD Model 1930 turrets were dual-purpose. SAP shells ({{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} OPf Model 1928, weighing {{convert|15|kg|lb}}) would be used for sea targets, with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|765|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}} and a {{convert|15800|m|ft|sp=us}} maximum range, but only 10 rounds per gun were intended, due to the belief that anti-ship fire would mainly come from the stronger {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns. HE shells ({{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} OEA Model 1928, weighing {{convert|135|kg|lb}}) would be used on aerial targets, with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|780|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}} and a {{convert|10000|m|ft|sp=us}} ceiling (at the 80° maximum elevation). The rate of fire was 10rpm. Illuminating shells ({{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} OEcl Model 1928) were provided to replace the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} OEcl Model 1936.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=106–107}} The {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns proved to be the only reliable arms of ''Richelieu'' until 1942, due to the uncompleted or obsolescent fire control of the 380&amp;nbsp;mm and 152&amp;nbsp;mm batteries.

=====Anti-aircraft light artillery=====
For short range anti-aircraft defense, the French Navy had planned to develop for the ''Dunkerque''-class battleships an automatic version ({{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} ACAD Model 1935) of the {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} semi-automatic anti-aircraft with twin mountings (CAD Model 1933); the latter had a theoretical firing rate of 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;rpm. Hand loaded using a six-round box magazine, the actual firing rate was 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;rpm; in the same time period, the British [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|Pom Pom]] gun and the Swedish designed [[Bofors 40 mm]]/L60 gun had a 120 to 200&amp;nbsp;rpm firing rate. Therefore, the {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} ACAD Model 1935 was expected to have a firing rate of 120&amp;nbsp;rpm or above. However, in 1940 only a prototype ACAD mounting (designated Model 1936) was tested (aboard the old patrol sloop ''Amiens''; it was apparently successfully used during the [[Dunkirk evacuation]]).{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=168–169}}

Six {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} ACAD Model 1935 mountings would have been fitted, four [[abeam]]{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=What does this (and abaft) mean?}} the after funnel superstructure, and two abeam turret II. Four [[fire control system]]s, equipped with a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[rangefinder]] and linked to the mountings by an RPC system driven by Sautter-Hallé electric [[servomotor]]s, were intended to be installed: two for the forward mountings, abaft turret II, one deck higher, and two for the after mountings, abeam the mountings, one deck higher. This {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery would have been complemented by six or eight {{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} Hotchkiss quadruple MG mountings (CAQ Model 1929) on the upper platforms of the forward and aft towers.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=109–111}}

=====Fire control systems=====
The most conspicuous difference in the ''Richelieu'' and ''Dunkerque'' profiles was the mounting of the fire control director system aft, on a kind of [[mack (ship)|mack]], so that the funnel opening came out obliquely aft underneath the control tower.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=436}} Otherwise, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s fire control system was very similar to ''Dunkerque''{{'}}s. All the fire control systems were airtight and fitted with light steel plating against the [[machine gun]] attacks of strafing aircraft.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=108}}

Three fire control systems were mounted one over the other atop the fore tower. The lowest was the A system, for the main artillery, with a {{convert|14|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} triple stereoscopic OPL (''Optique de Précision de Levallois-Perret'') rangefinder. The {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} artillery used two fire control systems. System 1, in the upper position, was for anti-aircraft gunnery and had a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} double stereoscopic OPL rangefinder (DSR). System 2, in the central position, was for anti-ship gunnery and had a {{convert|8|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} double stereoscopic OPL rangefinder.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=107-108}}

The same noteworthy weight accumulation in the fore tower top as on ''Dunkerque'' proved to be a problem when ''Richelieu'' was torpedoed at Dakar, as a whiplash effect on the main mast around which they were mounted provoked more serious effects on the fore tower systems than on those on the aft tower, even though the latter was nearer the explosion.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=68}}

The aft tower carried only the auxiliary system for the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} artillery (system 3) with a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} DSR. The auxiliary (B) system for the main artillery was between the funnel and the axial aft {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret and had an {{convert|8|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} DSR. Each main artillery turret was fitted with a {{convert|14|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} DSR and each {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret with a {{convert|8|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} DSR. Two systems with {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} OPL rangefinders (OR) provided for the [[flag officer|flag]] staff were installed on the wings of the [[admiral]]’s [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. When the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA battery was fitted, they were replaced by systems fitted with {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} OR's for this battery's fire control. Two systems also fitted with {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} rangefinders were then mounted on the [[navigation]] bridge, one deck lower. There was also a {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} SOM (''Société d'Optique et de Mécanique de haute précision'') stereoscopic tactical rangefinder atop the admiral's bridge. As on the ''Dunkerque''-class battleships, the systems provided raw target data to the transmitting station located beneath the armored decks, with continuous transmission to the director and the guns.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=108}}

The [[lookout]] and target designation facilities were similar in principle to ''Dunkerque''{{'}}s. The lower lookout station for close-range contacts was on platform 3 of the fore tower. The middle level, for both surface and aerial contacts, was on platform 6 and the upper lookout station, primarily for spotting torpedoes and mines, was on platform 9.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=107, 115}} Night firing was aided by five {{convert|1.20|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} [[searchlight]]s, one atop the admiral's bridge and two on either side of the funnel structure.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=109}}

=====Aircraft installations=====
As on ''Dunkerque'', aircraft installations (aircraft hangar, crane and two catapults, for four seaplanes) were fitted on ''Richelieu''{{'}}s stern. The components were the same, {{convert|22|m|ft|sp=us}} trainable catapults operated with compressed air, which could launch a {{convert|3.5|t|LT}} aircraft at {{convert|103|km/h|mph}}, and a recovery crane with a capacity of {{convert|4.5|t|LT}}. The aircraft were ([[flying boat]]) [[seaplanes]] of the [[Loire 130]] type&amp;nbsp;– single-engined (720&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza 12-cylinder liquid cooled) with a {{convert|3500|kg|lb}} weight, a {{convert|210|km/h|mph}} maximum speed, a {{convert|165|km/h|mph}} cruise speed at {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}, two {{convert|7.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine guns]] and two {{convert|75|kg|lb}} bombs.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=34}}

''Richelieu''{{'}}s extra boiler in each [[boiler room (ship)|boiler room]] left one boiler room under the funnel instead of two. Consequently, the aft {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret on the center line, turret VII, was on [[frame (nautical)|frame]] 68.85{{efn|The frames, in the French Navy, are numbered, by the distance in meters from the ship's stern}} on ''Richelieu'', versus on frame 44.30 on ''Dunkerque'', as the aft lateral secondary turrets were respectively on frame 54.45, versus 53.30.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=12}}{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|p=23}}{{efn|Turret VII was abaft turrets V and VI on ''Dunkerque'', which corresponded to the traditional French method of turret numbering (from bow to stern), but turrets V and VI were abaft turret VII on ''Richelieu''.}} The {{convert|36.50|m|ft|sp=us}} space on the quarterdeck between the aviation hangar and the stern was 6 meters greater than that on ''Dunkerque.'' This made room for a second catapult. The catapults were offset to port and starboard ''en échelon''{{efn|The port catapult was on frame 9, and the starboard catapult on frame 24}} with an elevator between them. The planes were moved on rails from the hangar to the elevator where they were placed on the two catapults. Two planes could be stowed in the {{convert|25|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} hangar on the same level, [[Folding wings|wings folded]] and in line, instead of sitting on the two platforms of a two-tier hangar lift, and two more on the catapults with wings deployed.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=120}}

On ''Richelieu'', the armor weight was {{convert|16045|t|LT}} and corresponded to 39.2% of the total weight, for a {{convert|40927|t|LT}} normal displacement, with {{convert|2905|t|LT}} of fuel (half of full load).{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=10}} ''Dunkerque'' had 35.9%, ''Strasbourg'', 37.3%, with a {{convert|30750|t|LT}} or {{convert|31570|t|LT}} normal displacement, with {{convert|2860|t|LT|sigfig=4}} of fuel (¾ of full load).{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=21}}

Comparison with other battleships is more intricate. The figures given for ''Iowa''-class battleships are 18,700 tons for  armor weight or 41.6% of {{formatnum:45000}} tons standard displacement,{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p = 250}} which corresponds for ''Richelieu'' to more than 42% of standard displacement. For ''Bismarck'', the figures are 17,258 tons or 17,540 tons of armor, and from 43.92% to 41.30%, depending on whether the percentage is calculated with 39,931 tons light displacement or 41,781 tons standard displacement.{{sfn|Lenton|1966|p = 13}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p = 300}} All are higher than for earlier battleships (such as ''Dunkerque'') or those for the ''King George V''-class battleships, 12,500 tons and 34.80%{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p = 55}} or for the ''Littorio''-class battleships with {{convert|13600|t|LT}} weight of armor and 36% of {{convert|37750|t|LT}} standard displacement.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p= 117}}

=====Armor=====
Armor thicknesses were:{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=111–116}}
* The armored belt, with a [[sloped armour|slope]] of 15°24’, was {{convert|327|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick between frame 51.50 and frame 182.95 and from {{convert|3.38|m|ft|sp=us}} above the waterline to {{convert|2.50|m|ft|sp=us}} under the water line. The forward [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]], at frame 182.95, and the after bulkhead, at frame 51.50, extended from the main deck to the {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick floor of the [[magazine (artillery)|artillery magazines]], and were {{convert|233|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The forward bulkhead thickness increased to {{convert|355|mm|in|abbr=on}} between the first and second platform decks.
* The upper armored deck at main deck level was {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The lower armored deck was {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick and extended to frame 233, improving the protection of the forward part of the ship, left unprotected on ''Dunkerque''. Abaft the after transverse bulkhead, (at the first platform deck level) was a {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} armored deck with angled sides in the form of a [[carapace]] above the shafts, increasing to {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} above the steering gear.
* On the conning tower, the armor was {{convert|310|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick on the front and sides, {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the rear' and {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the roof.
* The main turrets were protected with {{convert|405|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick armor on the barbette, above the upper armored deck, {{convert|430|mm|in|abbr=on}} armor on the faces, inclined to 30°, from {{convert|170|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|195|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the roof, {{convert|240|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the turret I rear wall and {{convert|230|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the turret II rear wall. This thickness on the rear walls, less than ''Dunkerque'' or ''Strasbourg''{{'}}s approximately {{convert|345|mm|in|abbr=on}} thickness, was due to the use of a [[Krupp cemented armour|cemented steel]] on ''Richelieu''.
* The {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun turrets were less armored than ''Dunkerque''{{'}}s quadruple {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets, with a {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} thickness on barbettes, {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the faces angled at 45°, {{convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on}} on sides and roof, and {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the rear.

The British ''King George V''-class battleships and {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}} had a thicker armored belt than ''Richelieu'' ({{convert|356|mm|in|abbr=on}}), but their turrets were less protected ({{convert|330|mm|in|abbr=on}}), and the horizontal armor ({{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}}) was equivalent,{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p=59 et 66}} but their command spaces were only protected against shrapnel.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=184}}

The U.S. Navy battleships had an equivalent armored belt (about {{convert|335|mm|in|abbr=on}}) to ''Richelieu'', on the ''North Carolina'' and ''South Dakota'' classes, and a little less thick ({{convert|310|mm|in|abbr=on}}) on the ''Iowa'' class. The main artillery turret protection was less thick ({{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}}) on the ''North Carolina'' class, thicker ({{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on}}) on the ''Iowa'' class, and thicker ({{convert|457|mm|in|abbr=on}}) on the ''South Dakota'' class. The horizontal armor was a little less thick ({{convert|104|mm|in|abbr=on}}) on the ''North Carolina'' class and equivalent ({{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|165|mm|in|abbr=on}}) on the ''South Dakota'' and ''Iowa'' classes. The conning tower was better protected, with {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the ''North Carolina'' and ''South Dakota'' classes and with {{convert|445|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the ''Iowa'' class.{{sfn|Lenton|1968|pp=37, 41, 45}}

The Italian ''Littorio'' had a thicker armored belt ({{convert|350|mm|in|abbr=on}}) than ''Richelieu'', was less protected on the turrets, with {{convert|350|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and on the conning tower, with {{convert|260|mm|in|abbr=on}}, but had a slightly better horizontal protection with {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the upper armored deck and {{convert|162|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the main deck.{{sfn|Giorgerini|Nani|1973|p=319}} The German ''Bismarck''-class battleships had a thinner armor than ''Richelieu'' on the main artillery turrets ({{convert|356|mm|in|abbr=on}}), but thicker on the conning tower ({{convert|356|mm|in|abbr=on}}), equivalent for the armored belt ({{convert|320|mm|in|abbr=on}}) and weaker horizontal armor ({{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|115|mm|in|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Lenton|1966|p=47}}

=====Underwater protection=====
As on ''Dunkerque'', the underwater protection consisted of a sandwich of void spaces, light bulkheads, liquid loading compartments or compartments filled with a rubber-based water-excluding compound (''ébonite-mousse''), and a heavy internal holding bulkhead to absorb the explosion of a torpedo head.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=116}}

The compartment outward of the inclined armor belt had a maximum depth of {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}}, and had a filling of ''ébonite mousse''. Inward of this compartment, there was a {{convert|18|mm|in|abbr=on}} bulkhead, enclosing a void compartment {{convert|0.9|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, then an [[fuel oil|oil fuel]] bunker {{convert|3.4|m|ft|sp=us}} deep ({{convert|0.5|m|ft|sp=us}} less than on ''Dunkerque''), then a {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} bulkhead, containing a void compartment {{convert|0.67|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, backed by a {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo bulkhead of special steel. The maximum width was around {{convert|7|m|ft|sp=us}}. The reduction of {{convert|0.5|m|ft|sp=us}} comparing with ''Dunkerque'' was necessary to accommodate the boiler room design.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=117}}

This figure of {{convert|7|m|ft|sp=us}} width was impressive, compared with the {{convert|4.10|m|ft|sp=us}} on ''King George V'', {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us}} on ''Scharnhorst'', or {{convert|6|m|ft|sp=us}} on ''Bismarck''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=184 ,295 and 300}} The Italian ''Littorio''-class battleships had a peculiar underwater protection system, designed by chief designer, ''Generale Ispettore del Genio Navale'' [[:it:Umberto Pugliese|Pugliese]] that incorporated a {{convert|3.8|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} diameter cylindrical expansion space. But the [[Achilles' heel]]s of battleships facing [[torpedo]] attacks were their vitals that could not be protected, such as the shaft of ''Richelieu'' at Dakar, on 8 July 1940, or the rudder of ''Bismarck'' in May 1941.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=74 and 90–91}}

====Propulsion====
The faced constraints such as a {{convert|33.5|m|ft|sp=us}} beam to accommodate the barbettes of four {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun turrets, a {{convert|245|m|ft|sp=us}} long hull, limited by the length of the Navy shipbuilding infrastructure, and thus a length/beam ratio of 7.3. The target speed was {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph}}.{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=75}} Reaching the target required 150,000&amp;nbsp;hp, then the greatest mechanical power ever installed on a battleship. It would be surpassed on American ''Iowa''-class battleships in 1943–1944. An equivalent speed had been reached with less power (144,000&amp;nbsp;hp) on {{HMS|Hood|51|6}},{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p=40}} but with a {{convert|262|m|ft|sp=us}} hull, a {{convert|42000|t|LT}} displacement, and a length/beam ratio of 8. This was achieved absent any shipbuilding restraint or Treaty limit. All British and US battleships built in the late 1930s respected the Treaty's {{formatnum:35000}} ton displacement limit. The ''King George V'' class could reach {{convert|29|kn|km/h mph}}, while ''North Carolina'' or ''South Dakota'' classes reached {{convert|28|kn|km/h mph}}.&amp;nbsp;They were {{convert|225|m|ft|sp=us}} or {{convert|215|m|ft|sp=us}} long, with a propulsion plant developing respectively 110,000, 120,000 or 130,000&amp;nbsp;hp.{{sfn|Lenton|1972|p=59}}{{sfn|Lenton|1968|pp=37, 41}} The Italian ''Littorio''-class battleships exceeded {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph}} with a {{convert|230|m|ft|sp=us}} hull and 140,000&amp;nbsp;hp.{{sfn|Giorgerini|Nani|1973|p=329}} The German battleship ''Bismarck'' had a {{convert|29|kn|km/h mph|adj=on}} speed with 138,000&amp;nbsp;hp, and reached 31 knots with forcing for 150,000&amp;nbsp;hp,{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=300}} with a length/beam ratio of only 6.9 as she had nearly the same hull length as ''Richelieu'', but a wider beam ({{convert|36|m|ft|sp=us}}).{{sfn|Lenton|1966|p=47}}

''Richelieu'' employed six [[:fr:fonderie d'Indret|Indret]] boilers and four [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Parsons]] turbines. The boilers were of a new type, the so-called suralimenté, meaning pressure-fired (and thus the abbreviation of Sural). These boilers operated at 27&amp;nbsp;kg/cm² (384&amp;nbsp;lb/in²) pressure at {{convert|350|C|F}} ,{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=75}} as on ''Dunkerque'', but forced circulation and pressure firing produced 14.4&amp;nbsp;kg/m³) of steam per cubic meter well in excess of conventional boilers.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=50 and 117}} They were {{convert|6.30|m|ft|sp=us}} long versus 5.33&amp;nbsp;m in on ''Dunkerque'', {{convert|4.65|m|ft|sp=us}} height versus {{convert|5.34|m|ft|sp=us}}, and, moreover, {{convert|4.50|m|ft|sp=us}} wide versus {{convert|6.50|m|ft|sp=us}}.

''Richelieu''{{'}}s 2-meter greater beam made it possible to install three boilers side by side in two boiler rooms, instead of three rooms as on ''Dunkerque''. Boiler room 1 was underneath the fore tower, with, from starboard to port, boilers #10, #11, and #12, followed by the forward [[engine room]] housing the geared turbines for the wing shafts. Boiler room 2 (directly underneath the funnel), contained boilers #20, #21, and #22 and powered the center shaft turbines in the aft engine room. The reduction in number of boiler rooms caused a significant reduction in survivability, meaning that a single penetrating hit could deprive the ship of half (if not all) speed {{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p = 118}}

Each Engine Room held two sets of turbines, each driving a {{convert|4.88|m|ft|sp=us}} diameter four-bladed propeller . Each set comprised a single high pressure (27&amp;nbsp;kg/cm²) turbine, a medium pressure (10&amp;nbsp;kg/cm²) turbine, and two low pressure [[Steam turbine#Two-flow rotors|two-flow rotor turbines]] (4&amp;nbsp;kg/cm² and 1.25&amp;nbsp;kg/cm²). Four turbo generators, each of {{convert|1500|kW|hp}}, were used; two in the forward engine room, and the rest in a separate compartment directly abaft the main machinery spaces, adjacent to the magazines for the aft {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p = 23}}

The maximum fuel load for peace-time cruising was {{convert|5866|t|LT}}, but in wartime fuel was limited to {{convert|4700|t|LT}} to maximize the underwater protection system's effectiveness. When full, the liquid loading compartments created additional pressure on bulkheads instead of absorbing explosive pressures. The ships' travel radius was {{convert|9850|nmi|km mi}} at {{convert|16|kn|km/h mph}}, {{convert|8250|nmi|km mi}} at {{convert|20|kn|km/h mph|sigfig=2}}, and {{convert|3450|nmi|km mi}} at {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph|sigfig=2}}.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p = 25}}

During speed trials, in April 1940 {{convert|30.2|kn|km/h mph|sigfig=2}} was achieved using 123,000&amp;nbsp;hp with near {{convert|42000|t|LT}} displacement, and in June {{convert|31|kn|km/h mph}} were maintained for 3 hours and 30 minutes, with {{convert|41800|t|LT}} displacement and 155,000&amp;nbsp;hp, and {{convert|31.38|kn|km/h mph}} were reached with 179,000&amp;nbsp;hp forcing{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=What does forcing mean in this context?}}.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp = 117–120}}

===1938 Supplementary Program Battleships===
In 1937, Italy ordered two more {{sclass-|Vittorio Veneto|battleship|2}}s to be [[laid down]] in 1938. The French reaction was to order two more ''Richelieu''-class battleships, with an improved design, since France's limited building capacity required delays before laying these units down.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=163}}

The second London naval disarmament conference's failure marked the end of international naval armament limitation activity. Japan had withdrawn from the conference on 15 January 1936; Italy also declined to sign the [[Second London Naval Treaty]]. A so-called &quot;escalator clause&quot; had been included at the American negotiators' urging, allowing the signatory countries of the Second London Treaty (France, the UK and the US) to raise the battleship [[main battery]] [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] limit from {{convert|14|in|mm|sigfig=3}} to {{convert|16|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, and the limit for battleship [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] from {{formatnum:35000}} tons to {{formatnum:45000}} tons, if Japan or Italy still refused to sign after April 1, 1937.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=73}} Ultimately the US adopted [[16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 gun|{{convert|16|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} guns]] for their new [[fast battleship]] classes,{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=80}} whereas the UK chose to respect the Second London Naval Treaty limitations for the ''King George V''-class battleships. Germany was not concerned, as she had not been invited to the second London conference, but officially the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} had {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and {{formatnum:35000}} tons displacements. France decided to respect the limitations of {{formatnum:35000}} tons and {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} as long as no continental European power broke them.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=73}}{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=104}} In December 1937 [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy|Chief of the Navy General Staff (''Chef d'Etat-major Général de la Marine'')]], Admiral [[François Darlan|Darlan]] ordered a study of new designs for two battleships,{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=87}} driven by the problems revealed by ''Dunkerque''{{'}}s trials, especially her main and secondary artillery.{{sfn|Dumas|2001c|p=90}}

Three projects were studied, the first (project A) with the same quadruple arrangement forward as ''Richelieu'', but different secondary artillery arrangements, the second (project B) with one quadruple turret forward and one quadruple turret aft, the third (project C) with two fore triple turrets and one triple turret aft, in every case with a {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} caliber. Project C led to an excess displacement of {{formatnum:5000}} tons over the limit of {{formatnum:35000}} tons, so it was discarded.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=88–90}}

In June 1938, the French Admiralty's choice was conditioned by France's limited shipyard space that could accommodate very large ship construction. The [[:fr:Arsenal de Brest#Les bassins du Salou|Salou]] #4 graving dock in the [[Brest, France|Brest]] Navy Yards was intended to be ready for building a new battleship in January 1939, when the ''Richelieu'' would have floated out, as all other large shipyards were in use. On the new [[:fr: Alfred Caquot|Caquot dock]], in the Penhoët Shipbuilding Yards in [[Saint-Nazaire]], ''Jean Bart'' was under construction and expected to be floated out in late 1939-early 1940. In the same yard, on the #1 slipway where {{SS|Normandie}} and ''Strasbourg'' had been laid down, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Joffre||2}} was to be built from November 1938 till 1941. Consequently, it was not reasonable to keep the Salou dock empty for six or more months, waiting to start building a Project B design that needed at least a year to prepare definitive drawings after it had been ordered. Therefore, the Project A design was chosen for the Salou building dock. The Caquot dock could then be used for the second.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=104}}

Admiral Darlan chose Project A variant 2 for the third ''Richelieu''-class ship to be laid down, named ''Clemenceau''. He chose project B variant 3 for the second ship&amp;nbsp;– a design in which he was much involved&amp;nbsp;– and named her ''Gascogne'' after [[Gascony]] where he was born,{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=88}} marking a transition to adopting province names for battleships.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=176}}

In summer 1939 the French intelligence service warned the Admiralty that the keels of two German battleships had been laid down, allegedly of {{convert|40000|t|LT}} and with {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns. They were actually [[Plan Z]] [[H-class battleship proposals|H-39-class]] battleships. It was decided to breach the Treaty limits. Based on the studies of 1938's Project C, new designs led to the so-called ''Province'' or later {{sclass-|Alsace|battleship|2}}s that were never even ordered.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=104–105}}

====''Clemenceau''====
On ''Clemenceau'', the main artillery arrangement was as on ''Richelieu'' and ''Jean Bart''. But the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery would have consisted of four triple turrets of {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} caliber, two amidships (one on each side), and two aft in [[superfiring]] positions. Darlan thought that the three {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets aft on ''Richelieu'' were a mistake, since two turrets in centerline positions would provide the same broadside of six guns and save nearly {{convert|300|t|LT}}, allowing six more {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA mountings. Two of these mountings would have been positioned in front of the fore tower in superfiring position abaft the fore {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets, and four others, abeam the funnel and the axial aft {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets, and abaft the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} amidships turrets.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=94}} As the firing arcs of the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets amidships were intended to be mainly directed forwards, the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA battery would have been shielded enough from their blast effects. Moreover, these {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets would have been fully enclosed, with a {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} plating against shrapnel. This new model of turrets was known as the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} CAD Model 1937, and also as the ''mine sweeper sloop type'', since it was intended to be installed on the {{sclass-|Elan|minesweeping sloop|5}} and {{sclass-|Chamois|minesweeping sloop|5}} minesweeper sloop classes; it was also intended for the {{sclass-|Le Fier|destroyer|5}} destroyer class and as a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] on the ''De Grasse'' cruiser class, to be commissioned in the late 1930s or early 1940s.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=168}}

But this new arrangement involved some difficulties. The second aft turret in superfiring position had a greater part of its barbette above the main armored deck, and thus needed more {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} plating. The {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret faces' armor thickness had to be reduced to {{convert|116|mm|in|abbr=on}}– instead of {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} – the armored belt's to {{convert|320|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the main turrets' rear plates' to {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The auxiliary fire control system abaft the funnel, for the {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery, was to be mounted about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us}} higher than in ''Richelieu'', requiring a greater funnel height.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=440}} Two more fire control systems with {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} stereoscopic ORs, for the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA battery, would have been installed on the sides of the fore tower. To save weight, particularly in the heights, the anti-ship fire control system for the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery would have not been installed, but the two remaining fire control directors for the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery, on the aft tower and on the fore tower in the upper position, would have been fitted with a stereoscopic {{convert|8|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} OR.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=170–171}} With these arrangements, the anti-ship and anti-aircraft artillery on ''Clemenceau'' would be better than that originally intended for ''Richelieu'' and ''Jean Bart''.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=97}}

As a last consequence, the center line arrangement of the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets aft placed the extreme aft turret (turret VI) in frame 54.45,{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=94}} while on ''Richelieu'' the extreme aft turret (turret VII; in the center line position) was on the 68.85 frame. Thus, the aviation hangar would have been shortened by nearly {{convert|15|m|ft|sp=us}}. The aft lateral turrets' removal, which were on ''Richelieu'' precisely on frame 54.45,{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=12}} would allow a broader hangar. The two seaplanes in the hangar would have been accommodated side by side, wings folded, instead of in line. Otherwise, the aviation facilities would have been the same as on ''Richelieu''.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=166}}

The short-range anti-aircraft battery would have been six twin ACAD Mode 1935 mountings, installed with their fire control systems on nearly the same positions as on ''Richelieu'', but the two forward mountings were slightly abaft the turret II barbette, and for the four after mountings one deck higher. New quadruple {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} ''zénithaux''{{efn|The Hotchkiss ''zénithaux'' mounting guns were normally pointed skywards and could be angled in both the horizontal and vertical planes to a maximum of 45 degrees.}} mountings, intended to be used against dive-bombing aircraft, would have been installed on each side of the quarterdeck near the aviation hangar.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=167-169}}

====''Gascogne''====
The most conspicuous change with ''Gascogne'' would have been the return to a main artillery arrangement with a quadruple {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun turret aft. This rearrangement also would shift superstructures forward so that these were now mounted almost exactly midships and no longer at a considerable distance aft of the midship position.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=440}}

''Gascogne''{{'}}s secondary artillery would have been three triple turrets of {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} caliber, all on one axial line, two in a superfiring position forward and one between the funnel and the aft {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret, which freed up the sides of the ship for eight anti-aircraft dual mountings of {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} caliber.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=171}} As the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns' magazines would have been near the main artillery turrets' magazines, which would increase risks, the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets' armor had to be improved. In July 1938 it was proposed to increase the turret armor thickness to {{convert|190|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the faces (instead of {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}}), {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the roofs and {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the sides (instead of {{convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on}}); the barbettes would have remained at {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In February 1939, a rebalancing was proposed with a thickness of {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the barbette, {{convert|155|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the turret faces, and from {{convert|135|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|85|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the turret sides. A thinner upper armored deck had been considered, reducing its thickness to around {{convert|145|mm|in|abbr=on}}, instead of around {{convert|160|mm|in|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=93, p.98}} but there is no proof that such a decision was actually taken, beyond a STCN recommendation dated 5 March 1938.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=174}}

In the December 1938 designs, aircraft installations were intended to be fitted at the ship's center, with trainable catapults between the fore tower and the funnel, with a hangar at the aft tower's base. Problems with positioning the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA battery too near the main and secondary batteries resulted, in February 1939, in repositioning the aircraft installations at the ship's stern. A single axial catapult would have had its pedestal countersunk in the quarterdeck, with an internal hangar in a recess under the first deck and a lift to hoist the seaplanes to the first deck level to avoid the blast effects of the rear {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret firing, which also would have required raising the aft {{convert|381|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret up one deck, on the ''Vittorio Veneto''-class battleships.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=88–90, 99}} The hull seaplanes would have been of a new twin-motored type, the Farman/NCAC NC 420, with an increased endurance ({{formatnum:1350}} km at 240&amp;nbsp;km/h, versus {{formatnum:1125}} km at 150&amp;nbsp;km/h for the [[Loire 130]]). Its prototype was almost complete in June 1940 but never flew.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=176}} Two seaplanes would have been stowed in the hangar in line, and a third one would have been parked on rails on the quarterdeck, to the aviation hangar's starboard.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=176}}

Thus, the eight {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} CAD Model 1937 turrets would have been positioned in four groups of two, amidships, in the four corners of the [[superstructure]]. Each group of two turrets would have had a fire control system, with a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} OR; for the forward groups this would be on each side of the fore tower, and for the aft turret groups it would be atop the aft tower. Thus, the backup system for the {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery would have been eliminated, and the secondary battery's fire control direction insured by the upper system in the fore tower for anti-ship gunnery and by the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} battery's systems for anti-aircraft gunnery.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=174}}

The six {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA Model 1935 guns would have been installed with four mountings abeam the forward turret (two on the [[forecastle]] and two a little abaft, one deck higher), with their fire control systems amidships between the fore and the aft tower, and the two would have been positioned abeam the aft superstructure with their fire control systems a little forward and one deck higher. The {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} ''zénithaux'' quadruple mountings were repositioned amidships between the fore and aft towers, because on the [[quarterdeck]]&amp;nbsp;– as on ''Clemenceau''&amp;nbsp;– they would have been excessively exposed to the blast from the aft main turret.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=170–175}}

===''Richelieu''===
[[File:Richelieu-3.jpg|right|thumb|''Richelieu'' at [[Dakar]], in 1941; there were three fire control systems atop the fore tower and neutrality tricolor bands on turret II]]

The keel was laid down on 22 October 1935 in Brest.{{sfn|Sarnet|Le Vaillant|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=8}} The hull was floated out on 17 January 1939.{{sfn|Sarnet| Le Vaillant|1997|p=21}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|p=39}} ''Richelieu'' then left the Salou graving dock, to be armed in one of the [[:fr:Arsenal de Brest#Les bassins de Laninon|Laninon]] docks at the Brest Navy Yards. The bow and the stern, built separately, were attached there since the Salou graving dock was only {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}} long.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=435}}{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=49}} Mechanical trials began at the end of March 1940.{{sfn|Sarnet| Le Vaillant|1997|p=34}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|p=43}}

In April 1940, ''Richelieu'' [[Ship naming and launching|went to sea for the first time]]. In late May and mid-June, the Commanding Officer, Captain Marzin carried out speed and gunnery trials, reaching 32 knots, and firing a few shots from her main and secondary batteries. Due to the advance of German troops, ''Richelieu'' hastily left Brest bound for Dakar on 18 June 1940, having on board 250 [[shell (projectile)|shells]] but only 48 [[Artillery#Propellant|powder charges]] for her main battery.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=45}} Escorted by the {{sclass-|Adroit|destroyer|2}}s {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}}, she reached Dakar on 23 June 1940.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|p=49}}{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=122–125}}

====Dakar, under Vichy's orders====
[[File:HMS Hermes June 1940.jpg|left|thumb|{{HMS|Hermes|95|6}}, whose aircraft torpedoed ''Richelieu'' at Dakar on 7 July 1940; in the background is {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}}]]

As the local political conditions seemed very dubious regarding the acceptance of the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|armistice]] between [[Vichy France|France]] and Germany, Captain Marzin decided to proceed to [[Casablanca]] two days later, shadowed by a powerful British battle group. ''Richelieu'' was sent back to Dakar by the French Admiralty on 28 June where she moored in the outer roadstead, east of Dakar harbour and north of the island of Gorée, protected only, on the high sea side, by a line of five seized British flagged freighters.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|p=74}} Her anti-aircraft artillery was very weak. The {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets could not fire on aerial targets, as the corresponding uppermost rangefinder on the fore tower had not been put in service; moreover, shells and powder charges were lacking. Only the six {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets were usable. The short range anti-aircraft artillery had only four double {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} semi-automatic mountings, four quadruple {{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun|Hotchkiss machine gun]]s, and two twin 13.2&amp;nbsp;mm machine guns.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=12}}

The 22 June 1940 armistice prompted British anxiety that the French Navy would be taken over by the [[Axis Powers]]. This led to attacks from the Royal Navy against the French warships ([[Operation Catapult]]): to seize them (in British harbors), sink them (at [[attack on Mers-el-Kebir|Mers el-Kebir]]), or intern them (at [[Alexandria]]). During the night of July 7 to 8, five days after the attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, a team from {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} attempted to damage ''Richelieu'' with [[depth charge]]s moored under her [[stern]], but they did not explode. In the morning, [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] [[bomber]]s from ''Hermes'' torpedoed ''Richelieu'' below the armored deck. This caused a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} long hole, and disabled the starboard propeller shaft; flooding caused her stern to touch bottom. One torpedo is likely to have hit the depth charges moored during the night. The crippled battleship was pumped out after a few days and made [[seaworthy]] for emergencies, and moored inside the Dakar harbor.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=70–77}}

On 24 September, ''Richelieu'' took part in the defence of [[battle of Dakar|Dakar]] against British and [[Free French Forces|Free French]] forces. There was a gunnery duel between ''Richelieu'' and the British battleships {{HMS|Barham|04|6}} and {{HMS|Resolution|09|6}}: ''Barham'' was hit twice by the shore batteries manned by ratings from ''Richelieu''. In the engagement ''Richelieu'' was struck by two {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} shells causing no serious damage; there were 250 near misses.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=49}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=79–84}} ''Richelieu'' was damaged in the battle the first time her main battery fired: a {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} shell blew back and disabled two guns in the #2 main turret; this was thought to be from the use of the wrong propellant type. There was no more firing during this day with the #2 main turret. On the day after, the #1 main turret was used instead. The propellant was changed to the SD19 propellant of the reconditioned ''Strasbourg'' powder charges; however, this caused serious problems regarding range-finding. In 1941, an inquiry commission under Admiral [[:fr:Hervé de Penfentenyo|de Penfentenyo de Kervérégen]] concluded there had been a mistake in the shell base design.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|pp=77–78}} During the two days, ''Richelieu'' fired a total of 24 rounds. No hits were recorded. The third day, as HMS ''Resolution'' had been struck by a torpedo from a French [[submarine]], the British and Free French force retreated.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=80–84}}

Temporary repairs were completed in Dakar; some light anti-aircraft mountings were added, partly taken from the wreck of the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Audacieux||2}} (severely damaged by a [[heavy cruiser]] during the battle).{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=12}} During the first months of 1941, ''Richelieu'' was the first French battleship to be fitted with an early French [[radar]] (designated as &quot;electro-magnetic detection&quot;). On 24 April 1941, ''Richelieu'' could sail at {{convert|14|kn|km/h mph}} on three engines, the fourth propeller having been removed. During July 1941, three Loire 130 [[seaplane]]s were shipped.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=34, p.50}}

====On the Allies' side====
[[File:Richelieu Ney York.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' arrives in New York with her damaged turret II. The uppermost [[fire control system]] on the fore tower had to be dismantled for her to pass under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]]]

After French forces in Africa joined the Allies after the Allied [[North African Campaign timeline|landings in North Africa]] in November 1942, the ''Richelieu'' sailed for [[refit]]ting at the [[New York Navy Yard]] on 30 January 1943. The three ruined barrels of ''Richelieu''{{'}}s upper main battery turret were replaced by barrels previously fitted on {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}, the second ''Richelieu''-class unit, that was staying at Casablanca. The fourth barrel from ''Jean Bart'' was used for trials at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Dahlgren]] firing range and never made its way onto the battleship.{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=37}}

The seaplane equipment (hangar, catapults, and crane) had been removed in Dakar. The space thus spared on the stern was used to mount {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft guns on the rear deck. The overall anti-aircraft armament was massively reinforced, with 48 {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} AA guns in single mounts replacing the original {{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} Hotchkiss machine guns, and 14 quad {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets replacing the original {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} semi-automatic guns. Adoption of US-pattern [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary batteries]] made providing ammunition easier; a special factory had to be set up to produce ammunition for the main battery. She remained with only two [[rangefinder]]s on the fore tower, and the rear mast was shortened. She was fitted with air and surface warning radar, but the U.S. Navy was reluctant to provide gunnery practice radars.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=181}} All these modifications increased her [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] by {{convert|3000|t|LT}}. After sea trials&amp;nbsp;– with a maximum speed of {{convert|30.2|kn|km/h mph}}&amp;nbsp;– the refit was declared complete on 10 October 1943.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=195–217}}{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|pp=36–41}}

''Richelieu'' sailed for Mers el-Kebir on 14 October and thence to [[Scapa Flow]], arriving on 20 November. She served with the [[British Home Fleet]] from November 1943 to March 1944, participating in an operation off the Norwegian coast in January 1944. She was then transferred to the [[British Eastern Fleet]] to cover for British battleships undergoing refit; this was despite reportedly strong anti-[[Gaullist]] sympathies on board and limitations of her radar and ammunition (only available from US sources). She arrived at [[Trincomalee]], [[Colonial history of Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]) on 10 April 1944, in time to join the attack by Task Force 65 on [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]] on 19 April ([[Operation Cockpit]]) and on [[Surabaya]] in May 1944 ([[Operation Transom]]); she also served in Operations Councillor and Pedal, in June. On 22 July, she sailed to attack Sabang and [[Sumatra]] (Operation Crimson) and returned to Trincomalee on 27 July.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=191–216}}

Relieved by {{HMS|Howe|32|6}}, ''Richelieu'' returned to Europe. After about a week in [[Military port of Toulon|Toulon]], she sailed for Casablanca, where she arrived on 10 October 1944, for [[careening]]. She was refitted in [[Gibraltar]] in January 1945, and rejoined the Eastern Fleet until the end of the war against Japan, arriving back at Trincomalee on 20 March 1945.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=195–217}} Now with Task Force 63 of the British East Indies Fleet, she joined in more bombardments of Sabang in April and of the [[Nicobar Islands]] in late April to early May. The next operation, to intercept the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}}, was abortive.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=216–224}}

''Richelieu'' refitted at [[Durban]] from 18 July to 10 August,{{sfn|Sarnet| Le Vaillant|1997|p=325}} and arrived via Diego Suarez at Trincomalee on 18 August, learning of the Japanese surrender on 15 August.{{sfn|Sarnet| Le Vaillant|1997|p=329}} She left Trincomalee on 5 September to participate in the liberation of [[Singapore]], [[Operation Tiderace]].{{sfn|Sarnet| Le Vaillant|1997|p=330}} While she was passing down the [[Straits of Malacca]] on 9 September, at 07:44 a [[Naval mine|magnetic mine]] detonated {{convert|17|m|ft|sp=us}} to starboard. She eventually limped into Singapore at noon on 11 September.{{sfn|Sarnet| Le Vaillant|1997|pp=331–334}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=237–242}}

====Post war====
After V-J Day, during the last three months of 1945, ''Richelieu'' took part in the return of French forces to [[Indochina]], particularly at Nha Trang, with her ''[[Fusiliers Marins]]'' landing party, and delivering gun support. When ''Richelieu'' left for France, the crew received congratulations from General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Leclerc]], the French Commanding General in Indochina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lepotier|1967|pp=243–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dumas|2001b|pp=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December, she sailed for France, and arrived in [[Toulon]] on 11 February 1946.

After 1946, she had the classic existence of a warship during peacetime, alternating between training times and such tasks as, maneuvering with the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Arromanches|R95|2}} &amp;nbsp;– formerly {{HMS|Colossus|R15|6}}&amp;nbsp;– when she joined the [[French Navy]], taking the [[President of the French Republic]] for a visit to the [[French colonies#French West Africa|French West Africa colonies]] in 1947 or officially visiting [[Portugal]].{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=315–330}} During a careening in Toulon in 1951, she was fitted with French-built radar devices, and received one new-built [[380mm/45 Modèle 1935 gun|{{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] gun and three guns seized by the Germans, two having been installed during the war in shore batteries in Norway and in Normandy, the third having been used for trials at the [[Krupp]] proving grounds in [[Meppen, Germany|Meppen]] (Germany).{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|pp=43, p. 54–59}}

Once in her career (on 30 January 1956), she maneuvered with ''Jean Bart'' for a few hours, before being based in Brest as a gunnery training school. Placed in the [[reserve fleet]] in 1958, she was in 1968 [[Decommission (ship)|decommissioned]] and sold to Italian [[Ship breaking|ship scrappers]].{{sfn|Dumas|2001b|p=60}}

===''Jean Bart''===

====From Saint-Nazaire to Casablanca====
''Jean Bart'' was laid down in December 1936; it was built in the large [[:fr:Albert Caquot|Caquot]] dock in [[:fr:Chantiers de Penhoët|Penhoët]] later named the &quot;''Jean Bart'' dock&quot; and was expected to leave it in October 1940. In May 1940, it was decided that the uncompleted battleship had to be sent to a safer place in Britain or in French Africa, beyond the [[Luftwaffe]]'s range. The ship was afloat in the fitting-out basin; however, this was separated from the navigational channel by an earth dam. When it appeared that the [[Battle of France]] was on its way to be won by the [[Wehrmacht]] by late May, work on dredging the earth dam was begun in order to be ready to leave at a high tide on 20 June. Half the propulsion machinery (boilers and turbines) was fitted to be worked when necessary. On 18 June, as the German [[Panzer division]]s were approaching, the Commanding Officer was ordered to be ready to leave immediately for Casablanca or to scuttle the ship. It was not before the middle of the next night that the dredging work was finished with very narrow margins for the battleship to pass through, and in the early hours of 19 June, nearly in view of the German vanguard, ''Jean Bart''&amp;nbsp;– barely 75% completed, her steam engines never having been worked before, and under the threat of German bombers&amp;nbsp;– was taken out of her St. Nazaire's dock by four tugs and reached Casablanca, Morocco, on 22 June under her own steam at an average speed on the journey's final leg of {{convert|22|kn|km/h mph}}.{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=19, p. 75}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=435}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=129–141}}

Only one of her two {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} main turrets had been installed by then; the second turret's guns had to be left or were lost with the sinking of the vessel shipping them. Her {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} secondary battery was also not yet installed, and was replaced by anti-aircraft [[machine gun]]s. No rangefinder was fitted.{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=76}} ''Jean Bart'', moored in Casablanca harbor, stayed uncompleted, lacking facilities to complete her.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|pp=154–156}}

On 8 November 1942, Allied landings in [[French North Africa]] ([[Operation Torch]]) began. ''Jean Bart'', with her {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns opened fire on the U.S. warships covering the landings, with range finding data sent by phone from the shore stations of Sidi Abderhamane and Dar Bou Azza.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=32}} She was silenced by the second hit from the {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns of {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|6}}, which jammed her turret rotating mechanism. The sixth of the seven {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} shells that hit her exploded in a magazine of {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret, which was empty as these turrets had not been installed. Had they been, this event would have had catastrophic consequences.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=81}} These magazines' armor weakness was known and was intended to be corrected on ''Gascogne''. On 10 November, after overhauling her {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret, ''Jean Bart'' almost hit {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|6}}, the Task Force 34 flagship. Bombers from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|6}} soon inflicted severe damage, with two heavy bombs hitting the bow and the stern. She settled into the harbor mud with decks awash.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=158–166}}{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=69–70}}

====Completion====
After French North Africa forces joined the Allies, ''Jean Bart'' was made seaworthy to be [[refit]]ted with American help, as with ''Richelieu''. The French Admiralty's wish&amp;nbsp;– presented by Vice Admiral Fenard, Chief of the French Naval Mission&amp;nbsp;– to complete ''Jean Bart'' in U.S. shipyards was discussed during 1943. But U.S. Navy authorities concluded the task exceeded their capacities, for the ship was too different from the equivalent U.S. warships, and the correct parts were lacking.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=70}} Instead of completing her as designed, it was proposed in May 1943 to complete only one main artillery turret, using [[340mm/45 Modèle 1912 gun|{{convert|340|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] guns taken on the French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Lorraine||2}} that had joined the Allied forces (after she had stayed from 1940 to 1943 in Alexandria). Fifteen U.S.-built dual-purpose [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|{{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] double turrets, sixteen Bofors {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} quad mountings, numerous [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] mountings, and aircraft installations for six planes ([[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman Avenger]] or [[Fairey Barracuda]] bombers and [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Hellcat]] or [[Supermarine Seafire|Seafire]] fighters), would have transformed ''Jean Bart'' into a kind of hybrid battleship-aircraft carrier. A second proposal, less expensive but always with the same main artillery turret, had seventeen {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} double turrets and twenty Bofors quad {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} mountings and would have yielded a kind of AA battleship.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=33–34, p 112–115}} Admiral [[Ernest King|King]], Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, decided finally in March 1944 not to agree to any French proposals, and she stayed in Casablanca.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=70}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=253–257}}

The question of ''Jean Bart'' was once more discussed by the French Admiralty in 1945. Was she to be scrapped? Completed as a classic battleship as designed? Transformed into an aircraft carrier? On 21 September 1945, the Higher Council of the French Navy agreed not to scrap her. [[:fr:Louis Kahn (amiral)|Louis Kahn]], Chief Naval Constructor, French Navy, who had designed the {{sclass-|Joffre|aircraft carrier|2}} in the late 1930s,{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=31}} presented a project for a transformation into an aircraft carrier operating forty/fifty-four planes, for a cost of 5 billion Francs, in five years or less. Some admirals, namely Admiral Fenard, formerly chief of the French Naval Mission to the United States, and Admiral Nomy, who had been a Naval aviator and would be later [[Chef d'état-major de la marine|Chef d'Etat-major Général de la Marine]] (1951–1953), found it surprising that so few planes could be accommodated on a ship with a displacement of {{convert|40000|t|LT}}, as equivalent ships in other navies were operating twice as many planes. In the minutes of the 21 September 1945 meeting of the Navy Higher Council, Rear Admiral Barjot wrote: &quot;The design of aircraft carrier presented to the Council is called, by a member, &quot;caricature&quot; in regard to a project which would be established with the wish to create an efficient aircraft carrier...Despite the war learnings, the outdated myth of big gun goes on dominating our naval doctrine...It was surprising enough to see in 1945 the Navy General Staff supporting, doctrinally, against the aircraft carrier solution, the battleship solution&quot;.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=257–264}}

British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Eagle|R05|6}}, [[laid down]] in 1942 and launched in 1946, with a displacement of {{convert|38600|LT|t}} ({{convert|46000|LT|t}} [[Full-load displacement|full load]]), was by then designed to accommodate 80 planes.{{sfn|Archibald|1971|p=182}} However, the French experience of a battleship converted into an aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Béarn||2}}, was rather unsuccessful, her slow speed having led to her use only as an aircraft transport ship.{{sfn|Ireland|Grove|1997|p=128}}

It was decided finally to complete ''Jean Bart'' as an integral battleship, with the aim to get, with a delay of five years, a command ship, heavily anti-aircraft armed, with a capacity of naval bombing for attack against land.{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=211}} She sailed from Casablanca in August 1945 to [[Cherbourg-Octeville#Seconde Guerre mondiale|Cherbourg]], the only usable French graving dock on the French Atlantic coast. She entered in one of the [[Arsenal de Brest|Brest]] [[Arsenal de Brest#Les bassins 8 et 9 entre 1910 et 1945|Laninon]] docks in March 1946. Work progressed slowly as the Brest Navy Yards had to be rebuilt in the meantime after severe wartime destruction. The battleship emerged with a much more compact fore control tower, topped by only one rangefinder (''Richelieu'' had two after her refit). In 1948, she received an additional bulge to limit the increase of her draught, due to the planned fitting of stronger anti-aircraft artillery; her beam reached {{convert|35.5|m|ft|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=76}} Gunnery and speed sea trials showed a top speed of more than {{convert|32|kn|km/h mph}}.{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=264–267}}

====Career====
''Jean Bart'' was officially [[commission (ship)|commissioned]] on 16 January 1949, but the anti-aircraft short range artillery, twelve {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} dual mountings and fourteen Bofors licensed {{convert|57|mm|in|abbr=on}} dual mountings, was not fitted before 1952–1953.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=71–73}}

She was admitted to active service on 1 May 1955. She soon took the President of the French Republic on an official visit to [[Copenhagen]], and went on to [[Oslo]]. In July, she took part (in New York) in ceremonies celebrating the 175th anniversary of the [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] landing of French troops led by the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]].{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=315–330}} On 21 October, in Toulon, ''Jean Bart'' succeeded ''Richelieu'' as the [[flagship]] of the South Group of Schools.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=74}}

During her active career, ''Jean Bart'' had a complement of 750 to 900 men, fewer than the planned 1500. She reached more than 1200 men when she was about to be sent due to the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Canal crisis]], but even then, only one {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret and the axial {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} turret could be manned.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=75}}{{sfn|Jordan|Dumas|2009|p=221}}

In 1956, she took part in the operations off [[Port-Said]] during the Suez Crisis, but French support of land operations was not primarily the four shots fired by her {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns against the land, but by the French [[Aviation navale#La crise de Suez|Aeronavale]] [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsairs]]. ''Jean Bart''{{'}}s main operational contribution was to ship the [[1st Foreign Parachute Regiment]] from Algiers to Cyprus.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=75}}{{sfn|Lepotier|1967|pp=337–342}}

After having fired the last French Navy {{convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} gunshots in July 1957, she was placed in reserve, on August 1, 1957, and served as a school ship for the gunnery training schools in Toulon. Proposals in 1957–1958 to modernize her anti-aircraft artillery with new {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} turrets (Model 53 in place of Model 45), or later to transform her into a guided missile battleship similar to {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|6}} (but no French-built missile existed at that time, so it was proposed to use the U.S. [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] missile) were not accepted.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|pp=54–56}} In 1964, when a command ship was looked for by the Pacific Center for [[French nuclear testing|Nuclear Experiments]], the cruiser ''{{ship|French cruiser|De Grasse|C610|2}}'' was preferred to ''Jean Bart'', which would have been more expensive to transform.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=83}}

Decommissioned in 1968, she was scrapped in 1970 near Toulon,{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=76}} leaving the Turkish {{TCG|Yavûz||2}}, formerly {{SMS|Goeben}}, the only survivor afloat in European waters of the battleship era.{{sfn|Breyer|1980|p=349}}

''Jean Bart'' was overall an experimental battleship, never fully operational, mainly because of budget cuts but also because, when she was completed, the battleship was no longer the ''[[capital ship]]'' for the French Navy, since instead three [[aircraft carrier]]s&amp;nbsp;– {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Arromanches|R95|2}}, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|La Fayette|R96|2}}, and {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Bois Belleau|R97|2}}&amp;nbsp;– operated during the 1950s in support in Indochina, in Algeria and during the Suez Crisis. However, she was useful post-war as a testbed for new French-built naval AA guns and radars.{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=76}}

===''Clemenceau'' and ''Gascogne''===
The third unit, ''Clemenceau'', was laid down in the Salou graving dock as soon as ''Richelieu'' had left it. Work progressed slowly, as ''Clemenceau'' did not have priority. Thus, in mid-1940&amp;nbsp;– nearly eighteen months later&amp;nbsp;– she was only 10% completed as a hull section of {{convert|130|m|ft|sp=us}}. Taken by the Germans as a war prize, she was registered by the [[Kriegsmarine]] as ''Battleship R'', but the Germans never seriously considered continuation of construction work. Made buoyant, presumably in 1941, to vacate the building basin, moored near the submarine base,{{sfn|Dumas|2001a|p=96}} or towed to [[Landevenec]],{{sfn|Le Masson|1969|p=78}} and intended for use by the Germans as a blocking ship to seal off the harbour entrance, her hull was sunk during a U.S. air raid at the beginning of the offensive to free Brest (on 27 August 1944) and scrapped post-war.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=310, p. 436}} In the late 1950s, the name of [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] was given to the first modern post-war French-built aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Clemenceau|R98|6}}.{{sfn|Ireland|Grove|1997|p=211}}

The fourth unit, the planned ''Gascogne'', was intended to be laid down in the &quot;''Jean Bart'' dock&quot;. When the ship building yard was occupied by the Germans, in June 1940, the battleship had not been yet formally ordered. No work was ever begun. Some stored parts and material were declared war booty and registered by the Germans as ''Battleship S''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=310, p. 440}}
