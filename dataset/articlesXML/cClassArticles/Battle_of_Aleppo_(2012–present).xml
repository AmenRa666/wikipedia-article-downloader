By December, rebel fighters were commonly looting for supplies; they switched their loyalties to groups that had more to share. This new approach led to the killing of at least one rebel commander following a dispute; fighters retreating with their loot caused the loss of a frontline position and the failure of an attack on a Kurdish neighborhood. The looting cost the rebel fighters much popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian rebels sidetracked by scramble for spoils of war|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/27/syrian-rebels-scramble-spoils-war|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a week of heavy fighting, rebels both inside and outside Aleppo advanced into the Ramouseh neighborhood, linked up and captured it. They also seized the Al-Assad Military Academy.

Later that week they recaptured the Ramouseh district and reversed almost all rebel gains made since July 30. The Syrian Government forces then [[Aleppo offensive (September–October 2016)|started an offensive]] to capture eastern Aleppo on 22 September, taking 15–20% of the rebel-held part of Aleppo.

Rebels started [[Aleppo offensive (October–November 2016)|an attack on western Aleppo]] in late October, which failed, with government forces retaking areas in the south-west which they had lost to the rebel's late July offensive.

== Strategic analysis ==
Rebel forces expanded into the countryside south of Aleppo to control sections of the M4 and M5 highways, effectively blocking ground reinforcements for the Syrian Army. Before the end of 2012, the Syrian Army in Aleppo was receiving sporadic supplies and ammunition replenishment by air or via backroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria rebels win support from Britain, battle in Damascus|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/20/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE88J0X720121120|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of Base 46, a large complex that reinforced and supplied government troops, was seen by experts as &quot;a tactical turning point that may lead to a strategic shift&quot; in the battle for Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Exclusive: Syrian rebels seize base, arms trove|url=http://news.yahoo.com/ap-exclusive-syrian-rebels-seize-arms-trove-202610902.html|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2012 intelligence report, American publisher [[Stratfor|Strategic Forecasting, Inc.]] described the strategic position of government forces in Aleppo as &quot;dire&quot;, and said the Free Syrian Army had them &quot;essentially surrounded&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Rebel Gains in Syria|url=https://www.stratfor.com/sample/analysis/recent-rebel-gains-syria|publisher=Stratfor|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, it was reported that the army planned to encircle Aleppo and impose blockades and truces. It would also try to recapture [[Shaykh Najjar|Sheikh Najjar Industrial City]] to rebuild the economy and provide jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAAblockadeAleppo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2014/03/syria-army-impose-blockade-militants-aleppo.html#|title=Syrian army to impose blockade in Aleppo|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2014, the army had seized Sheikh Najjar, reinforced Aleppo Central Prison and captured Handaraat, almost besieging rebel-held Aleppo.

The Syrian government's defeat at the [[Second Battle of Idlib]] in late March 2015, which helped expand the influence of the al-Nusra Front, forced the Islamic State ([[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|IS]]) to expand its attacks in central Syria after it failed to block the Raqqa highway that branches out to the Syrian army's main supply route to Aleppo along the Khanasir-Athriya road. IS's aim would potentially be to establish the necessary conditions to attack Idlib and al-Nusra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2015/04/syria-hama-is-nusra-attack-aleppo-army.html |title= IS' Hama incursion threatens Nusra's gains | website= | publisher= Al Monitor |date= 2 April 2015 |accessdate= 2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hama and Homs offensive (March–April 2015)|March–April IS offensive]] in central Syria led some volunteers defending the Homs-Aleppo highway to consider deserting to defend their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/world/middleeast/syria-isis-advances-in-hama-and-damascus.html |title= ISIS Said to Step Up Offensive in Syria | website= | publisher= The New York Times |date= 2 April 2015 |accessdate= 2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jane's Information Group]], a possible offensive on Homs by both al-Nusra Front and IS working independently might force the government to move critical forces away from Aleppo to defend key supply routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.janes.com/article/50598/jabhat-al-nusra-and-islamic-state-s-attempts-at-cutting-damascus-homs-highway-would-threaten-assad-s-control-of-syria |title= Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State's attempts at cutting Damascus-Homs highway would threaten Assad's control of Syria |last1=Abi Ali |first1= Firas |publisher= IHS Jane's 360 |date= 12 April 2015 |accessdate= 15 April 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After additional opposition gains during the [[2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive]], Jane's said it was no longer possible for the SAA to properly reinforce Aleppo, leaving their forces vulnerable to any opposition or IS offensive on the city.

== Barrel bombs ==
In 2014, the [[United Nations]] adopted Resolution 2139 which ordered the end of using [[barrel bomb]]s in the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title='There are no barrel bombs': Assad's Syria 'facts' |url= http://www.channel4.com/news/assad-syria-interview-bbc-barrel-bombs-facts-video |publisher=Channel4 |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights stated that the Syrian army dropped 7,000 barrel bombs in the first five months of 2015, claiming the lives of 3,000 people. [[Amnesty International]] claims that barrel bombs killed 3,000 people in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria: living under the horrors of barrel bombs in Aleppo|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/barrel-bombs-syria-assad-aleppo-deraa-idlib-civilian-deaths|publisher=Channel4|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Channel4]]'' claims that videos have emerged online showing the Syrian army using barrel bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB&quot;/&gt;

The Syrian government has been alleged of using the barrel bombs several times. Some of them are:
*''[[Middle East Monitor]]'' reported 14 deaths allegedly caused by the bombs in the Kallasa and Qasila neighbourhood of the city in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At least 14 killed in Aleppo barrel-bomb attack |url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/19362-at-least-14-killed-in-aleppo-barrel-bomb-attack |publisher=Middle East Monitor|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the government has denied using barrel bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Barrel-bomb attack' targets mosque in Syria's Aleppo|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/barrel-bomb-attacks-syria-aleppo-reported-150622175005995.html |publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview to BBC, President Bashar al-Assad denied using &quot;indiscriminate weapons&quot; like barrel bombs in the rebel held territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria conflict: President Assad on weapons of war|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31327152 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assad said, &quot;I know about the army.

== Hell cannons ==
The Aleppo rebels use [[hell cannon]]s, a makeshift mortar firing gas cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel. UN High Commissioner For Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein has stated that their use is &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; and constitutes indiscriminate attacks as they are very difficult to aim correctly, frequently killing and maiming civilians in Government-held areas. According to Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein their use is primarily to &quot;terrorize the inhabitants of western Aleppo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55201#.WAZoEvkrLIV Aleppo demands ‘bold action,’ including limiting use of Security Council veto – UN rights chief]&quot; UN News Centre, April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in December 2014 that between July and December 2014 the rebels killed 204 civilians using hell cannons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-attacks-idUSKBN0JQ17I20141212 &quot;Syrian rebel 'hell cannons' kill 300 civilians: monitoring group&quot;], Reuters, December 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Law Mark A. Summers of Barry University School of Law, a legal expert previous assigned to the Office of the Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, wrote that both the uses of barrel bombs and hell cannons is inaccurate and so randomly destructive that their use is per se illegal and thus constitutes either the direct or indiscriminate targeting of civilians and civilian objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurist.org/forum/2015/05/mark-summers-syrian-war.php Mark A.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;..the ongoing devastation inflicted on the country's stunning archaeological sites—bullet holes lodged in walls of its ancient Roman cities, the debris of Byzantine churches, early mosques and crusader fortresses—rob Syria of its best chance for a post-conflict economic boom based on tourism, which, until the conflict started 18 months ago, contributed 12% to the national income.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria's Looted Past: How Ancient Artifacts Are Being Traded for Guns|url=http://world.time.com/2012/09/12/syrias-looted-past-how-ancient-artifacts-are-being-traded-for-guns/#ixzz26ujLHJ8C|publisher=Time|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
