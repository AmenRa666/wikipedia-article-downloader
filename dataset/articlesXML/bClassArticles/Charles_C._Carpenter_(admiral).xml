He participated in the [[African Slave Trade Patrol]], fought in the [[American Civil War]], served as Commander of the [[Asiatic Squadron]], and was recalled to duty briefly during the [[Spanish–American War]].

==Naval career==
Carpenter was born in [[Leyden, Massachusetts|Leyden]], [[Massachusetts]], on February 27, 1834, the son of David N. Carpenter and the former Maria P. Newcomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=48206630 Find-A-Grave Memorial: Adm John Irwin (1832-1901)]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[midshipman]] from Massachusetts on October 1, 1850, he was attached to the [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} in the [[Pacific Squadron]] from 1851 to 1855. He attended the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], from 1855 to 1856 and, upon completing his studies, was promoted to [[passed midshipman]] on June 20, 1856.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Hamersly, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/books/callahan/reg-usn-c.htm Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.history50states.com/MA-Suffolk-Jamaica_Plain History of Jamaica Plain (Suffolk County), Massachusetts: Charles C. Carpenter Biographical Sketch]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter was in the [[Home Squadron]] and in special service between 1856 and 1858, serving consecutively aboard the [[steam frigate]]s {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}}, {{USS|Roanoke|1855|6}}, and {{USS|Colorado|1856|6}} and the [[brig]] {{USS|Dolphin|1836|6}}; he was aboard ''Dolphin'' on August 21, 1858 when she captured a [[slave ship]], the brig ''Echo'', with 300 [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[slave]]s on board. He was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on January 23, 1858.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/d5/dolphin-iii.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'': ''Dolphin'' III]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter{{'}}s next duty was aboard a [[receiving ship]] at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Massachusetts, in 1858 and 1859, and he was promoted to [[Master (naval)|master]] on January 22, 1858 and to [[lieutenant]] the next day. He reported for duty aboard the [[Propeller|screw]] [[Steamboat|steamer]] {{USS|Mohawk|1853|6}} in 1859. ''Mohawk'' cruised off the coast of [[Cuba]] in 1859 and 1860 and captured the slave ship ''Wildfire'' on April 20, 1860, freeing 530 African slaves. She later guarded [[U.S. Naval Station Key West, Florida|Naval Station Key West]], in [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], [[Florida]], from armed groups seeking to seize it from the [[United States Government]] in the months prior to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m13/mohawk-ii.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'': ''Mohawk'' II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
Carpenter was still aboard ''Mohawk'' when the Civil War broke out in April 1861. He served aboard her that year in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in the [[Union blockade]] of the [[Confederate States of America]], both off [[Texas]] and in the [[East Gulf Blockading Squadron]]. In 1862 he was aboard the screw steamer {{USS|Flag|1861|6}} in the [[South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]], participating in the capture of two [[blockade runner]]s, the steamers ''Anglia'' and ''Emily'', and being promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] on July 16, 1862. In 1863 he transferred to the [[Monitor (ship)|monitor]] {{USS|Catskill|1862|6}}, also in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and participated in attacks on the Confederate defenses of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], on April 7, July 10, and August 17, 1863. Later in 1863 he was assigned to the staff of the U.S. Naval Academy, where he remained through the end of the war in 1865.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Post–Civil War===
After service aboard the [[flagship]] of the [[Asiatic Squadron]], the screw sloop-of-war {{USS|Hartford|1858|6}}, from 1866 to 1867, Carpenter became [[commanding officer]] of the screw sloop-of-war {{USS|Wyoming|1859|6}} in the same [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] in 1868. He then performed duty at the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] in [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery]], [[Maine]], from 1868 to 1870 and was promoted to [[Commander (United States)|commander]] on February 10, 1869. After another short assignment at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in 1871, he returned to sea as commanding officer of the screw steamer {{USS|Nantasket|1867|6}} in the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] from 1871 to 1872. He was back at the Portsmouth Navy Yard from 1872 to 1875 on equipment duty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Carpenter was commanding officer of the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Huron|1875|6}} in the North Atlantic Squadron from 1875 to 1876, before another tour at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in 1878. Promoted to [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|captain]] on March 25, 1880, Carpenter was on equipment duty at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1880 to 1882, then returned to USS ''Hartford'' as her commanding officer from 1882 to 1884; during his tour, ''Hartford'' carried a team of American and [[United Kingdom|British]] scientists from [[Callao, Peru|Callao]], [[Peru]], to the [[Caroline Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] to observe the [[Solar eclipse of May 6, 1883|total solar eclipse of May 6, 1883]]. He commanded the receiving ship {{USS|Wabash|1855|6}} at the Boston Navy Yard from 1888 to June 1890
.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Carpenter was commandant of the Portsmouth Navy Yard from June 1890 to January 15, 1894, and was promoted to [[Commodore (United States)|commodore]] on May 15, 1893. He became commander of the Asiatic Squadron on September 1, 1894 and was promoted to rear admiral on November 11, 1894; the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895]] was a major concern of his tour as squadron commander.

===Retirement===
Carpenter relinquished command of the Asiatic Squadron on December 21, 1895 and retired from the Navy upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 62 on February 28, 1896. He resided in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], [[New Hampshire]], during his retirement.

===Recall to active duty===
Carpenter was recalled to active duty during the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, returning to the Portsmouth Navy Yard to serve as its commandant from April to August 1898. He then returned to retirement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleetorganization.com/1890sflagassignments.html fleetorganization.com. Flag Assignments 1890-1900]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Carpenter had begun to suffer from severe [[nervous disorder]]s during the final years of his naval career and sought medical treatment soon after his retirement. His condition improved, but around mid-February 1899 his health went into decline again, and he spent six weeks in the Adams Nervine Asylum in the [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, for treatment. Although his condition again showed signs of improvement, he committed suicide at the asylum by shooting himself in the head on the morning of April 1, 1899. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and two daughters.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50A14FE3C5911738DDDAA0894DC405B8985F0D3 Anonymous. &quot;Naval Officer{{'}}s Suicide: Rear Admiral Carpenter Takes His Own Life at Boston,&quot; ''The New York Times'', April 3, 1899.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter is buried at [[Proprietors Burying Ground]] in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GScid=641070&amp;GRid=11717688&amp; Find-A-Grave Memorial: Lieut Charles Carroll Carpenter (1834-1899)]&lt;/ref&gt;
