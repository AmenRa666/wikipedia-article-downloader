The '''Civil War Memorial''', in the [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]] county seat of [[Sycamore, Illinois|Sycamore]], [[Illinois]], United States, is located in front of the DeKalb County Courthouse on a public square. The memorial was erected in 1896 and dedicated in 1897. The structure is a memorial to the thousands of DeKalb County residents who served in the American Civil War. It incorporates an [[obelisk]] which rises to 50 feet (15.2 m) in height. The base is adorned with copper sculpture, completed by an unknown sculptor. On the east facade of the memorial the word &quot;Antietam&quot;, denoting the [[Battle of Antietam]], is misspelled. This work of [[public art]] underwent its first restoration work in 2005-2006.

The memorial is included among the 187 buildings and structures considered [[Contributing property|contributing properties]] to the [[Sycamore Historic District]]. The [[historic district]] was added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978. The structure also has artistic significance as it is listed by the Smithsonian American Art Museum in their research database. It is one of the few [[sculpture]]s in DeKalb County found within that database. The Civil War Memorial is owned by DeKalb County.

==History==
The DeKalb County Civil War Memorial and the sculpture that adorns it was created by an unknown sculptor and installed in front of the DeKalb County Courthouse in 1896.&lt;ref name=prop&gt;&quot;[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/ Civil War Memorial],&quot; Property Information Report, Sycamore Historic District, HAARGIS Database, ''Illinois Historic Preservation Agency''.

In July 2005 the statues adorning the monument underwent a [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]].&lt;ref name=hernandez/&gt; DeKalb County appropriated [[United States dollar|US$]]15,000 for the project which, among other tasks, repaired a split seam in one of the soldier statues and a crack in the other sculpture's base.&lt;ref name=hernandez/&gt; The project took approximately six months; the statues were removed for the duration of the restoration work and reinstalled in March 2006. During the restoration it was revealed that the statues, thought to be [[bronze]], were actually [[copper]].&lt;ref name=herra&gt;Herra, Dana.

==Design==
[[File:Sycamore Il Civil War Memorial7.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Antietam&quot; is misspelled on the east side of the memorial.]]
The 50-foot (15.2-m) tall memorial has base dimensions of 10 feet (3 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m).&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The monument is constructed from a combination of marble, masonry, and the metal used for the sculpted copper and masonry soldiers. The structure also incorporated wood into its design.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The [[rifle]]s the figures on the base hold and the bases that they stand on are made of wood.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The front facade is adorned with a marble plate engraved with an excerpt from U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Each of the other facades, also marble faced, are emblazoned with the names of major battles and campaigns of the war. The word &quot;Antietam,&quot; representing the [[Battle of Antietam]], is misspelled on the east, [[marble]] facade of the memorial as &quot;Anteitam.&quot;&lt;ref name=chron&gt;[http://www.daily-chronicle.com/articles/2006/07/26/neighbors/neighbors03.txt Road Rally drove into Sycamore's past], '[[Daily Chronicle]]', July 26, 2006. Retrieved February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two [[copper]] statues, each standing 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the [[obelisk]] which rises to a masonry soldier statue, instead of the typical [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of an obelisk. The figure atop the [[granite]] obelisk is a mustached American Civil War soldier dressed in a long coat, a cape, and a cap. In the figure's right hand he holds the handle of his sword and the sword's tip rests in front of his right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] infantry soldier and a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman is dressed in a cap, long coat, and a cape, much like the figure atop the obelisk. The Union cavalryman, standing on the east side of the base, is dressed in a brimmed hat and short jacket.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==Significance==
The 1974 Illinois Historic Sites Survey Inventory found the DeKalb County Civil War Memorial significant in the areas of [[military]] and [[sculpture]]. At the time of the 1974 survey, the memorial was considered in &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;not altered&quot; condition.&lt;ref name=ihs&gt;&quot;[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/PDFs/143705.pdf Civil War Memorial]&quot;, ([[PDF]]), Illinois Historic Sites Survey Inventory Form, 1974, HAARGIS Database, ''Illinois Historic Preservation Agency''. Retrieved July 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the few sculptures in [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]] that is listed in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]'s Smithsonian Institution Research Information System (SIRIS).&lt;ref name=siris&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ Smithsonian Institution Research Information System], Art Inventories Catalog, ''Smithsonian American Art Museum''.
