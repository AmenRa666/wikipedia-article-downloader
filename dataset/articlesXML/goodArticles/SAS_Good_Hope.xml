'''SAS ''Good Hope''''' ([[pennant number]]: F432) was one of three {{sclass2-|Loch|frigate}}s in the [[South African Navy]] (SAN). It was built as HMS ''Loch Boisdale'' (K432) for the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]], but was transferred to the SAN before completion in 1944 and renamed as HMSAS ''Good Hope''. The ship was assigned to [[convoy]] escort duties in 1945, but did not encounter any enemy ships before the end of the war. 

It was assigned to ferry troops home from [[Egypt]] afterwards and made port visits in [[Middle Africa]] in 1948. Upon returning home, ''Good Hope'' was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] until it was converted into a [[training ship]] during the mid-1950s and served as the navy's [[flagship]]. The ship was again placed in reserve in 1965 and was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1977. ''Good Hope''{{'}}s remains were donated for use as an [[artificial reef]] and it was [[scuttling|scuttled]] the following year.

== Description ==
''Good Hope'' displaced {{convert|1435|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard load]] and {{convert|2260|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|307|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|38|ft|7|in|m|1}} and a mean deep [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|4|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=c0&gt;Chesneau, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; It was powered by a pair of [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one [[propeller shaft]], using steam provided by two [[Admiralty three-drum boiler]]s. The engines developed a total of {{convert|5500|ihp|lk=in}} which gave a maximum speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}. The ship carried {{convert|730|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave it a range of {{convert|9500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}.&lt;ref name=l2/&gt; Its main armament was a single [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|4-inch (102&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk V]] [[dual-purpose gun]]. Its [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of four [[QF 2 pounder naval gun#QF 2-pounder Mark VIII|2-pounder (40&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot;]] in a quadruple mount and six [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} Oerlikon guns]] in two twin powered mounts and two single hand-operated mounts.&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; For [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine work]], ''Good Hope'' was fitted with a pair of triple-barrelled [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] [[anti-submarine mortar]]s and 15 [[depth charge]]s delivered by one rail and two throwers.&lt;ref name=c0/&gt; The ship was equipped with Type 144 and 147B [[ASDIC]] and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 277|Type 277]] surface-search [[radar]]. Its crew numbered 114 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=l2&gt;Lenton, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for her reclassification as a [[dispatch boat|despatch vessel]]/training ship in 1955, ''Good Hope''{{'}}s Oerlikons were replaced by a pair of [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}} Bofors]] light [[AA gun]]s on the Squid deck forward of the [[bridge wing]]s and her depth charges and their gear was removed. This allowed the ship's [[forecastle]] deck to be extended right aft to add more accommodations and it was covered in [[teak]] above the new compartments. Its [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was enlarged and a new [[mainmast]] was added. During her refit in early 1958, ''Good Hope''{{'}}s main armament was replaced by a twin-gun turret fitted with more powerful [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|four-inch Mk XVI guns]].&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, pp. 161, 163&lt;/ref&gt; She was refitted in 1961.&lt;ref name=m0&gt;Moore, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Good Hope'' was built by [[Blyth Shipbuilding Company|Blyth Harbour and Dock Company]] at their shipyard in [[Blyth, Northumberland]] and was [[laid down]] on 8 November 1943, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 5 July 1944&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 9 November 1944. The ship was originally named ''Loch Boisdale'', but was renamed by the South Africans after it was transferred by the British while [[fitting out]]. After [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]] at [[HMS Western Isles|HMS ''Western Isles'']] in [[Tobermory, Mull]], it was assigned to the 18th Escort Group of the [[Western Approaches Command]]; it was damaged during its first mission and required a month to repair the storm damage. ''Good Hope'' rejoined the 18th Escort Group which was covering convoys between England and France until the German surrender in May. It was then refitted for tropical duties before sailing for South Africa on 6 June 1945 with its [[sister ship]], {{HMSAS|Natal|K10|2}}, with 29 ex-prisoners of war aboard the sisters. They arrived on 30 June, but ''Good Hope'' was not sent to the Far East because the Japanese surrendered before it was ready to go.&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, pp. 158–59, 166&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Good Hope'' and her sisters ''Natal'' and {{SAS|Transvaal||2}} repatriated some 700 troops from Egypt between November 1945 and March 1946 and escorted the battleship {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}} while it was serving as the [[royal yacht]] during [[King George VI]]'s tour of South Africa in 1947. All three sisters toured ports in [[Portuguese West Africa]] and the [[Belgian Congo]] in August–September 1948. Upon their return, ''Good Hope'' was reduced to reserve at [[Salisbury Island, Durban]]. In mid-1954 the ship began conversion into a despatch vessel in Durban and it was recommissioned on 3 June 1955 as the flagship of the South African Navy. Later that year, it conveyed the [[Governor General of South Africa]], [[Ernest George Jansen]], on a goodwill visit to [[French Madagascar]]. The following year, it took the navy's [[List of South African military chiefs|Chief of Staff]], Rear Admiral [[Hugo Biermann]], to [[Portuguese Mozambique]]. That same year, a [[South African Air Force]] [[Sikorsky S-55]] [[helicopter]] landed aboard, the first helicopter deck landing aboard a South African warship. The ship was refitted in [[Simon's Town]] in early 1958 and transported Biermann to Portuguese West Africa and the Belgian Congo in August 1959. As part of this trip, it sailed some {{convert|70|mi}} up the [[Congo River]] to [[Matadi]]. During the early 1960s, ''Good Hope'' was assigned fishery protection duties in addition to her normal training tasks. The ship was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in September 1965 and was sold for [[South African rand|R6,500]], together with her sister ''Transvaal'', in 1977. After stripping it of all valuable metals and fittings, ''Good Hope''{{'}}s [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] was donated to the [[False Bay Conservation Society]] for use as an artificial reef.&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, pp. 160–61, 163, 165–66&lt;/ref&gt; She was scuttled in [[False Bay]] on 12 December 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WRECKSITE - GOOD HOPE FRIGATE 1944-1978|url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?58830|website=www.wrecksite.eu|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
