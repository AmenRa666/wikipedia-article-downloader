== Careful with the article size ==

I applaud the work being done to improve this article, but be aware it's getting rather long per [[WP:SIZERULE]], at 'Prose size (text only): 72 kB (12209 words) &quot;readable prose size&quot;'. ([[User:Hohum|&lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;'''Hohum'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Hohum|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;@&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]) 17:25, 1 December 2014 (UTC)
: I think we can shorten the article by deleting unneccessary details where standard weapon systems are listed. Where unusual or special weaponry was employed, we could keep that but mentioning that the bridge was attacked and defended by standard equipment doesn't add much information. Mentioning the units involved is enough imho. [[User:AadaamS|AadaamS]] ([[User talk:AadaamS|talk]]) 18:43, 1 December 2014 (UTC)
:: I tend to write for the uninitiated, those who are unfamiliar with military systems, organizations, and jargon, thus I've added what some might view as unneeded details. Your call though. — [[User:btphelps|btphelps]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Btphelps |talk to me]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Btphelps |what I've done]])&lt;/sup&gt; 11:44, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

== German order of battle ==

Two thoughts:

1) Are the German corps, Army (''Armee'') or Reserve corps?

2) Aren't German corps often given in Roman numerals, eg as in [[III Army Corps (Germany)]]   (later ''III Panzerkorps'') ? [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 20:54, 8 December 2014 (UTC)

: I'm unfamiliar with German unit naming conventions. Please jump in and make fixes. — [[User:btphelps|btphelps]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Btphelps |talk to me]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Btphelps |what I've done]])&lt;/sup&gt;

== A question arising from &quot;shortened war&quot; ==

The text says &quot;General George C. Marshall commented, &quot;The bridgehead provided a serious threat to the heart of Germany, a '''diversion''' of incalculable value. It became a springboard for the final offensive to come...&quot;  (my emphasis)

&quot;Diversion&quot; seems an interesting word. Is he meaning it as a change in their original direction (like a road diversion), or a move that draws the enemy away (like a feint)? Does it need clarification. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 12:36, 9 December 2014 (UTC)

: Since the capture of Ludendorff Bridge pulled sizable numbers of forces from among those facing Monty, I believe he meant drawing the enemy away. — [[User:btphelps|btphelps]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Btphelps |talk to me]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Btphelps |what I've done]])&lt;/sup&gt; 11:38, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

== Article assessment==

Anyone want to have a go at reassessing the article quality class now? — [[User:btphelps|btphelps]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Btphelps |talk to me]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Btphelps |what I've done]])&lt;/sup&gt; 11:47, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

== Lead's initial sentence ==

@[[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]], while you may feel otherwise, the initial sentence DOES NOT need to &quot;state what the topic of article is.&quot; Per [[WP:LEAD|WP guidelines]], &quot;The lead should establish significance, include mention of consequential or significant criticism or controversies, and be written in a way that makes readers want to know more.&quot; The key here is 'makes readers want to know more.&quot; The [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#First_sentence|specific guidance]] for the initial sentence states:

: ...&quot;use the first sentence to introduce the topic, and then spread the relevant information out over the entire lead.&quot;

Further, the guidance states:

: &quot;For topics notable for only one reason, this reason should usually be given in the first sentence.&quot;

While the battle is notable for more than one reason, the most interesting and compelling fact (which surprised me when I discovered it) is that both the Germans and Americans agreed that taking the bridge shortened the war. I had read some reports by various writers who stated that capturing the bridge shortened the word, but I didn't expect to find corroborating statements by prominent military authorities. 

Given the above guidance, and the lack of direct statements supporting your suggestion that the initial sentence needs to &quot;state what the topic of article is&quot;, I am revising the lead to restablish this distinctive notability and help pique the reader's interest in finding out why the [[Battle of Remagen]] shortened the war.  — [[User:btphelps|btphelps]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Btphelps |talk to me]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Btphelps |what I've done]])&lt;/sup&gt; 19:01, 12 December 2014 (UTC)

:Did it shorten the war as a whole, or the war in the Europe? The A-bombs shortened the war in the east. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 23:27, 12 December 2014 (UTC)

:: I think the quotes and citations are referring to the war in Europe of course. None of them specifically say as much but I believe its a reasonable inferrance. Should i make it more obvious? — [[User:btphelps|btphelps]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Btphelps |talk to me]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Btphelps |what I've done]])&lt;/sup&gt; 00:28, 17 December 2014 (UTC)

== Luftwaffe ==

I like it when editors take into account the air contribution for once. Would the nominee mind Dapi89 expanding ever so slightly on the details here? [[User:Dapi89|Dapi89]] ([[User talk:Dapi89|talk]]) 17:40, 20 February 2015 (UTC)

{{Talk:Battle of Remagen/GA1}}

==Last bridge over the Rhine?==
The lead states that the Remagen Bridge was the last bridge over the Rhine still standing when found by the Allies. That is true of the bridges north of Ludwigshafen, but after 19 March 1945, 3 bridges over the Rhine further upstream were still intact: the bridge at Maximiliansau was not blown until 21 March, at Speyer on 23 March and Gamersheim was intact until blown on 24 March. So when the Bridge at Remagen was found by Allied forces, it was not the last bridge over the Rhine. Perhaps this can be clarified.

== Only Julius Caesar had crossed the Rhine? ==

The statement &quot;Before Napoleon, only Julius Caesar had crossed the Rhine&quot; is incorrect. Just off the top of my head: French armies crossed the Rhine many times under Louis XIV and XV, capturing many cities including Heidelburg and Freiburg and fighting battles such as Blenheim; just apart from Drusus the Romans had a whole province on the eastern side of the Rhine  (Agri Decumates) which necessarily means they were crossing the Rhine for a long time after Julius Caesar...  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.245.219.245|62.245.219.245]] ([[User talk:62.245.219.245|talk]]) 14:33, 10 June 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
