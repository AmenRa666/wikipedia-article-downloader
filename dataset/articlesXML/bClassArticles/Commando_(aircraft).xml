'''''Commando''''' ([[Air Ministry]] [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''AL504'') was a very long range [[Consolidated Liberator II]] aircraft adapted for passenger transport, to serve as the personal aircraft of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]. ''Commando'' [[List of aerial disappearances|disappeared without a trace]] on 27 March 1945 over the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], while on a flight from [[RAF Northolt]] to [[Lagens Field]] in the [[Azores]], en route to [[Ottawa]] in [[Canada]]. The cause of the disappearance of the aircraft remains unknown to this day.

==Background==
Volunteer pilot [[William Vanderkloot]], a US citizen serving with [[RAF Ferry Command]] since June 1941, delivered a specially modified long-range [[Consolidated Liberator II]] in July 1942.  Vanderkloot was ordered to RAF headquarters where he was asked by Sir [[Charles Portal]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]], if there was a safe, direct route from [[England]] to [[Cairo]], by air in the Liberator which he had just delivered to [[Prestwick Airport]].  Vanderkloot informed Portal that the flight was possible with one stop in [[Gibraltar]]. Initially heading Eastwards from Gibraltar, staying over the sea in the afternoon, and then turning sharply South after dusk, flying over [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy]] territory in [[Africa]] in darkness, before turning East again for the [[Nile]], approaching Cairo from the South. Thus the danger from land-based enemy aircraft in North Africa and [[Sicily]] would be largely avoided without having to fly halfway around Africa.

[[File:Royal Air Force Ferry Command, 1941-1943. CH8550.jpg|thumb|right||The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill in RAF uniform, accompanied by Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Charles Portal]], Chief of the Air Staff, leaving ''Commando'' at [[RAF Lyneham]], [[Wiltshire]], on their return from the [[Casablanca Conference]].]] Portal told Vanderkloot to &quot;stay handy to the telephone&quot;. The next day Vanderkloot was taken to [[Winston Churchill]]'s residence at [[No.10 Downing Street]]. Churchill, clad in robe and slippers, offered him a drink, beginning a relationship that had Vanderkloot flying the Prime Minister on sensitive diplomatic trips across war-torn [[Europe]], [[Russia]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle-East]].&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Ian|title=RAF Ferry Command : Liberator AL504, &quot;Commando&quot; : Winston Churchill's flights : August 1942, Cairo and Moscow : January – February 1943, Casablanca and Turkey|location=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/publication/106211|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lavery&gt;{{Cite book |first=Brian |last=Lavery |title=Churchill Goes to War: Winston's Wartime Journeys |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=2007 |isbn=1591141036|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He took calculated risks,&quot; said his son, William III. There was a lot more risk in flying back then. It was a frontier, and I think all the old pilots will say it, secretly to themselves, that they enjoyed being on their own. It was the wild blue yonder.&quot; As Churchill's pilot, Vanderkloot flew [[Lord Mountbatten]] to England in June 1942, conveyed the Prime Minister and Chief of the Imperial General Staff [[Alan Brooke]] to Egypt in August 1942 to replace [[Claude Auchinleck]] commander of the British army in North Africa with [[Bernard Montgomery]] and also took Churchill to high-level talks in Moscow with Joseph Stalin, to Turkey to determine that country's wartime intentions, and to the Casablanca Conference in 1943.&lt;ref name=Times190400&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vanderkloot|first1=William J.|publisher=The Times|date=19 Apr 2000|location=London|page=25|title=unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=airspace&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/Travels-with-Churchill.html |author=Graham Chandler |title=Travels with Churchill.

[[File:American Aircraft in Royal Air Force Service 1939-1945- Consolidated Liberator. CH18804.jpg|thumb|right|interior of AL504 ''Commando'']]
On delivery ''Commando'' had a regular Liberator nose and tail configuration despite the internal modifications but was later converted to have a covered nose and also to have a single tail fin. The [[Very Important Person|VIP]] (&quot;Very Important Person[s]&quot;) interior had comfortable seating, an electric galley and even a bed, installed for Churchill.&lt;ref name=IWM&gt;{{cite web |title=AMERICAN AIRCRAFT IN ROYAL AIR FORCE SERVICE 1939–1945: CONSOLIDATED LIBERATOR.| url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205210637|website=Imperial War Museum| accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joebaugher&gt;{{cite web| title=Liberator II for the RAF/LB-30|url=http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/b24_5.html | website=joebaugher.com| accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the second extended trip,&lt;ref name=Lavery/&gt; Churchill never again flew in ''Commando'', instead switching to ''[[Avro York#Specials|Ascalon]]'', a passenger version of the Lancaster bomber with a larger fuselage and an all-British crew. Vanderkloot and his mixed US/Canadian civilian crew were all recommended for British awards for their service, he and one other receiving honorary [[OBE]]s.&lt;ref name=natarc&gt;{{cite book|title=Document Air 2/6699|publisher=National Archives|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Aircraft in Royal Air Force Service 1939-1945- Consolidated Liberator. CH18803.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of AL504 ''Commando'']]
In September 1943 Liberator AL504 was withdrawn from VIP service and flown to a [[Tucson, Arizona]] [[USAAF]] base, where it underwent major modifications and emerged as a one-off transport, lengthened by seven feet, with single tail fin, extended fuselage, and upgraded engines. AL504 flew again in March 1944 as the trial version of the [[US Navy]]’s [[Consolidated RY Liberator Express]] transport.&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merriam|first1=Ray|title=World War II Album Volume 7: Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator and PB4Y-2 Privateer|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1312961975|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanderkloot and the crew continued to fly it for a time, one crew member's last logbook entry for AL504 is 24 November 1944.&lt;ref name=airspace/&gt;

''Commando'' had served as Churchill’s official aircraft during a critical period and later in the war was also used on occasion by other VIP’s for their business in connection with the war effort. She also served with [[No. 45 Group Communications Flight]] (45 Gp Comms Flt), based at Dorval, near Montreal.&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;{{cite book |last=Lake |first=Alan |title=Flying Units of the RAF |year=1999 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |location=Shrewsbury |isbn=978-1-84037-086-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was well maintained and proved extremely reliable and had been flown from [[Montreal]] to [[Sydney, Australia]] on 5 November 1944 by [[Air Commodore]] C J Powell CBE, [[RAF]] (Senior Air Staff Officer) [[RAF Transport Command]].&lt;ref name=Livingstone&gt;{{cite book|last1=Livingstone|first1=Bob|title=Under the Southern Cross : the B-24 Liberator in the South Pacific|date=1998|publisher=Turner Pub.|location=Paducah, KY|isbn=978-1563114328|page=122|edition=Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Commando'' was the second of 139 VLR (Very Long Range) Liberator II aircraft delivered to the RAF mostly to be used by [[RAF Coastal Command]] on maritime patrol duty and anti-submarine warfare, escorting the supply convoys of merchant vessels and attacking and sinking German [[U-boat]]s.

==Last flight==
The Under-Secretary of State for Air [[Rupert Brabner]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]], his deputy Sir [[John Abraham (civil servant)|John Abraham]] KBE CB, and the Air Member for Training [[Air Marshal]] Sir [[Peter Roy Maxwell Drummond]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Medal bar|&amp; Bar]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[Military Cross|MC]] [[RAF]] needed to fly to Canada with other dignitaries to attend a ceremony marking the closure of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]]. [[Winston Churchill]]'s former personal transport ''Commando'' was assigned as the VIP aircraft.

Flown by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] William Biddell OBE DFC, the aircraft took off from [[RAF Northolt]] at 23:00 hours GMT on Monday 26 March 1945 to fly to [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] with a refueling stop at [[Lagens Field]] in the [[Azores]].
Routine contact was established between the aircraft and its base at 05:22 hours GMT in the morning with the flight proceeding as scheduled.
The flight was proceeding routinely when the last contact was made with [[RAF Transport Command]] at [[RAF Prestwick]] at 07:16 hours GMT on the morning of 27 March 1945 in position 40°30'N 20°17'W by civilian Radio Officer Frederick Williams aboard the aircraft, to advise an estimated time of arrival of 08:10 hours at [[Lagens Field]]. There were no further signals.

==Loss and searches==
When ''Commando'' failed to arrive at [[Lagens Field]] emergency calls were made by radio and air-sea searches initiated once the aircraft was classified as overdue. [[RAF Coastal Command]] assisted by the [[Royal Navy]] commenced a series of searches which were described by [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] in his announcement in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 March 1945.
Close to the flight path which ''Commando'' would have been following over the ocean in towards [[Lagens Field]] aircrew of the searching [[RAF Coastal Command]] aircraft spotted some yellow dinghies, a small amount of wreckage and an oil patch on the surface. It was {{convert|150|-|200|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} north-west of the Azores, there were no traces of any survivors.&lt;ref name=Storr&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storr|first1=Alan|title=RAAF WW2 fatalities by categories|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RC09125_020--1-.pdf|website=static.awm.gov.au|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little could be done and it was considered probable that ''Commando'' had crashed at sea while approaching the Azores.&lt;ref name=asn157730&gt;{{cite web|title=Accident record|url=http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=157730|website=ASN|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible causes==
* Radio or radio navigational aid failure was not considered an issue as the aircraft was flying in daylight and the Azores would probably have been located without difficulty.
* Engine failure was considered. The No. 2 engine had been changed during maintenance on 15 November 1944 and had 517 flying hours, the other three engines had each accumulated 466 flying hours and had been serviced on 16 November 1944. The aircraft carried its own [[flight engineer]]. Its previous civilian flight engineer, John Affleck, testified at the court of enquiry and reported that mention was made in a radio signal of an oil leak in the No. 2 engine which he believed might have resulted in a fire beside a fuel tank.&lt;ref name=airspace/&gt;
* Fuel shortage was considered unlikely, excepting a catastrophic leak, as the aircraft carried considerably more than sufficient for its flight to the Azores.
* Pilot error was considered unlikely as the aircraft was flown by a highly experienced [[RAF Transport Command]] transatlantic pilot who had 635 flying hours on Liberators and 3,780 flying hours in total.
* Navigational error was discounted as the traces of wreckage were found close to the expected flight path.
* Structural failure was considered, but was not confirmed due to lack of evidence from crash debris.
