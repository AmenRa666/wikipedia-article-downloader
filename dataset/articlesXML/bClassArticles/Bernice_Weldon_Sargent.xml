'''Bernice Weldon Sargent''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|size=100%|sep=,|MBE|FRSC}} (24 September 1906 – 17 December 1993) was a Canadian physicist who worked at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Montreal Laboratory]] during the [[Second World War]] as head of its nuclear physics division. In his 1932 doctoral thesis, he discovered the relationship between the radioactive disintegration constants of [[beta particle]]-emitting radioisotopes and corresponding logarithms of their maximum beta particle energies. These plots are known as &quot;Sargent curves&quot;.

==Biography==
Bernice Weldon Sargent was born in [[Williamsburg, Ontario]], on 24 September 1906,&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=In Memoriam  – Bernice Weldon Sargent 1906–1993  |first=J.R. |last=Leslie |first2=G.T. |last2=Ewan |journal=Physics in Canada |issn=0031-9147 |volume=50 |issue=1 |date=January–February 1994 |url=https://www.cap.ca/onlineforms/temp_PiC_archive/1994-v50-n1.pdf |accessdate=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Henry Sargent, a farmer, and his wife  Ella {{nee}} Dillabough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV9H-35GD |title=Person Details for Henry Sargent in entry for Bernice Weldon Sargent, &quot;Ontario Births, 1869–1911&quot; |publisher=Family Search |accessdate=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Chesterville High School and Morrisburg Collegiate Institute. He was awarded a Prince of Wales Entrance Scholarship and a Carter Scholarship, and entered [[Queen's University]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree [[Honours degree|with honours]] in mathematics and physics in 1926, and a [[Master of Arts]] degree the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot; /&gt;

In 1928, Sargent was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]], which allowed him to travel to England to study at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] under [[Ernest Rutherford]]. His 1932 doctoral thesis, written under the supervision of Rutherford and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]], on &quot;The Disintegration Electrons&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot; /&gt; subsequently published in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]'', described relationship between the radioactive disintegration constants of [[beta particle]]-emitting radioisotopes and corresponding logarithms of their maximum beta particle energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] |title=The Maximum Energy of the β-Rays from Uranium X and Other Bodies |first=B. W. |last=Sargent |volume=139 |issue=839 |pp=659–673 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1933.0045 |date=3 March 1933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plots are today known as &quot;Sargent curves&quot; or &quot;Sargent diagrams&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Terms and Definitions in Nuclear Chemistry |publisher=Radiochemistry Society |url=http://www.radiochemistry.org/nomenclature/s.htm |accessdate=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was used by [[Enrico Fermi]] in developing his theory of [[beta decay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=American Journal of Physics |title=Fermi's Theory of Beta Decay  |first=Fred L. |last=Wilson  |volume=36 |issue=12 |date=December 1968 |url=http://microboone-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=953;filename=FermiBetaDecay1934.pdf;version=1 |accessdate=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargent returned to Canada, where he became a [[lecturer]] and then an [[assistant professor]] at Queen's University. In 1941, he joined [[George Laurence]] of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC)  in [[Ottawa]] to investigate nuclear energy, writing a report on &quot;Uranium Fission in a Bulk of Carbon and Uranium Oxide&quot;. In 1943, he took a leave of absence from Queen's University to join the Anglo-Canadian [[Montreal Laboratory]], which subsequently became part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. He became the head of its nuclear physics branch in 1945, and, after the laboratory moved to the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] in 1946, of the physics division in 1951. As such, he was involved in the design of the first Canadian [[nuclear reactor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Early Years&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ieee.ca/millennium/nuclear_power/NuclEnerg.PDF |title=Early Years of Nuclear Energy Research in Canada |first=George C. |last=Laurence |authorlink=George C. Laurence  |accessdate=19 May 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his wartime activities, Sargent was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1946. He was awarded the [[Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot;/&gt;

In 1951, Sargent left the Chalk River Laboratories to return to Queen's University as the head of its physics department and, from 1954 to 1972, as its R.S. Mclaughlin Research Professor. Under his management, the physics department expanded in size, and moved to new premises at Stirling Hall, which was built under his supervision. He stepped down as the head of the physics department in 1967, but continued teaching until he retired in 1972. He continued to perform research at Queen's and Chalk River until 1990, when his activities were curtailed due to illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot;/&gt;

In addition to his research activities, Sargent was a member of the Canadian Association of Physicists, serving its president from 1955 to 1956, and was an associate editor of the Canadian Journal of Physics from 1954 to 1968. He became a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 1941, and was the rapporteur and later convener of its Physics Subject Division from 1964 to 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot;/&gt;

Sargent died in [[Kingston, Ontario]], on 17 December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Canadian Nuclear Society Bulletin |issn=0714-7074  |volume=14 |issue=4 |date=Winter 1993–1994 |title=Canadian Nuclear Pioneer }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, Dorothy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics in Canada&quot;/&gt;
