The '''recorded [[military history]]''' of '''[[Puerto Rico]]''' encompasses the period from the 16th century, when Spanish [[conquistador]]es battled native [[Taíno]]s in the rebellion of 1511, to the present employment of Puerto Ricans in the [[United States Armed Forces]] in the military campaigns in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].

Puerto Rico was part of the [[Spanish Empire]] for four centuries, when the Puerto Ricans defended themselves against invasions from the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], and [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]]. They fought alongside General [[Bernardo de Gálvez]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in the battles of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. During the mid-19th century, Puerto Ricans residing in the United States fought in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CW&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whalen| first1 = Carmen Teresa| last2 = Vázquez-Hernández| first2 = Víctor| title = The Puerto Rican Diaspora Historical Perspectives| year = 2005| isbn = 978-1-59213-413-7| page = 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quest for Latin American independence from Spain spread to Puerto Rico, in the short lived revolution known as the ''[[Grito de Lares]]'' and culminating with the ''[[Intentona de Yauco]]''. The island was invaded by the United States during the [[Spanish–American War]]. After the war ended, Spain officially ceded the island to the United States under the terms established in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. Puerto Rico became a [[United States territory]] and the &quot;Porto Rico Regiment&quot; (Puerto Rico's name was changed to Porto Rico) was established on the island.

Upon the outbreak of World War I, the [[U.S. Congress]] approved the [[Jones–Shafroth Act]], which extended [[United States citizenship]] (the Puerto Rican House of Delegates rejected US citizenship)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Morris| first = Nancy| title = Puerto Rico Culture, Politics, and Identity| url = https://books.google.com/?id=FWcjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31| year = 1995| publisher = Praeger| isbn = 978-0-275-95228-0| page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with limitations upon Puerto Ricans and made them eligible for the military [[Conscription|draft]]. As citizens of the United States, Puerto Ricans have participated in every major United States military engagement from World War I onward. During World War II, Puerto Ricans participated in the Pacific and Atlantic theaters, not only as combatants, but also as commanders. It was during this conflict that Puerto Rican nurses were allowed to participate as members of the WAACs. The members of Puerto Rico's [[65th Infantry|65th Infantry Regiment]] distinguished themselves in combat during the [[Korean War]] and were honored with the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/10/obama-honors-puerto-rican-infantry-regiment-with-congressional-gold-medal/ Obama honors Puerto Rican Infantry Regiment with Congressional Gold Medal, ''Washington Post,'' June 10, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]] five Puerto Ricans were awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the United States. Presently Puerto Ricans continue to serve in the military of the United States. The following is brief history of the military events in which Puerto Ricans have participated.

== Taíno rebellion of 1511 ==
[[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the island of Puerto Rico on November 19, 1493, during his second voyage to the so-called &quot;New World&quot;. The island was inhabited by the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] group of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] known as Tainos, who called the island &quot;Borikén&quot; or &quot;Borinquen&quot;. The Tainos were known as a peaceful people, however they were also warriors and often fought against the Caribs, who in more than one occasion attempt to invade the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4526:imitos-inunca-mas-tainos-bravos-habia-mas-de-uno&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342 |title=¿Taínos mansos? ¡Piénselo otra vez! |website=Periodicolaperla.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus named the island ''San Juan Bautista'' in honor of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]]. The main port was named ''Puerto Rico (Rich Port)'' (eventually the island was renamed Puerto Rico and the port which was to evolve into the capital of the island was renamed San Juan). The conquistador [[Juan Ponce de León]] accompanied Columbus on this trip.&lt;ref name=&quot;CEE&quot;&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0839647.html Ponce de Leon, Juan. ''The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th ed. 2005. Columbia University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Estatua de Agüeybaná II, El Bravo, en el Parque Monumento a Agüeybaná II, El Bravo, en Ponce, Puerto Rico (DSC02672C).jpg|thumb|200px|Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave)]]
When Ponce de León arrived in Puerto Rico, he was well received by the ''Cacique'' ([[Tribal chief]]) [[Agüeybaná (The Great Sun)]], chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, some of the first colonists were farmers and miners in search of [[gold mining|gold]]. In 1508, Ponce de León became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of [[Caparra Archaeological Site|Caparra]] between the modern-day cities of [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]] and San Juan. After being named Governor, de León and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos died as a result of cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, upon Agüeybaná's death, his brother Güeybaná, better known as [[Agüeybaná II]] (The Brave), and a group of Tainos led [[Diego Salcedo (soldier)|Diego Salcedo]], a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led his people in the Taino rebellion of 1511, the first rebellion in the island against the better armed Spanish forces. [[Guarionex]], cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]) and killed eighty of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boriquén&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newdeal.feri.org/pr/pr06.htm|title=History from Puerto Rico: A Guide to the Island of Boriquén|last=Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration|year=1940|publisher=The University Society|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cacique Guarionex died during the attack which was considered a Taino victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;HU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ortizal.com/utuado.html |title=Historia De Utuado |website=Ortizal.com |date=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Taino victory the colonists formed a citizens' [[militia]] to defend themselves against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León and one of his top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OS7TaeBN-C0J:www.nps.gov/saju/historyculture/upload/A%2520Historical%2520Overview%2520of%2520Colonial%2520Puerto%2520Rico_The%2520Importance%2520of%2520San%2520Juan%2520as%2520a%2520Military%2520Outpost.doc+agueybana+el+bravo&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=A Historical Overview of Colonial Puerto Rico: The Importance of San Juan as a Military Outpost|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;''Naraciones historicas by Cayetano Coll y Toste, Pub.

According to the &quot;500TH Florida Discovery Council Round Table&quot;, on March 3, 1513, Juan Ponce de León, organized and commenced an expedition (with a Crew of 200-including Women and Free Blacks) departing from &quot;[[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Punta Aguada]]&quot; Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was the historic 1st gateway to the discovery of Florida which opened the doors to the advanced settlement of the USA. They introduced Christianity, Cattle, Horses, Sheep, the Spanish language and more to  the land (Florida) that later became the United States of America, 107 years before the Pilgrims landed.&lt;ref&gt;PROCLAMATION precented by Dennis O.

== Europeans fight over Puerto Rico ==

=== 16th Century ===
[[File:FortElMorro SanJuan PuertoRico.jpg|thumb|left|El Morro, Puerto Rico's main military fortification]]
Puerto Rico was considered the &quot;Key to the Antilles&quot; by the Spanish because of its location as a way station and port for Spanish vessels. In 1540, with revenue from Mexican mines, the Spanish settlers began the construction of [[Fort San Felipe del Morro]] (&quot;the promontory&quot;) in San Juan. With the completion of the initial phase of the construction in 1589 ''El Morro'' became the island's main military fortification, guarded by professional soldiers. The rest of Puerto Rico, which had been reorganized in 1580 as a [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|captaincy general]], had to rely on only a handful of soldiers and the local volunteer militia to defend the island against militant and pirate attacks.

The main enemies of Spain at the time were the English and the Dutch. They, however were not the only enemies that Spain faced in the Caribbean during this period. On October 11, 1528, the French sacked and burned the settlement of [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]] during an attempt to capture the island, destroying many of the island's first settlements—including Guánica, Sotomayor, Daguao and Loiza—before the local militia forced them to retreat. The only settlement that remained was San Juan.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

In 1585, war broke out between England and Spain. The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]] was not limited to Europe—extending to Spanish and English territories in the Americas. In November 1595, [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]], the [[vice-admiral]] in command of the [[Royal Navy]] fleet that tackled the [[Spanish Armada]], and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Sir John Hawkins]] attempted an unsuccessful invasion of San Juan. Both Hawkins and Drake died of illness in the course of the campaign. On June 15, 1598, the English fleet, led by [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George Clifford]], landed in Santurce and held the island for several months. He was forced to abandon the island upon an outbreak of bacillary dysentery among his troops. In 1599, 400 additional soldiers and 46 cannons were sent to the island along with a new governor, Alonso de Mercado, to rebuild the city.&lt;ref&gt;'' Colle y Toste (1918)and Dr. Oscar Costa-Mandry (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th century ===
The Netherlands was a world military and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean with the English. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain Boudewijn Hendricksz (also Boudoyno Henrico or Balduino Enrico) to capture Puerto Rico. On September 24, 1625, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men. Enrico sent a message to the governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haros, ordering him to surrender the island. De Haros refused; he was an experienced military man and expected an attack in the section known as Boqueron. He therefore had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

[[File:La recuperación de la isla de Puerto Rico por el gobernador de la isla, Juan de Haro. Por Eugenio Cajés..jpg|thumb|200px|Seventeenth-century Spanish painting commemorating Enrico's defeat at San Juan de Puerto Rico; by [[Eugenio Caxés]], [[Museo del Prado]]]]
De Haro realized that an invasion was inevitable and ordered Captain [[Juan de Amezquita]] and 300 men to defend the island from El Morro Castle and then had the city of San Juan evacuated. He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance in the interior of the island. On September 25, Enrico attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and [[La Fortaleza]] (the Governor's Mansion). He invaded the capital city and set up his headquarters in La Fortaleza. The Dutch were counterattacked by the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El [[Fort San Felipe del Morro|Morro Castle]]. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amezquita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcnbiografias.com/app-bio/do/show?key=haro-juan-de-conquistador |title=Haro, Juan de [administrador colonial español&amp;#93; (ca. 1550-1631). |website=MCNBiografias.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans, who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amezquita and Andre Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRH&quot;&gt;[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/2/2/7/12272/12272.htm ''The History of Puerto Rico From the Spanish Discovery to the American Occupation'' / Middeldyk, R.A.

In 1693, the ''Milicias Urbanas de Puerto Rico'' were organized in almost every town. Every native  male, ages 16 to 60, was obliged to serve in these companies, unless he had an official exemption on account of physical disability or family hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~prwgw/military.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328064029/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~prwgw/military.htm |archivedate=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[File:Miguel Enriquez.jpg|left|130px|thumb|Captain Miguel Henriquez]]
While Spain and England were in a power struggle in the New World, Puerto Rican [[privateer]]ing of English ships was encouraged by the Spanish Crown. Captain [[Miguel Enríquez (privateer)|Miguel Enríquez]] and Captain [[Roberto Cofresí]] (in the 19th century) were two of the most famous. In the first half of the 18th century, Henriquez, a shoemaker by occupation, decided to try his luck as a privateer. He showed great valor in intercepting English merchant ships and other ships dedicated to [[contraband]] that were infesting the seas of Puerto Rico and the Atlantic Ocean in general. Henriquez organized an expeditionary force which fought and defeated the English in the island of Vieques. He was received as a national hero when he returned the island of Vieques to the Spanish Empire and to the governorship of Puerto Rico. In recognition of his service, the Spanish Crown awarded Henriquez the ''Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie'' (The Gold Medal of the Royal Effigy), named him &quot;Captain of the Seas and War&quot;, and gave him a [[letter of marque and reprisal]], thus granting him the privileges of privateer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblioteca.uprh.edu/cultural/rebelion_masas.htm|title=Centro Cultural |accessdate=October 22, 2006 |author=Santiago Maunez Vizcarrondo |work= |publisher=Dra. Antonia Sáez|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th century ===

====Armed conflicts with the British====
The English continued their attacks against Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, taking minor islands including [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]] east of Puerto Rico. On August 5, 1702, the city of [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], on Puerto Rico's northern coast, was invaded by the British. Armed only with spears and [[machete]]s, under the command of Captain [[Antonio de los Reyes Correa]], 30 militia members defended the city from the English, who were armed with [[musket]]s and [[sword]]s. The British were defeated, suffering 22 losses on land and 8 at sea. Reyes Correa was declared a [[Folk hero|national hero]] and was awarded the ''Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie'' (&quot;Gold Medal of the Royal Image&quot;) and the title of &quot;Captain of Infantry&quot; by [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/arecibo.shtml |title=Arecibo, Puerto Rico |website=Welcome.topuertorico.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native-born Puerto Rican (''criollos'') had petitioned the Spanish Crown to serve in the regular Spanish army, resulting in the 1741 organization of the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico. The Fijo served in the defense of Puerto Rico and other Spanish overseas possessions, performing in battles in Santo Domingo, other islands in the Caribbean, and South America, most notably in [[Venezuela]]. However, Puerto Rican complaints that the Fijo was being used to suppress the revolution in Venezuela caused the Crown to bring the Fijo home and in 1815 it was mustered out of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brigade-napoleon.org/infantrie/spanish/Spanish_Regiment.htm |title=Regimento Fijo de Puerto Rico |accessdate=October 6, 2006 |author= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1765, the Spanish Crown sent Field Marshal [[Alejandro O'Reilly]] to Puerto Rico to form an organized militia. O'Reilly, known as the &quot;Father of the Puerto Rican Militia&quot;, oversaw training to bring fame and glory to the militia in future military engagements, nicknaming the civilian militia the &quot;Disciplined Militia.&quot; O'Reilly was later appointed governor of colonial [[Louisiana]] in 1769 and became known as &quot;Bloody O'Reilly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cultura&quot;&gt;''Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ev1.net/~gpmoran/ch1.htm |title=The Celtic Connection |accessdate=October 6, 2006 |author= |work= |publisher= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060813014450/http://users.ev1.net/~gpmoran/ch1.htm |archivedate = August 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The American Revolutionary War====
[[File:Ramon de Castro.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Brigadier General Ramón de Castro]]
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Spain lent the rebelling colonists the use of its ports in Puerto Rico, through which flowed financial aid and arms for their cause. An incident occurred in the coast of Mayagüez, in 1777, between two [[Continental Navy]] ships, the ''Eudawook'' and the ''Henry'', and a Royal Navy warship, {{HMS|Glasgow|1757|6}}. Both American ships were chased by the larger and more powerful ''Glasgow''. The American colonial ships were close to the coast of [[Mayagüez]]; members of the Puerto Rican militia of that town, realizing that something was wrong, signaled for the ships to dock at the town's bay. After the ships docked, the crews of both ships got off and some Mayagüezanos boarded and raised the Spanish flag on both ships. The commander of the ''Glasgow'' became aware of the situation and asked the island's governor, Jose Dufresne to turn over the ships. Dufresne refused and ordered the British warship out of the Puerto Rican dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n12/PRSST0912-en.html |title=Something Sweet Like Mango in the Air: A Primer on Mayagüez |newspaper=Puerto Rico Herald |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governor of [[Louisiana]], [[Bernardo de Gálvez]], was named [[Field Marshal]] of the Spanish colonial army in North America. In 1779, Galvez and his troops, composed of Puerto Ricans and people from other Spanish colonies, distracted the British from the revolution by capturing [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], the capital of the British colony of West Florida and the cities of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].

====Sir Ralph Abercromby attacks Puerto Rico====
[[File:MilicianoDisciMoreno.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Uniform used by the Freed Black Militia of Puerto Rico]]
On February 17, 1797, the governor of Puerto Rico Brigadier General Ramón de Castro, received news that Great Britain had invaded the island of Trinidad. Believing that Puerto Rico would be the next British objective he decided to put the local militia on alert and to prepare the island's forts against any military action. On April 17, 1797, British ships under the command of Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]] approached the coastal town of [[Loíza, Puerto Rico|Loíza]], to the east of San Juan. On April 18, British soldiers and German mercenaries (&quot;[[Hesse|Hessians]]&quot;) landed on Loíza's beach. Under the command of de Castro, British ships were shot at by artillery from both El Morro and the San Gerónimo fortresses but were beyond reach. After the invaders disembarked practically all fighting was land based with many skirmishes, field artillery and mortar fire exchanges between the San Gerónimo and San Antonio Bridge fortress and British emplacements in Condado to the East and El Olimpo hill in Miramar to the South. The British tried to take the San Antonio, a key passage to the San Juan islet, and repeatedly bombarded the nearby San Gerónimo to the tune of nearly one thousand shells and almost demolishing it. At the Martín Peña Bridge, they were met by the likes of Sergeants [[José and Francisco Díaz]] and Colonel [[Rafael Conti]] who together with Lieutenant Lucas de Fuentes attacked the enemy with two cannons. After fiercely fighting by the Spanish forces and local militia, they were defeated in all attempts to advance into San Juan. The invasion failed because Puerto Rican volunteers and Spanish troops fought back and defended the island in a manner described by a British lieutenant as of &quot;astonishing bravery&quot;.

====&quot;La Rogativa&quot; folklore====
The defense of San Juan served as the base for the legend of &quot;La Rogativa&quot;.  According to the popular Puerto Rican legend, on the night of April 30, 1797, the townswomen, led by a bishop, formed a ''rogativa'' (prayer procession) and marched throughout the streets of the city singing hymns and carrying torches while at the same time praying for the deliverance of the city. Outside the walls, the invaders mistook the torch-lit movement for the arrival of Spanish reinforcements. When morning came, the enemy was gone from the island and the city was saved from a possible invasion. Four statues, sculptured by [[Lindsay Daen]] in the ''Plazuela de la Rogativa'' (Rogativa Plaza) in [[Old San Juan]], pay tribute to the bishop and townswomen who participated in ''La Rogativa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopuertorico.about.com/od/thelocal/tp/folklore.htm |title=Myths, Legends, and Superstitions of Puerto Rico |website=Gopuertorico.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindsaydaen.com/pages/page10.htm |title=La Rogativa Details |website=Lindsaydaen.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attack of Aguadilla====
The British also attacked [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico|Aguadilla]] and Punta Salinas. They were defeated by Colonel Conti and the members of the militia in Aguadilla, and the British troops that had landed on the island were taken prisoner. The British retreated on April 30 to their ships and on May 2 set sail northward. Because of the defeat given to the British forces, governor Ramon de Castro petitioned Spanish King [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] for recognition for the victors; he was promoted to Field Marshal and several others were promoted and given pay raises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;&gt;''Historias de Puerto Rico'' by Paul G.

Pareja, 1967, 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The British persisted in invading Puerto Rico, after Abercromby's defeat, with unsuccessful skirmishes on the coastal towns of Aguadilla (December 1797), Ponce, Cabo Rojo, and Mayagüez. This continued to occur until 1802 when the war finally came to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Brau, Salvador. ''Historia de Puerto Rico'', San Juan: Editorial Coqui, 1966; 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
France had threatened to invade the Spanish colony of [[Santo Domingo]]. In 1808, the Spanish Crown sent their Navy, under the command of Puerto Rican Captain [[Ramón Power y Giralt]], to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the French by enforcing a [[blockade]]. Col. Rafael Conti organized a military expedition with the intention of defending the Dominican Republic. They were successful and were proclaimed as heroes by the Spanish Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=09091001 |title=History: Power y Giralt, Ramón |website=Enciclopediapr.org |date=2014-09-12 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Civil War ===
[[File:Augusto Rodriquez.jpg|125px|thumb|right|Lieutenant Augusto Rodríguez]]
During the 1800s, commerce existed between the ports of the eastern coast of the United States and Puerto Rico. Ship records show that many Puerto Ricans traveled on ships that sailed to and from the  U.S. and Puerto Rico. Many of them settled in places such as New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Upon the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], many Puerto Ricans joined the ranks of the United States military armed forces, however since Puerto Ricans were Spanish subjects they were inscribed as Spaniards. The 1860 census of New Haven, Connecticut, shows there were 10 Puerto Ricans living there. Among of them was [[Augusto Rodríguez (soldier)|Augusto Rodriguez]] who joined the 15th Connecticut Regiment (a.k.a. Lyon Regiment) in 1862. During the Civil War, Rodriguez, who reached the rank of Lieutenant, served in the defenses of Washington, D.C.. He also led his men in the Battles of [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] and [[Battle of Wyse Fork|Wyse Fork]]. The regiment was mustered out on June 27, 1865 and he was discharged in New Haven on July 12, 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;CW&quot;/&gt;

===Slave revolts===
Up until 1873, when slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico, the wealth amassed by many landowners in Puerto Rico derived mainly from the exploitation of slaves. But slavery generated its antithesis—disobedience, uprisings and flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Baralt |first=Guillermo A. |title=Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795–1873 |year=2007 |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishing |isbn=978-1-55876-463-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baralt |first=Guillermo A. |title=Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795–1873 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=L9H7nQEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |year=2007 |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |isbn=978-1-55876-463-7 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Puerto Rico there were many minor slave revolts in which the slaves clashed with the military establishment. In July 1821, [[Marcos Xiorro]], a bozal slave, planned and organized a conspiracy against the slave masters and the colonial government of Puerto Rico. According to his plot, which was to be carried out on July 27, during the festival celebrations for Santiago ([[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]]), several slaves were to escape from various plantations in Bayamón, which included the haciendas of Angus McBean, C. Kortnight, Miguel Andino and [[Fernando Fernández (distiller)|Fernando Fernández]]. They were then to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve [[cutlass]]es and swords which were hidden in those fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot; /&gt; Xiorro, together with a slave from the McBean plantation named Mario and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves of Bayamón and [[Toa Baja]] and capture the city of Bayamón. They would then burn the city and kill those who were not [[Black people|black]]. After this, they would all unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of [[Río Piedras, Puerto Rico|Río Piedras]], [[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico|Guaynabo]] and Palo Seco. With this [[critical mass]] of slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would then invade the capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], where they would declare Xiorro as their king.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot; /&gt; Unfortunately for the slave conspirators, the plot was divulged by a fellow slave to the authorities.

The mayor of Bayamón mobilized 500 soldiers. The ringleaders and followers of the conspiracy were captured immediately. A total of 61 slaves were imprisoned in Bayamón and San Juan.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot; /&gt; The ringleaders were executed and the fate of Xiorro remains a mystery.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot; /&gt; There were other minor revolts up until the abolition of slavery in the island became official.

== Revolt against Spain ==

=== South America ===
[[File:Antonio Valero Bernabe.gif|thumb|left|General [[Antonio Valero de Bernabé]], the &quot;Liberator from Puerto Rico&quot;]]
In 1822, there was an attempt, known as the [[Ducoudray Holstein Expedition]], conceived, carefully planned and organized by General [[Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein]] to invade Puerto Rico and declare it a republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cedo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayaguezsabeamango.com/images/documentos/capital.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - MayagÃ¼ez Capital ULT.doc |website=Mayaguezsabeamango.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This invasion was different from all its precursors since none before had intended to make Puerto Rico an independent nation, and use the Taino name &quot;Boricua&quot; as the official name of the republic, it was also intended more as a mercantile venture than a patriotic endeavor. It was the first time an invasion intended to make the city of Mayagüez the capital of the island.&lt;ref name=Cedo/&gt; However, plans of the invasion were soon disclosed to the Spanish authorities and the plot never materialized.

====United Provinces of New Granada====
In the early 19th century the Spanish colonies, in what is known as the [[Latin American wars of independence]], began to revolt against Spanish rule. [[Antonio Valero de Bernabé]] was a Puerto Rican military leader known in Latin America as the &quot;Liberator from Puerto Rico&quot;. Valero was a recent graduate of the Spanish Military Academy when [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] convinced King Charles IV of Spain to permit him to pass through Spanish soil with the sole purpose of attacking Portugal. When Napoleon refused to leave, the Spanish government declared war. Valero joined the Spanish Army and helped defeat Napoleon's army at the [[Siege of Saragossa (1808)|Siege of Saragossa]]. Valero became a hero; he was promoted to the rank of colonel and was awarded many decorations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valero&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zonai.com/promociones/biografias/1001/valero.asp |title=Biografías - Antonio Valero|accessdate=October 7, 2006 |author1=Carmen Leonor Rivera-Lassén|author2=Cristina Fernández |work=El Nuevo Día |pages= |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913122154/http://www.zonai.com/promociones/biografias/1001/valero.asp &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=September 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] assumed the throne of Spain in 1813, Valero became critical of the new king's policies towards the Spanish colonies in Latin America. He developed a keen hatred of the monarchy, resigned his commission in the army, and headed for Mexico. There he joined the insurgent army headed by [[Agustín de Iturbide]], in which Valero was named chief of staff. He fought for and helped achieve [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence]] from Spain. After the Mexican victory, Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico. Since Valero had developed anti-monarchist feelings following his experiences in Spain, he revolted against Iturbide. His revolt failed and he attempted to escape from Mexico by way of sea.&lt;ref name=Valero/&gt;

Valero was captured by a Spanish pirate, who turned him over to the Spanish authorities in Cuba. Valero was imprisoned but managed to escape with the help of a group of men that identified with [[Simón Bolívar]]'s ideals. Upon learning of Bolívar's dream of creating a unified Latin America, including Puerto Rico and Cuba, Valero decided to join him. Valero stopped in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], where he established contacts with the Puerto Rican independence movement.

He then traveled to Venezuela, where he was met by General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]].&lt;ref name=Valero/&gt; He next joined Bolívar and fought alongside &quot;The Liberator&quot; against Spain, gaining his confidence and admiration. Valero was named Military Chief of the Department of Panama, Governor of Puerto Cabello, Chief of Staff of Colombia, Minister of War and Maritime of Venezuela, and in 1849 was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Lucas G.

[[File:Maria de las Mercedes Barbudo, Independence Leader from Ponce, Puerto Rico, circa 1815 (6607177617).jpg|175px|thumb|María de las Mercedes Barbudo]]

The meetings of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities and the members of the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which Venezuelan rebel leader José María Rojas sent to [[María de las Mercedes Barbudo]], Rojas stated that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movements was in danger of being discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMB2&quot;&gt;[http://www.raquelrosario.net/Historias%20Claridad%20Mercedes%20Bar.pdf María de las Mercedes Barbudo; Primera mujer independentista de Puerto Rico; CLARIDAD;  December 1994; page 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercedes Barbudo, also known as the &quot;first Puerto Rican female freedom fighter&quot;, was a businesswoman who became a follower of the independence ideal for Puerto Rico upon learning that Bolivar dreamed of eventually engendering an American Revolution-style federation, that would be known as the [[United Provinces of New Granada]], between all the newly independent republics, with a government ideally set-up solely to recognize and uphold individual rights. She was involved with the Puerto Rican Independence Movement which had ties with the Venezuelan rebels led by [[Simón Bolívar]] and who were against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.80grados.net/mercedes-la-primera-independentista-puertorriquena/ |title=Mercedes, la primera independentista puertorriqueĂąa |website=80grados.net |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unknown to Mercedes Barbudo, the Spanish authorities in Puerto Rico under Governor [[Miguel de la Torre]], were suspicious of the correspondence between her and the rebel factions of Venezuela. Secret agents of the Spanish Government had retained some of her mail and delivered it to Governor de la Torre. He ordered an investigation and had her mail confiscated. The Government believed that the correspondence served as propaganda of the Bolivian ideals and that it would also serve to motivate Puerto Ricans to seek their independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRFF&quot;&gt;[http://www.raquelrosario.net/PR's%20first%20female%20freedom%20fighter-Ing.pdf Puerto Rico's first female Freedom Fighter; by: Natalia de Cuba; San Juan Star; October 20, 1997; page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Miguel de la Torre ordered her arrest on the charge that she planned to overthrow the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. Since Puerto Rico did not have a women's prison she was held without bail at the Castillo San Cristóbal. Among the evidence which the Spanish authorities presented against her was Rojas letter. She was exiled to Cuba where she was able to escape and make her way to Venezuela where she spent her final days.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRFF&quot;/&gt;

The Spanish government had received many complaints from the nations whose ships were attacked by Puerto Rican pirate Captain [[Roberto Cofresí]]. Cofresí and his men had attacked eight ships, amongst them an American ship. The Spanish government, which routinely encouraged piracy against other nations, was pressured and felt obliged to pursue and capture the famous pirate. In 1824, Captain John Slout of the U.S. Naval Forces and his schooner {{USS|Grampus|1821|6}} engaged Cofresí in a fierce battle. The pirate Cofresí was captured, along with eleven of his crew members, and turned over to the Spanish Government. He was imprisoned in El Castillo del Morro in San Juan. Cofresi was judged by a Spanish Council of War, found guilty, and executed by firing squad on March 29, 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vacationpuertorico.com/cofresi.html |title=The Story of...Roberto Cofresí Ramírez de Arellano |accessdate=October 7, 2006 |publisher=Property Resources, Rincon Puerto Rico|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040609073305/http://vacationpuertorico.com/cofresi.html|archivedate=June 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 13, 1855, a [[mutiny]] broke out among the artillerymen at [[Fort San Cristóbal]]. They were protesting an extended two years of military service imposed by the island's Spanish governor, Garcia Cambia. The mutineers pointed their cannons towards San Juan, creating a state of panic among the population. Upon their surrender, the governor had the eight men arrested and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[firing squad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/saju/sancristobal.html |title= San Cristobal|accessdate=October 7, 2006 |author= |work= |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grito de Lares ====
Many Spanish colonies had gained their independence by the mid-1850s. In Puerto Rico, there were two groups: the loyalists, who were loyal to Spain, and the ''independentistas'', who advocated independence. In 1866, Dr. [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]], [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]], and other independence advocates met in New York City where they founded the [[Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico]]. An outcome of this venture was a plan to send an armed expedition from the [[Dominican Republic]] to invade the island. Several revolutionary cells were formed in the western towns and cities of Puerto Rico. Two of the most important cells were at Mayagüez, led by [[Mathias Brugman]] and code named &quot;Capa Prieto&quot; and at Lares, code-named &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; and headed by [[Manuel Rojas (independence leader)|Manuel Rojas]]. &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; was the main center of operations and was located in the Rojas plantation of El Triunfo. Manuel Rojas was named &quot;Commander of the Liberation Army&quot; by Betances. [[Mariana Bracetti]] (sister-in-law of Manuel) was named &quot;Leader of the Lares Revolutionary Council.&quot; Upon the request of Betances, Bracetti knitted the first flag of Puerto Rico also known as the revolutionary [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Flag of Lares]] (''Bandera de Lares'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Carlito Rovira |title=The birth of Puerto Rico's fight for independence |url=http://www.pslweb.org/liberationnews/news/05-09-01-the-birth-puerto-ricos-fight-in.html |work=Liberation | publisher=LiberationNews.org|pages= |page= | date=1 September 2005 | accessdate=2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish authorities discovered the plot and were able to confiscate Betances's armed ship before it arrived in Puerto Rico. The Mayor of the town of [[Camuy, Puerto Rico|Camuy]], Manuel González (leader of that town's revolutionary cell), was arrested and charged with treason. He learned that the Spanish Army was aware of the independence plot, and escaped to warn Manuel Rojas. Alerted, the revolutionists decided to start the revolution as soon as possible, and set the date for September 28, 1868. Mathias Brugman and his men joined with Manuel Rojas's men and with about 800 men and women, marched on and took the town of Lares. This was to be known as &quot;[[Grito de Lares]]&quot; (The Cry of Lares) The revolutionists entered the town's church and placed Mariana Bracetti's revolutionary flag on the High Altar as a sign that the revolution had begun. They declared Puerto Rico to be the &quot;Republic of Puerto Rico&quot; and named [[Francisco Ramírez Medina|Francisco Ramírez]] its President. Manuel and his poorly armed followers proceeded to march on to the town of [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico|San Sebastián]], armed only with clubs and machetes. The Spanish Army had been forewarned, and awaited with superior firepower. The revolutionists were met with deadly fire. The revolt failed, many revolutionists were killed, and at least 475, including Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti, were imprisoned in the jail of Arecibo and sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/rojas.html |title=Manuel Ronjas |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |author= |work=The World of 1898:The Spanish-American War |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/BiografiasPr/mariana_bracetti.htm |title=Mariana Bracetti |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |author= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others fled and went into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by a farmer named Francisco Quiñones; he was captured and executed on the spot. In 1869, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed almost entirely of native-born Puerto Ricans, and also the Compañia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Olga J.

Leaders of ''El Grito de Lares'' who were in exile in New York City joined the [[Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee]], founded on December 8, 1895 to continue the quest for independence. In 1897, with the aid of [[Antonio Mattei Lluberas]] and Fidel Velez, the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco, they organized another uprising, which became known as the [[Intentona de Yauco]]. On March 26, 1897, there was a second and last major attempt to overthrow the Spanish government. The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities, who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMPR&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Negroni| first = Héctor Andrés| title = Historia militar de Puerto Rico| year = 1992| authorlink= Héctor Andrés Negroni| isbn = 978-84-7844-138-9 | publisher = Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, the incoming governor of Puerto Rico, Jose Laureano Sanz, in an effort to ease tensions in the island, dictated a general [[amnesty]] and released all who were involved with the [[Grito de Lares]] revolt from prison. Both Mariana Bracetti and Manuel Rojas were released.

Among the many Puerto Ricans who volunteered to fight for Cuba's independence were Juan Ríus Rivera, Francisco Gonzalo Marín, also known as &quot;Pachin Marín&quot; and José Semidei Rodríguez.

[[Juan Ríus Rivera]] as a young man met and befriended Betances, and was joined the pro-independence movement in the island. He became a member of the Mayagüez revolutionary cell &quot;Capá Prieto&quot; under the command of Brugman. Ríus, did not participated directly in the revolt because at the time he was studying law in Spain, however he was an avid reader about information pertaining to the [[Antilles]] and learned about the failed revolt. He interrupted his studies and traveled to the United States where he went to the Cuba Revolutionary &quot;Junta&quot; and offered his services. He joined the Cuban Liberation Army and was given the rank of General. He fought alongside Gen. [[Máximo Gómez]] in Cuba's [[Ten Years' War]]. He later fought alongside Gen. [[Antonio Maceo Grajales]] and upon Maceo's death was named Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army. After Cuba gained its independence, Gen. Juan Ríus Rivera became an active political figure in the new nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcnbiografias.com/app-bio/do/show?key=rius-rivera-juan |title=Ríus Rivera, Juan (1846-1924). |website=MCNBiografias.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Gonzalo Marín]] was a poet and journalist in Puerto Rico who joined the Cuban Liberation Army upon learning of the death of his brother Wecenlao in the battlefields of Cuba. Marin, who was given the rank of Lieutenant, befriended and fought alongside [[José Martí]]. In November 1897 Lt.

== Spanish–American War ==
In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayler Mahan, a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker, wrote a book titled ''The Influence of Sea Power upon History'' in which he argued for the creation of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy. Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea which would serve as coaling and naval stations and which would serve as strategical points of defense upon the construction of a canal in the [[Isthmus of Panama|Isthmus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SP&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Beruff| first = Jorge Rodríguez| title = Strategy As Politics Puerto Rico on the Eve of the Second World War| year = 2007| publisher = Universidad De Puerto Rico| isbn = 978-0-8477-0160-5| page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not new, since [[William H. Stewart]], the former Secretary of State under the administrations of various presidents, among them [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]], had stressed that a canal be built either in [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] or [[Panama]] and that the United States annex the [[Dominican Republic]] and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive the approval of the U.S. Senate and Spain did not accept the 160 million dollars which the U.S. offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP&quot;/&gt;

Captain Mahan made the following statement to the War Department:{{quotebox|&quot;Having therefore no foreign establishments either colonial or military, the ships of war of the United States, in war will be like land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide resting places for them where they can coal and repair. would be one of the first duties of a government proposing to itself the development of the power of the nation at sea&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Mahan, ''The Influence of Sea Power upon History (1660–1783)'', London: Sampson Low, Marston, Seale; page 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since 1894, the [[Naval War College]] had been formulating plans for war with Spain. By 1896, the Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan which including military operations in Puerto Rican waters. Not only was Puerto Rico considered a valuable as a naval station, Puerto Rico and Cuba were also abundant in valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked, that commodity was sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Beruff| first = Jorge Rodríguez| title = Strategy As Politics Puerto Rico on the Eve of the Second World War| year = 2007| publisher = Universidad De Puerto Rico| isbn = 978-0-8477-0160-5| page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States declared war on Spain in 1898 following the sinking of the battleship {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} in Havana harbor, Cuba. One of the United States' principal objectives in the Spanish–American War was to take control of Spanish possessions Puerto Rico and Cuba in the Atlantic, and the [[Philippines]] and [[Guam]] in the Pacific.

The Spanish Crown sent the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican Provisional Battalions to defend Cuba against the American invaders. The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, composed of the Talavera Cavalry and [[Krupp]] artillery, was sent to [[Santiago de Cuba]] where they battled the American forces in the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]]. After the battle, the Puerto Rican Battalion suffered a total of 70% casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIA's and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/tropas.htm |title=tropas.htm |website=Home.coqui.net |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasion of Puerto Rico by the American military forces was known as the [[Puerto Rican Campaign]]. On May 10, 1898, Spanish forces, under the command of Captain [[Ángel Rivero Méndez]] in the fortress of San Cristóbal in San Juan, exchanged fire with the {{USS|Yale|1889|6}}, and on May 12 a fleet of 12 American ships bombarded San Juan.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perso.wanadoo.es/padron/rivero/ |title=Angel RIVERO. Crónica de la Guerra Hispanoamericana en Puerto Rico |website=Perso.wanadoo.es |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, the {{USS|Yosemite|1892|6}} arrived in San Juan and blockaded the port. Captains [[Ramón Acha Caamaño]] and José Antonio Iriarte, both natives of Puerto Rico, were among those who defended the city form Fort San Felipe del Morro. They had 3 Batteries under their command, which were armed with at least three 15&amp;nbsp;cm Ordóñez cannons. The battle lasted 3 hours and resulted in the death of Justo Esquivies, the first Puerto Rican soldier to die in the Puerto Rican Campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt;

On July 25, General [[Nelson A. Miles]] entered the southern town of [[Guánica, Puerto Rico|Guánica]] with 3,300 troops and faced a minor skirmish in their landing.
[[File:Yauco Battlefield 1898.jpg|250px|thumb|Part of the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, where the Battle of Yauco took place in 1898]]
One of the most notable battles during the Puerto Rico Campaign occurred between the Spanish forces and Puerto Rican volunteers, led by Captain Salvador Meca and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig against the American forces led by Brigadier General George A. Garretson on July 26, 1898. The Spanish forces engaged the 6th Massachusetts in a firefight in what became known as the [[Battle of Yauco]]. Puig and his forces suffered 2 officers and 3 soldiers wounded and 2 soldiers dead. The Spanish forces were ordered to retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Barnes |url=http://www.spanamwar.com/puertoland2.htm |title=Puerto Rican Land Campaign, Part 2 |website=Spanamwar.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puerto Rican Campaign was short compared to the other campaigns because the Puerto Ricans who resided in the southern and western towns and villages resented Spanish rule and tended to view the Americans as their liberators, thereby making the invasion much easier and because, as stated before, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican Provisional Battalions where in Cuba defending that island. However, the Americans met resistance from the Spanish forces and Puerto Rican Volunteers and were engaged in the following battles: Battle of Fajardo, Battle of Guayama, Battle of the Guamani River Bridge, Battle of Coamo, Battle of Silva Heights and Battle of Asomante.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY&quot;/&gt; On August 13, 1898, the Spanish–American War ended and the Spanish surrendered without other major incidents. Some Puerto Rican leaders such as [[José de Diego]] and [[Eugenio María de Hostos]] expected the United States to grant the island its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-02

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that Puerto Rico would gain its independence, a group of men staged an uprising in Ciales which became known as &quot;El Levantamiento de Ciales&quot; or the &quot;Ciales Uprising of 1898&quot; and proclaimed Puerto Rico to be a republic. The Spanish authorities who were unaware that the cease fire had been signed brutally suppressed the uprising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Almanaque_historico3.htm#donde |title=O b r a d i s e ñ a d a y c r e a d a p o r H é c t o r A |website=Proyectosalonhogar.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total casualties of the [[Puerto Rican Campaign]] were 450 dead or wounded Spanish and Puerto Ricans, and 4 dead and 39 wounded Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg1&quot;&gt;''From Yauco to Las Marias; Being a story of the recent campaign in western Puerto Rico by the independent regular brigade under command of Brigadier general Schwon'' by Karl Hermann, Pub.

Upon the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on December 10, Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States. The Spanish troops had already left by October 18, and the United States named General Nelson A. Miles military governor of the island. On July 1, 1899, &quot;The Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry, United States Army&quot; was created, and approved by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] on May 27, 1908. The regiment was a segregated, all-volunteer unit made up of 1,969 Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg1&quot;/&gt;

=== Puerto Rican commander in the Philippines ===
In 1897, before the onset of fighting in Puerto Rico, [[Juan Alonso Zayas]], born in San Juan, was a Second Lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders to head for the Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in [[Baler, Aurora|Baler]]. He arrived in [[Manila]], the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of [[Luzon]]. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100&amp;nbsp;km); if traveled through the jungles and badly built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230&amp;nbsp;km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas's mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://angkangpilipino.com/2012/02/04/los-ultimos-de-filipinas/ |title=Suggestions To Ensure An Excellent Experience With Payday Advances |website=Angkangpilipino.com |date=2013-04-04 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alonso&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/AlonsoZayas.htm |title=Juan Alonso Zayas: Un héroe puertorriqueño desconocido |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |author=Miguel Hernández Torres |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independence advocates, under the leadership of Colonel Calixto Vilacorte, were called &quot;[[insurgency|insurgents]]&quot; (''Tagalos'') by the Spanish crown. On June 28, 1898, they demanded the surrender of the Spanish army. The Spanish governor of the region, Enrique de las Morena y Fossi, refused; the Filipinos immediately attacked Baler in a battle that was to last for seven months. Despite being outnumbered and suffering hunger and disease, the battalion did not capitulate. In the meantime, Zayas and the rest of the battalion were totally unaware of the Spanish–American War that was going on. In August 1898, the hostilities between the United States and Spain came to an end. The Philippines became a U.S. possession under the accordance of the Treaty of Paris. In May 1899, the Battalion at Baler found out about the Spanish–American War and its aftermath. They had been unaware that they had been fighting for a possession which was no longer theirs to fight for. On June 2, 1899 the Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Martín Cerezo surrendered to the Tagalos only after some conditions were met. Among the conditions were the following:
* 1. That the Spaniards not be treated as prisoners of war and
* 2. that they would not be harmed in their quest of reaching a Spanish ship which would take them back to Spain.
The 32 survivors of Zayas Battalion were sent to Manila, where they boarded a ship for Spain. In Spain, they were given a hero's welcome and became known as ''los Ultimos de Baler''—&quot;the Last of Baler.&quot;&lt;ref name=Alonso/&gt;

== Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry ==

On March 2, 1898, Congress authorized the creation of the first body of native troops in Puerto Rico. On June 30, 1901, the &quot;Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry came into being. An Act of Congress, approved on May 27, 1908, reorganized the regiment as part of the &quot;regular&quot; Army. Since the native Puerto Rican officers where Puerto Rican citizens and not citizens of the United States, they were required to undergo a new physical examination to determine their fitness for commissions in the Regular Army and to take an oath of U.S. citizenship with their new officers oath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Higgins| first = Jack| title = Temporada En El Infierno| year = 1993| publisher = Emece Editores| isbn = 978-84-7888-138-3| page = 370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Puerto Rican National Guard ==
[[File:Esteves.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Major General Luis R. Esteves (Army)]]
In 1906, a group of Puerto Ricans met with the appointed Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rican National Guard. The petition failed because the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] prohibits the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without the authorization of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/arng-pr.htm |title=Puerto Rico National Guard |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |author= |authorlink= |date=May 23, 2005 |work= |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |pages= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 1915, Major General [[Luis R. Esteves]] of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] became the first Puerto Rican and the first Hispanic to graduate from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]. While he attended West Point, he tutored classmate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in Spanish; a second language was required in order to graduate. He was a Second Lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Brigade of the army under the command of [[John J. Pershing]] when he was sent to [[El Paso, Texas]] in the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]]. From El Paso, he was sent to the town of Polvo, where he was appointed mayor and judge by its citizens. Esteves helped organize the 23rd Battalion, which would be composed of Puerto Ricans and be stationed in [[Panama]] during World War I. He would also play a key role in the formation of the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bellsouthpwp.net/r/u/ruiz_b/LuisRaulEsteves/Luis_Raul_Esteves.htm |title= Major General Luis Raúl Esteves Völckers |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |author=Bruce C.

[[File:Camp Las Casas1904.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Pto. Rico Regiment training in Camp Las Casas (c. 1904)]]
In 1904, [[Camp Las Casas]] was established in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] under the command of Lt. Colonel Orval P. Townshend. The Porto Rico Regiment was assigned to the camp. The regiment consisted of two battalions of the former Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.valerosos.com/65thpg1.htm |title=History of the 65th Infantry 1898 to 1946 page 1 |website=Valerosos.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. first shot of World War I fired in Puerto Rico====
Lieutenant [[Teófilo Marxuach]] was the officer of the day at El Morro Castle on March 21, 1915. The ''Odenwald'', built in 1903 (not to be confused with the German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of the [[San Juan Bay]] and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnacion Correa then manned a machine gun and fired warningf shots with little effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMPR&quot;/&gt; Marxuach fired a shot from a cannon located at the Santa Rosa battery of &quot;El Morro&quot; fort, in what is considered to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against any ship flying the colors of the [[Central Powers]],&lt;ref name=&quot;USNI&quot;&gt;&quot;US Naval Institute Proceedings&quot;; &quot;A Breach of Neutrality&quot;; by: Lt.

The first draft number was picked by Diana Yaeger, the daughter of the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico [[Arthur Yager]]. The number she picked was 1435 and it belonged to San Juan native Eustaquio Correa. Thus, Correa became the first Puerto Rican to be &quot;drafted&quot; into the Armed Forces of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://co.kalipedia.com/historia-universal/tema/eustaquio-correa.html?x1=20080804klphishpr_22.Kes&amp;x=20080804klphishpr_24.Kes |title=Eustaquio Correa en Kalipedia Colombia |website=Web.archive.org |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2016-05-28 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713132847/http://co.kalipedia.com/historia-universal/tema/eustaquio-correa.html?x1=20080804klphishpr_22.Kes&amp;x=20080804klphishpr_24.Kes |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1917, the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was sent to guard the [[Panama Canal]] in defense of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] One of the Puerto Ricans who distinguished himself during World War I was Lieutenant [[Frederick Lois Riefkohl]] of the US Navy, who on August 2, 1917, became the first known [[Puerto Rican recipients of the Navy Cross|Puerto Rican to be awarded the Navy Cross]]. The [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], which is the second highest medal after the [[Medal of Honor]], that can be awarded by the U.S. Navy, was awarded to Lt. Riefkohl for his actions in an engagement with an enemy submarine. Lt. Riefkohl, who was also the first Puerto Rican to graduate from the United States Naval Academy, served as a Rear Admiral in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/01_wwi-nc/nc_02_WW1_Navy-SUB.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215707/http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/01_wwi-nc/nc_02_WW1_Navy-SUB.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick L. Riefkohl's brother, [[Rudolph W. Riefkohl|Rudolph William Riefkohl]] also served.  Riefkohl was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and assigned to the 63rd Heavy Artillery Regiment in France where he actively participated in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]. According to the [[United States War Department]], after the war he served as [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] of Coastal Artillery at the [[Letterman Army Medical Center]] in [[Presidio of San Francisco]], in [[California]] (1918).

By 1918, the Army realized that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. [[Dolores Piñero]] from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the mornings and in the laboratory during the afternoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |author=Mercedes Graf |date=Summer 2002 |title=With high hopes: women contract surgeons in World War I |journal=Minerva: Quarterly Report on Women and the Military |volume= |issue= |page=7 |id= |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EXI/is_2_20/ai_106472385/pg_7 |accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York (state)|New York]], many Puerto Ricans joined the [[369th Infantry Regiment (United States)|369th Infantry Regiment]] which was mostly composed of [[Afro-Americans]]. They were not allowed to fight alongside their white counterparts; however, they were permitted to fight as members of a French unit in French uniforms. They fought along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France, and their reputation earned them the nickname of &quot;the Harlem Hell Fighters&quot; by the [[German Empire|Germans]]. Among them was [[Rafael Hernández Marín]], considered by many as Puerto Rico's greatest composer. The 369th was awarded French ''Croix de guerre'' for battlefield gallantry by the French President.

Marine aviation was fairly new, it came into existence on May 22, 1912, and the first major expansion of the Marine Corps' air component, of which Puerto Rico played a major rule, came with America's entrance into World War I.

The need for a Puerto Rican National Guard unit became apparent to Major General Luis R. Esteves, who had served as instructor of Puerto Rican Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry at [[Camp Las Casas]] in Puerto Rico. His request was met with the approval of the government and Puerto Rican Legislature. In 1919, the first regiment of the Puerto Rican National Guard was formed, and General Luis R.

=== Second Nicaraguan Campaign (1926–33) ===
After World War I, Puerto Ricans fought on foreign shores as members of the United States Marine Corps.

Puerto Rico suffered greatly during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, and many Puerto Ricans moved to the [[East Coast of the United States]] looking for jobs and a better way of life. On the island, the unemployment rate continued to rise and many Puerto Ricans who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a source of employment. Not only were they paid better than at the few other available jobs, but they were also guaranteed three meals a day, clothing, and shelter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valerosos2&quot;/&gt;

=== The Rif War (1920) ===
After the Spanish–American War, members of the Spanish forces and civilians who were loyal to the Spanish Crown were allowed to return to Spain. Those who returned to their motherland took with them their Puerto Rican spouses and children. Among those who were born in Puerto Rico and who would go on to serve in the [[Rif War]] as members of the Spanish mititary were General Manuel Goded Llopis and Captain Felix Arenas Gaspar. The Rif War is a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule took place in [[Spanish Morocco]], a Spanish protectorate in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balagan.org.uk/war/iberia/1909/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218211945/http://balagan.org.uk/war/iberia/1909/index.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Rif War Captain [[Félix Arenas Gaspar]], who was born in San Juan, distinguished himself in combat.

=== Spanish Civil War (1936–39) ===
Before the United States entered World War II, Puerto Ricans were already fighting on European soil, not only in the Rif War, but also on both sides of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

The Spanish Civil War was a major conflict in Spain that started after an attempted ''[[coup d'état]]'' committed by parts of the [[Spanish Army|army]], led by the [[Franquism|Fascist]] [[Francisco Franco|General Francisco Franco]], against the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Puerto Ricans fought on behalf of both of the factions involved, the &quot;Nationalists&quot; as members of the Spanish Army and the &quot;Loyalists&quot; (Republicans) as members of the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade|Abraham Lincoln International Brigade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;despierto&quot;/&gt;

Among the Puerto Ricans who fought alongside General Franco on behalf of the Nationalists was General [[Manuel Goded Llopis]] (1882–1936), a high-ranking officer in the Spanish Army. Llopis, who was born in San Juan, was named Chief of Staff of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]], after his victories in the Rif War, took the [[Balearic Islands]] and by order of Franco, suppressed the rebellion of [[Asturias]]. Llopis was sent to lead the fight against the Anarchists in [[Catalonia]], but his troops were outnumbered. He was captured and was sentenced to die by firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Richard A. H.

Among the many Puerto Ricans who fought on behalf of the Second Spanish Republic as members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, was [[Lieutenant]] [[Carmelo Delgado Delgado]] (1913–1937), a leader of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] from [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]] who upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War was in Spain in pursuit of his law degree. Delgado was an [[anti-fascist]] who believed that the Spanish Nationalists were traitors. He fought in the [[Battle of Madrid]], but was captured and was sentenced to die by firing squad on April 29, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alba-valb.org/ |title=Abraham Lincoln Brigade: Spanish Civil War History and Education: Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives |website=Alba-valb.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===

==== The Pearl Harbor of the Atlantic ====
[[File:Rosmap.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Map of U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]]
In 1940, when Germany attacked Great Britain, the United States feared that if Germany controlled Great Britain, Mexico and the U.S. would be next. In the same year, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] ordered the construction of a naval base in the Atlantic similar to [[Pearl Harbor]] in Hawaii. The site was meant to provide anchorage, docking, repair facilities, fuel, and supplies for 60% of the Atlantic Fleet. The naval base, which was named [[Roosevelt Roads Naval Station|U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]], became the largest naval installation in the world in landmass and was meant to be the Pearl Harbor of the Atlantic. However, with the defeat of Germany in 1945, the United States concentrated all of their efforts to the war in the Pacific. In May 2003, after six decades of existence, the base was officially shut down by the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n18/CBRROpportunityCrsrds-en.html |title=Opportunity Doesn't Knock.

In 1939, a survey was conducted of possible air base sites. It was determined that Punta Borinquen was the best site for a major air base. Later that year, Major Karl S. Axtater assumed command of what was to become &quot;Borinquen Army Air Field&quot; (Later renamed Ramey Air Force Base). The first squadron based at Borinquen Field was the 27th Bombardment Squadron, consisting of nine B-18A Bolo medium bombers. In 1940, the air echelon of the 25th Bombardment Group (14 B-18A aircraft and two A-17 aircraft) arrived at the base from Langley Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles A.

During World War II, the following squadrons were assigned to the airfield:

====Puerto Ricans in the military====
In October 1940, the 295th and 296th Infantry Regiments of the Puerto Rican National Guard, founded by Major General [[Luis R. Esteves]], were called into Federal Active Service and assigned to the Puerto Rican Department in accordance with the existing [[War Plan Orange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;neta_marin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18 |url=http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/marin.htm|title=Puerto Rican Units (World War II) |first=Hector |last=Marin|publisher=Hispanic America USA|work=Hispanics in the Defense of America}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513025822/http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/marin.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There weren no Puerto Rican military-related fatalities in the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor. However, there was one civilian Puerto Rican fatality. Daniel LaVerne was a Puerto Rican armature boxer who was working at Pearl Harbor's Red Hill underground fuel tank construction project when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He died as a result of the injuries which he received during the attack. His name is listed among the 2,338 Americans killed or mortally wounded on December 7, 1941, in the Remembrance Exhibit in the back lawn of the USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center at Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kim Taylor |url=http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth1_1200.htm |title=JCS: Fatalities at Pearl Harbour: Svinth et al |website=Ejmas.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated by the Department of Defense that 65,034 Puerto Ricans served in the U.S. military during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;neta_unit1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-19|url=http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/unit1.htm|title=Introduction: World War II (1941–1945)|work=Hispanics in the Defense of America}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204094234/http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/unit1.htm |date=February 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers from the island, serving in the 65th Infantry Regiment, participated in combat in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]]—in Germany and Central Europe. Those who resided in the mainland of the United States were assigned to regular units of the military and served either in the European or [[Pacific War|Pacific theaters]] of the war. Some families had multiple members join the Armed Forces. Seven brothers of the Medina family known as &quot;The Fighting Medinas&quot;, fought in the war. They came from [[Río Grande, Puerto Rico]] and Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pbs.org/newyorkgoestowar/ |title=Watch PBS TV Shows Online |website=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases Puerto Ricans were subject to the racial discrimination which at that time was widespread in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;neta_unit1&quot; /&gt;
[[File:PRNT.jpg|left|thumb|Puerto Rican Army nurses, 296th Station Hospital, Camp Tortuguero, Vega Baja, PR.]]
World War II was also the first conflict in which women, other than nurses, were allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many of the island's women work force migrated to the mainland U.S. to work in the factories which produced military equipment. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not have to deal with the language barriers. Among them was Second Lieutenant [[Carmen Lozano Dumler]], who became one of the first Puerto Rican female military officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Women&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/PRHistory.html |title=Puerto Rican Servicewomen in Defense of the Nation |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |author=Judith Bellafaire |work= |publisher=Women In Military Service For America Memorial Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the Army sent recruiters to the island to recruit no more than 200 women for the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC). Over 1,000 applications were received for the unit which was to be composed of only 200 women. The Puerto Rican WAC unit, Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, a segregated Hispanic unit, was assigned to the [[New York Port of Embarkation]], after their basic training at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia]]. They were assigned to work in military offices which planned the shipment of troops around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/PRHistory.html |title=Women In Military Service For America Memorial |website=Womensmemorial.org |date=1944-08-21 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was PFC [[Carmen García Rosado]], who in 2006, authored and published a book titled &quot;LAS WACS-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Segunda Guerra Mundial&quot; (The WACs-The participation of the Puerto Rican women in the Second World War), the first book to document the experiences of the first 200 Puerto Rican women who participated in said conflict.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;LAS WACS&quot;-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Seginda Guerra Mundial; by: Carmen Garcia Rosado; page 60; 1ra.

The 149th [[Women's Army Corps|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]] (WAAC) Post Headquarters Company was the first WAAC Company to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbor for Europe on January 1943. The unit arrived in Northern Africa on January 27, 1943, and rendered overseas duties in [[Algiers]] within General Dwight D. Eisenhower's theatre headquarters. Tech4 [[Carmen Contreras-Bozak]], a member of this unit, was the first Hispanic to serve in the Women's Army Corps as an interpreter and in numerous administrative positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utopia.utexas.edu/explore/latino/narratives/07Bozak_Carmen.html |title=Carmen Contreras-Bozak |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919122433/http://www.utopia.utexas.edu/explore/latino/narratives/07Bozak_Carmen.html |archivedate=September 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 65th Infantry, after an extensive training program in 1942, was sent to Panama to protect the Pacific and the Atlantic sides of the [[isthmus]] in 1943. On November 25, 1943, Colonel [[Antulio Segarra]], proceeded Col. John R. Menclenhall as Commander of the 65th Infantry, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican Regular Army officer to command a Regular Army regiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valerosos.com/CommandsGVillahermosa.html |title=Commands - by Col.

On January 12, 1944, the 296th Infantry Regiment departed from Puerto Rico to the Panama Canal Zone. In April 1945, the unit returned to Puerto Rico and soon after was sent to [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The 296th arrived on June 25, 1945 and was attached to the Central Pacific Base Command at Kahuku Air Base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelby1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=World War II Order of Battle|author=Shelby, Stanton|publisher=Galahad Books|location=New York|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel [[Gilberto José Marxuach]], &quot;The Father of the San Juan Civil Defense&quot;, was the commander of both the 1114th Artillery Co. and the 1558th Engineers Co.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMA&quot;&gt;&quot;Gilberto Marxauch Acosta&quot;, ''El Mundo'', by Luis O'Niel de Milan, June 7, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on January 1944, the 65th Infantry Regiment was embarked for [[Jackson Barracks]] in [[New Orleans]] and later sent to [[Fort Eustis]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] in preparation for overseas deployment to North Africa. After they arrived at [[Casablanca]], they underwent further training. By April 29, 1944, the 65th Infantry regiment was sent to North Africa, arriving at [[Casablanca]], where they underwent further training. For some Puerto Ricans, this would be the first time that they were away from their homeland. Being away from their homeland for the first time would serve as an inspiration for compositions of two [[Bolero]]'s; &quot;[[En mi viejo San Juan]]&quot; by [[Noel Estrada]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prpop.org/biografias/n_bios/noel_estrada.shtml], Retrieved February 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Despedida&quot; (My Good-bye), a farewell song written by [[Pedro Flores (composer)|Pedro Flores]] and interpreted by [[Daniel Santos (singer)|Daniel Santos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;veinte y cinco&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Daniel Santos: Su vida y sus canciones |author=Francisco José Correa Bustamante |year=1995 |publisher=Editores Corsan |location=Guayaquil, Ecuador |pages=25–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 29, 1944, the Regiment had landed in Italy and moved on to [[Corsica]]. On September 22, 1944, the 65th Infantry landed in France and was committed to action on the Maritime Alps at Peira Cava. On December 13, 1944, the 65th Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Juan César Cordero Dávila]], relieved the 2nd Battalion of the [[442nd Infantry Regiment]], a Regiment which was made up of [[Japanese Americans]] under the command of Col. [[Virgil R. Miller]], a native of Puerto Rico. The 3rd Battalion fought against and defeated Germany's 34th Infantry Division's 107th Infantry Regiment. There were 47 battle casualties including Pvt. Sergio Sanchez-Sanchez and Sergeant Angel Martinez, from the town of Sabana Grande, who were the first two Puerto Ricans to be killed in combat action from the 65th Infantry. On March 18, 1945, the regiment was sent to the [[Germany|District of Mannheim]] and assigned to [[military occupation]] duties. In all, the 65th Infantry participated in the battles of [[Naples]]-Fogis, Rome-Arno, [[central Europe]] and of the [[Rhineland]].

It was during this conflict that CWO2 [[Joseph B. Aviles, Sr.]], a member of the [[United States Coast Guard]] and the first [[Hispanic-American]] to be promoted to [[Chief Petty Officer]], received a war-time promotion to [[Chief Warrant Officer]] (November 27, 1944), thus becoming the first Hispanic American to reach that level as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/HispanicAmericansChronology.asp |title=Hispanic-Americans and the U.S. Coast Guard: A Historical Chronology |website=Uscg.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aviles, who served in the United States Navy as [[Gunner's Mate|Chief Gunner's Mate]] in World War I, spent most of the war at [[St. Augustine, Florida]] training recruits.

Cordero and his men underwent brutal torture and humiliation during the [[Bataan Death March]] and nearly four years of captivity. He was one of nearly 1,600 members of the 31st Infantry who were taken as prisoners. Half of these men perished while prisoners of the Japanese forces. After Cordero gained his freedom, when the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops defeated the Japanese, he was sent to Italy and in 1946, returned to the United States. Cordero, who retired with the rank of Brigadier General, wrote about his experiences as a prisoner of war and what he went through during the [[Bataan Death March]]. He authored ''My Experiences during the War with Japan'', which was published in 1950. In 1957, he authored a revised Spanish version titled ''Bataan y la Marcha de la Muerte''; Volume 7 of ''Colección Vida e Historia''.&lt;ref&gt;''Toledo Blade'' June 9, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aviators====
[[File:Jose A. Muniz.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Muñiz, (USAAF)]]
Puerto Ricans also served in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. In 1944, Puerto Rican aviators were sent to the Tuskegee Army Air Field in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]] to train the famed 99th Fighter Squadron of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States armed forces. Puerto Ricans were also involved in clerical positions with the Tuskegee unit. Among the Puerto Ricans who helped make the Tuskegee experiment a successful one were T/Sgt. Pablo Diaz Albortt, an NCO (Non Commissioned Officer) in charge of the Special Service Office, and Eugene Calderon, who was assigned to the &quot;Red Tail&quot; unit, as the Company Clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Francis| first = Charles E.| title = The Tuskegee Airmen The Men who Changed a Nation| year = 1997| publisher = Branden Books| isbn = 978-0-8283-2029-0| page = 370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, the Tuskegee Airmen were credited with 109 Luftwaffe aircraft shot down, a patrol boat run aground by machine-gun fire, and destruction of numerous fuel dumps, trucks and trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redtailreborn.com/Red_Tail_Reborn/History.html |title=at Directnic |website=Redtailreborn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Puerto Ricans who served in either the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], the British [[Royal Air Force]] or the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during the war and distinguished themselves as fighter pilots and bombardiers were Captains Mihiel &quot;Mike&quot; Gilormini and Alberto A. Nido, Lieutenants José Antonio Muñiz and César Luis González, and T/Sgt. Clement Resto.

Captain [[Mihiel Gilormini|Mihiel &quot;Mike&quot; Gilormini]] served in the Royal Air Force and in [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a [[fighter pilot]] during World War II. He was the recipient of the Silver Star Medal, the Air Medal with four clusters and the Distinguished Flying Cross 5 times. Gilormini later became a co-founder of the [[Puerto Rico Air National Guard]] and retired as Brigadier General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Negroni| first = Héctor Andrés| title = Historia militar de Puerto Rico| year = 1992| publisher = Hector Andres Negroni| isbn = 978-84-7844-138-9| page = 486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Alberto A. Nido]] served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], the Royal Air Force and in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during the war. He flew missions as a bomber pilot for the RCAF and as a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter pilot for the RAF. As member of the RAF, he belonged to 67th Reconnaissance Squadron who participated in 275 combat missions. Nido later transferred to the USAAF's 67th Fighter Group as a [[P-51 Mustang]] fighter pilot. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with four [[oak leaf cluster]]s and the Air Medal with four oak leaf clusters. Nido co-founded the Puerto Rico Air National Guard and, as Gilormini, retired a Brigadier General.&lt;ref&gt;El Mundo; &quot;La carrera de Alberto A. Nido en las fuerzas aéreas de los EE. UU.; April 26, 1944; Number 9986&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant [[José Antonio Muñiz]] served with distinction in the [[China Burma India Theater]]. During his tour of duty he flew 20 combat missions against the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] and shot down a [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Relatan hechos en que Participaron&quot;; El Mundo; May 12, 1945; Number 10467&lt;/ref&gt; Muñiz was also a co-founder of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/muniz.htm |title=Mu?iz ANGB |website=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2nd Lieutenant [[César Luis González]], a co-pilot of a [[C-47]], was the first Puerto Rican pilot in the United States Army Air Forces. He was one of the initial participants of the invasion of [[Sicily]] on July 10, 1943 also known as [[Operation Husky]]. During the invasion of Sicily, he flew on two night missions, the first on July 9, where his mission was to release paratroops of [[82nd Airborne Division]] on the area of [[Gela]] and the second on July 11, when he dropped reinforcements in the area. His unit was awarded a &quot;DUC&quot; for carrying out this second mission in spite of bad weather and heavy attack by enemy ground and naval forces. González died on November 22, 1943, when his plane crashed during training off the end of the runway at [[Castelvetrano]]. He was posthumously promoted to First Lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar2pilots.net/314-Group-Roll-Of-Honor.pdf |title=worldwar2pilots.net |website=Worldwar2pilots.net |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T/Sgt. Clement Resto served with the 303rd Bomb Group and participated in numerous bombing raids over Germany. During a bombing mission over [[Düren]], Germany, Resto's plane, a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], was shot down. He was captured by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to [[Stalag|Stalag XVII-B]] where he spent the rest of the war as a [[prisoner of war]]. Resto, who lost an eye during his last mission, was awarded a [[Purple Heart]], a [[Prisoner of War Medal|POW Medal]], and an [[Air Medal]] with one battle star after he was liberated from captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Human experimentation==
Puerto Rican soldiers were also subject to human experimentation by the United States Armed Forces. On Panama's San Jose Island, Puerto Rican soldiers were exposed to [[mustard gas]] to see if they reacted differently than their &quot;white&quot; counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_14/issue_09/frontpage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903170608/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_14/issue_09/frontpage.html |archivedate=September 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Susan L. Smith of the University of Alberta, the researchers were searching for evidence of race-based differences in the responses of the human body to mustard gas exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyam.org/initiatives/im-histe.shtml The New York Academy of Medicine; The Lilianna Sauter Lecture; &quot;Medicine in Wartime, Part IV: Place, Health and War: World War II Mustard Gas Experiments in Transnational Perspective&quot;; Susan L.

==Post World War II==
[[File:Denton.jpg|right|130px|thumb|LTJG Maria Rodriguez Denton]]

The American participation in the Second World War came to an end in Europe on May 8, 1945 when the western Allies celebrated &quot;[[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]]&quot; (Victory in Europe Day) upon Germany's surrender, and in the Asian theater on August 14, 1945 &quot;[[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]&quot; (Victory over Japan Day) when the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrendered]] by signing the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]]. Lieutenant Junior Grade [[Puerto Rican women in the military|Maria Rodriguez Denton]] (U.S. Navy), born in Guanica, Puerto Rico, was the first woman from Puerto Rico who became an officer in the United States Navy as member of the [[WAVES]]. It was LTJG Denton who forwarded the news (through channels) to President Harry S. Truman that the war had ended.&lt;ref name=Women/&gt;

On October 27, 1945, the 65th Infantry sailed home from France. Arriving at Puerto Rico on November 9, 1945, they were received by the local population as national heroes and given a victorious reception at the Military Terminal of Camp Buchanan.

According to the book &quot;Historia Militar De Puerto Rico&quot; (Military history of Puerto Rico), by historian Col. [[Héctor Andrés Negroni]], the men of the 65th Infantry were awarded the following military decorations:&lt;ref name=&quot;HMPR&quot;/&gt;

According to the 4th Report of the Director of Selective Service of 1948, a total of 51,438 Puerto Ricans served in the Armed Forces during World War II, however the Department of Defense in its report titled &quot;Number of Puerto Ricans serving in the U.S. Armed Forces during National Emergencies&quot; stated that the total of Puerto Ricans who served was 65,034 and from that total 2,560 were listed as wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoD&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately, the exact total amount of Puerto Ricans who served in World War II in other units, besides those of Puerto Rico, cannot be determined because the military categorized Hispanics under the same heading as whites. The only racial groups to have separate stats kept were African-Americans and [[Asian American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18|url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/WWII/minst.htm

== Revolt against the United States ==
During the mid-1940s, various pro-independence groups, such as the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]], which believed in gaining the island's independence through the electoral process, and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which believed in the concept of armed revolution, existed in Puerto Rico. On October 30, 1950, the nationalists, under the leadership of Dr. [[Pedro Albizu Campos]] staged uprisings in the towns of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], Mayagüez, [[Naranjito, Puerto Rico|Naranjito]], Arecibo, [[Utuado]] ([[Utuado Uprising]]), San Juan ([[San Juan Nationalist revolt]]) and [[Jayuya]].
[[File:Troops in Jayuya.gif|left|300px|thumb|The National Guard, commanded by the [[Puerto Rico Adjutant General]]  Major General [[Luis R. Esteves]] and under the orders of Gov. [[Luis Muñoz Marín]], occupy Jayuya]]
The most notable of these occurred in Jayuya in what became known as ''El Grito de Jayuya'' ([[Jayuya Uprising]]). Nationalist leader [[Blanca Canales]] led the armed nationalists into the town and attacked the police station. A small battle with the police occurred; one officer was killed and three others were wounded before the rest dropped their weapons and surrendered. The nationalists cut the telephone lines and burned the post office. Canales led the group into the town square where the illegal light blue version of the [[Puerto Rican Flag]] was raised (it was against the law to carry a Puerto Rican Flag from 1898 to 1952.) In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was held by the nationalists for three days.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nylatinojournal.com/home/puerto_rico_x/history/puerto_rico_s_october_revolution.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 25, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826152927/http://nylatinojournal.com/home/puerto_rico_x/history/puerto_rico_s_october_revolution.html |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States declared [[martial law]] in Puerto Rico and sent the Puerto Rico National Guard to attack Jayuya. The town was attacked by U.S. [[bomber]] planes and ground [[artillery]]. Even though part of the town was destroyed, news of this military action was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. It was called an incident between Puerto Ricans. The top leaders of the nationalist party, including Albizu Campos and Blanca Canales, were arrested and sent to jail to serve long prison terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRJ&quot;/&gt;

[[Griselio Torresola]], Albizu Campos's bodyguard, was in the United States at the time of the Jayuya Uprising. Torresola and fellow nationalist [[Oscar Collazo]], were to assassinate President [[Harry S. Truman]]. On November 1, 1950, they attacked the [[Blair House]] where Torresola and a policeman, [[Leslie Coffelt]], lost their lives. Oscar Collazo was arrested and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by President Truman and he eventually received a presidential pardon.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRJ&quot;/&gt;

== Cold War (1947–91) ==
After World War II a [[geopolitical]], [[ideological]], and [[economic]] struggle emerged between the United States and the Soviet Union which included their respective allies. This struggle was popularly named the [[Cold War]] because open hostilities never occurred between the main parties involved. The so-called &quot;war&quot; involved a nuclear and conventional weapons arms race, networks of military alliances, economic warfare and trade embargoes, propaganda, espionage, and proxy wars. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 was the most important direct confrontation. The [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War]] were among the major civil wars polarized along Cold War lines.

===Puerto Rico Air National Guard===
Colonel Mihiel Gilormini, was named base commander to the 198th Fighter Squadron in Puerto Rico. Gilormini and Colonel Alberto A. Nido, together with Lieutenant Colonel Jose Antonio Muñiz, played an instrumental role in the creation of the [[Puerto Rico Air National Guard]] on November 23, 1947. The Puerto Rico Air National Guard is a part of the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/156aw.htm |title=156th Airlift Wing [156th AW&amp;#93; |website=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Gilormini and Nido were eventually promoted to Brigadier General and served as commanders of PRANG.  In 1963, the Air National Guard Base, at the San Juan International airport in Puerto Rico, was renamed &quot;Muñiz Air National Guard Base&quot; in honor of Lt. Col. Jose Antonio Muñiz who perished in July 4, 1960 when his [[F-86]] crashed during take off during the 4th of July festivities in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAB&quot;/&gt;

=== The USS ''Cochino'' incident ===
[[File:US 65th Infantry Regiment.Painting.Korean War.Bayonet charge against Chinese division.jpg|thumb|right|1992 painting depicting the Puerto Rican 65th Infantry Regiment's [[bayonet]] charge against a Chinese division during the Korean War.]]
The {{USS|Cochino|SS-345}} was a [[Gato-class submarine]] under the command of [[Rafael Celestino Benítez]]. On August 12, 1949, the ''Cochino'', along with the {{USS|Tusk|SS-426}}, departed from the harbor of [[Portsmouth]], England. Both diesel submarines were supposed to be on a cold-water training mission, however, according to ''Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage'',&lt;ref&gt;''Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage'', (Public Affairs, 1998) by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, with Annette Lawrence Drew, ISBN 0-06-103004-X&lt;/ref&gt; the submarines were part of an American intelligence operation. They had snorkels that allowed them to spend long periods underwater, largely invisible to an enemy, and they carried electronic gear designed to detect far-off radio signals. The mission of the ''Cochino'' and the ''Tusk'' was to eavesdrop on communications that revealed the testing of submarine-launched Soviet missiles that might soon carry [[nuclear warheads]]. Thus, making this the first American undersea spy missions of the cold war.

The mission was cut short when one the ''Cochino''{{'}}s 4,000-pound batteries caught fire. Commander Benitez directed the firefighting, trying both to save the ship and his crew from the toxic gases. The crew members of the ''Tusk'' rescued all except one ''Cochino'' crew member and convinced Commander Benitez, who was the last man on the ''Cochino'', to board the ''Tusk''. The ''Cochino'' sank off the coast of Norway two minutes after Benitez's departure. Benitez retired as a Rear Admiral from the Navy in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mishalov.com/Benitez.html

=== The Korean War ===
[[File:Company c.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Company &quot;C&quot; of the 65th Infantry on patrol]]
Sixty-one thousand Puerto Ricans served in the Korean War, including 18,000 Puerto Ricans who enlisted in the [[continental United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1980&quot;/&gt; Puerto Ricans distinguished themselves as part of the 65th Infantry Regiment receiving many awards and recognitions; however, they were also involved in the largest court martial of the Korean War.

On August 26, 1950, the 65th Infantry departed from Puerto Rico and arrived in Pusan, Korea on September 23, 1950. It was during the long sea voyage that the 65th Infantry was nicknamed the &quot;Borinqueneers&quot;. The name is a combination of the words &quot;Borinquen&quot; (the Taíno name for Puerto Rico) and &quot;Buccaneers&quot;. The men of the 65th were the first infantrymen to meet the enemy on the battle fields of Korea. Among the hardships suffered by the Puerto Ricans was the lack of warm clothing during the cold, harsh winters. The enemy made many attempts to encircle the Regiment, but each time they failed because of the many casualties inflicted by the 65th. On December 1950, U.S. Marines found themselves at the Chosin Reservoir area. In June 1951, The 65th was part of a task force which enabled the Marines to withdraw from the Hauack-on Reservoir. When the Marines were encircled by the [[Chinese Communist]] troops close to the Sino-Korean border, the 65th rushed to their defense. As a consequence, the Marines were able to return safely to their ships.&lt;ref name=Valerosos/&gt;

Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was the Operation &quot;Killer&quot; of January 1951, becoming the first Regiment to cross the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. On April 1951, the Regiment participated in the Uijonber Corridor drives and on June 1951, the 65th was the third Regiment to cross the Han Ton River. Master Sergeant [[Juan E. Negrón]] will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously on March 18, 2014, for his courageous actions while serving as a member of Company L, 65th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division during combat operations against an armed enemy in Kalma-Eri, Korea on April 28, 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;utsandiego.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/feb/21/medal-of-honor-recipients-obama/ |title=Obama to award Medal of Honor to 24 Army veterans &amp;#124; SanDiegoUnionTribune.com |website=Utsandiego.com |date=2014-02-21 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 65th was the Regiment that took and held Cherwon and they were also instrumental in breaking the [[Iron Triangle (Korea)|Iron Triangle]] of Hill 717 on July 1951. On November 1951, the Regiment fought off an attack by two Regimental size enemy units, with success. Colonel Juan César Cordero Dávila was named commander of 65th Infantry on February 8, 1952, thus becoming one of the highest-ranking ethnic officers in the Army. On July 3, 1952, the Regiment defended the MLR for 47 days and saw action at Cognac, King and Queen with successful attacks on Chinese positions. On October the Regiment also saw action in the Cherwon Sector and on Iron Horse, Hill 391, whose lower part was called &quot;Jackson Heights&quot;. On September 1952, the 65th Infantry was holding on to a hill known as &quot;Outpost Kelly&quot;. Chinese Communist forces that had joined the North Koreans overran the hill in what became known as the Battle for Outpost Kelly. Twice the 65th Regiment was overwhelmed by Chinese artillery and driven off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mervino.com/window/IBB/map65th.html |title=Outpost Kelly |accessdate=October 10, 2006 |author= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1953, the 2nd [[Battalion]] conducted a series of successful raids on Hill 412 and in November, the Regiment successfully counterattacked enemy units in the Numsong Valley and held their positions until the truce signing between all parts involved.

==== Mass court-martial ====
Col. Cordero Dávila was relieved of his command by Col. Chester B. DeGavre, a West Point graduate and a &quot;continental&quot; officer from the mainland United States and the officer staff of the 65th was replaced with non-Hispanic officers. DeGavre ordered that the unit stop calling itself the Borinqueneers, cut their special rations of rice and beans, ordered the men to shave off their mustaches and had one of them wear signs that read &quot;I am a coward&quot;. It is believed that as a result of this humiliation, combat exhaustion, and the language barrier where factors that influenced some of the men of Company L of the 65th in their refusal to continue to fight.

In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass [[court martial]] of the Korean War. The [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Robert T. Stevens]] moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though the men who were court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n22/NewGenFights65th-en.html |title=New Generation Fights For 65th |newspaper=Puerto Rico Herald |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Army report released in 2001 blamed the breakdown of the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.ausa.org/webpub/DeptArmyMagazine.nsf/byid/CCRN-6CCRYR &quot;From Glory to Disaster and Back&quot;] ''Army Magazine''; September 1, 2001], Retrieved February 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post Korean War ===
The 65th Infantry was credited with battle participation in nine campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;The campaigns in which the 65th infantry participated were the [[United Nations|UN]] Defense-1950, UN Offense-1950, CCF Intervention-1950, First UN Counterattack Offensive-1951, UN and CCF Spring Offensive-1951, UN Summer-Fall Offensive-1951, 2nd Korean Winter 1951–52, Korean Summer-Fall-1952 and 3rd Korean Winter-1952-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the distinctions awarded to the members of the 65th were a Medal of Honor, 10 Distinguished Service Crosses, 256 [[Silver Star]]s and 595 [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Stars]]. According to ''El Nuevo Día'' newspaper, May 30, 2004, a total of 756 Puerto Ricans lost their lives in Korea and a total of 3,630 men were wounded, from all four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. More than half of these were from the 65th Infantry (This is without including non-Puerto Ricans). The 65th Infantry returned to Puerto Rico and was deactivated in 1956. However, Major General [[Juan César Cordero Dávila]], [[Puerto Rico Adjutant General|Puerto Rico's Adjutant General]] (1958–65), persuaded the Department of the Army to transfer the 65th Infantry from the regular Army to the Puerto Rican National Guard. This was the only unit ever transferred from active component Army to the Army Guard.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

=== Operation El Dorado Canyon ===
On April 14, 1986, in response to acts of terrorism sponsored by [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]—in particular, the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|Berlin disco bombing]] of April 6—and against the backdrop of heightened tension and clashes between the Libyan and U.S. Navies over Libya's disputed territorial water claims in the [[Gulf of Sidra]], the United States launched a surprise attack on key facilities in [[Tripoli]] and other parts of Libya. The attack was code-named [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].

With the acquiescence of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]], 24 U.S. Air Force [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111F]] fighter-bombers took off from U.S. air bases in England. Attacking in the pre-dawn hours of April 15, their main objectives were 22 airfields, terrorist training camps, and other military installations. Captain [[Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci]] was one of the pilots who participated in the Libyan air raid. His F-111 was shot down over the disputed Gulf of Sidra off the Libyan coast. Ribas-Dominicci and his weapons systems officer, Captain [[Paul F. Lorence]], were the only U.S. casualties. Al-Qaddafi, who was also personally targeted, escaped harm, but his daughter was killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Libyan state sponsored terrorism: What did Operation El Dorado Canyon accomplish? by Gregory L.

In 1990, 1,700 Puerto Rican National Guardsmen were among the 20,000 [[Hispanic]]s deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm as part of the Gulf War. Four Puerto Ricans lost their lives, including Captain [[Manuel Rivera, Jr.]] of the Marine Corps, a Puerto Rican from the [[South Bronx]], who on January 22, 1991 became the first Marine, and therefore the first Hispanic, to be killed in [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]].

During this era Haydee Javier Kimmich, from [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico]], was the highest-ranking Hispanic female in the Navy when she was promoted to the rank of Capatin. The naval rank of Captain is the equivalent of Colonel in the other US armed forces. Kimmich was assigned as the Chief of Orthopedics at the Navy Medical Center in Bethesda and reorganized their Reservist Department during [[Operation Desert Storm]].

[[Operation Restore Hope]] was an American [[Operation (military)|military operation]] with the support of the United Nations that was formed to deliver [[humanitarian aid]] and restore order to the African nation of [[Somalia]], which was suffering from a severe famine, anarchy, and domination by a number of [[warlord]]s following the collapse of [[Siad Barre]]'s [[Marxism|Marxist]] government and the outbreak of the [[Somalian Civil War]]. On January 30, 1993, Private First Class [[Domingo Arroyo, Jr.]], a Marine from Puerto Rico, became the first of the 44 American soldiers killed during the operation. He was ambushed in [[Mogadishu]], the capital of Somalia, by Somali warlords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:S17FE3-94:/ |title=PFC Domingo Arroyo Jr |accessdate=October 17, 2006 |author= |date=February 17, 1993 |work= |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2001, [[United Airlines Flight 93]] was hijacked by four members of [[al-Qaeda]] as part of the September 11 attacks. The hijackers' specific target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel [[Marc H. Sasseville]] and Lieutenant [[Heather Penney]] Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, there was only one way to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Durante |first=Thomas |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035704/9-11-anniversary-Heather-Penneys-suicide-mission-United-93.html |title=9/11 anniversary: Heather Penney's would-be 'suicide' mission to take down United 93 &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-09-10 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Puerto Ricans have participated in the military campaigns of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], in what the United States and its allies refer to as the [[War on Terror]]. Among those that have perished during the Irag Operation are the first three Puerto Rican women to die in a foreign combat zone. They are Specialist Frances M. Vega, Specialist Lizbeth Robles and Specialist Aleina Ramirez Gonzalez. On November 2, 2003, Specialist [[Frances M. Vega]] became the first female Puerto Rican soldier born in the United States to die in a war zone. A ground-to-air missile fired by insurgents in [[Fallujah]] hit the [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] transport helicopter Vega was in; she was one of 16 soldiers who lost their lives in the crash that followed. On March 1, 2005, Specialist [[Lizbeth Robles]] became the first female Puerto Rican soldier born on the island to die in Iraq when her Humvee was involved in an accident. On July 10, 2007, Captain [[María Inés Ortiz]], who was assigned to a hospital in an area known as the &quot;[[Green Zone]]&quot; in [[Baghdad]], Iraq, became the first Puerto Rican nurse to die in combat and the first Army nurse to die in the Iraq War after the area came under a heavy mortar attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite news| accessdate=2007-07-13
