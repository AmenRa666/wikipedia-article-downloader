The [[United States military]] formerly excluded gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians from service, but no longer does.  Transgender people have also been allowed to openly serve since June 30, 2016.&lt;ref name=transgenderend&gt;{{cite news|title=TMilitary lifts transgender ban s|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article86902072.html|agency=McClatchy|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the [[United States Congress]] passed and President [[Bill Clinton]] signed a law instituting the policy commonly referred to as &quot;[[Don't ask, don't tell]]&quot; (DADT) which allowed gay, lesbian, and bisexual people to serve as long as they did not reveal their sexual orientation. Although there were isolated instances in which service personnel met with limited success through lawsuits, efforts to end the ban on openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people serving either legislatively or through the courts initially proved unsuccessful.

In 2010, two federal courts ruled the ban on openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual service personnel unconstitutional and on July 6, 2011, a federal appeals court suspended the DADT policy. In December 2010, The House and Senate passed and President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]] and, under its provisions, restrictions on service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual personnel ended as of September 20, 2011.

== Lesbian, gay, and bisexual American military service ==

=== History ===

==== Early years ====
To train the new American Army in the latest military drills and tactics, General George Washington brought in  [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] (1730–94), who had been an officer on the German General staff. Von Steuben escaped Germany where he was threatened with prosecution for homosexuality.  He joined Washington's army at Valley Forge in February 1778 accompanied by two young aides. Steuben became an American general, and a senior advisor to Washington. Despite rumors about his parties, there never was an investigation of Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History ; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&amp;pg=PA1007|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

The first evidence of antipathy to homosexuals serving in the United States military dates from March 11, 1778, when Lieutenant [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin]] was drummed out of the [[Continental Army]] following his conviction at [[court-martial]] on charges of sodomy and perjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Randy Shilts|title=Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOAmL6JPCE0C&amp;pg=PA11|year=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1910s–1940s ====
The U.S. military discharged soldiers for homosexual acts throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century even in the absence of any explicit prohibition of sodomy. The [[Articles of War#United States of America]] of 1916, implemented on March 1, 1917, included Article 93 stating that any person subject to military law who committed &quot;assault with intent to commit sodomy&quot; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref name=&quot;usni&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/dont-ask-dont-tell/timeline |title=Key Dates in US Policy on Gay Men and Women in the United States Military |publisher=usni.org |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was modified on June 4, 1920, to make the act of sodomy itself a crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;usni&quot; /&gt; The change went into effect on February 4, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004163647/http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html|title=HyperWar: The Articles of War, Approved June 4, 1920|archivedate=October 4, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first express prohibition of homosexuality or homosexual conduct in the armed forces of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/USA0103.pdf United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

The several branches of the U.S. lacked a unified policy on service by homosexuals for most of their history. Before 1949, each tended to charge personnel caught engaging in homosexual conduct with sodomy, court-martial them, and issue them a dishonorable discharge. In 1940, psychiatrists [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] and [[Winfred Overholser]] formulated guidelines for psychiatric screening for military inductees. Both believed homosexuals should not be inducted, and neither proposed excluding all homosexuals from military service. Despite their recommendations, other psychiatrists and military officials made homosexuality a key component of the screening apparatus they recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Kaiser, ''The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1997), pp. ??&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|United States Army Surgeon General's]] office issued a circular in 1941 that for the first time classified &quot;homosexual proclivities&quot; as disqualifying inductees from military service. The [[United States Navy]] and the Selective Service adopted similar exclusionary policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Women's Army Corps]] adopted a similar policy in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

With the mass mobilization and deployment of troops for operations in World War II, it became impractical to convene court-martial boards for homosexual conduct offenses. Commanders instead issued [[blue discharge]]s – a form of administrative [[military discharge]] – to homosexual personnel. The blue discharge, which was also issued disproportionately to [[African American]]s, was neither honorable nor dishonorable. However, blue discharge holders faced difficulties in civilian life because the blue discharge carried with it a negative association. The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] denied blue-discharge veterans the benefits of the [[G.I. Bill]] as a general policy.&lt;ref name = berube230&gt;Bérubé, 230&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, a policy directive ordered that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, [[Section 8 (military)|section 8]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 142–3&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, staff sergeant [[Allen Irvin Bernstein]], who was arrested in January 1944 by [[military police]] after a failed pickup attempt with another soldier, was confined in a psychiatric ward at [[Fort Lee, Virginia|Camp Lee, Virginia]], and discharged within a month.  He subsequently appealed the discharge decision, attaching a copy of his 140-page defense of homosexuality, ''Millions of Queers (Our Homo America)'', which, however, was ignored and remained forgotten and unpublished until rediscovered in 2010 by a researcher in the [[National Library of Medicine]].  Denied all veterans benefits, Bernstein continued to refile appeals with the Army until, 37 years later, the Army accepted his appeal and retroactively converted his blue discharge to an honorable discharge in 1981.&lt;ref name=outintro&gt;{{cite web|title=1940 Defense of Homosexuality: 'Millions of Queers (Our Homo America)':  Introduction|url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/1940-defense/intro-bernstein|website=outhistory.org|publisher=OutHistory|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue discharges were discontinued in May 1947 and replaced with two new headings, &quot;general&quot; and &quot;undesirable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 242&lt;/ref&gt; A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions though distinct from an &quot;honorable discharge.&quot; An undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable, yet distinct from a &quot;dishonorable discharge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Army also changed its regulations to ensure that homosexuals would not qualify for general discharges.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, a servicemember found to be homosexual but who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service received an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct were dishonorably discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Homosexuals in Uniform| work = [[Newsweek]] | date = 1947-06-09 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bjeJCGF5OiUC&amp;pg=PA163&amp; | accessdate = 2009-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, four honorably discharged gay veterans formed the [[Veterans Benevolent Association]], the first such organization.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, 110&lt;/ref&gt; It was primarily social in nature and its membership peaked at 100. The group disbanded in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;Katz, 635&lt;/ref&gt; and several of its members later formed the New York chapter of [[homophile]] advocacy group [[One, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Standard policy, 1949–1993 ====
In October 1949, the newly consolidated [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] standardized anti-homosexual regulations across all branches of the military: &quot;Homosexual personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed legislation on May 6, 1950, creating the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], which became effective on May 31, 1951. It established a single justice system for the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Truman Signs Code of Service Justice|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=May 7, 1950| newspaper=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30916FD385B177B93C5A9178ED85F448585F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining an offender as &quot;any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usni&quot; /&gt;

The success of the armed forces in pre-screening self-identified gay and bisexual people from the 1940s through 1981 remains in dispute; during the [[Vietnam War]], some men pretended to be gay in order to avoid the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kusch|first=Frank|title=All American Boys: Draft Dodgers in Canada from the Vietnam War|year=2001|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MnNYvkmBnoC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant number of gay and bisexual men and women did manage to pass through the screening process and serve in the military, some with special distinction.

For example, in the 1950s, the Navy medical doctor [[Thomas Anthony Dooley III|Tom Dooley]] received national fame for his anti-Communist and humanitarian efforts in Vietnam. He was forced to resign in March 1956 when found to have participated in homosexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Shilts, ''Conduct Unbecoming: Gays &amp; Lesbians in the U.S. Military Vietnam to the Persian Gulf'' (NY: St. Martin's Press, 1993), 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy conducted the first official study on sexual orientation and the Navy regulations and rules. In 1957, the [[Crittenden Report]] found that gay-identified people were no more likely to be a security risk than heterosexual-identified people, but nevertheless recommended that homosexuals be excluded from service because &quot;Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Terry, ''An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), 347&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco politician and gay rights campaigner [[Harvey Milk]] served in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He served aboard the submarine rescue ship USS Kittiwake (ASR-13) as a diving officer, later transferring to Naval Station, San Diego to serve as a diving instructor. In 1955, he was discharged from the Navy at the rank of lieutenant, junior grade, though whether his homosexuality was an issue in his discharge is doubted by researchers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Milk said numerous times that he was [[dishonorably discharged]] and claimed it was because he was gay, but [[Randy Shilts]] was skeptical of this claim, stating: &quot;The Harvey Milk of this era was no political activist, and according to available evidence, he played the more typical balancing act between discretion and his sex drive.&quot; (p. 16) Scholar Karen Foss confirms his discharge from the Navy had no connection to his sexuality and states, &quot;While exaggeration is a frequent campaign tactic, in Milk's case such embellishments served to demonstrate his willingness to be part of the political system while also maintain his distance from it.&quot; (See Foss, Karen. &quot;The Logic of Folly in the Political Campaigns of Harvey Milk&quot;, in Queer Words, Queer Images, Jeffrey Ringer, ed. (1994), New York University Press. ISBN 0-8147-7441-5, p. 21.)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, a gay servicemember who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service generally received a general discharge, while those found to have engaged in homosexual conduct more often received undesirable discharges.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Gay servicemembers received a disproportionate percentage of undesirable discharges issued.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, beginning with [[Leonard Matlovich]], who was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, several high-profile court challenges to the military's regulations on homosexuality occurred, with little success, and when such successes did occur it was when the plaintiff had been open about his homosexuality from the beginning or due to the existence of the &quot;queen for a day&quot; rule, which stated that if a service-member was caught having sex with a person of the same gender they could avoid being discharged if the &quot;member did not have a propensity of intent to engage in homosexual acts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GayTV&quot;&gt;The &quot;Queen For a Day Rule&quot; stated that if a service-member was caught having sex with a person of the same gender they could avoid being discharged if  the &quot;member did not have a propensity of intent to engage in homosexual acts.&quot;  {{cite book | title=Gay TV and Straight America | publisher=Rutgers University Press | author=Becker, Ron | year=2006 | location=Piscataway, New Jersey | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1981, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] issued a new regulation on homosexuality that was designed to ensure withstanding a court challenge by developing uniform and clearly defined regulations and justifications that made homosexual status, whether self-applied or by the military, and conduct grounds for discharge (DOD Directive 1332.14 (Enlisted Administrative Separations), January 1981):

{{quote|Homosexuality is incompatible with military service. The presence in the military environment of persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who, by their statements, demonstrate a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission. The presence of such members adversely affects the ability of the armed forces to maintain discipline, good order, and morale; to foster mutual trust and confidence among service members; to ensure the integrity of the system of rank and command; to facilitate assignment and worldwide deployment of service members who frequently must live and work in close conditions affording minimal privacy; to recruit and retain members of the armed forces; to maintain the public acceptability of military service; and to prevent breaches of security.}}

The directive justified the policy and removed the &quot;queen for a day&quot; rule that had prompted some courts to rule against the armed forces. However, the intent of the policy had also been to treat homosexuality as being akin to a disability discharge and thus ensure that anyone found engaging in homosexual activity and/or identifying as gay, would be separated with an honorable discharge. The DOD policy has since withstood most court challenges, although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has refused to weigh in on the constitutionality of the policy, preferring to allow lower courts and the [[United States Congress]] to settle the matter.

In the 1980s, many of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidates expressed an interest in changing the regulations concerning homosexuality in the armed forces, and, as American social mores changed, public opinion began to express more sympathy with gay people in armed forces, at least to the extent that investigations into a serviceman or -woman's sexual behaviour and/or orientation were seen as a witch-hunt. &quot;Gays in the military&quot; became a political issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 Presidential campaign]], when Clinton, the Democratic candidate, promised to lift the military's ban on homosexual and bisexual people.

In 1992, the United States General Accounting Office published a report entitled ''Defense Force Management: DOD's Policy on Homosexuality'', that outlined the DOD policy on homosexuality and the reasons for it. The report also included excerpts from a previously unpublished 1988 Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center study on homosexuality that made similar conclusions as the 1957 Crittenden Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Defense Force Management: DOD's Policy on Homosexuality |author=United States General Accounting Office |date=June 1992|id=GAO/NSIAD-92-98 |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d33t10/146980.pdf|accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LGBT military personnel sought to overturn the military's ban on service by homosexuals. Among the earliest were [[Leonard Matlovich]], who fought to remain in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] after [[coming out]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Sexes: The Sergeant v. the Air Force | newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = 1975-09-08 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917785,00.html| accessdate = 2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perry Watkins]], who was drafted in 1967 despite disclosing his homosexuality on his induction papers.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; District Court judge [[Gerhard Gesell]] ordered Matlovich's reinstatement in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than return Matlovich to duty, the Air Force offered him a cash settlement of $160,000, which Matlovich accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Army|Army]] tried to discharge Watkins several times, until the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ordered his reinstatement in 1989 and the [[United States Supreme Court]] refused to hear the case. The appellate court, however, did not rule the military policy unconstitutional in Watkins's case. Rather, it decided that simple equity mandated that the Army could not discharge Watkins for homosexuality when it knew of his sexual orientation all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court |litigants = Watkins v.

At the height of the push to rescind the ban before DADT, [[Miriam Ben-Shalom]] joined with other discharged personnel to form the [[Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Veterans of America]].

==== Don't ask, don't tell, 1993–2011 ====
{{Main article|Don't ask, don't tell}}

[[File:USarmydefineshomosexuality.jpg|thumb|upright|Image from a U.S. Army training manual, 2001, regarding homosexuality]]

[[Don't ask, don't tell]] (DADT) is the common term for the policy restricting the United States military from efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those that are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service.

Following the implementation of DADT, the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]] was formed to protect the rights of active duty personnel. Other organizations include [[Servicemembers United]] which formed in 2005 by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Servicemembers United: History | publisher = Servicemembers United | url = http://servicemembersunited.org/?page_id=32 | accessdate = 2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and groups associated with West Point ([[Knights Out]]) and the Naval Academy ([[USNA Out]]).

Service members discharged under DADT continued to seek redress through the courts without success. Courts often cited the Supreme Court's 1986 decision in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', which upheld the constitutionality of state [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]]. After the Supreme Court reversed ''Bowers'' in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which banned all acts of [[sodomy]]. In both ''United States v. Stirewalt'' and ''[[United States v. Marcum]]'', the court found Article 125 constitutional, but ruled that the &quot;conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,&quot;&lt;ref name = stirewalt&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm U.S. v. Stirewalt, September 29, 2004], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but also said that despite the application of ''Lawrence'' to the military, Article 125 could still be upheld in cases where there are &quot;factors unique to the military environment&quot; that would place the conduct &quot;outside any protected liberty interest recognized in ''Lawrence''&quot;,&lt;ref name=marcum&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/02-0944.htm U.S. v. Marcum, August 23, 2004], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; such as fraternization, public sexual behavior, or anything that would adversely affect good order and discipline. Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under the ''Lawrence'' in ''United States v. Meno''&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Meno ARMY 20000733&lt;/ref&gt; and ''United States v. Bullock''.&lt;ref&gt;SodomyLaws.org: [http://www.sodomylaws.org/usa/military/milnews052.htm US v. Bullock (2004)], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of reviewing the end of DADT, the Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review Working Group recommended repealing or amending Article 125 to eliminate any ban on consensual sodomy between adults.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense: [http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_dadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130%28secure-hires%29.pdf &quot;Report of the Comprehensive Review of the Issues Associated with a Repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell',&quot; November 30, 2010], accessed January 30, 2012; [[:File:DADT Defense Department report.pdf|comprehensive report]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major legal challenges to the DADT policy include ''[[Witt v. Department of the Air Force]]'' and ''[[Log Cabin Republicans v. United States]]''. The first ended in a negotiated settlement, but only after the lesbian plaintiff whom the Air Force tried to discharge won retirement with full benefits in 2011 as DADT neared its end. In the second, Federal Judge [[Virginia A. Phillips]] ordered the military on October 12, 2010, to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation, or other proceeding that began under DADT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11528661 | work=BBC News | title=US ban on openly gay military personnel suspended | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of appeals and stays of her ordered followed in the fall of 2010 just as Congressional attempts to repeal DADT took shape.

An attempt to repeal DADT began in May 2010 when the House approved an amendment to the 2011 [[National Defense Authorization Act]]. It failed in September, when Sen. [[John McCain]] led a successful filibuster against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/09/21/senate.defense.bill/index.html?iref=allsearch |publisher=CNN | title=Senate halts 'don't ask, don't tell' repeal | date=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, after a second Senate filibuster, Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Susan Collins]] introduced the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. It passed the House of Representatives on December 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll638.xml Final vote results for roll call 638]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111hr2965|title=H.R.2965 – 111th Congress (2009–2010): Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 – Congress.gov – Library of Congress|publisher=|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate on December 18 by a vote of 65-31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/12/dadt.html|title=Senate Takes Historic Step, Repeals ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ [Updated]|author=Mike Vilensky|work=Daily Intelligencer|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barack Obama signed the bill on December 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/22/AR2010122201888.html|title=Obama signs DADT repeal before big, emotional crowd|publisher=|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2010, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to suspend proceedings in the ''Log Cabin'' case. Instead, on July 6, 2011, that court, citing progress made by military officials in preparing for an end to DADT, ordered the government to cease enforcement of DADT while dismantling the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mears|first1=Bill|title=Appeals court suspends enforcement of 'don't ask, don't tell' policy|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/07/06/dadt.ruling/|accessdate=July 6, 2014|work=CNN|date=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeal was not immediate. The Department of Defense first reviewed its policies and guidelines and drafted implementation regulations. Then the President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified that new regulations had been drafted and that the new regulations would not damage military cohesion and readiness. That certification triggered a 60-day waiting period at the end of which, on September 20, 2011, DADT expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/its-official-dont-ask-dont-tell-is-history/2011/03/03/gIQAq93yfK_blog.html|title=It's official: `Don’t ask don’t tell’ is history|author=Greg Sargent|date=September 19, 2011|work=Washington Post|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Service academies =====
A research report that appeared in the journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'' at the end of 2011 said that military academy cadets opposed allowing homosexuals to serve openly in greater percentages than participants in ROTC did, and that both groups opposed such service to a greater degree than their civilian counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Morten G. Ender, et al., &quot;Civilian, ROTC, and Military Academy Undergraduate Attitudes toward Homosexuals in the U.S. Military: A Research Note,&quot; ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'', January 2012, vol. 38, 164-172, [http://afs.sagepub.com/content/38/1/164.abstract abstract available online], accessed February 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some news outlets viewed this as a negative reaction to the repeal of DADT earlier in the year,&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/03/service-academy-gay-cadets_n_1070094.html Max J.

===== Benefits =====
Despite the end of DADT on September 20, 2011, the same-sex spouses of gay and lesbian service members were not treated on a par with the different-sex spouses of military service members because of restrictions imposed by Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) and certain federal statutes that contain definitions of marriage that exclude same-sex couples. Same-sex spouses are denied death benefits, identification cards, base access, access to repatriation ceremonies, and other entitlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.military.com/news/article/military-gay-couples-wont-enjoy-benefits.html|title = Military Homosexual Couples Won’t Enjoy Benefits|date = July 18, 2011|publisher = Military.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Association of Bragg Officers Spouses (ABOS) denied membership to Ashley Broadway, the female spouse of a female Army officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Robbie|title=Army Wife Says She Was Excluded as a Lesbian |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/us/north-carolina-army-wife-says-she-was-excluded-as-a-lesbian.html|accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the weeks of press coverage that ensued, Fort Bragg's commander said he lacked authority over the private organization while the [[U.S. Marines]] announced that clubs conducting business on base must admit same-sex spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fantz|first=Ashley|title=Marine Corps to spouse clubs: Allow same-sex members or you don't operate on base|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/10/marine-corps-to-spouse-clubs-allow-same-sex-members-or-you-dont-operate-on-base/ |accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ABOS offered Broadway a &quot;special guest membership&quot;, which she declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Bill|title=Army spouses club offers 'special guest membership' for same-sex wife|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/18/16576893-army-spouses-club-offers-special-guest-membership-for-same-sex-wife|accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=NBC News |date=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, ''Military Spouse'' magazine named Broadway Fort Bragg's 2013 &quot;Military Spouse of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex wife is Fort Bragg spouse of year |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/01/25/Same-sex-wife-is-Fort-Bragg-spouse-of-year/UPI-81931359160449/ |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |newspaper=UPI|date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, ABOS invited Broadway to join and announced that its membership was open to &quot;any Spouse of an active duty commissioned or warrant Officer with a valid marriage certificate from any state or district in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officer’s lesbian wife can join spouses club|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2013/01/ap-army-lesbian-invited-bragg-spouses-club-012613/|accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=Army Times|date=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2013, Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] announced the Department's extension of certain military &quot;additional benefits&quot; to same-sex spouses which are not explicitly prohibited under the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], in addition to &quot;member-designated benefits&quot; which were already available to same-sex spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=15809|title = Statement from Secretary of Defense Leon E.

===== Discharge pay =====
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought suit in 2010 on behalf of servicemembers discharged for homosexuality who received only half the standard separation pay upon discharge. All were discharged under the DADT policy, but the ACLU said that the practice ante-dated the adoption of DADT.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/discharged-gay-service-members-sue-over-half-pay-policy/ James Dao, &quot;Discharged Gay Service Members Sue Over 'Half-Pay' Policy,&quot; September 22, 2011], accessed February 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government in ''[[Collins v. United States]]'' that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under &quot;[[Don't ask, don't tell]]&quot; since November 10, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner |first=Chris |title=Servicemembers Kicked Out Under Military's Gay Ban Since '04 To Receive Full Separation Pay|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/servicemembers-kicked-out-under-militarys-gay-ban|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=Buzz Feed|date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muñoz|first=Carlo|title='Don't ask, don't tell' dischargees to receive full back pay from DOD|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/275971-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-receive-full-back-pay#ixzz2HKWfWEDG|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Veterans associations =====
The [[American Military Partner Association]] (AMPA) was formed in 2009 to enable the LGBT partners of servicemembers and veterans to provide support in areas where the military fails to and to advocate on behalf of equal treatment of those in same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swarns|first=Rachel L.|title=Military Rules Leave Gay Spouses Out in Cold|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/gay-spouses-face-a-fight-for-acceptance-in-the-military.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Less than honorable discharges =====
Following the end of DADT, approximately 114,000 servicemembers who had been separated from military service since WW II under the categories &quot;other than honorable discharge&quot;, &quot;general discharge&quot;, or &quot;dishonorable discharge&quot; became eligible to have their discharges amended. Those without an honorable discharge are often excluded from veterans benefits like health care and tuition assistance, and the lack of an honorable discharge can create a hurdle to employment in the civilian sector as well. The Armed Forces established procedures for processing such requests through the Military Department Board for Correction of Military/Naval Records or the Military Department's Discharge Review Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Pentagon sees no need for gay discharged troops bill|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/02/10/pentagon-sees-need-gay-discharged-troops-bill/|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Washington Blade |date=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, after advocates for gay and lesbian veterans complained about the process, Representatives [[Mark Pocan]] (D-Wisconsin) and [[Charles Rangel]] (D-New York) introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in the House of Representatives to codify the process and reduce inconsistencies. Pocan said the legislation represented the same policies as those currently in place, but was needed because &quot;without having it in law, it could change at some date in the future with a different administration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=Lawmakers Push Fix For Ousted Gay Service Members’ Discharge Records|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/lawmakers-announce-bill-to-ensure-ousted-gay-servicemembers |accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Buzz Feed|date=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bar Association endorsed the legislation on November 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=Deborah Cassens|title=Vets discharged under Don't Ask, Don't Tell should be allowed to seek change in records, ABA says|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/vets_discharged_under_dont_ask_dont_tell_should_be_allowed_to_change_milita/|accessdate=February 10, 2014 |newspaper=ABA Journal|date=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 2014, Senator [[Brian Schatz]] (D-Hawaii) introduced the same legislation in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Schatz introduces bill for discharged gay veterans |url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/01/30/schatz-introduces-bill-discharged-gay-veterans/|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After ''Windsor'' ====
On June 26, 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' that the statute under which the U.S. military was withholding benefits from servicemembers in same-sex marriages, Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], was unconstitutional. Secretary of Defense [[Chuck Hagel]] stated: &quot;The Department of Defense welcomes the Supreme Court’s decision [and] will immediately begin the process of implementing the Supreme Court's decision in consultation with the Department of Justice and other executive branch agencies. The Department of Defense intends to make the same benefits available to all military spouses—regardless of sexual orientation—as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCloskey|first1=Megan|last2=Carroll|first2=Chris|title=Supreme Court strikes down DOMA; Hagel promises benefits ASAP|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/supreme-court-strikes-down-doma-hagel-promises-benefits-asap-1.227671|accessdate=June 27, 2013|newspaper=Stars &amp; Stripes|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2013, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced that it would provide spousal and family benefits to servicemembers in same-sex marriages on the same terms as it does to those in different-sex marriages. The benefits, which include health care coverage, housing allowances, military ID cards, and survivor benefits, can be claimed retroactive to June 26, the day of the ''Windsor'' decision. A same-sex marriage must be documented by a marriage certificate that establishes that the marriage was valid where it was celebrated. The DoD also announced that servicemembers who need to travel to a jurisdiction that allows them to marry will be afforded up to 7 days leave to do so, up to 10 days if they are stationed outside the U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Chuck Hagel]] said: &quot;This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department, and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married&quot;. The DoD set September 3 as its target date for implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Huetteman |first=Emmarie |title=Gay Spouses of Members of Military Get Benefits|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/us/politics/gay-spouses-of-members-of-military-get-benefits.html |accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna |title=Pentagon extends military spouse benefits to same-sex married couples|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2013/0814/Pentagon-extends-military-spouse-benefits-to-same-sex-married-couples|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the servicemember's commander determines the amount of leave to be granted based on the servicemember's unit responsibilities and specific situation. Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council, a longtime opponent of the end of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;, wrote that &quot;It could well be argued that the new policy actively discriminates against opposite-sex couples, who receive no special leave for their weddings&quot;. DoD officials said the leave was for travel and cited Texas or South Korea as locations that pose problems for same-sex couples seeking to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shane III|first=Leo|title=DOD leave for same-sex marriage criticized|url=http://www.stripes.com/dod-leave-for-same-sex-marriage-criticized-1.236004|accessdate=August 19, 2013|newspaper=Stars and Stripes|date=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy does not apply to those in same-sex legal relationships other than marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships.

The Veterans Administration has cited other federal statutes that define &quot;spouse&quot; and ‘surviving spouse’ The status of benefits for veterans in same-sex relationships was the subject of ongoing lawsuits.

===== Discrimination =====
In 2015, Defense Secretary [[Ash Carter]] added sexual orientation to the list of nondiscrimination protections under the military's equal opportunity program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/06/09/military-equal-opportunity-sexual-orientation-transgender/28740207/|title=Sexual orientation added to military's non-discrimination policy|author=Patricia Kime, Staff writer|date=June 9, 2015|work=Army Times|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Lawsuits and veterans benefits =====
Several [[McLaughlin v. Panetta|lawsuits on behalf of same-sex military spouses]] had challenged the constitutionality of DOMA and statutes that define &quot;spouse&quot; and &quot;surviving spouse&quot; as &quot;a person of the opposite sex&quot; when determining eligibility for veterans benefits.

On October 27, 2011, the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]] (SLDN) had brought suit in federal court in Massachusetts on behalf of several military servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. The benefits at issue in that case, ''McLaughlin v. Panetta'', included medical and dental benefits, basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/news/?ak=6798 |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=SLDN Takes Aim at DOMA |date=November 23, 2011 |work=[[Metro Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, the federal judge hearing the case asked the parties to explain by July 18 why the logic that found ''Windsor'' unconstitutional did not apply to that definition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=House Republicans Face Decision On Fighting Gay Veterans’ Spousal Benefits|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/house-republicans-face-decision-on-fighting-gay-veterans-spo|accessdate=July 17, 2013|newspaper=BuzzFeed|date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, the [[Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group]] BLAG, which had defended DOMA and the restrictive definitions of marriage acknowledged that &quot;[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality&quot; but took no position on the other statutes except to say that the constitutionality of those definitions &quot;remains open&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner |first=Chris |title=House Republicans Cave On Marriage Fight |url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/house-republicans-cave-on-marriage-fight|accessdate=July 18, 2013|newspaper=BuzzFeed |date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Justice told the court that it would not defend those statutes. BLAG asked to withdraw from a similar lawsuit in federal court in California, ''Cooper-Harris v. United States'', on July 22.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/155453235/2-12-cv-00887-136 Application to Withdraw], accessed July 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, Judge [[Consuelo Bland Marshall|Consuelo Marshall]] ruled that the provisions of Title 38 of the U.S. Code that define ''spouse'' so as to exclude those in same-sex marriages are unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BuzzFeed|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=August 29, 2013 |url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-judge-strikes-down-law-barring-same-sex-couples-from|title=Federal Judge Strikes Down Law Barring Same-Sex Couples from Receiving Veterans Benefits|last=Geidner|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar case involving only veterans benefits, ''[[Cardona v. Shinseki]]'', is awaiting resolution in the [[United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims|Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]], after being suspended while awaiting the resolution of ''Windsor''. On July 19, 2013, [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) Secretary [[Eric Shinseki]] noted in a letter about the case that the statutory definitions of &quot;spouse&quot; and &quot;surviving spouse&quot; had yet to be invalidated by a court. The VA is waiting for guidance from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] on how ''Windsor'' applies to those statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phaneuf|first=Keith M.|title=Blumenthal, Norwich woman battle for equal benefits for veterans|url=http://www.ctmirror.org/story/2013/08/15/blumenthal-norwich-woman-battle-equal-benefits-veterans|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=Connecticut Mirror|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if that statutory limitation is invalidated, the VA's rules for establishing the validity of a marriage may restrict benefits to same-sex married couples residing in a jurisdiction that recognizes their marriage or who resided in the jurisdiction where they married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Serwer|first=Adam|title=DOMA is dead but gay vets remain in limbo|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/06/28/doma-is-dead-but-for-veterans-doma-lives-on/|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=MSNBC|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Respect for Marriage Act]] sponsored by Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] and Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] eliminates the question of residence by establishing a rule for federal purposes that a marriage is valid if it was valid where celebrated. They reintroduced the legislation the day ''Windsor'' was decided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ring|first=Trudy |title=Finishing the Job: DOMA Repeal Bill Reintroduced|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2013/06/26/finishing-job-doma-repeal-bill-reintroduced |accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=The Advocate|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]], as required by law, notified Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]] that the Obama administration had determined that it should not enforce the federal statutes that define ''spouse'' in a way that excludes same-sex spouses. He cited ''Windsor'' and the decision in ''Cooper-Harris'' the previous week as well as BLAG's withdrawal from litigation challenging the statutes in question. Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted that the question of the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Feds won't enforce law barring gay veterans from spousal benefits |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/09/04/doj-wont-enforce-law-barring-gay-veterans-spousal-benefits/ |accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2013, VA home loan benefits were extended to include service members in same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Le|first=Tommy|title=VA Loan For Same Sex Marriages|url=https://www.vahomeloancenters.org/va-loan-for-same-sex-marriages/ |accessdate=January 14, 2014|website=VA Home Loan Centers|date=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that it would only provide benefits to the same-sex spouses of veterans who either (1) married in the state in which they resided or (2) live in a state that recognizes their marriage when they apply for benefits. On August 18, the American Military Partner Association filed an appeal in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] challenging the VA's interpretation of federal law. Their brief cited ''Windsor'' and many federal court decisions since ''Windsor'' that have held denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional. It said the VA's policy ruling &quot;imports into federal law unconstitutional state definitions of marital status.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denniston |first1=Lye |title=Test of gap in veterans' benefits for same-sex marriages|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/08/test-of-gap-in-veterans-benefits-for-same-sex-marriages/|accessdate=August 22, 2014|work=SCOTUSblog|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Veterans-benefits-appeal-CAFC.pdf AMPA v.

===== National Guard =====
In several states that do not recognize same-sex marriages–notably Oklahoma, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas–National Guard officials initially refused to comply with Department of Defense directives to allow the same-sex spouses National Guard members in their states to enroll in federal benefit programs, instead requiring such members to travel to federal facilities to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel Jr.|first=Richard A.|title=Texas and 5 Other States Resist Processing Benefits for Gay Couples|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/texas-and-5-other-states-resist-processing-benefits-for-gay-couples.html|accessdate=December 8, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guard officials in Oklahoma enrolled some same-sex couples until September 5, 2013, when Governor [[Mary Fallin]] ordered an end to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma Gov.

On November 6, Fallin announced that Oklahoma guard members could have benefits requests for same-sex spouses processed at federal facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Silas|title=Oklahoma National Guard will process same-sex spouse benefits at a few federal facilities|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-national-guard-will-process-same-sex-spouse-benefits-at-a-few-federal-facilities/article/3901831|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=NewsOK|date=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, after DoD officials objected to that plan, Fallin ordered that all married couples would be required to have benefits requests processed at those facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Russell |title=Fallin: OK will no longer process benefits for National Guard couples|url=http://www.krmg.com/news/news/local/fallin-ok-will-no-longer-process-benefits-national/nbydX/|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=KRMG|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, Texas agreed to conform with DoD policy stating that state workers would be considered federal workers while enrolling same-sex couples for benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Ann|last2=Campoy|first2=Ana|title=Texas National Guard to begin letting same-sex couples register for benefits|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/11/27/texas-national-guard-to-begin-letting-same-sex-couples-register-for-benefits/ |accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=Fox News|date=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana adopted a policy like that of Texas on December 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Louisiana Nat'l Guard latest to process same-sex benefits|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/03/louisiana-natl-guard-latest-process-sex-benefits/|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Georgia Nat'l Guard to process same-sex benefits |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/09/georgia-natl-guard-process-sex-benefits/|accessdate=December 9, 2013 |newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mississippi the same week.&lt;ref name=all&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=All nat'l guards now compliant with Hagel edict on same-sex benefits|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/13/natl-guards-now-compliant-hagel-edict-sex-benefits/|accessdate=December 12, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, Secretary of Defense Hagel announced that all state national guard units were in compliance, though three of them–Oklahoma, Florida and South Carolina–allowed all guard members to apply for ID cards and benefits only at federal facilities. Some other states chose to place their state employees on federal status for the sake of processing such applications.&lt;ref name=all /&gt;

===== Sodomy =====
{{Main article|Section 839(a) of title 10 United States Code §&amp;nbsp;925 – Article 125.}}

The [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014]] enacted in December 2013 repealed the ban on consensual sodomy found in Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Defense bill contains gay-related provisions |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/20/defense-bill-contains-gay-related-provisions/|accessdate=December 21, 2019|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Healthcare Needs and Provisions for Gay and Lesbian Military Veterans in the United States ====

In 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is providing healthcare services for approximately one million gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|title=Communication between VA Providers and Sexual and Gender Minority Veterans: A Pilot Study|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=2014|doi=10.1037/a0035840 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans do not feel that they have adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well-being.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

===== Concerns from Gay and Lesbian Veterans =====
In their article, Sherman and her coauthors explain that in the past, most of the gay and lesbian veterans were uncomfortable in disclosing their sexual orientations or identities because they were afraid that this information could lead to their discharge from the military.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; With the repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, gays and lesbians are assured that their sexual orientations will not be used against them.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Nonetheless, because of their previous experiences in the military, many gay and lesbian veterans are still worried that this information may jeopardize their future careers and prospects.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Because of societal stereotypes and stigmas, they are also worried that they may be denied medical service, lose their benefits, or receive inferior services.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

Sherman and her coauthors conducted a study on the communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, and some of them are having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

Similarly, another 2011 report states that lesbians often decline routine medical tests.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Gay men are not as likely to seek medical treatment when compared with heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Hence, some medical conditions and disorders may not be treated in a timely manner.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

However, Sherman and her co-authors point out that the missing patient-centered communication can affect the quality of medical treatment.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Sexual orientation and identity can have implications for the physical and mental health of the patient.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

According to the authors, since sexual identity and orientation is a contentious issue, many healthcare workers are not comfortable in approaching this topic.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; But if the physicians initiate the conversation, it is more likely that the veterans will provide this information.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Based on their data, if the gay and lesbian veterans can divulge information about their personal medical history, values, and preferences, they may experience higher levels of patient satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; It is also more likely for them to receive appropriate preventive care and diagnostic screenings for their unique health risks, such as sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Moreover, comprehensive medical records can provide a multitude of information useful not only for medical treatments but also for evaluations, such as the fitness of the veterans for duty.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

===== Response from Veterans’ Health Administration =====
To alleviate the concerns from the gay and lesbian veterans about discrimination and to address healthcare disparities, in 2013, the VHA has introduced some policy changes.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; For instance, the VHA has established the Office of Health Equity to oversee the gay and lesbian healthcare needs and to reduce the inequities in their healthcare provisions.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharpe|title=Ensuring Appropriate Care for LGBT Veterans in the Veterans Health Administration.|journal=Hastings Center Report|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These new developments mark a milestone in expanding the role of the government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; Another policy is to redefine the meaning of “family” and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will have a better understanding of the psychological and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt;

Since the gay and lesbian veterans are not asked to disclose information about their sexual orientation on medical forms,&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; In response to these concerns, the Institute of Medicine suggested that patients disclose such information on medical records. The information will be confidential and only used to assess health.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; The VHA is striving to prevent this information from being shared with other organizations.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; Sharpe and Uchendu suggest the option of incorporating open-ended questions to encourage the veterans to supply additional written information.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt;

Healthcare services for gay and lesbian veterans are not adequate.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; The main purpose of the first steps of the VHA is to create a cordial culture and a welcoming environment for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; Fostering a better relationship among the healthcare providers and the patients and encouraging the patients to provide more personal information can improve healthcare outcomes for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt;

== Transgender service ==

=== History ===
In the early 1960s, [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] regulations banned openly [[transgender]] persons from military service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|title=Transgender Vets Want Military Access|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/transgender-vets-want-military-access.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 1, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925095848/http://www.military.com/news/article/transgender-vets-want-military-access.html|archivedate=September 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3720592/transgender-military-service-ban/|title=Transgender Military Service Ban Ending?|author=Eliza Gray|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2016, [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Ash Carter]] announced that the ban on transgender people from openly serving in the US military had been lifted and that the [[United States Department of Defense]] was undergoing a twelve-month transition period to satisfy the needs of transgender soldiers.&lt;ref name=transgenderend /&gt;

Transgender veterans have formed organizations such as the [[Transgender American Veterans Association]] (TAVA), which advocates for transgender individuals to be allowed to serve in the military,&lt;ref name=leff&gt;{{cite news|last=Leff |first=Lisa |title=Transgender vets want military access for own|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/01/ap-transgender-veterans-011111/|accessdate=January 20, 2013|newspaper=Army Times|date=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of DADT did not change matters for transgender persons, though transgender activists like Navy veteran [[Autumn Sandeen]] played significant roles in protesting DADT. Even if discharged under mental health regulations, transgender veterans can receive medical benefits at Veterans Administration hospitals, though VA hospitals cannot perform sex-reassignment surgeries.&lt;ref name=leff /&gt; Some have returned to active service after transitioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transgender Vets Want Military Access|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/transgender-vets-want-military-access.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2014, an advisory panel organized by the [[Palm Center]], a research institute based at [[San Francisco State University]], released a report that found no compelling medical reason for placing limitations on military service by transgender persons. It said DoD rules that prevented enlistment or continued service by transgender person were based on outmoded and untenable ideas about their psychological and physical fitness, and it dismissed concerns about the costs of medical care. It said the DoD's policies could be changed by an executive order. The panel was headed by former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders]] and Rear Adm. Alan Steinman, a former chief health and safety director for the Coast Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leff|first=Lisa|title=Transgender Troop Ban Faces Scrutiny|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/apnewsbreak-transgender-troop-ban-faces-scrutiny-22893840|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Snow|first=Justin|title=Independent commission finds no justification for military's transgender ban|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2014/03/independent-commission-finds-no-justification-for.html |accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=Metro Weekly|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We determined not only that there is no compelling medical reason for the ban, but also that the ban itself is an expensive, damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active, Guard and reserve components. Medical regulations requiring the discharge of transgender personnel are inconsistent with how the military regulates all other medical and psychological conditions, and transgender-related conditions appear to be the only gender-related conditions that require discharge irrespective of fitness for duty.}}

In May 2014, Secretary of Defense Hagel said his department's policy with respect to transgender service should be reviewed &quot;continually&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Benjamin|title=Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel: Military’s Transgender Policy ‘Continually Should Be Reviewed’|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/secretary-of-defense-chuck-hagel-militarys-transgender-policy-continually-should-be-reviewed/|accessdate=July 6, 2014|work=ABC News|date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[American Medical Association]] approved a resolution against the ban on openly transgender troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/transmilitary/2015/06/08/americas-doctors-transgender-military-ban-pointless|title=America's Doctors: Transgender Military Ban is Pointless|author=Dawn Ennis|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, the Army issued a directive that protected transgender soldiers from being dismissed by mid-level officers by requiring the decision for discharge to be made by the service's top civilian for personnel matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/03/06/army-eases-ban-on-transgender-soldiers/24529333/|title=Army eases ban on transgender soldiers|author=Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY|date=March 6, 2015|work=Army Times|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, the Air Force stated that for enlisted airmen, there was no outright grounds for discharge for anyone with [[gender dysphoria]] or who identified as transgender, and that a person would only be subject to eviction from the Air Force if his or her condition interfered with their potential deployment or performance on active duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/us-air-force-transgender-no-discharge|title=US air force: being transgender is no longer grounds for discharge|author=Ed Pilkington|work=the Guardian|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus signed a memorandum directed to the chief of Naval operations and commandant of the Marine Corps stating: “Effective immediately, separations initiated under the provisions of the reference for service members with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria, who identify themselves as transgender, or who have taken steps to externalize the condition, must be forwarded to the assistant secretary of the Navy (manpower and reserve affairs) for decision.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20150702_Navy_Marines_policy_ends_directive_to_discharge_transgender_members.html?id=311530031 |title=Hawaii Local Breaking News and Headlines – Navy, Marines end directive to discharge transgender members – Hawaii News – Honolulu Star-Advertiser |publisher=Staradvertiser.com |date=2015-06-26 |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2015, Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the creation of a Pentagon working group &quot;to study over the next six months the policy and readiness implications of welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Locker and Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/13/carter-defense-transgender-policy/30104403/ |title=Pentagon moves closer to allowing transgender troops to serve |publisher=Usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that all decisions to dismiss troops with [[gender dysphoria]] would be handled by the Pentagon's acting under secretary of Defense for personnel and readiness (Brad Carson).&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday1&quot; /&gt;

Still later in 2015, in November, &quot;Transgender Members of the U.S. Military&quot; were listed as one of the nine runners-up for ''[[The Advocate]]'''s Person of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Advocate.com Editors |url=http://www.advocate.com/people/2015/11/05/person-year-finalists |title=Person of the Year: The Finalists |publisher=Advocate.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on June 30, 2016 that, beginning on that date, otherwise qualified United States service members could not any longer be discharged, denied reenlistment, involuntarily separated, or denied continuation of service because of being transgender.&lt;ref name=&quot;transgenderend&quot;/&gt; It was also announced at the same time that, starting in 2017, under [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] regulations transgender persons may serve in the United States military so long as they have adapted to their identified gender for at least an 18-month period.&lt;ref name=transgenderend /&gt;  However, it was later confirmed by Associated Press journalist Lolita C. Baldor that the policy went into effect at an earlier date on October 1, 2016 and that three weeks later, 10 soldiers in the United States Army became the first to openly petition for a sex change.&lt;ref name=abctrans&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/transgender-soldiers-seek-formal-army-recognition-43035644&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 26, the Department of Defense ruled that any form of discrimination among transgender youth was incompatible with an Executive Order issued by then US President Bill Clinton in the year 2000 which directed federal agencies that conduct educational activities to comply with [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] and issued a memorandum ordering military youth schools to immediately comply with the 2000 Executive Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jowers|first1=Karen|title=DoD: Protections for transgender youth apply to all facilities, programs|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/dod-protections-for-transgender-youth-apply-to-all-facilities-programs|website=Military Times|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 16, the United States Air Force published its official guidance policy for transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.airforcetimes.com/articles/air-force-releases-guidance-on-transgender-airmen&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States Army also followed suite and issued its guidance policy for transgender individuals on November 1.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.armytimes.com/articles/army-outlines-path-to-transition-for-transgender-soldiers&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 7, the Navy released its official guidance policy for transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripes.com/news/navy-announces-guidance-for-sailors-seeking-gender-transition-1.438154&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 10, 2016, 55 sailors in the United States Navy and 48 airmen in the United States Air Force publicly petitioned for their respective gender confirmation surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/10/more-than-100-troops-seeking-transgender-care/93566330/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===

According to 2014, estimates from the [[Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy]], that despite the ban on military service, about 21.4 percent of the total transgender population in the US is estimated to have served in the military, according to the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Transgender-Military-Service-May-2014.pdf Transgender Military Service in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorials for LGBT veterans ==
In the year 2000, a memorial to all veterans and to [[LGBT]] veterans was dedicated in the national veterans cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgbtvm.org/ |title=National LGBT Veterans Memorial |publisher=Nlgbtvm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the first American memorial specifically honoring LGBT veterans was dedicated in [[Desert Memorial Park]], Cathedral City, California.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 2015, the first American federally-approved monument honoring LGBT veterans was dedicated at the [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7chicago.com/society/monument-to-lgbt-veterans-dedicated-in-elwood/741262/ |title=Monument to LGBT veterans dedicated in Elwood |publisher=abc7chicago.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
