The '''''MV Al Salmy 4''''' is a former [[train ferry]], converted to [[RO-RO]]/Passenger ferry, owned by SAMC. 

Built in 1974 as the ''Chartres'' for [[SNCF]]. Chartered by the French Government during the [[First Gulf War]], it was eventually sold by SNCF in 1993 to Agapitos Express Ferries and renamed ''Express Santorini''. Sold to Minoan Flying Dolphins in 1999, and then transferred to [[Hellenic Seaways]] in 2005, the ship operated charters from 2007 to 2014 within the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] archipelago of the [[Azores]] with ''Atlântico Line''. She was sold to Portucalence Shipping in 2014, and then was sold to [[United Arab Emirates|Emirati]] company SAMC in 2016, taking the name ''Al Salmy 4''.

==History==
===Chartres===
[[File:Express santorini 4.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The arrival of the Flying Dolphins' ''Express Santorini'' at the port of Vila do Porto]]

[[File:Velas - Fähr- und Fischereihafen, Autofähre.JPG|thumb|235px|left|Rounding the dock at the port of Velas (Azores)]]
The ''Chartres'' was one of three Sealink multipurpose train ferries built in the early 1970s, complimenting the [[British Rail]]'s ''Vortigern'' and the ''Saint Eloi'' of Sealink UK's French subsidiary ALA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chartres&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hhvferry.com/Chartres2.html |title=Chartres Sealink/SNCF |publisher=HHVFerry |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chartres'' was built in [[Nantes]] by Dubigeon-Normandie S.A. (later Chantiers Dubigeon S.A.) in 1974 for SNCF (French Railways) operations between Dover-Dunkerque and passenger service between Dover-Calais.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; Although the three ships were similar, there were small structural differences that included size of windows and design of funnels.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt;

The ''Chartres'' was delivered to SNCF on 9 January 1974 and visited [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], Calais and [[Dunkerque]] on 15 February. ''Chartres'' entered service on the Dunkerque-[[Dover]] route on 25 February. She was christened at Calais on 6 March 1973.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt;

Launched on 12 September 1973, the Chartres briefly operated train ferry operations and was quickly transferred to Dieppe. From 1973, Chartres operated as a car and passenger ferry on the Boulogne-Dover and Calais-Dover routes during the summer; and as a train ferry on the Dunkerque-Dover route during the winter. In 1975-76, she was operated on the [[Dieppe]]-[[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] routes between 1983 and 1990.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; 

It continued to service the English Channel until the summer of 1990, along the Dover-Calais route, on behalf of ALA from her berth at Dover's Western Docks.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; Sold to the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company|Isle of Man Steam Packet line]], it replaced the ''Saint Eloi'' (which had been rechristened the ''Channel Entente'').&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; In this role it operated cross-channel passenger service until the end of the 1993 season.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; Following the opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] train ferry service ceased from the Dover Western Docks and Nord pas-de-Calais ceased, and it began to operate passenger traffic.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; ''Chartres'' collided with the Calais [[pilot boat]] ''Louis Magniez'' in 1978.&lt;ref name=FoF/&gt;

''Chartres'' operated on the Dieppe - Newhaven route from 29 May 1982. She was placed into service on the Dunkerque - Dover route in 1986 and again in 1988. On 25 January 1990, ''Chartres'' collided with the breakwater at Dieppe and was severely damaged. She was repaired at [[Rouen]] and re-entered service on 3 June on the Calais - Dover route. Due to a blockade of Calais later that month, ''Chartres'' operated on the Boulogne - Dover route before spending the last week of June on the [[Zeebrugge]] - Dover route. In October, she was switched to the Boulogne - [[Folkestone]] route. ''Chartres'' was [[bareboat charter|chartered]] by the French Government in December for use as a [[troopship]] during the [[First Gulf War]]. She operated between [[Toulon]] and [[Yanbu]], Saudi Arabia until June 1991.&lt;ref name=FoF/&gt; On return from trooping duties, she was chartered by [[Société Anonyme de Gérance et d'Armement#Angleterre-Lorraine-Alsace Société Anonyme de Navigation|Angleterre-Lorraine-Alsace]], the French subsidiary of [[Sealink]].&lt;ref name=HHV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhvferry.com/Chartres2.html |title=CHARTRES |publisher=HHV |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter of 1991-92, she operated on the [[Dún Laoghaire]] - [[Holyhead]] route. In May 1993, she was placed in service on the Calais - Dover route, making her final voyages on 24 September.&lt;ref name=FoF/&gt;

===Express Santorini===
[[File:SMG PDL PontaDelgada bowSantorini02.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The bow of ''Express Santorini'' in the Portas do Mar]]
The vessel was acquired by Agapitos Express Ferries on 5 November 1993, of the growing Hellas Ferries corporation, and renamed the ''Express Santorini''.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; It departed from Calais for Piraeus on 21 December, where there was a minor change in the ships livery following the takeover.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; From 1994, she operated the Piraeus-[[Paros]]-[[Naxos]]-[[Santorini]] route. On 8 November 1999, ''Express Santorini'' was sold to Minoan Flying Dolphins and was operated under the management of [[Hellas Ferries]]. She operated on the Piraeus-Naxos-[[Ios (island)|Ios]]-Santorini route. 

But, in 2005 while operating in the Piraeus-Paros-Santorini archipelago, Hellas Ferries adopted the name Hellenic Seaways name, appearing in a revised blue hull colours.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt;

For technical reasons, in July 2006 it was laid-up in [[Drapetsona]], following a major engine failure in June.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt;

Beginning in the summer of 2007, the ''Express Santorini'' was chartered by Atlantico Line to operate in the Azores between the islands of Faial, Pico and Sao Jorge, until 30 September.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; Alternately, during the winter season, it continued to Piraeus where it operated local services.&lt;ref name=Chartres/&gt; Following a further period laid up at Drapetsona, ''Express Santorini'' was again chartered by Atlantico Line between June and September 2008; she was also chartered between May and October from 2009 to 2014.&lt;ref name=FoF/&gt; That year she was sold to Portucalence Shipping and remained in service in the Azores until the fall of 2016, when she was sold to [[United Arab Emirates|Emirati]] company SAMC, taking the name ''Al Salmy 4.''
