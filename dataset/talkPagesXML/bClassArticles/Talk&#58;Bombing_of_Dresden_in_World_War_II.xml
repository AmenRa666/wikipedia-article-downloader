== Counting dead ==

Counting casualties is a bit mean, in that reduces to numbers the personal tragedies involved, however, with 3'900 tons of bombs dropped on Dresden, the figure in article, of 22'000 to 25'000 victims, would yield around 6 victims per ton of bombs, that seems quite low for the densely populated, several stories buildings residential area Dresden was then, and continues being. The 135'000 overal casualties figure that David Irving proposed in his early 70s book: 'The destruction of Dresden', looks more realistic, but this historian was put in jail later in XX century, in Austria, under the accusation of: 'Holocaust denial', that even if it were an untrue accusation, I won't discuss this, would reduce the credibility of his writings. 135'000 (one hundred and thirty five thousand) may be the accurate balance of victims from the two days of 1945 Dresden bombings, that destroyed also the home where Richard Wagner lived, one of the composers loved by A Hitler, with the peculiar element that the piece favourite to A H was in its structure and general sound somehow close to the baroque work by the great British composer Henry Purcell. Regards, + Salut--[[User:Caula|Caula]] ([[User talk:Caula|talk]]) 20:38, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
:Irving's work on Dresden is not considered credible, nor are estimates of 100,000+; the death toll is generally put at 25,000 to 35,000. See the [https://www.hdot.org/evans/# Evans Report] on Irving's distortions regarding this issue (and others). Even ''without'' taking into account the issue of Holocaust denial, his work has still been heavily criticized. [[User:GeneralizationsAreBad|GAB]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:GeneralizationsAreBad|gab]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:47, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
::Casualties were limited by the well-practiced use of air raid shelters, and the high proportion of civilians was due to poor knowledge of local shelters by refugees (mostly former settlers of the recently occupied and then lost territories annexed from Poland and the USSR). The 20-22,000 was arrived by a double entry bookkeeping, of counting dead bodies against missing ration holders and was arrived at by both the Nazis (as per their internal reports) at the time, and much later by a group of historians who had little reason to fudge the numbers. All other estimates have good reasons for overestimating casualties and are therefore suspect.[[User:NiD.29|&amp;#32;- NiD.29]] ([[User talk:NiD.29|talk]]) 12:27, 10 October 2016 (UTC)

== Falsified figure? ==

As I understand it, the German medical authorities offered a figure of 260,000 dead and stated that others in the centre of the city were disintegrated. The figure of 20,000 referred to those victims who could be identified and named. A website of 2016 states a figure of 10,000 deaths. Such a figure would be a seventh of the deaths during the bombing of Hamburg - it is ludicrous.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/1.144.96.234|1.144.96.234]] ([[User talk:1.144.96.234#top|talk]]) 03:58, 11 October 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::The 22,000 refers to the total number of actual dead rather than being an estimate - the Germans had incredibly good records thanks to almost everyone being on rations. The death toll was relatively low because they had a very effective system for getting people under cover during air raids, and Dresden was at the limit of the RAF and USAAF's range, so the Germans had more than their usual amount of time to take cover. The majority of casualties were civilian refugees who had the least preparation and experience for doing so and they tried to use whatever cover they could find, which included the basements of buildings that were not adequately fireproofed. That Kurt Vonnegut survived on the surface (as a POW and hence of low priority for the Germans) should tell you something in that regard.[[User:NiD.29|&amp;#32;- NiD.29]] ([[User talk:NiD.29|talk]]) 16:08, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

== Blitz ==

The bombing of England extended beyond London. I (born 1947) grew up in a Liverpool street, about two miles from the docks, where three houses had been bombed. It was a slum area, so the houses were never rebuilt ([[User:Pamour|Pamour]] ([[User talk:Pamour|talk]]) 22:10, 19 October 2016 (UTC)).

== War crime / Claim==
{{hat|Clear consensus against the edit demonstrated. Discussion now Hijacked by suspicious I.P. activity. [[User:Irondome|Irondome]] ([[User talk:Irondome|talk]]) 20:02, 31 October 2016 (UTC)}}
Given the enduring controversy, the allegations that the raid was a war crime need to be included in the lede. ([[User:Dsklw|Dsklw]] ([[User talk:Dsklw|talk]]) 17:59, 30 October 2016 (UTC))
:I would suggest you would be better off expanding the existing sections dealing with this debate. If consensus indicates  it should be in the lede, it should be reworded in a [[WP:NPOV]] style.

::: A single sentence saying some think it was a war crime in the lead does not accurately reflect the body of the article.

::::::Please see [[Aerial bombardment and international law#International law up to 1945]]. Your assertion that it was &quot;widely regarded as a war crime under the international laws on aerial warfare at the time..&quot; is unsupported and incorrect. It was a defended city, which existing laws at the time made it a legitimate target for attack. It was also a major supplier of war-related components, despite the myth of it being an &quot;innocent&quot; target. The debate amongst historians continues, and your proposed edit is [[WP:UNDUE]].

First, everything in Germany was a defended target thanks to the Luftwaffe, second, Dresden was a major center of manufacture of a wide variety of war materiel, third, it was the centerpiece in the German defence against the advancing Russians as well as being one of the largest transportation hubs in Germany, and quotes taken out of context from years later when Churchill was senile hardly count as references.[[User:NiD.29|&amp;#32;- NiD.29]] ([[User talk:NiD.29|talk]]) 15:09, 31 October 2016 (UTC)
:The Luftwaffe no longer existed in 1945. Churchill wrote in February 1945 that Dresden was bombed only to terrorize the civilian population. ([[Special:Contributions/81.159.6.116|81.159.6.116]] ([[User talk:81.159.6.116|talk]]) 15:42, 31 October 2016 (UTC))

:::Indeed. [[User:Irondome|Irondome]] ([[User talk:Irondome|talk]]) 15:56, 31 October 2016 (UTC)
::::I don't think this requires discussion. Not even the arch-detractors (Grayling and his mob) have been able to show, beyond opinion, this was a war crime. In any case, international law permitted bombing of this kind or certainly didn't regard it as criminal. I also think the IP shows a lack of appreciation for how dangerous air operations were in 1945. Does he care to know how many Bomber Command crews lost their lives at the hands of this &quot;non-existent Luftwaffe&quot; in 1945? [[User:Dapi89|Dapi89]] ([[User talk:Dapi89|talk]]) 17:38, 31 October 2016 (UTC)
:::::Bomber Command crews were only terrorists like ISIS and al Queda. Churchill admitted in his secret note that the raid was only ordered to terrorize German civilians, and that the myths about Dresden being a military target were only used as a pretext for the terrorism.

Churchill's secret memo on 28 March 1945, in which he admitted Dresden was only bombed in order to spread terror among the civilian population, should be mentioned in the intro as it proves the city had no military significance, despite later claims.
