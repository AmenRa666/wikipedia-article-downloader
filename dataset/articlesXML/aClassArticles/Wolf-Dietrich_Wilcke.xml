'''Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke''' (11 March 1913&amp;nbsp;– 23 March 1944) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' pilot during World War II, a [[fighter ace]] credited with 162 enemy aircraft shot down in 732 combat missions. He claimed the  majority of his victories over the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and 25 over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], including four [[Heavy bomber|four-engined bombers]].

Born in [[Śrem|Schrimm]] in the [[Province of Posen]], Wilcke volunteered for military service in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' of the [[Third Reich]] in 1934.{{refn|From 1919, Germany's national defense force was known as the ''Reichswehr''. That name was dropped in favor of ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' on 16 March 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work= |title=Proklamation der Reichsregierung an das deutsche Volk bezüglich der Einführung der allgemeinen Wehrpflicht |trans_title=Proclamation of the German Government to the German people regarding the introduction of compulsory military service |url=http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/1935/allgemein-wehrpflicht-einfuehrung_prokl.html |language=German |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Initially serving in the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (Army), he transferred to the ''Luftwaffe'' (Air Force) in 1935. Following flight training, he was posted to ''Jagdgeschwader'' &quot;Richthofen&quot; (Fighter Wing &quot;Richthofen&quot;) in April 1936. After an assignment as fighter pilot instructor he volunteered for service with the [[Condor Legion]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in early 1939. After his return from Spain, he was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of the 7. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (7th squadron) of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing). Following the outbreak of World War II, he claimed his first aerial victory on 7 November 1939. On 18 May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]], he was shot down and taken [[prisoner of war]]. After the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice with France]], he returned from captivity and was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the III. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (3rd group) of JG&amp;nbsp;53 during the [[Battle of Britain]], claiming 10 victories over England.

Wilcke then fought in the aerial battles of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. There, after 25 aerial victories, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 6 August 1941. In September 1941, he relocated with his group to the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theater]], where he was able to claim further victories. At the end of May 1942, he was transferred to the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stab]]'' (headquarters unit) of [[Jagdgeschwader 3|''Jagdgeschwader'' 3]] (JG 3—3rd Fighter Wing) &quot;Udet&quot;, and that August he was appointed as its ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander). Following his 100th aerial victory on 6 September, he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]]. During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], on 17 December, he claimed his 150th aerial victory. On 23 December 1942, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]], his total now 155 aerial victories.

Subsequent to the presentation of the Swords to his Knight's Cross, he was officially banned from operational flying. Occasionally he still flew combat missions and on 23 March 1944, flying in [[defense of the Reich]], he claimed his 162nd and last aerial victory and was [[killed in action]] by [[United States Army Air Forces]] long-range [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighters near [[Schöppenstedt]], in Lower Saxony.

== Early life and career ==
Wilcke was born on 11 March 1913 at [[Śrem|Schrimm]] in the [[Province of Posen]], part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] at the time, now Śrem in the [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]], Poland. He was the son of a ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (captain) of ''Infanterie-Regiment'' 47 (47th Infantry Regiment), Hans Wilcke, who died of [[pneumonia]] when Wilcke was just four weeks of age. His mother, Hertha von Schuckmann, married again on 14 June 1919.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=70}} In 1931, Wilcke was arrested for attending a then-illegal [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstration]] of the [[Nazi Party]]. Although his loyalty to the Nazi cause is emphasized multiple times in his personal military files,{{sfn|Berger|1999|p=407}} according to biographers Prien and Stemmer, he was a firm opponent of the National Socialist regime; later in his career, for a time after taking command of III. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (3rd group) of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing),&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)|Organization of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; he had the [[Swastika]]s on his unit's aircraft painted over.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=27}} He volunteered for military service in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' after receiving his ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma). He joined ''Artillerie-Regiment'' 6 (6th Artillery Regiment) in [[Minden]] as a ''[[Fahnenjunker]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 April 1934. His [[legal guardian]] and stepfather, [[Friedrich von Scotti]], also served in this regiment.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=70}}

As a ''[[Fähnrich]]'' (officer candidate), Wilcke was posted to the ''[[Kriegsschule (Wehrmacht)|Kriegsschule]]'' (war school) in [[Dresden]] on 1 October 1934. On 1 November 1935, he was transferred to the newly emerging ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' holding the rank of ''[[Oberfähnrich]]'' (senior officer candidate). On 20 April 1936, while serving at the flight school in [[Perleberg]], he was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant). On 15 October he was transferred to ''Jagdgeschwader'' &quot;Richthofen&quot; (Fighter Wing &quot;Richthofen&quot;), also known as [[Jagdgeschwader 132|''Jagdgeschwader'' 132]] (JG 132—132nd Fighter Wing), named after the World War I fighter ace [[Manfred von Richthofen]] and forerunner of [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] (JG 2—2nd Fighter Wing) &quot;Richthofen&quot;.{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2005|p=14}} There he excelled as a pilot and showed exceptional leadership ability and was sent as fighter pilot instructor to the ''[[Jagdfliegerschule]]'' (fighter pilot school) in [[Werneuchen]] in the second half of 1937.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=71}}

In March 1939, Wilcke volunteered for service with the [[Condor Legion]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. For a few weeks, he flew with 1. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (1st squadron) of [[Jagdgruppe 88|''Jagdgruppe'' 88]] (J/88—88th Fighter Group) without claiming any aerial victories.{{sfn|Forsyth|2011|p=101}} He was awarded the [[Spanish Cross]] in Bronze with Swords for his service in Spain.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=33}} In Spain he became friends with [[Werner Mölders]] and when Mölders was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the newly created III. ''Gruppe'' of JG&amp;nbsp;53, he selected Wilcke as ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of the 7. ''Staffel'' (7th squadron) of JG&amp;nbsp;53.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=71}}

== World War II ==
World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. Wilcke, who at the time was still a member of 3. ''Staffel'' (3rd squadron) of JG&amp;nbsp;53, flew missions over Poland. He claimed his first aerial victory on 7 November 1939 over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] when he shot down an ''[[Armée de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force) [[Potez 630]], a twin-engined fighter, near [[Völklingen]] during the [[Phoney War]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|pp=51, 56}} For this achievement he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class on 25 November 1939.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=71}}

From 2–16 January 1940, Wilcke and other pilots from III. ''Gruppe'' went on a [[ski]] vacation to the [[Vorarlberg]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|pp=70–71}} On 11 March 1940, he shot down another Potez at an altitude of {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} near the &quot;[[Tripoint|three-nations-corner]]&quot; north of [[Metz]]. He claimed his third victory at 2:55&amp;nbsp;pm on 25 March. 7. ''Staffel'' engaged a flight of [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] at {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}. In the resulting aerial battle, Wilcke shot down one of the Moranes over [[Diedenhofen]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=75}}

=== Battle of France and Britain ===
The [[Battle of France]], the German invasion of France and the [[Low Countries]], began on 10 May 1940. On 18 May 1940, he engaged in aerial combat with eight French [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] fighter aircraft and was shot down west of [[Rethel]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|pp=104, 127}} His victor may have been ''[[sous lieutenant]]'' Camille Plubeau.{{sfn|Sutherland|Canwell|2011|p=143}} Wilcke [[Parachute|bailed out]] and was taken [[prisoner of war]]. Following the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice with France]], he and Mölders, who had also been a prisoner of war, returned to the unit on 30 June 1940.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=123}} Wilcke was promoted to ''Hauptmann'' the next day and again took command of 7. ''Staffel''. On 11 July 1940, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=71}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-337-0036-02A, Im Westen, Feldflugplatz mit Me 109.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] E-1's of JG&amp;nbsp;53, similar to those flown by Wilcke]]
On 13 August 1940, during the [[Battle of Britain]], Wilcke replaced ''Hauptmann'' Harro Harder as ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of the III. ''Gruppe''.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Harro Harder was the brother of [[Jürgen Harder]].&lt;/ref&gt; Harder had been last seen at 1:35&amp;nbsp;pm on 12 August and was reported as [[missing in action]] following combat east of the [[Isle of Wight]]. The day of his appointment, Wilcke almost lost his life as well, when he was forced to bail out after engine failure over the [[English Channel]]. He was rescued that night by a [[Dornier Do 18]] flying boat.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=140}} III. ''Gruppe'' flew a [[Escort fighter|bomber escort]] mission targeting [[London]] on 30 August. Wilcke destroyed a [[barrage balloon]] on the morning mission and claimed his fourth victory, a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] in the vicinity of [[Dover]] during his second mission of the day.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=149}} On 1 September 1940, on another bomber escort mission that started at 11:20&amp;nbsp;am, Wilcke claimed his fifth victory, a [[Hawker Hurricane]], south of London.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=150}} He claimed his sixth victory, probably a [[Fairey Swordfish]] biplane, on 11 September over the Channel between Dover and [[Calais]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=157}}

On 15 September 1940, III. ''Gruppe'' engaged 20 to 30 [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) fighters south of London. In the resulting combat, Wilcke claimed the destruction of his second Hurricane. Two days later, on a mission that began at 4:35&amp;nbsp;pm, Wilcke achieved his ninth victory, another Hurricane.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=160}} He claimed his tenth victory, again a Hurricane, on a mission targeting the London area that took off at 11:15&amp;nbsp;am on 20 September.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=163}} On the last day of September 1940, he claimed two more victories to bring his total to 12; the action took place during his second mission of the day, which began at 1:45 pm, escorting [[Dornier Do 17]]s to London.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=167}} In combat with RAF Spitfires, Wilcke claimed his 13th victory at 11:45 am on 10 October 1940, his final of the Battle of Britain.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=173}} In recognition of these achievements he was awarded the [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe]] ({{lang|de|''Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe''}}) on 1 April 1941.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=71}}

=== Operation Barbarossa ===
On 8 June 1941, the bulk of JG&amp;nbsp;53's  air elements moved via [[Jever]], in northern Germany, to [[Coleman Army Airfield|Mannheim-Sandhofen]]. There the aircraft were given a maintenance overhaul prior to moving east.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=252}} On 12 June, III. ''Gruppe'' was ordered to transfer to a forward airfield at [[Sobolewo, Suwałki County|Sobolewo]]. On 21 June, the ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of JG&amp;nbsp;53 and its ''Gruppenkommandeure'' were summoned to nearby [[Suwałki]], where ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' (field marshal) [[Albert Kesselring]] gave the final instructions for the upcoming attack. Wilcke briefed his pilots that evening.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=253}}

On 22 June, the ''Geschwader'' crossed into Soviet airspace in support of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union, which opened the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. III. ''Gruppe'' took off on its first mission at 3:20&amp;nbsp;am with the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Gruppenstab]]'' (headquarters unit) and 7. ''Staffel'' targeting Soviet airfields at [[Alytus]] and Oranji. Wilcke shot down three [[Polikarpov I-15]] [[biplane]] fighter aircraft.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=260}} The second mission of the day by III. ''Gruppe'' was a [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] escort mission to [[Grodno]] at 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, during which Wilcke claimed another victory.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=262}} He led another attack at 4:10&amp;nbsp;pm; while strafing airfields, he claimed his fifth aerial victory of the day, an &quot;[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]&quot; achievement, taking his total to 18.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=263}}

On 25 June 1941, JG&amp;nbsp;53 was relocated with III. ''Gruppe'' arriving at [[Vilnius]] at 8:30&amp;nbsp;am. The same day, Wilcke was slightly injured when he collided with another aircraft during [[takeoff]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=265}} He claimed his 19th victory on the evening of 30 June 1941, flying a [[combat air patrol]] into the [[Barysaw]] area.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=268}} Wilcke was ordered to form &quot;''Gefechtsverband Wilcke''&quot; (&quot;Battle Group Wilcke&quot;) on 1 July 1941. He commanded his III. ''Gruppe'' and II. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 52]] (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing) to counter-attack Soviet bombers.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=269}} On 9 July, Wilcke destroyed a [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] ground attack aircraft.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=274}} He claimed a victory on 25 July during fighter escort missions in the [[Vyazma]] area.{{sfn|Prien|1997|pp=285–286}} On 29 July 1941, III. ''Gruppe'' provided fighter cover for the German armored spearheads in the [[Dukhovshchina, Smolensk Oblast|Dukhovshchina]] area. During this mission, Wilcke claimed another victory. The next day, over the spearheads at [[Yartsevo, Smolensk Oblast|Yartsevo]]-[[Bely, Tver Oblast|Bely]], Wilcke shot down a [[Polikarpov I-180]] fighter.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=289}} He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 6 August 1941 for 25 victories. Both Wilcke and ''Leutnant'' [[Herbert Schramm]] were decorated by Kesselring on 9 August 1941.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=72}}{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=290}}

On 23 August 1941, the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] began its assault on the Soviet forces in the [[Velikiye Luki]] area. Wilcke claimed two aerial victories while supporting these operations.{{sfn|Prien|1997|pp=291–292}} III. ''Gruppe'' began returning to Germany in early October 1941. The air elements left the Soviet Union on 4 October, while the ground units were transported back by train to Mannheim on 13 October. Since 22 June 1941, III. ''Gruppe'' had claimed 769 aerial victories for the loss of 6 pilots killed, 7 missing in action, 2 captured and 12 wounded.{{sfn|Prien|1997|pp=299, 301}}

=== North Africa and Malta ===
After its return to Germany, III. ''Gruppe'' was deployed to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theater]]. The ground elements of III. ''Gruppe'' arrived in [[Catania]] in [[Sicily]] on 28 November 1941. Wilcke and his adjutant [[Jürgen Harder]] arrived on 2 December, with the rest of the ''Gruppe'' arriving the next day. On 6 December 1941, III. ''Gruppe'' was ordered to move to [[Timimi]] in [[Libya]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=327}} Wilcke claimed his 34th aerial victory on 11 December, during a fighter escort mission for [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers attacking [[Bir Hakeim]].{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=330}}

III. ''Gruppe'' relocated back to Sicily on 17 December 1941 for operations in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Siege of Malta]]. The island of [[Malta]] had a strategically important position in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. With the opening of a [[North African Campaign|new front in North Africa]] in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa. To counter this threat, the ''Luftwaffe'' and the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) conducted bombing raids to neutralize the RAF defenses and the ports. During the siege, Wilcke claimed four victories over RAF fighters in April–May 1942. He claimed his first victory during the siege, and 35th overall,  over a Spitfire fighter on 2 April 1942.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=364}} His 36th aerial victory on 22 April may have been Hurricane (Z4011) &quot;B&quot; of [[No. 185 Squadron RAF|No. 185 Squadron]] flown by [[Pilot Officer]] &quot;Sonny&quot; Ormrod, who was killed in the engagement.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1991|p=213}} On 12 May 1942, III. ''Gruppe'' destroyed nine Spitfires, among them one by Wilcke.{{sfn|Prien|1997|p=380}}

=== Wing commander of JG 3 ===
On 18 May 1942, Wilcke was transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 3|''Jagdgeschwader'' 3]] &quot;Udet&quot; (JG&amp;nbsp;3—3rd Fighter Wing), named after the World War I fighter ace [[Ernst Udet]]. Operating on the Eastern Front, Wilke became a ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of JG&amp;nbsp;3 &quot;Udet&quot; on 11 August, replacing ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) [[Günther Lützow]], who was posted to the staff of the ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' (General of Fighters) as [[Inspector of the Day Fighters]] on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=72}} Operating from the [[Chuhuiv|Chuguyev]] Airfield, JG&amp;nbsp; 3 &quot;Udet&quot; saw combat in the [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]] area, present-day Kharkiv, during the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]]. On 26 June 1942, JG&amp;nbsp; 3 &quot;Udet&quot; was assembled at [[Shchigry, Kursk Oblast|Schtschigry]] on the southern sector of the Eastern Front for the upcoming summer offensive, supporting the [[Wehrmacht]]'s advance towards [[Stalingrad]]. In the following months, JG&amp;nbsp; 3 &quot;Udet&quot; was based at airfields at [[Gorshechensky District|Gorshechnoye]], Olkhovatka, [[Millerovo, Millerovsky District, Rostov Oblast|Millerovo]], Nowy-Cholan, [[Frolovo]], Tuzov and [[Pitomnik Airfield|Pitomnik]].{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=12}}

On 13 June 1942, Wilcke claimed his first victory with JG&amp;nbsp;3 &quot;Udet&quot;, shooting down a [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3]] fighter for his 39th victory. He followed this with another LaGG-3 on 22 June, and a LaGG-3 and a [[Polikarpov R-5]] reconnaissance bomber on 24 June 1942.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=393}} On 3 July 1942, he claimed three [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston]] medium bombers, followed by two LaGG-3s and another Boston the next day. He became an &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; again on 6 July, shooting down a [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]], a LaGG-3, an R-5 and three Hurricanes. Three days later, he shot down two [[Ilyushin Il-2]] Sturmovik [[ground-attack]] aircraft and, on 10 July, four more Bostons. The next day, he claimed another R-5 and two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1]] fighters. On 12 July, he again claimed an R-5 and two LaGG-3s before he shot down another LaGG-3 on 18 July. On 24 July he was credited with a [[Polikarpov I-153]] biplane fighter and two days later two Hurricanes and two Pe-2s. On both 27 and 28 July he claimed victory over a LaGG-3, his last victories in July 1942.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=394}}

Wilcke's first victories in August 1942, a [[Sukhoi Su-2]] light bomber followed by two LaGG-3s, occurred on 5 and 6 August. On 9 August he filed a victory claim for an unknown aircraft type, bringing his &quot;score&quot; to 79 aerial victories. He took command of JG&amp;nbsp;3 &quot;Udet&quot; and achieved his first victory as ''Geschwaderkommodore'' on 12 August, again over an unknown type of aircraft. He claimed eight further victories of unknown types, two on 13 August, one on 17 August, three on 20 August, and two on 23 August. His first victory on 26 August was identified as a [[Yakovlev Yak-7]] fighter, the other two that day were again unknown types. Another series of unidentified aircraft shot down followed.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=394}} He claimed one aircraft destroyed on 28 August, one more on 30 August and four on 31 August, taking his total to 96 aerial victories by the end of August 1942.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|pp=394–395}} Wilcke claimed his next two victories on 3 September and two more on 6 September, all four of unknown types of aircraft.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=395}} This brought his total to 100 aerial victories. Wilcke was the 20th ''Luftwaffe'' pilot to achieve the century mark.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=244}} On 9 September 1942, he became the 122nd officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht honored with the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]].{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=72}}

=== Battle of Stalingrad ===
From 10–19 September 1942, Wilcke claimed another series of victories over aircraft of unknown type, which included one on 10 September, one on 12 September, four on 18 September and two on 19 September.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=395}} On 16 September 1942, the Soviets launched an offensive north of Stalingrad. Wilcke led about 40 serviceable German fighters against the Soviet [[8th Air Army|8 ''Vozdyshnaya Armiya'']] (8 VA—8th Air Army), [[16th Air Army|16 ''Vozdyshnaya Armiya'']] (16 VA—16th Air Army), and 102 ''Istrebitel'naya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya Protivo-Vozdushnaya Oborona'' (102 IAD PVO—Fighter Aviation Division of the Home Air Defense) over Stalingrad. At the time, Wilcke often flew with ''Hauptmann'' [[Walther Dahl]] as his wingman.{{sfn|Bergström|Dikov|Antipov|Sundin|2006|pp=153–154}} On 20 September 1942,  Wilcke shot down two LaGG-3s.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=395}} Two days later, he shot down six [[Yakovlev Yak-1]] fighters over Stalingrad, his third &quot;ace-in-day&quot; feat, taking his total to 116 aerial victories. It is possible that one of his opponents was ''[[Leytenant]]'' (Second Lieutenant) Nikolai Karnachyonok of 434 ''Istrebitel'nyy Aviatsionyy Polk'' (434 IAP—434th Fighter Aviation Regiment), who was killed in action that day and was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] made a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Bergström|Dikov|Antipov|Sundin|2006|p=163}}&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;IAP—Istrebitelny Aviatsionny Polk (Fighter Aviation Regiment—Истребительный Авиационный Полк)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Geschwaderstab'' (headquarters unit) was based at the Pitomnik Airfield from 23 September to 21 November 1942. There Wilcke directed fighter operations for the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. During the previous offensive towards Stalingrad, the ''Geschwaderstab'' of JG&amp;nbsp;3 &quot;Udet&quot; had claimed 137 victories, of which 97 victories were credited to Wilcke.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=12}} While based at Pitomnik, Wilcke claimed four victories on 24 September, one on 25 September, three on 28 September, four on 29 September, one on 3 October and two more on 24 October.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=395}} On 25 and 26 October he claimed one victory on each day and his final two while based at Pitomnik on 1 November 1942, taking his personal total to 135 victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=396}} For these achievements he received the [[German Cross]] in Gold, awarded on 3 November 1942.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=72}}

In the aftermath of the encirclement of the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] on 23 November 1942, the ''Geschwaderstab'' was moved to [[Morozovskaya]]-West, outside the Stalingrad pocket. Wilcke organized fighter escort missions for the transport aircraft delivering supplies for the 6th Army. Pressed by the advancing Soviet armored spearheads, Morozovskaya-West had to be abandoned by the ''Geschwaderstab'' on 23 December, and the aircraft were moved to Morozovskaya-South, which was not yet threatened by the Soviet Army. On 3 January 1943, this airfield had to be abandoned as well and the ''Geschwaderstab'' was relocated to [[Tazinskaya]], there it remained until the fighting over the Stalingrad pocket ended. During this period the ''Geschwaderstab'' claimed 25 victories, 21 by Wilcke and 4 by Dahl, for the loss in action of two pilots.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=12}}

Wilcke claimed two victories on 24 November 1942, an Il-2 Sturmovik and a Yak-1, his first victories in support of the Stalingrad pocket. On 30 November he claimed the destruction of three aircraft of unknown type, one more on 2 December, and three more on 8 December. Four victories claimed on 12 December, one [[Lavochkin La-5]] and three Yak-1s, took his total to 148 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=396}} Wilcke became the fourth German fighter pilot to achieve 150 aerial victories in combat.{{refn|The first pilot to claim 150 aerial victories was [[Gordon Gollob]]  who achieved the milestone on 29 August 1942. [[Hermann Graf]] reached that total on 4 September 1942 while [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]] did so on 15 September 1942.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|pp=19–21}}|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} He achieved this mark on 17 December 1942, claiming victories 149–151. The next day he claimed victory over three more aircraft.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=396}} Following this 154th victory, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] on 23 December 1943, the 23rd member of the Wehrmacht to be so honored. Along with the Swords came the ban from flying further operational combat missions.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=73}} Although banned from flying,{{refn|The ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' (Air Force High Command), fearing the loss of such an experienced fighter unit leader, banned Wilcke from flying further combat missions.{{sfn|Berger|1999|p=378}}|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} he was credited with two more victories on the Eastern Front, a Yak-1 on 28 December and an aircraft of unknown type on 5 January 1943.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=396}}

In March 1943, Wilcke led ''Geschwaderstab'' and II. and III. ''Gruppe'' during operations against the [[Kuban bridgehead]] as part of the [[4th Air Corps (Germany)|IV. ''Fliegerkorps'']] (4th Air Corps). In early May 1943, the ''Geschwaderstab'' was ordered out of actions and returned to [[Mönchengladbach|München-Gladbach]], present-day Mönchengladbach. Wilcke had only the ''Geschwaderstab'' and I. ''Gruppe'' under his effective command and no further combat missions were flown until October 1943.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=13}}

=== Defense of the Reich and death ===
Wilcke was promoted to ''Oberst'' on 1 December 1943 and requested permission to fly operationally and lead his ''Geschwader'' from the air.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=73}} In February 1944, although still officially banned from flying operations, Wilcke ignored the order and flew several missions leading his ''Stabsschwarm'' against the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) in [[Defense of the Reich]] missions.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=13}} He claimed his 157th victory, over a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], on 10 February and his 158th, over a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]], on 24 February. He shot down two [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers on 4 March 1944, his 159th and 160th aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=397}} On 6 March, his Bf 109G-6 was crippled in aerial combat and he made an emergency landing at [[Neuruppin]].{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=389}} Combat on 6 March cost both sides heavy losses. The [[Eighth Air Force]] lost 75 four-engined bombers and 14 escort fighters, the ''Luftwaffe'' lost 65 aircraft; 36 German pilots were killed and 27 wounded.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=259}}

[[File:DGentile.jpg|thumb|right|Gentile on the wing of his P-51B, 'Shangri-La']]
On 23 March 1944, Wilcke led JG&amp;nbsp;3 &quot;Udet&quot; against a USAAF bomber formation near [[Braunschweig]]. On this day, the USAAF was attacking aircraft factories at Braunschweig and other targets of opportunity in [[Münster]], [[Osnabrück]] and [[Achmer]]. In total, the Eighth Air Force had committed 768 B-17s and B-24s bombers to this attack, supported by 841 long-range fighters. The ''Luftwaffe'' countered this attack with 13 day fighter ''Gruppen'', mustering 259 fighters on this day. Following combat, the ''Luftwaffe'' claimed the destruction of 51 enemy aircraft, including 44 four-engined bombers. The ''Luftwaffe'' suffered 16 pilots killed and six wounded as well as 33 aircraft lost. The USAAF admitted the loss of 29 bombers and 5 escort fighters while claiming 62 German aircraft shot down and another 2 destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|p=259}}

During this engagement, Wilcke shot down a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and a [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighter, but was then shot down in his Bf 109G-6 (''Werknummer'' 160 613—factory number) near [[Schöppenstedt]].{{sfn|Berger|1999|pp=379, 380}}{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2002|pp=389, 397}} It is assumed that the victors were [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] [[Don Gentile]] and Captain [[John Trevor Godfrey]] of the [[4th Fighter Group]].{{sfn|Scutts|1987|p=58}} By this date, Wilcke had claimed 162 enemy aircraft in 732 combat missions.{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=229}} His death was announced in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'', an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht, on 30 March.{{sfn|Die Wehrmachtberichte 1939–1945 Volume 3|p=69}}

Wilcke had been nicknamed &quot;''[[Fürst]]''&quot; (prince) by his comrades on account of his attitude towards his men and paternal sense of responsibility.{{sfn|Weal|1999|p=64}} He had also been very conscious of his style and appearance and wore a very expensive and custom tailored leather coat, a trade which also added to his perception and fostered the nickname.{{sfn|Braatz|2005|p=187}} His funeral ceremony was held at the airfield in München-Gladbach. Among others, the funeral ceremony was attended by his stepfather. Wilcke was buried in the honor section of the cemetery in Mönchengladbach-Holt.{{sfn|Stockert|2012|p=73}}
