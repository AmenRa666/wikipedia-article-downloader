Colonel '''Bailey K. Ashford''' (September 28, 1873 – September 10, 1934) was an American  physician who had a military career in the United States Army, and afterward taught full-time at the [[School of Tropical Medicine (Puerto Rico)|School of Tropical Medicine]], which he helped establish in San Juan.

A pioneering physician in the treatment of anemia, while stationed in Puerto Rico Ashford organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign against [[hookworm]], which cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population). This reduced the death rate from associated [[anemia]] by 90 percent. He was a founding member of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission.

==Early years==
Ashford was born in [[Washington D.C.]] as one of five children in the family of Francis Ashford, a prominent physician, and his wife. His general education was obtained at the public schools and at Columbian University in Washington D.C. (now [[George Washington University]]). In 1896, he graduated from the [[Georgetown University School of Medicine]]. He served as resident physician in several area hospitals.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPR&quot;&gt;[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=10062203 &quot;Bailey K. Ashford&quot;], ''Puerto Rico Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a recently commissioned lieutenant in the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|United States Army Medical Corps]], Ashford accompanied the military expedition to [[Puerto Rico]] in 1898 during the Spanish–American War.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSH&quot;&gt;[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/BiografiasPr/coronel_bailey_ashford.htm Proyecto Salon Hogar]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hookworm treatment===
Serving as the medical officer in the [[Antiguo Hospital Militar Español de Ponce|general military hospital]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], in 1899 he was the first to describe and successfully treat [[North America]]n [[hookworm]]. He was a tireless clinician and conducted an exhaustive study of the [[anemia]] caused by hookworm infestation, which was responsible for as many as 12,000 deaths a year. From 1903–1904, he organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign, which cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population). This work reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPR&quot; /&gt;

===Anemia treatment===
Captain Ashford was a founding member of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission. By special authority of the Secretary of War, he served on the Commission from 1904–1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSH&quot; /&gt;

==School of Tropical Medicine==
In 1911, his proposal for an Institute of Tropical Medicine (Later renamed School of Tropical Medicine) in Puerto Rico was approved by [[Antonio R. Barceló]], the president of the Puerto Rican Senate. He pushed for passage of the legislation to authorize the school, and Governor Horace Towner and his cabinet proceeded to create it.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRET&quot;&gt;''Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barceló, 1868–1938''; by: [[Delma S. Arrigoitia]]; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); ISBN 978-1-934461-69-3&lt;/ref&gt; After serving as a commander of the Army Medical Department’s First Division during [[World War I]], Colonel Ashford was assigned to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. He campaigned for the development of &quot;a real school of tropical medicine in the American tropics&quot;.

The [[School of Tropical Medicine (Puerto Rico)|School of Tropical Medicine of Puerto Rico]] was formally dedicated in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11613953&amp;dopt=Abstract Ramírez de Arellano AB., &quot;Columbia's overseas venture: the School of Tropical Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico&quot;], ''Med Geogr Herit.'' 1989 Dec;5:35–40, accessed 28 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was affiliated with Columbia University in New York and became part of the University of Puerto Rico.

After a 30-year [[Army]] career as a military doctor, Ashford assumed a full-time faculty position at the School, where he continued his interest in tropical medicine. Together with doctors [[Isaac González Martínez]] and [[Ramón M. Suárez Calderon]], he continued to carry out experiments related to anemia. The [[University of Puerto Rico]] campus at Rio Piedras, the building of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (see drawings&lt;ref&gt;http://medweb.rcm.upr.edu/anes/tropical.html&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Puerta de Tierra]], San Juan, is one of the few examples of the [[Plateresque|Neo-Plateresque]] architectural style in the Island.

==Legacy and honors==
[[File:Casa Bailey Ashford.jpg|thumb|right|Ashford home in [[Condado, Puerto Rico]]]]
In his honor, the main avenue in the [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] district of &quot;[[Condado, Puerto Rico|El Condado]]&quot;, bears his name as does Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital, also in [[Condado (Santurce)|Condado]]. His home in Condado is being preserved and renovated.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPR&quot; /&gt;

In 1941, The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, established the &quot;Bailey K. Ashford Medal&quot;. This is awarded for distinguished work in tropical medicine to a worker in his or her early or mid-career. The first person to receive the award was Lloyd E. Rozeboom. The medal is awarded every year, and more than one award may be given.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astmh.org/Bailey_K_Ashford_Medal.htm Bailey K. Ashford Medal], American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashford died on September 10, 1934, in his home in San Juan. His remains were [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=27762542 interred] in [[Puerto Rico National Cemetery]] in the city of [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EPR&quot; /&gt;
