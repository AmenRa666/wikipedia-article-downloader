==Untitled==
It might be worth clarifying if she was the largest vessel to be sunk with all hands during WW2.  Or was it the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Chiyoda]]? [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 11:56, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

==Far Less Dramatic?==

This article states: &quot;In his 2009 book &quot;Battle of Surigao Strait&quot;, Anthony Tully argues Fuso's sinking was far less dramatic than commonly believed: rather than breaking in half, she merely rolled over and sank.&quot; Whether rolling over or breaking in half, a 40,000 ton battleship sinking with more or less all hands after a magazine explosion at night is pretty dramatic either way...  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.1.168.113|24.1.168.113]] ([[User talk:24.1.168.113|talk]]) 03:34, 24 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:He's welcome to his viewpoint, however, many Japanese eye-witnesses state otherwise.  As do most historical sources.[[User:HammerFilmFan|HammerFilmFan]] ([[User talk:HammerFilmFan|talk]]) 06:58, 2 January 2013 (UTC)

== Fuso survivor? ==

The Battle of Surigayo Strait article now references a Fuso survivor, Hideo Ogawa. If this is verifiably true the speculations that Fuso was the largest ship sunk with all hands need to be removed. [[Special:Contributions/68.12.162.118|68.12.162.118]] ([[User talk:68.12.162.118|talk]]) 05:02, 12 March 2011 (UTC)

Whoops, didn't realize I wasn't logged in - [[User:Jgoulden|John D. Goulden]] ([[User talk:Jgoulden|talk]]) 05:04, 12 March 2011 (UTC)

== bad template ==

The template used on this page breaks the standard reference tools.  I leave it to others to fix this - but it should be addressed.  Inline citations cause system cite errors. [[User:HammerFilmFan|HammerFilmFan]] ([[User talk:HammerFilmFan|talk]]) 07:33, 2 January 2013 (UTC)

*Just adding some things here so I don't edit-conflict. Inserted: also, sources conflict, particularly in the later battles, so I want to get the whole picture here, and then we can make some judgment calls on what to keep for the article. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 16:43, 6 February 2013 (UTC)

**p. 66: At 09:08 on 24 October 1944, ''Fusō'', ''Yamashiro'' and ''Mogami'' spotted a group of  27 planes, including TBFs, F6Fs, and SB2Cs, that had been launched from the carrier USS ''Enterprise''.
**p. 68 This would be the first time ''Fusō'' would fire its guns in actual combat. A bomb hit near Turret No. 2, penetrating the decks, killing everyone in No.1 secondary battery, and causing a 2-degree list to starboard. Another bomb destroyed the catapult and both floatplanes. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 04:37, 7 February 2013 (UTC)
**p. 120: Early the next morning, ''Fusō'' opened fire around 01:05 after a shape was spotted off the port bow. Unfortunately, the shape turned out to be ''Mogami'', and ''Fusō''{{'s}} fire killed three sailors in that ship's sick bay.
**p. 134: The first ordnance to hit ''Fusō'' were two bombs from an air attack.
**p. 152: One or two torpedoes hit ''Fusō'' amidships on the starboard side at 03:09. The ship listed to starboard, slowed down, and fell out of formation. 
**p. 178, 179: ''Fusō'' sank at some point between 03:38 and 03:50; only a few dozen men survived its rapid descent and massive oil fire, and only 10 of these survived after a few hours in the water. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 21:51, 5 February 2013 (UTC)
**p. 179: {{blockquote|... both Kato/Ogawa’s precious account and the USS Hutchins report are describing a sinking and event at odds with the conventional record—one that seems far removed from the spectacle of the invariably alleged huge magazine explosion and blossom of light at 0338 that supposedly blew the battleship in half! ... the entire assertion that battleship Fuso exploded at all, let alone broke into two parts that remained afloat, was built on the shakiest of foundations. ... Fuso was torpedoed, and as a result of progressive flooding, upended and capsized within forty minutes.|Tully}}
**- Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 02:29, 8 February 2013 (UTC)
**p. 275–277: Some reports claimed that ''Fusō'' broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour, but the &quot;identification was not based on the observation of obvious details like gun mounts and battleship superstructures, but simply the width and scale of the fire sighted.&quot; - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 03:01, 8 February 2013 (UTC)
*From {{cite book |author=Mark Stille |title=Imperial Japanese Navy Battleships 1941-45 (New Vanguard) |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Reading |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=1-84603-280-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}:
**p. 4: Battleships of the Imperial Navy did little until the late stages of the war, when they engaged and attempted to halt the US forces. Only one would survive the war.
**p. 23: ''Fusō'' and her sister ship ''Yamashiro'' spent most of the war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay. The two ships left Hashirajima on May 29, 1942, to assist the invasion of Midway if needed, but they played no part in that disastrous battle, and returned to Japan. ''Fusō'' stayed in home waters until August 1943, when she ferried troops and supplies to Truk. She took part in the failed attempt to defend Biak Island and its airfield in May 1944.
**p. 23, 24: In October 1944, after a refit, both ships sailed to Lingga Anchorage as part of Operation ''Sho-go'' (Victory), the defense of the Phillipines. The two ships, slower than the other battleships, were assigned to Force C, and headed north into Leyte Gulf. With the other ships, they left for Leyte on October 20. The fleet departed Lingga on October 20 and headed to Leyte. On October 24, ''Fusō'' lost her catapult to a bomb dropped by carrier aircraft in the Sulu Sea. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 16:40, 6 February 2013 (UTC)
