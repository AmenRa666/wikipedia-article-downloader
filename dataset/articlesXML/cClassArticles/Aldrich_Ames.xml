'''Aldrich Hazen Ames''' (born May 26, 1941) is an American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) analyst, turned [[KGB]] mole, who was convicted of espionage in 1994. He is serving a [[life sentence]] without the possibility of parole in the high-security [[United States Penitentiary, Allenwood|Allenwood U.S. Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Bureau of Prisons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;LastName=Ames&amp;Middle=&amp;FirstName=Aldrich+&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=23&amp;y=24 |title=Aldrich Hazen Ames Register Number: 40087-083 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons |work=Bop.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}} ''(Search result)''&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was formerly a 31-year CIA [[counter-intelligence|counterintelligence]] officer and analyst who committed espionage against the United States by [[spying]] for the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/aldrich-hazen-ames|title=FBI — Aldrich Hazen Ames|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far as it is known, Ames compromised the second-largest number of CIA agents, second only to [[Robert Hanssen]].

== Early life and work ==
Ames was born in [[River Falls, Wisconsin]], to Carleton Cecil Ames and Rachel Ames (née Aldrich). His father was a college lecturer at the [[University of Wisconsin-River Falls]] and his mother a high school English teacher. Aldrich was the eldest of three children and the only son. In 1952, his father began working for the CIA's Directorate of Operations in Virginia, and in 1953 was posted to Southeast Asia for three years, accompanied by his family. Carleton received a &quot;particularly negative performance appraisal&quot; in part because of a serious drinking problem and spent the remainder of his career at CIA headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''An Assessment of the Aldrich H. Ames Espionage Case and Its Implications for U.S. Intelligence: Report Prepared by the Staff of the Select Committee on Intelligence, United States Senate'' [84-046] (Washington: U. S. Government Printing Office, 1994), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames attended high school at [[McLean High School]] in [[McLean, Virginia]]. Beginning in 1957, following his sophomore year, Ames worked for the CIA for three summers as a low-ranking (GS-3) records analyst, marking classified documents for filing. In 1959, Ames entered the [[University of Chicago]] planning to study foreign cultures and history, but his &quot;long-time passion&quot; for drama resulted in failing grades, and he did not finish his sophomore year. Ames worked at the CIA during the summer of 1960 as a laborer/painter. He then became an assistant technical director at a Chicago theater until February 1962. Returning to the Washington area, Ames took full-time employment at the CIA doing the same sort of clerical jobs he had performed in high school.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== CIA career ==
Five years later, Ames completed a bachelor's degree in history at [[George Washington University]]. Ames did not originally plan to have a career with the CIA, but after attaining the grade of GS-7 and having received good performance appraisals, Ames was accepted into the Career Trainee Program despite several alcohol-related brushes with the police.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 5; {{cite web|url=http://www.s9.com/Biography/Ames-Aldrich-Hazen |title=Ames, Aldrich Hazen Biography |publisher=S9.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Ames married fellow officer Nancy Segebarth, whom he had met in the Career Trainee Program. When Ames was assigned to [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]], Nancy resigned from the CIA because of a rule that prohibited married partners from working as officers from the same office.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 5. Nevertheless, Nancy Ames performed part-time administrative work in her husband's office.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames's job in Turkey was to target Soviet intelligence officers for recruitment, and he succeeded in infiltrating the Communist [[Dev-Genç]] organization through a roommate of student activist [[Deniz Gezmiş]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/1997/03/02/f16.html |accessdate=2008-10-13 |title=Disislerinde CIA Köstebegi |date=1997-03-02 |first=Savas |last=Suzal |work=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |language=Turkish}}. Ames made multiple payments for information that included the names of the DEV-GENÇ members Gezmiş knew and the details of their activities.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this success, Ames's performance was rated only &quot;satisfactory&quot;, and Ames, discouraged by the critical assessment, considered leaving the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Ames returned to CIA headquarters where he spent the next four years in the Soviet-East European (SE) Division. His performance reviews were &quot;generally enthusiastic&quot;, apparently because he was better at managing paperwork and planning field operations than at agent recruiting. Nevertheless, his excessive drinking was also noted, and two &quot;[[eyes only]]&quot; memoranda were placed in his file.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 6. At a Christmas party in 1974, Ames was discovered intoxicated and in &quot;a compromising position&quot; with a female CIA employee. However, a bright point in that assignment is when Ames handled a Czech asset and prevented recapture, which so impressed Ames' superiors he was recommended for a more demanding assignment.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Ames was assigned to [[New York City]] where he handled two important Soviet assets. His performance was excellent, he received several promotions and bonuses, and was ranked above most operations officers in his pay grade, although his tendency to procrastinate in submissions of financial accounting was noted. Ames's inattention to details also led him to make two important security violations, including once leaving a briefcase of classified operational materials on the subway. Ames apparently received only a verbal reprimand.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Ames accepted a posting to [[Mexico City]] while his wife remained in New York. His evaluations in Mexico were mediocre at best, and he also engaged in at least three extramarital affairs. In October 1982, Ames began an affair with María del Rosario Casas Dupuy, a cultural attaché in the Colombian Embassy and a CIA informant. Despite CIA regulations, Ames did not report his romance with a foreign national to his superiors, even though some of his colleagues were well aware of it. Ames's lackluster performance reviews were in part the result of heavy drinking. At a diplomatic reception in Mexico City, Ames got into a loud, drunken argument with a Cuban official that &quot;caused alarm&quot; among his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in September 1983, the CIA assigned Ames back to the SE division in Washington, placing him &quot;in the most sensitive element&quot; of the Department of Operations, that was responsible for Soviet counterintelligence. Ames had access to all CIA plans and operations against the [[KGB]] and the [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]], Soviet military intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Assessment, 8-9&quot;&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, he formally separated from his wife, and, in November, he submitted an &quot;outside activity&quot; report to the CIA noting his romantic relationship with Rosario. As part of his divorce settlement, Ames agreed to pay the couple's debts plus provide his wife monthly support for three-and-a-half years, a total of about $46,000. Ames thought the divorce might bankrupt him, and he later said that this financial pressure first led him to consider spying for the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Assessment, 8-9&quot; /&gt; Rosario also proved to be a heavy spender, phoning her family in Colombia at a cost of $400 a month and going on shopping sprees—after her arrest the FBI discovered in the Ameses' house sixty purses, more than five hundred pairs of shoes, and 165 unopened boxes of pantyhose.&lt;ref&gt;Maas, 222–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Espionage ==
Ames routinely assisted another CIA office that assessed Soviet embassy officials as potential intelligence assets. As part of this responsibility, and with the knowledge of both the CIA and the FBI, Ames began making contacts within the Soviet Embassy. In April 1985, Ames provided information to the Soviets that he believed was &quot;essentially valueless&quot; but that would establish his credentials as a CIA insider. He also asked for $50,000, which the Soviets quickly paid.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames later claimed that he had not prepared for more than the initial &quot;con game&quot; to satisfy his immediate indebtedness, but once having &quot;crossed a line,&quot; he &quot;could never step back.&quot; Ames soon identified more than ten top-level CIA and FBI sources who were reporting on Soviet activities. Not only did Ames believe that there was &quot;as much money as [he] could ever use&quot; in betraying these intelligence assets, but their elimination would also reduce the chance of his own espionage being discovered.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985, the CIA's network of Soviet-bloc agents began disappearing at an alarming rate. The CIA realized something was wrong but was reluctant to consider the possibility of an agency mole. Initial investigations focused on possible breaches caused by Soviet [[Covert listening device|bugs]] or by a broken code.&lt;ref name=PowellTreason&gt;Powell, Bill (2002-11-01), ''Treason: How a Russian Spy Led an American Journalist to a U.S. Double Agent'', Simon &amp; Schuster, ISBN 0-7432-2915-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA then blamed asset losses on another former CIA agent, [[Edward Lee Howard]], who had also been passing information to the Soviets. But when the CIA lost three other important sources of information about whom Howard could have known nothing, it was clear that the arrests (and executions) originated from another source.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one CIA officer put it, the Soviets &quot;were wrapping up our cases with reckless abandon,&quot; which was highly unusual because the &quot;prevailing wisdom among the Agency's professional 'spy catchers'&quot; was that suddenly eliminating all the assets known to the mole would put him in danger. In fact, Ames's KGB handlers apologized to him but said the decision to immediately eliminate all American assets had been made at the highest political levels.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Ames continued to meet openly with his contact at the Soviet embassy, [[Sergey Dmitriyevich Chuvakhin]], and for a time, Ames summarized for the CIA and FBI the progress of what he portrayed as an attempt to recruit the Soviet. Ames received $20,000 to $50,000 every time the two had lunch.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 18–19. To deposit the money, Ames maintained several bank accounts and divided the cash into amounts under $10,000 to avoid bank reporting requirements.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Ames received $4.6 million from the Soviets, which allowed him to enjoy a lifestyle well beyond the means of a CIA officer.&lt;ref name=PowellTreason /&gt;

When, in August 1985, Ames's divorce became final, he immediately married María del Rosario. Understanding that his new wealth would raise eyebrows, he developed a cover story that his prosperity was the result of money given to him by his Colombian wife's wealthy family. To help fabricate this, Ames wired considerable amounts of his espionage profits to his new in-laws in Bogota, as well as to better their impoverished status.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Ames told the KGB that he feared he would be a suspect after the loss of several CIA assets. The KGB threw US investigators off his trail by constructing an elaborate diversion whereby a Soviet case officer told a CIA contact that the mole was stationed at [[Warrenton Training Center]] (WTC), a secret CIA communications facility in Virginia. US mole hunters investigated 90 employees at WTC for almost a year and came up with ten suspects, although the lead investigator noted that &quot;there are so many problem personalities that no one stands out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pincus |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Pincus |title=CIA: Ames Betrayed 55 Operations; Inspector General's Draft Report Blames Supervisors for Failure to Plug Leak |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=September 24, 1994 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiner |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Weiner |title=Senate Report Faults C.I.A. for Ineptitude in Spy Case |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=November 2, 1994 |page=A1 http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/02/us/senate-report-faults-cia-for-ineptitude-in-spy-case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames was posted to [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] in 1986. There his performance once again ranged from mediocre to poor, and included evidence of problem drinking. Nevertheless, in 1990–91, Ames was reassigned to the CIA's Counterintelligence Center Analysis Group, providing him with access to &quot;extremely sensitive data&quot;, including information on US [[double agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 33–35. Ames's immediate supervisors were aware of his alcohol abuse and proclivity to sleep at his desk, but his annual performance reviews &quot;consistently rated him a strong performer.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== CIA response ==

In late 1986, the CIA assembled a team to investigate the source of the leaks. The team, led by Paul Redmond and consisting of [[Jeanne Vertefeuille]], [[Sandra Grimes]], Diana Worthen, and Dan Payne, examined different possible causes, including the possibilities that the KGB had either bugged the agency, intercepted its communications, or placed a mole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/ames-mole-hunt-team.html |title=The People of the CIA … Ames Mole Hunt Team — Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |date=April 30, 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, the CIA was certain that there was a mole in the agency and recruitment of new Soviet agents came to a virtual halt from fear that the agency could not protect its current assets.&lt;ref name=PowellTreason /&gt;

Prior to this, in November 1989, a fellow employee reported that Ames seemed to be enjoying a lifestyle well beyond the means of a CIA officer and that his wife's family was less wealthy than he had claimed. Nevertheless, the CIA moved slowly. When the investigator assigned to Ames' finances began a two-month training course, no one immediately replaced him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators were also diverted by a false story from a CIA officer abroad who claimed that the Soviets had penetrated the CIA with an employee born in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Analysis,&quot; 48. The investigation into this tale suggested a fabrication &quot;for career enhancing or financial reasons.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 and 1991, Ames passed two [[polygraph]] examinations while spying for the Soviet Union and Russia, respectively. Ames was initially &quot;terrified&quot; at the prospect of taking the test, but he was advised by the KGB &quot;to just relax&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 44–45; {{harvnb|Weiner|Johnston|Lewis|1995|pp=89–90}} The KGB advised Ames to get &quot;a real good night's sleep. Be fresh and rested. Be cooperative. Develop rapport with examiner. And try to remain as calm and easy as you can.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Ames' test demonstrated deceptive answers to some questions but the examiners passed him, perhaps in the later opinion of the CIA because the examiners were &quot;overly friendly&quot; and therefore did not induce the proper physiological response.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 45–46. Pete Early depicts Ames as being able to convince himself that the answers he was giving were actually truthful. Also, according to Early, except for a handful of staff members, the CIA had largely abandoned trying solving the case, and more credit for the resolution should be given the FBI. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D8113EF937A15751C0A961958260 Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, &quot;Aldrich Ames: Brilliant or Bumbling?&quot; ''New York Times'', February 24, 1997, review of Pete Early, ''Confessions of a Spy''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA finally focused on Ames after coworkers noted a sharper personal appearance with:
* Cosmetic dentistry; Ames' teeth, which were yellowed by heavy smoking, were capped.
* Attire; Ames had been previously known for &quot;bargain basement&quot; attire, then suddenly changed to tailor-made suits not even his superiors could afford.
The CIA also realized Ames' annual salary was $60,000, yet he could afford:
* A $540,000 house in [[Arlington, Virginia]], paid for in cash;&lt;ref name=&quot;WJL p.144&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|Johnston|Lewis|1995|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A $50,000 [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] car;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|Johnston|Lewis|1995|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Home remodeling and redecoration costs of $99,000;&lt;ref name=&quot;WJL p.144&quot; /&gt;
* Monthly phone bills exceeding $6,000, mostly calls by Ames' wife to her family in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]];
* Premium credit cards whose minimum monthly payment exceeded his monthly salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com |title=Crime Library – Crime News and Stories |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest ==
In March 1993, the CIA and FBI began an intensive investigation of Ames that included electronic surveillance, combing through his trash, and a monitor installed in his car to track his movements.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 50-51. The monitor sometimes failed, frustrating the FBI on several occasions.&lt;/ref&gt; From November 1993 until his arrest, Ames was kept under virtually constant physical surveillance. When in early 1994 he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow, the FBI believed it could wait no longer, and he and his wife were arrested on February 21, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/aldrich-hazen-ames |title=FBI History: Famous Cases - Aldrich Hazen Ames|publisher=FBI.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At arrest, Ames told the officers, &quot;You're making a big mistake! You must have the wrong man!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner,Johnston,Lewis|1995|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 1994, Ames and his wife were formally charged by the [[United States Department of Justice]] with spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. Ames's betrayal resulted in the deaths of a number of CIA assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://oig.justice.gov/special/9704.htm | title=A Review of the FBI’s Performance in Uncovering the Espionage Activities of Aldrich Hazen Ames | first=Michael R. | last=Bromwich | authorlink=Michael R. Bromwich | date=April 1997 | accessdate=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded guilty on April 28 and received a sentence of [[life imprisonment]]. His wife received a five-year prison sentence for [[tax evasion]] and conspiracy to commit espionage as part of a plea bargain by Ames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/ames/ames.htm |title=FBI History: Famous Cases - Aldrich Hazen Ames|publisher=FBI.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100129083132/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/ames/ames.htm| archivedate= 29 January 2010}}. Rosario Ames was released from federal custody after she completed her sentence.&lt;/ref&gt;

In court, Ames admitted that he had compromised &quot;virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me&quot; and had provided the USSR and Russia with a &quot;huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1994_rpt/ssci_ames.htm|title=An Assessment of the Aldrich H. Ames Espionage Case and Its Implications for U.S. Intelligence - Senate Select Committee on Intelligence - 01 November 1994 - Part One |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that information Ames provided to the Soviets led to the compromise of at least a hundred US intelligence operations and to the [[execution]] of at least ten US sources.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assessment,&quot; 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Ames' betrayal of CIA methods allowed the KGB to use &quot;controlled agents&quot; to [[1995 CIA disinformation controversy|feed the US both genuine intelligence and disinformation]] from 1986 to 1993. Some of this &quot;feed material&quot; was incorporated into CIA intelligence reports, some of which even reached three Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Benjamin|title=Doubles Troubles: The CIA and Double Agents during the Cold War|journal=International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence|date=2016|volume=29|issue=1|pages=51-52|doi=10.1080/08850607.2015.1083313|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850607.2015.1083313|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames said he was not afraid of being caught by the FBI or CIA but was afraid of Soviet defectors, saying, &quot;Virtually every American who has been jailed in connection with espionage has been fingered by a Soviet source.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://france.newspaperarchive.com/waterloo-courier/1994-04-29/page-3/ |title=Money wasn't only reason Ames sold U.S. secrets |first=Walter|last=Pincus |work=Waterloo Courier |agency=The Washington Post |date=April 29, 1994 |page=A3 |via=Newspaperarchive.com |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when asked about the polygraph tests, Ames said, &quot;There's no special magic. Confidence is what does it. Confidence and a friendly relationship with the examiner.

Ames is [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] prisoner #40087-083, serving the first 21 years of his lifetime sentence in the high-security [[United States Penitentiary, Allenwood|Allenwood U.S. Penitentiary]] near [[Allenwood, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Bureau of Prisons&quot;/&gt; The retirement of both CIA and Allenwood staff who monitored his mail and phone calls in part triggered his move on 24 April 2016 to the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terre Haute|Terre Haute]], where the nation's first [[Communication Management Unit]] (CMU) provided staff and facilities to carry out the somewhat unique rules and procedures required to assure CIA-accessible access to, and monitoring of, Ames's communications.

The CIA was criticized for not focusing on Ames sooner, given the obvious increase in his standard of living.&lt;ref name=PowellTreason/&gt; There was a &quot;huge uproar&quot; in Congress when CIA director [[James Woolsey]] decided that no one in the CIA would be dismissed or demoted at the agency. &quot;Some have clamored for heads to roll in order that we could say that heads have rolled,&quot; Woolsey declared. &quot;Sorry, that's not my way.&quot; Woolsey was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Maas, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames's attorney, [[Plato Cacheris]], had threatened to litigate the legality of FBI searches and seizures in Ames's home and office without traditional search warrants, although Ames's guilty plea made the threat moot. Congress then passed a new law giving the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] that specific power.&lt;ref&gt;Maas, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some CIA sources betrayed ==
* [[Vitaly Yurchenko]] was a KGB officer in the Fifth Department of Directorate K, &quot;the highest-ranking KGB officer ever to defect to the United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|Johnston|Lewis|1995|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1985, he defected via [[Rome]] to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|Johnston|Lewis|1995|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to [[repatriate]] to the Soviet Union three months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|Johnston|Lewis|1995|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was privy to all information that Yurchenko gave to the CIA and was able to transmit it to the KGB, which allowed easy cover-ups of lost information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yurchenko returned to the Soviet Union in 1985 and was reassigned to a desk job within the FCD, a reward for helping to keep Ames' spying a secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Major General]] [[Dmitri Polyakov]] was the highest-ranking figure in Soviet military intelligence ([[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]]) giving information to the CIA from the early 1960s until his retirement in 1980. He was executed in 1988 after Ames exposed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Projects/AnthonyZanontian/ames.htm |first= Anthony |last=Zanontian |title=Complete Guide to the Russian KGB - Key Players |publisher=Math.ucsd.edu Cryptography Archive|date= |accessdate=2008-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081029174836/http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Projects/AnthonyZanontian/ames.htm| archivedate= 29 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably the most valuable asset compromised by Ames. One CIA official said of Polyakov, &quot;He didn't do this for money. He insisted on staying in place to help us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wise, David.

* Colonel [[Oleg Gordievsky]] was the head of the London ''rezidentura'' (station) and spied for the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS (MI6)]]. Ames handed over information about Gordievsky that positively identified him as a double agent,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|pp=179,180}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he managed to escape to the Finnish border where he was extracted to the United Kingdom via Norway by the British SIS before he could be detained in Russia.
* [[Adolf Tolkachev]] was an electrical engineer who was one of the chief designers at the [[Phazotron]] company, which produces military [[radar]]s and [[avionics]]. Tolkachev passed information to the CIA between 1979 and 1985, compromising multiple radar and missile secrets, as well as turning over classified information on avionics. He was arrested in 1985 after being compromised by both Ames and [[Edward Lee Howard]], and executed in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol47no3/article02.html |title=Tolkachev, A Worthy Successor to Penkovsky |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |work=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Valery Martynov]] was a Line X (Technical &amp; Scientific Intelligence) officer at the Washington ''rezidentura.'' Martynov revealed the identities of fifty Soviet intelligence officers operating from the embassy and technical and scientific targets that the KGB had penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Maas, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames handed Martynov's name to the KGB, and he was executed.&lt;ref name=cherkashin187&gt;{{harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Major [[Sergei Motorin]] was a Line PR (Political Intelligence) officer at the Washington ''rezidentura'' whom the [[FBI]] tried to blackmail into spying for the US. He eventually cooperated for his own reasons. Motorin was one of two moles at the ''rezidentura'' betrayed by Ames and then quickly executed.&lt;ref name=cherkashin187/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/ames/3.html |title=CIA Traitor Aldrich Ames |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |date= |page=3 |accessdate=2008-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080709015629/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/ames/3.html| archivedate=July 9, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colonel [[Leonid Poleshchuk]] was a Line KR (Counter-intelligence) agent in Nigeria. He too was betrayed by Ames. His arrest was attributed to a chance encounter where KGB agents had observed a CIA agent loading a [[dead drop]]. After some time, Poleshchuk was seen removing the contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|pp=191,192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sergey Fedorenko]] was a nuclear arms expert assigned to the Soviet delegation to the [[United Nations]]. In 1977, Ames was assigned to handle him, and Fedorenko betrayed information about the Soviet missile program to Ames. The two men became good friends, hugging when Fedorenko was about to return to Moscow. &quot;We had become close friends&quot;, said Ames. &quot;We trusted each other completely&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/ames/2.html |title=CIA Traitor Aldrich Ames |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |date= |page=2 |accessdate=2008-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081013094711/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/ames/2.html| archivedate= 13 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was initially hesitant to betray his friend, but soon after handing over the majority of the information, he decided to also betray Fedorenko to &quot;do a good job&quot; for the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Back in the USSR, Fedorenko used political connections to get himself out of trouble. Years later, Fedorenko met his friend Ames for an emotional reunion over lunch and promised to move to the United States for good. Ames promised to help. Shortly after lunch, Ames betrayed him to the KGB for a second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Fedorenko escaped arrest, defected, and is currently living in [[Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videofact.com/english/agents12_en.html |title=videofact |publisher=Videofact.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080927014754/http://www.videofact.com/english/agents12_en.html| archivedate= 27 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
