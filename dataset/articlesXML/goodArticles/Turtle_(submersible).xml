{{Campaignbox American Revolutionary War: Northern 1775}}
'''''Turtle''''' (also called '''''American Turtle''''') was the world's first [[submersible]] with a documented record of use in combat. She was built in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]{{cn|date=September 2015}} in 1775 by American [[David Bushnell]] as a means of attaching [[Naval mine|explosive charges]] to ships in a harbor.  Bushnell designed her for use against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Royal Navy]] vessels occupying North American harbors during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]] recommended the invention to [[George Washington]]; although the commander-in-chief had doubts, he provided funds and support for the development and testing of the machine.

Several attempts were made using ''Turtle'' to affix explosives to the undersides of British warships in [[New York Harbor]] in 1776. All failed, and her transport ship was sunk later that year by the British with the submarine aboard. Bushnell claimed eventually to have recovered the machine, but its final fate is unknown.  Modern replicas of ''Turtle'' have been constructed; the [[Connecticut River Museum]], the U.S. Navy's [[Submarine Force Library and Museum]], the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] and the [[Oceanographic Museum]] (Monaco) have them on display.

== Development ==
[[File:Turtle submarine 1776.jpg|thumb|left|This 19th-century diagram shows the side views of ''Turtle''. It incorrectly depicts the propeller as a screw blade; as seen in the replica photographed above and reported by Sergeant Lee, it was a paddle propeller blade.&lt;ref name=R30&gt;Rindskopf et al, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the early 1770s, David Bushnell, a [[Yale College]] freshman and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]], began experimenting with underwater explosives.  By 1775, with tensions on the rise between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], Bushnell had practically perfected these explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; That year he also began work near [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]] on a small manned submersible craft capable of affixing such a charge to the hull of a ship.  The charge would then be detonated by a clockwork mechanism that released a [[musket]] firing mechanism, probably a [[flintlock]], adapted for the purpose.&lt;ref name=D22/&gt;  According to Dr. Benjamin Gale, a doctor who taught at Yale, the firing mechanism and other mechanical parts of the submarine were manufactured by a [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] clockmaker named Isaac Doolittle.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for its shape, ''Turtle'' resembled a large [[clam]] as much as a [[turtle]]; it was about {{convert|10|ft}} long (according to the original specifications), {{convert|6|ft}} tall, and about {{convert|3|ft|1}} wide, and consisted of two wooden shells covered with [[tar]] and reinforced with steel bands.&lt;ref name=S172&gt;Schecter, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It dived by allowing water into a [[bilge]] tank at the bottom of the vessel and ascended by pushing water out through a hand pump.  It was propelled vertically and horizontally by hand-cranked propellers. It also had {{convert|200|lb}} of lead aboard, which could be released in a moment to increase buoyancy. Manned and operated by one person, the vessel contained enough air for about thirty minutes and had a speed in calm water of about {{convert|3|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=S172/&gt;

[[File:Turtle submarine.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram showing the front and rear of ''Turtle'']]
Six small pieces of thick glass in the top of the submarine provided natural light.&lt;ref name=S172/&gt;  The internal instruments had small pieces of [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] [[Foxfire (bioluminescence)|foxfire]] affixed to the needles to indicate their position in the dark.  During trials in November 1775, Bushnell discovered that this illumination failed when the temperature dropped too low.  Although repeated requests were made to [[Benjamin Franklin]] for possible alternatives, none was forthcoming, and ''Turtle'' was sidelined for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Bushnell's basic design included some elements present in earlier experimental submersibles.  The method of raising and lowering the vessel was similar to that developed by Nathaniel Simons in 1729, and the gaskets used to make watertight connections around the connections between the internal and external controls also may have come from Simons, who constructed a submersible based on a 17th-century Italian design by [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]].&lt;ref name=R29&gt;Rindskopf et al, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation for use==
[[Image:TurtleSubmarine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Drawing of a cutaway view of ''Turtle''{{'}}s interior.]]
Bushnell's work began to receive more attention in August 1775, when Franklin was informed of it.&lt;ref name=D22&gt;Diamant, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Bushnell's insistence on secrecy surrounding his work, news of it quickly made its way to the British, abetted by a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] spy working for New York Congressman [[James Duane]].  On November 16, 1775, a coded message to [[William Tryon]], the last royal governor of the [[Province of New York]], brought Bushnell's work to British attention.  The details of the report were highly inaccurate, implying ''Turtle'' was nearly ready to be deployed in [[Boston]] harbor against the fleet that was part of the British [[Siege of Boston|siege effort]] there.  In fact, Bushnell and his brother Ezra were still testing the machine in the Connecticut River.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In the spring of 1776, after the British [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|withdrew from Boston]], Bushnell offered the submarine to General [[George Washington]] for use in the defense of [[New York City]].  Washington agreed, and provided some funding to the inventor to prepare the vessel for deployment.&lt;ref name=DANFSTurtle&gt;DANFS ''Turtle I''&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1776, Bushnell asked General [[Samuel Holden Parsons]] for volunteers to operate ''Turtle'', because his brother Ezra, who had been its operator during earlier trials, was taken ill.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  Three men were chosen, and the submersible was taken to [[Long Island Sound]] for training and further trials.&lt;ref name=S173&gt;Schecter, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  While these trials went on, the British gained control of western [[Long Island]] in the August 27 [[Battle of Long Island]].  Since the British now controlled the harbor, ''Turtle'' was transported overland from [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] to the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name=S173/&gt;

== Attack on ''Eagle'' ==
[[Image:EzraLee.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|170px|Portrait of [[Ezra Lee]], ''Turtle''{{'}}s operator]]
General Washington then authorized an expedition by ''Turtle'' in [[New York Harbor]].&lt;ref name=S171&gt;Shecter, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; At 11:00 PM on September 6,&lt;ref name=R30/&gt; one of the volunteers, Sergeant [[Ezra Lee]], took the ''Turtle'' out to attempt an attack on Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]]'s flagship, [[HMS Eagle (1774)|HMS ''Eagle'']],&lt;ref name=S173/&gt; then moored off [[Governors Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Lee's account, ''Turtle'' was towed by rowboats as close as was felt safe to the British fleet. He then navigated for more than two hours before slack tide made it possible to reach ''Eagle''.  His first attempt to attach the explosive failed because the screw struck a metal impediment.&lt;ref name=R30/&gt; Lee tried and tried to turn the drill, but could not achieve penetration. A popular story held that he failed due to the [[copper]] lining covering the ship's hull. The Royal Navy had recently began installing [[copper sheathing]] on the bottoms of their warships to protect from damage by [[woodworm]]s and other marine life, however the lining was paper-thin and could not have stopped Lee from drilling through it. Bushnell believed Lee's failure was probably due to an iron plate connected to the ship's rudder hinge.&lt;ref name=S174&gt;Schecter, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lee attempted another spot in the hull, he was unable to stay beneath the ship, and eventually abandoned the attempt. It seems more likely that he was suffering from fatigue and [[carbon dioxide]] inhalation, which made him confused and unable to properly carry out the process of drilling through the ''Eagle'''s hull. Lee reported British soldiers on Governors Island spotted the submersible and rowed out to investigate.  He then released the charge (which he called a &quot;torpedo&quot;), &quot;expecting that they would seize that likewise, and thus all would be blown to atoms.&quot;&lt;ref name=S174/&gt;  Suspicious of the drifting charge, the British retreated back to the island.  Lee reported that the charge drifted into the [[East River]], where it exploded &quot;with tremendous violence, throwing large columns of water and pieces of wood that composed it high into the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=S174/&gt;  It was the first recorded use of a submarine to attack a ship;&lt;ref name=R29/&gt; however, the only records documenting it are American. British records contain no accounts of an attack by a submarine or any reports of explosions on the night of the supposed attack on HMS ''Eagle''.&lt;ref name=Compton-Hall&gt;Compton-Hall, pp. 32–40&lt;/ref&gt;

According to British naval historian Richard Compton-Hall, the problems of achieving [[neutral buoyancy]] would have rendered the vertical propeller useless. The route ''Turtle'' would have had to take to attack ''Eagle'' was slightly across the tidal stream which would, in all probability, have resulted in Lee becoming exhausted.&lt;ref name=Compton-Hall /&gt;  In the face of these and other problems, Compton-Hall suggests the entire story was fabricated as disinformation and morale-boosting propaganda, and if Lee did carry out an attack it was in a covered rowing boat rather than ''Turtle''.&lt;ref name=Compton-Hall/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Bushnell mines.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bushnell mines destroying a small British boat]]
On October 5, Sergeant Lee again went out in an attempt to attach the charge to a [[frigate]] anchored off Manhattan.  He reported the ship's watch spotted him, so he abandoned the attempt. The submarine was sunk some days later by the British aboard its tender vessel near [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].  Bushnell reported salvaging ''Turtle'', but its final fate is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington called the attempt &quot;an effort of genius&quot;, but &quot;a combination of too many things was requisite&quot; for such an attempt to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replicas ==
Functional replicas of the ''Turtle'' have been created and tested, as well as non-functioning cutaway ones for museum displays.

In 1976, a replica of ''Turtle'' was designed by Joseph Leary and constructed by Fred Frese as a  project marking the [[United States Bicentennial]]. It was christened by Connecticut's governor, [[Ella Grasso]], and later tested in the [[Connecticut River]]. This replica is owned by the [[Connecticut River Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CRM_Turtle|Connecticut River Museum – David Bushnell's Turtle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2007 three men were stopped by police while escorting and piloting a replica of ''Turtle'' within {{convert|200|ft}} of RMS ''[[Queen Mary 2]]'', then docked at the cruise ship terminal in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn]].  The replica was created by New York artist [[Philip &quot;Duke&quot; Riley]] and two residents of [[Rhode Island]], one of whom claimed to be a descendant of David Bushnell. The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] issued Riley a citation for having an unsafe vessel, and for violating the security zone around ''Queen Mary 2''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#QM2|Makeshift submarine found in East River]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, replicas of the exterior and interior of ''Turtle'' were used in the television series ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies| TURN: Washington’s Spies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AMC|''TURN: Washington’s Spies'' ]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Historian|TURN: Turtle Submarine]]&lt;/ref&gt;
