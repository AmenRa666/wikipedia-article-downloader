'''Kenneth L. Kraus''' is a former [[United States Marine]] who was the first American taken hostage by Iranian militants prior to the [[Iran hostage crisis]].&lt;ref name=NoFuton&gt;{{cite news|last=Copsey|first=Jonathan|title=Roswell cop Kenneth Kraus was a former Iran hostage|url=http://www.northfulton.com/Articles-TOP-STORIES-c-2013-03-19-197887.114126-sub-Roswell-cop-Kenneth-Kraus-was-a-former-Iran-hostage.html|newspaper=NorthFulton.com|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience==
On February 14, 1979 at approximately 9:45AM in Tehran, [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|the United States Embassy in Tehran]] was attacked and held&lt;ref name=AmSpectator_Lord&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lord|first1=Jeffrey|title=Jimmy Carterâ€™s Dead Ambassador|url=http://spectator.org/articles/34550/jimmy-carters-dead-ambassador|agency=American Spectator|publisher=American Spectator|date=23 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Fedayeen]] militants in what became known as the ''Valentine's Day Open House''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Report_Daugherty&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daugherty|first1=William J.|title=A First Tour Like No Other|journal=CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence|date=1996|volume=Held Hostage in Iran|issue=Spring 1998|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/spring98/iran.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Marine was shot and injured, then kidnapped. He spent a week in detention, where he was tortured for sensitive information on the Embassy. He was accused of shooting Iranian civilians and stood trial in what he referred to as a [[Kangaroo court]].&lt;ref name=People&gt;{{cite news|last=Walter|first=Greg|title=A Brave Young Leatherneck Escapes Death in Iran...|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20073111,00.html|newspaper=People Magazine|date=12 March 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=AP_FLS&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]]|title=Former Hostage Files Suit Against Iran|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19800212&amp;id=geJNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VosDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4412,1573458|newspaper=Free Lance Star/AP|date=12 Feb 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a week, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[William H. Sullivan|Ambassador William Sullivan]] secured his release, and he returned to a hero's welcome.

== The Capture ==
At 22 years old Kraus was sent to Tehran.  Then, in February 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] began and the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] was overthrown.  That was when the embassy came under attack for the first time.

The compound was overrun at 10:30 AM.&lt;ref name=Deseret&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Sheldon Engelmayer]]|first=|title=Hostage Suit Tells Torture|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19810204&amp;id=hj8jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TYMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4479,414133|newspaper=The Deseret News|date=4 Feb 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19 Marine guards were armed only with pistols and shotguns. Embassy staff locked themselves in the communications vault and started to destroy documents. [[Fedayeen]] militants threatened to set fire to the place and kill them all, so Ambassador Sullivan ordered the surrender of the Embassy.&lt;ref name=Houghton_Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Houghton|first=David Patrick|title=US foreign policy and the Iran hostage crisis|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521805094|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPf-vBzU46EC&amp;q=Kraus#v=snippet&amp;q=Kraus&amp;f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time Kraus and two other Marines were in the Embassy cafeteria with more than 18 civilians. One of the militants approached the building and Kraus caught him by surprise and pointed a shotgun at his head.  He and his fellow Marines negotiated to let the civilians go peacefully.  The Marines then destroyed most of the weapons to keep them from falling into the hands of the militants.  Militants then stormed the restaurant and captured the Marines. One of them fired a shotgun at Kraus, but his body armor absorbed the brunt of the impact.  He was hit in his head and chest with shrapnel, but not severely.&lt;ref name=Deseret /&gt;  He was then beaten for information.  When he did not give anything to his captors, one of them pulled a gun and fired it in close proximity, intentionally not to kill, but to wound him further; he was bleeding from his neck, arms and chest.&lt;ref name=Deseret /&gt;

Within hours he awoke in a hospital and was then blindfolded and taken to the Islamic Revolutionary Prison.&lt;ref name=Houghton_Kraus&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houghton|first1=David Patrick|title=US foreign policy and the Iran hostage crisis|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521805094|page=77|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zw18f_uonosC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;ots=xwz8WVww6r&amp;dq=Iran%20%22Valentine's%20Day%20Open%20House%22&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q=Iran%20%22Valentine's%20Day%20Open%20House%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interrogated and tortured, then on February 20, 1979, he stood trial in what was a ten-minute process; he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, which would be carried out on February 22, 1979.

== Release and Return ==
With the help of Iranian Foreign Minister [[Ebrahim Yazdi]], the siege was ended within 3 hours, but Kraus' whereabouts were claimed to be unknown.  It took less than a week to arrange his release.&lt;ref name=Houghton_Book /&gt;

On February 21, Kraus was handed back over to the United States at the Embassy, then flown to Washington D.C, via [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein Air Force Base]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=EveNews&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]]|title=Kraus Heads Home After Iranian Release|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19790222&amp;id=FF9GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xiwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3449,3103267|newspaper=The Evening News|date=22 Feb 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and Commendation==

He was awarded the Purple Heart and the [[Navy Cross]], second only to the Medal of Honor.

== Lawsuit ==
Kraus filed a $60 Million lawsuit against the Iranian Government on February 11, 1980.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]]|title=Injured US Marine Sues Iran for Damages|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19800212&amp;id=36NdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D10NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2579,1221602|newspaper=Observer-Reporter|date=12 Feb 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
