'''Sir Henry Percy''' [[Order of the Garter|KG]] (20 May 1364&amp;nbsp;– 21 July 1403), commonly known as '''''Sir Harry Hotspur''''', or simply '''''Hotspur''''', was a late-medieval [[Kingdom of England|English]] nobleman. He was a significant captain during the [[Anglo-Scottish wars]]. He later led successive rebellions against [[Henry IV of England]] and was slain at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403 at the height of his career.

== Career ==
[[File:Percy Hotspur.gif|left|thumb|upright|Arms of Hotspur]]
Henry Percy was born 20 May 1364 at either [[Alnwick Castle]] or [[Warkworth Castle]] in [[Northumberland]], the eldest son of [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], and Margaret Neville, daughter of [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Baron Neville de Raby|Ralph de Neville, 2nd Lord Neville of Raby]], and Alice de Audley.&lt;ref name=&quot;R_III-341_W&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=341}}; {{Harvnb|Walker|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was knighted by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] in April 1377, together with the future Kings [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;R_III-341_C-713_W&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=341}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1936|p=713}}; {{Harvnb|Walker|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1380, he was in Ireland with the [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March|Earl of March]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Walker|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1383, he travelled in [[State of the Teutonic Order|Prussia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;C-713_W&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1936|p=713}}; {{Harvnb|Walker|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Lord Warden of the Marches|warden of the east march]] either on 30 July 1384 or in May 1385,&lt;ref name=&quot;C-713_W&quot; /&gt; and in 1385 accompanied Richard II on an expedition into Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;R_III-341_W&quot; /&gt; 'As a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack' on the Scottish borders, the Scots bestowed on him the name 'Haatspore'.&lt;ref name=&quot;R_III-341_C-713_W&quot; /&gt; In April 1386, he was sent to France to reinforce the garrison at [[Calais]] and led raids into [[Picardy]]. Between August and October 1387, he was in command of a naval force in an attempt to relieve the siege of [[Brest, France|Brest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;C-713_W&quot; /&gt; In appreciation of these military endeavours he was made a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1388.&lt;ref name=&quot;C-713_W&quot; /&gt; Reappointed as warden of the east march, he commanded the English forces against [[James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas]], at the [[Battle of Otterburn]] on 10 August 1388, where he was captured, but soon ransomed for a fee of 7000 marks.&lt;ref name=&quot;R_III-341_C-713_W&quot; /&gt;

During the next few years Percy's reputation continued to grow. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to [[Cyprus]] in June 1393 and appointed Governor of Bordeaux, deputy to [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], in the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;R_III-341_C-713_W&quot; /&gt; He returned to England in January 1395, taking part in Richard II's expedition to Ireland, and was back in Aquitaine the following autumn. In the summer of 1396, he was again in Calais.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt;

Percy's military and diplomatic service brought him substantial marks of royal favour in the form of grants and appointments,&lt;ref name=&quot;C-713_W&quot; /&gt; but despite this, the Percy family decided to support Henry Bolingbroke, the future [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], in his rebellion against Richard II. On Henry's return from exile in June 1399, Percy and his father joined his forces at [[Doncaster]] and marched south with them. After King Richard's deposition, Percy and his father were 'lavishly rewarded' with lands and offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt;

Under the new king, Percy had extensive civil and military responsibility in both the east march towards Scotland and in north Wales, where he was appointed [[High Sheriff of Flintshire]] in 1399. In north Wales, he was under increasing pressure as a result of the rebellion of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. In March 1402, Henry IV appointed Percy royal lieutenant in north Wales, and on 14 September 1402, Percy, his father, and the [[George I, Earl of March|Earl of Dunbar and March]] were victorious against a Scottish force at the [[Battle of Humbleton Hill|Battle of Homildon Hill]]. Among others, they made a prisoner of [[Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;R_III-341_W&quot; /&gt;

== Rebellion and death ==
In spite of the favour that Henry IV showed the Percys in many respects, they became increasingly discontented with him. Among their grievances was the king's failure to pay the wages due to them for defending the Scottish border; his favour towards Dunbar; his demand that the Percys hand over their Scottish prisoners; his failure to put an end to Owain Glyndŵr's rebellion through a negotiated settlement; his increasing promotion of his son [[Henry V of England|Prince Henry]]'s military authority in Wales; and his failure to ransom Henry Percy's brother-in-law [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl of March|Sir Edmund Mortimer]], whom the Welsh had captured in June 1402.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walker|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|pp=14, 37}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|pp=193–195}}; {{Harvnb|Holmes|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Tout|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Bean|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred on by these grievances, the Percys rebelled in the summer of 1403 and took up arms against the king. According to J. M. W. Bean, it is clear that the Percys were in collusion with Glyndŵr. On his return to England shortly after the victory at Homildon Hill, Henry Percy issued proclamations in [[Cheshire]] accusing the king of 'tyrannical government'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt; Joined by his uncle, [[Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester|Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester]], he marched to Shrewsbury, where he intended to do battle against a force there under the command of the [[Henry V of England|Prince of Wales]]. The army of his father, however, was slow to move south as well, and it was without the assistance of his father that Henry Percy and Worcester arrived at Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, where they encountered the king with a large army. The ensuing [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] was fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides, but when Henry Percy himself was struck down and killed, his own forces fled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt; 

The circumstances of Percy's death differ in accounts. The chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] stated, in his ''Historia Anglicana'', that ''while he led his men in the fight rashly penetrating the enemy host,'' [Hotspur] ''was unexpectedly cut down, by whose hand is not known.'' Another is that he was struck in the face by an arrow when he opened his vizor for a better view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=John|title=War for the Throne, the Battle of Shrewsbury|year=2010|publisher=Pen and Sword Books|page=97|isbn=978-1-84884-028-7}}Campaign Chronicles series.&lt;/ref&gt; The legend that he was killed by the Prince of Wales seems to have been given currency by [[William Shakespeare]], writing at the end of the following century.

[[File:Wressle-Castle-29042011.jpg|thumb|Shortly after Henry died in battle, his uncle was executed. An attainder was issued and the family's property, including [[Wressle Castle]] in Yorkshire, was confiscated by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Earl of Worcester was executed two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Henry, upon being brought Percy's body after the battle, is said to have wept. The body was taken by [[Baron Furnivall|Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall]], to [[Whitchurch, Shropshire]], for burial. However, when rumours circulated that Percy was still alive, the king 'had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt; That done, the king dispatched Percy's head to [[York]], where it was impaled on the [[Micklegate Bar]] (one of the city's gates), whereas his four-quarters were sent to London, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Bristol, and [[Chester]] before they were finally delivered to his widow. She had him buried in [[York Minster]] in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1936|p=714}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1404, Percy was posthumously declared a [[treason|traitor]], and his lands were forfeited to the Crown.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Marriage and issue ==
Henry Percy married [[Elizabeth Mortimer]], the eldest daughter of [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]], and his wife, [[Philippa Plantagenet, 5th Countess of Ulster|Philippa]], the only child of [[Lionel, 1st Duke of Clarence]], and [[Elizabeth de Burgh, Countess of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=341}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By her he had two children:

Sometime after 3 June 1406, Elizabeth Mortimer married, as her second husband, [[Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys]], by whom she had a son, Sir Roger Camoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1912|p=508}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=398–399}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Camoys distinguished himself as a soldier in command of the rearguard of the English army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] on 25 October 1415.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leland|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Warkworth Castle, Keep.jpg|right|thumb|225px|[[Warkworth Castle]], the home of Henry Percy]]
Henry Percy, 'Hotspur', is one of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] best-known characters. In ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', Percy is portrayed as the same age as his rival, [[Prince Hal]], by whom he is slain in single combat. In fact, he was 23 years older than Prince Hal, the future [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]], who was a youth of 16 at the date of the Battle of Shrewsbury.

The name of one of England's top football clubs, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]], acknowledges Henry Percy, whose descendants owned land in the neighbourhood of the club's first ground in the [[Tottenham Marshes]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/tyne/article_3.shtml Harry Hotspur - Home grown hero of Alnwick]&quot;, ''bbc.com'', 18 June 2014.
