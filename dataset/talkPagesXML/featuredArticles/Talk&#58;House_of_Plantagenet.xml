==Re revert of Jbeans 1226 08 June 2016==

French words entered the English language, and a further sign of the shift was the usage of names common in France instead of [[Germanic name|Anglo-Saxon names]]. Male names such as [[William (name)|William]], [[Robert]] and [[Richard]] soon became common; female names changed more slowly. The Norman invasion had little impact on [[placenames]], which had changed significantly after earlier [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Scandinavian invasions]]. It is not known precisely how much English the Norman invaders learned, nor how much the knowledge of French spread among the lower classes, but the demands of trade and basic communication probably meant that at least some of the Normans and native English were bilingual.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Conquest323&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Nevertheless, [[William the Conqueror]] never developed a working knowledge of English and for centuries afterwards English was not well understood by the nobility.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crystal &quot;Story of Middle English&quot; ''English Language''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; - you even copied the exact form of the references! (which is how I figured out it came from an article I worked on - I am one of the few editors who use that exact form of references). You need to attribute text that is copied between articles in Wikipedia (leaving aside the issue that you did not import the full references for the short citations). The big concern with your edit, however, was the large amount of information you added that was not sourced. Some of it also is quite POV - look above &quot;Still, the dynastic period of the Plantagenets saw the development of successor English languages, one of which eventually replaced the usurper Norman French.&quot; &quot;Usurper&quot; is quite POV and very much not encyclopedic. Or &quot;Here the use of English was symbolic of the ''[[Anglicisation]]'' of the government of England and an [[antidote]] to the [[Francization]] which had taken place in the decades immediately before.&quot;? Antidote? And another problem is most of this is NOT related to the dynasty/house but is instead pure history. It really has no need to be so detailed here. And &quot;During the 14th century a new style of literature emerged with the works of [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]&quot; ... Wycliffe was a theologian. Chaucer wrote works of fiction. I'm not sure how the two combined to form a &quot;new style of literature&quot; Too much unsourced and too much not relevant to an article on the dynastic house, which is what this article is about. The history of the medieval English language belongs elsewhere. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 02:43, 9 June 2016 (UTC)
{{Reflist}}
* The key is Ealdgyth's comment '''too much not relevant to an article on the dynastic house, which is what this article is about'''. A lot of work was done on this article to remove periodic history and focus this article on the family, their actions and their impact. The general history went into [[England in the Late Middle Ages]]{{mdash}}I think you may have edited the wrong article. [[User:Norfolkbigfish|Norfolkbigfish]] ([[User talk:Norfolkbigfish|talk]]) 08:56, 9 June 2016 (UTC)
::::Agreed, but [[England in the Late Middle Ages]] already has a more concise para on this. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 12:53, 2 July 2016 (UTC)
::Ealdgyth and Norfolkbigfish: thank you both for responding; I am learning much---as there is much there to assimilate. Please believe I shall be mindful of your concerns even on those points where we disagree; I hope you will feel the same. I seek a mutual exchange of discussion in good faith---and for the possibilities of learning and common ground. 

::First, to respond, it is important for me to understand you---when you said  &quot;...part of one paragraph was copied without attribution&quot;. You said &quot;part of&quot;, but your response identified a complete paragraph (my lede paragraph re &quot;Norman conquest of England&quot;---see above). '''''{*B}'' So, please, which is it? Do you mean that the ''whole paragraph'' is without attribution? ---''or only a part''?---if the latter, pls clarify which part;''' then I can reply accurately. Thank you. // [[User:Jbeans|Jbeans]] ([[User talk:Jbeans|talk]]) 00:30, 10 June 2016 (UTC) ++++++++++++++++++++2

::: It's in the part I put above - you can compare the two bits in quotations - one is the edit you made (the first quoted bit) and the second is the paragraph from the Norman conquest article (which I handily linked to the relevant section that was borrowed from). Your edit clearly incorporates several sentences from the Norman conquest article - thus &quot;part of one paragraph&quot; (i.e. part of a paragraph you put in this article). When you copy ANY text from another Wikipedia article you must say in your edit summary that you are taking information from another wikipedia article. See [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia]]. In this case &quot;attribution&quot; doesn't mean citing a source in the article - it means that you took sentence you did not write and by incorporating them into a paragraph you put here, you were in effect claiming that YOU composed those words. Clearly, this isn't the case (since you also copied the rather unique citation format I use). But THAT is only a very small part of the problem with your edits. I detailed most of them above also. You need to take on board those problems also. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 00:54, 10 June 2016 (UTC)

::::Ealdgyth, thank you for your response, but still: you haven't identified that &quot;...part of one paragraph [that] was copied without attribution&quot;---which is in your stated complaint as posted. I have read your 2nd response (and the 1st again) several times now and cannot spot  where you mean the offending flaw is located.  ''OTOH You obviously know which phrase (or phrases) you meant''; '''''{*C}'' so this is request, again, that you simply point out the phrase that was &quot;..copied without attribution&quot;.'''

::::Here is a suggestion to make it easy: below is the paragraph you have complained of (which I proposed for the lede paragraph of a short subsection on the emergence of &quot;Middle English&quot; under the reign of the Plantagenets). I have 'box'-numbered each sentence to facilitate your fingering---precisely---the flawed part.

:::::@Ealdgyth: '''''{*E}'' it been some time now since my (above) post to you---with no response from you.

::::::: But, Norfolkbigfish: Ealdgyth has '''''not answered''''' my question, even &quot;once&quot;---indeed, she has '''''not answered''''' the (same, repeated) question now ''four'' times. And the question doesn't require a (lengthy) &quot;dialog&quot; of her; actually, the opposite is true. This question/request asks simply that she back-up her claim, which is: &quot;...at least part of one paragraph was copied without attribution from Norman conquest of England&quot; (see Revision History, 8 June 2016 Ealdgyth).

::::::*The request, '''''from the very beginning,''''' has been that she point out the specific sentence, or sentences, whereby she makes her claim.

:::::::* I have already answered twice. No need to keep repeating myself. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 01:53, 17 June 2016 (UTC)


:::::::::@Ealdgyth: I agree: you have &quot;already answered twice&quot;; 

:::::::::*But, I also disagree: 

:::::::::*Much more important than the question of 'repeating yourself'(?) is the fact that you certainly appear committed ''&lt;u&gt;to avoiding&lt;u&gt;'' the question asked of you:

:::::::::*1) Yes, you have already answered twice, but on neither occasion did you answer the question asked of you; instead, you have certainly ''&lt;u&gt;avoided&lt;u&gt;'' it---five times now! 2) Indeed, it 'appears' you have replaced it with a substitute question, re-framed to read perhaps: &quot;What can be said ''&lt;u&gt;that avoids answering the actual question asked&lt;u&gt;'', and thereby will enable one to avoid having to discuss the claims one has made---or having to account for them?

:::::::::I said 'appears' because of course because I may have wrongly guessed your intent; I hope so! (But it certainly appears that you are trying to avoid discussing the claims you have made.) '''''{*G}'' Now I request of you to own your obligation as a Wikipedia editor &quot;in good faith&quot; to discuss the work made in good faith by another editor; and specifically to answer the questions ''&lt;u&gt;where?&lt;u&gt;'' and ''&lt;u&gt;why?&lt;u&gt;'' of your claims, especially if you continue to post reckless broadsides and claims that disparage another editor's work.'''

:::::::::Ealdgyth: I do not presume to know or publish your reasons or intentions---nor do I need to; I believe you yourself will disclose that information by your acts. And this time---trust you'll be pleased to know---is the last time I will ask you to identify the sentences, specifically, that caused your claims of &quot;... copied without attribution&quot;; if you choose to continue your refusal to identify the sources of your claims and to discuss, then so be it. 

:::::::::Immediately below is the new section---comprising &lt;s&gt;four&lt;s&gt; five short paragraphs---that I originally proposed for this page, and which you immediately attacked. '''''{*H}'' Please identify the individual sentences you found that are  &quot;... copied without attribution&quot;;''' and from there we can discuss the particulars and other details of your concern.

:::::::::::{{ping|Ealdgyth}}:  '''''{*I}'' It has been a week now since my ''sixth'' (and final) request of you:  to identify those specific sentences that were &quot;... copied without attribution ...&quot;'''---as you claimed on 8 June 2016 against my edit of that date. As of today, you continue to refuse to answer this question asked of you  for some time now; '''''{*J}'' in fact, you have avoided this (same) question now for three weeks since my original request of you on 09 June 2016;''' (see lede, this section, above).

:::::::::::Therefore, I can reasonably interpret that '''''you will not answer this question''''' (meaning 'the ''question asked' '', not a substitute question), '''''because you cannot'''''; that is, your claim is baseless, it was made recklessly, with no specific  evidence to support such a view. (It may be that you made an honest mistake---which I can accept if you can acknowledge.)

'''mark-line 6.1 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++6.1'''

:::::::::::'''''{*K}'' Now I will address your other claims against my edit, including, &quot;... addition of unsourced information ...&quot;.''' To do so, I must again seek your willingness to specify your vague claim, and to discuss the details it with me .

:::::::::::'''''Therefore''''', from the copy (of the ''reverted edit'') reproduced above---beginning at &quot;Middle English&quot;---'''''{*L}'' please specifically identify those sentences you believe are 'unsourced' but  should be'''''. I welcome an opportunity to discuss problems, and repair them as needed, if you will point them out. // [[User:Jbeans|Jbeans]] ([[User talk:Jbeans|talk]]) 03:53, 30 June 2016 (UTC) ++++++++++++++++++++7
:::::::::::: Well &quot;It developed out of [[Old English#History|Late Old English]], introducing dramatic changes in grammar, pronunciation and [[orthography]]. Everyday vocabulary remained mostly Germanic, enhanced with [[Old Norse]] influence, but pronunciation absorbed significant changes in the [[Middle English#Late Middle English|Late Middle English]] period, as English began to undergo the [[Great Vowel Shift]].&quot; this sentence is without a source. Also &quot;Still, the dynastic period of the Plantagenets saw the development of successor English languages, one of which eventually replaced the usurper Norman French.&quot; But that still does not address the main problem, which is the fact that the information added is not directly about the Plantagenet dynasty, rather it is about the English language during the period. It doesn't belong here (as several other editors have also pointed out. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 12:46, 30 June 2016 (UTC)

::::::::::::: Thank you, Ealdgyth, for your response. My first reaction---to your naming the two sentences above---is: Why do you feel either sentence needs sourcing? There are no facts or themes presented (in either) that are contradicted elsewhere; there are none (facts/themes) that are controversial or opposed by dissenting groups of historians or scholars. Ealdgyth, pls open the links provided in the sentences: they connect the reader to background and collateral information (already existing on other Wp pages) that support the sentence narratives.

::::::::::::: Your phrase, &quot;this sentence is without a source&quot;, is insufficient. Probably 99.99+ percent of sentences in Wp are &quot;... without a source&quot;. Sentences that actually need sourcing are actually very rare---and are not merely arbitrary.  The question for you is: ''why'' does this sentence ''need'' a source? //[[User:Jbeans|Jbeans]] ([[User talk:Jbeans|talk]]) 05:16, 2 July 2016 (UTC) ++++++++++++++++++++++8

:::::::::::::: This is a featured article - every sentence should be sourced. This can be a source after a series of sentences (when the source then covers all the preceeding sentences) but those sentences actually DO need a source. Most folks reading this will not have a clue whether it's factual or not. By providing a source, you allow the reader to follow up and see that it is trustworthy. And whether or not the information is sourced in linked articles, it needs sourcing at the article it is contained in. [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]] doesn't mean that you shouldn't provide sources for information you add. But all this is really peripheral to the fact that the information doesn't relate to the family/dynasty of the Plantagenets - they didn't enforce or require changes in the language so it's not part of the topic of the article. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 12:30, 2 July 2016 (UTC)

::::::::::::::: I do not disagree, Ealdgyth, with (the first) two themes you mention, but I am concerned with how &quot;stickily&quot; or arbitrarily they may be applied to edits that were (arbitrarily) dismissed at the get-go---or, so I believe. Both sentences are properly sourced because such is the constraint I have ''always'' endeavoured to keep in my years of copy-editing and revising at Wp. But now I am obliged to retrace my work-up of this edit---to recover the connections to source articles---that I (routinely) perform in my work. I shall commence tonight and bring the results back here, I hope, by tomorrow---certainly by the day after.

::::::::::::::: (Now, let me clarify my intentions re the third point you &amp; others mention frequently: I don't agree with you, and I  intend to engage this matter. But, I am no longer---if ever I was---a multi-tasker! So, while I shall not object if you continue to repeat &quot;my-mind-is-already-set&quot; warning---still I cannot engage the matter right now.) // [[User:Jbeans|Jbeans]] ([[User talk:Jbeans|talk]]) 00:09, 4 July 2016 (UTC) +++++++++++++++++9

::::::::::::::: '''''{*M}'' Ealdgyth: re the first ''pair of sentences'' you designated: Sentences[1], (see below), does not require attribution,''' per [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia #Where attribution is not needed|Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia]]. This editing guideline points out where attribution is ''not'' needed: as when text is &quot;content rewritten&quot;, which is the case here. It reads:  

::::::::::::::: &quot;Not everything copied from one Wikipedia page to another requires attribution. If the re-user is the sole contributor of the text at the other page, attribution is not necessary. '''Content rewritten in one's own words does not require attribution.'''&quot;---[excepting against material that is creative /copyrightable]; and,

::::::::::::::: &quot;... '''even though attribution is not required in these cases, ''including a link'' is often useful.'''&quot; 

::::::::::::::: In the present context, Sentences[1] (see below), is not &quot;copy&quot;, or &quot;copying&quot;, but instead is ''&quot;content rewritten&quot;'' per [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia #Where attribution is not needed|Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia]]. I summarized and rewrote this text from  narrative found in the lede of the article [[Middle English]], (see below)---which (narrative) is sourced to the body   of the  article (see [[Middle English #History|section History]]):

:::::::::::::::: '''Sentences[1]&gt;''' &quot;It developed out of [[Old English#History|Late Old English]], introducing dramatic changes in grammar, pronunciation and [[orthography]]. Everyday vocabulary remained mostly Germanic, enhanced with [[Old Norse]] influence, but pronunciation absorbed significant changes in the [[Middle English#Late Middle English|Late Middle English]] period, as English began to undergo the [[Great Vowel Shift]].&quot;

:::::::::::::::: ---------------------

:::::::::::::::: '''[Article]&gt;''' [[Middle English|Middle English (ME)]] refers to the varieties of the English language spoken after the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066) until the late 15th century; scholarly opinion varies but the Oxford English Dictionary specifies the period of 1150 to 1500.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Middle English–an overview - Oxford English Dictionary|url = http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-time/middle-english-an-overview/|website = Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate = 2016-01-04|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the [[High Middle Ages|High]] to the [[Late Middle Ages]].

:::::::::::::::: '''[cf]&gt;''' ''&lt;u&gt;Middle English developed out of Late [[Old English]], seeing many dramatic changes in its grammar, pronunciation and [[orthography]].&lt;u&gt;'' Writing customs during Middle English times varied widely, but by the end of the period, about 1470, aided by the invention of the printing press, a standard based on the London dialect (Chancery Standard) had become established. This largely forms the basis for Modern English spelling, although pronunciation has changed considerably since that time. Middle English was succeeded in England by the era of [[Early Modern English]], which lasted until about 1650. By that time, a variant of the [[Northumbrian dialect]] (prevalent in northern England and spoken in southeast [[Scotland]]) was developing into the [[History of the Scots language|Scots language]].

:::::::::::::::: During the Middle English period many Old English grammatical features were simplified or disappeared. This includes the reduction (and eventual elimination) of most [[grammatical case]]s, and the simplification of noun, adjective and verb [[inflection]]. Middle English also saw a mass adoption of [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] vocabulary, especially in areas such as politics, law, the arts, religion and other courtly language. '''[cf]&gt;''' &lt;u&gt;Everyday English vocabulary remained mostly Germanic, with [[Old Norse]] influence becoming apparent. Significant changes in pronunciation took place, especially in the case of long vowels and diphthongs, which in the later Middle English period began to undergo the [[Great Vowel Shift]].&lt;u&gt; [end]

::::::::::::::: One can (deliberatively) read both items above, and can see that Sentences[1] is summarized  &quot;content rewritten&quot; of existing Wikipedia narrative that is itself properly sourced. Thus, Sentences[1] is correct here---as ''unsourced''---per the &quot;content rewritten&quot; guide, [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia #Where attribution is not needed|Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia]]. It does not require attribution here.  The links provide the reader a &quot;follow-up&quot; connection to the sources, and other background material as well; I am agreeable to adding more links, or modifying them for consensus.

::::::::::::::: Ealdgyth, clearly, in the context of providing attribution to &quot;creative /copyrightable&quot; work this guideline intends to distinguish between &quot;creative /copyrightable&quot; work vs. material that need not be sourced, (eg, &quot;content rewritten&quot;). Do you agree with this point, or no?

::* {{ping|Jbeans}}{{mdash}}you still need to consider that your edits had nothing to do with the Plantagenets as individuals or a family.

=======================================================================================================
'''SUMMARY (by Jbeans) re the above thread:'''

N.B.: This thread to date is summarized below re  two issues:  &quot;... addition of unsourced informaiton&quot;, and &quot;... part of one paragraph was copied without attribution&quot;; these two are the only issues covered here. Note the following changes---all on Jbeans' edits---are made to the thread: (1) added narrative-divider lines (=====), as directly above, and  below; and (++++++, --------). (2) isolated ''three existing'' blocks of narrative: Block-A, Block-B, Block-C, for ease of locating same. (3) bolded, for emphasis, 15 existing statements by Jbeans, and marked: '''''{*A}''''', '''''{*B}''''', etc. 

*1. 12:26, 06 June 2016 (see&gt; Article.): editor Jbeans (Jb) posted a new sub-section, &quot;Middle English&quot;,  to article House of Plantagenet (HP); '''see&gt; Block-B above;'''

*2. 12:35, 06 June 2016 (see&gt; Article.): editor Ealdgyth (Ea) reverted, leaving this message: '''&quot;(revert addition of unsourced informaiton - also at least part of one paragraph was copied without attribution from Norman conquest of England)&quot;;'''

*3. 09 June 2016 (see&gt; Talk--and the same hereinafter): Jb requests that Ea specify: '''the &quot;...part of one paragraph [that] was copied without attribution&quot;.''' (see&gt; '''''{*A}''''', above).

*4. 09 June 2016: Ea replies at length, but ''does not'' identify any specific phrase or sentence that &quot;...was copied without attribution&quot;.

*5. 10 June 2016: Jb again requests that Ea identify a specific part, or such a phrase or sentence, or &quot;...whole paragraph&quot;.(see&gt; '''''{*B}''''').

-------

*6. 10 June 2016: Ea replies: &quot;In this case &quot;attribution&quot; doesn't mean citing a source in the article - it means that you took sentence you did not write and by incorporating them into a paragraph you put here, you were in effect claiming that YOU composed those words.&quot; Ea implies that Jb is, in effect, plagiarizing. 
:Ea still avoids identifying specific phrase(s) or sentence(s) that '''&quot;... was copied without attribution&quot;.'''

*7. 11 June 2016: Jb provides a copy of the offending paragraph, with sentences numbered '''(see&gt; Block-A above),''' again requesting that Ea ''simply identify'' the phrases or sentences  she sees and claims are flawed (see&gt; '''''{*D}''''').

:'''Ea ignores responding.''' Jb repeats the request twice more.

*8. 16 June 2016: Ea posts that she has no more to say re this matter.

*9. 30 June 2016: After pressing Ea to identify the flawed sentences, Jb writes: &quot;Therefore, I can reasonably interpret that '''''you will not answer this question''''' ... '''''because you cannot'''''; that is, your claim is baseless ...&quot;; (see&gt; immediately above line-mark ++++++6.1). 
 
*10. 4 July 2018: Jb turns to Ea's ''second claim''---re '''&quot;...addition of unsourced information&quot;'''---and requests Ea specify what she claims. (see&gt; '''''{*K}''''', '''''{*L}'''''). Useful dialog ensues; however, both Jb and Ea appear to sometimes use the word &quot;sourcing&quot; when they may have in mind  the activity &quot;attribution&quot;.

------

*11. 5 July 2016: Jb notes that when narrative is &quot;content rewritten&quot;, as is the case of of his edit '''(see&gt; Block-B above),''' ''then attribution is not needed''---per [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia#Where attribution is not needed]], which states:
:&quot;Not everything copied from one Wikipedia page to another requires attribution. If the re-user is the sole contributor of the text at the other page, attribution is not necessary. '''Content rewritten''' in one's own words does not require attribution.&quot; [emphasis added]; (see&gt; '''''{*M},''''' above).

:Jb requests if Ea agrees that his post is ''not &quot;copying&quot;'' that needs attribution, but is &quot;content rewritten&quot; that ''does not'' need attribution;  '''(see&gt; Block-C, immediately above ++++++10)'''. '''Ea ignores responding.'''

*12. 13 July 2016: Jb presses Ea for reply (see&gt; '''''{*N}'''''); '''Ea ignores responding.'''

*13. 24 July 2016: Jb final request for reply (see&gt; '''''{*O}'''''); '''Ea ignores responding to date.'''
