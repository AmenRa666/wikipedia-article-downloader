== death ==

Is &quot;non-responsive&quot; the same as death? If not, then George McGovern is not dead yet and there should not be a death date on his page. [[Special:Contributions/74.69.11.229|74.69.11.229]] ([[User talk:74.69.11.229|talk]]) 21:30, 17 October 2012 (UTC)
:This may be related. Apparently a technical error had a prepared article prematurely linked on a newspaper website. They state the error has since been fixed. http://www.argusleader.com/article/20121018/UPDATES/121018014/Technical-error-mistakenly-announces-McGovern-s-death [[User:Veriss1|Veriss]] ([[User talk:Veriss1|talk]]) 20:24, 18 October 2012 (UTC)

== marginal photographs ==

A number of the photographs in this article, particularly near the beginning, have only marginal (at best) relation to the subject.  A fairly modern (2000) photo of a tourist attraction in a town where he lived as a child (1928), a bomber plane that wasn't even in his unitâ€”these don't really relate, take up space, and seem to be included gratuitously, simply because they are available.  Agree? --[[User:Piledhigheranddeeper|Piledhigheranddeeper]] ([[User talk:Piledhigheranddeeper|talk]]) 15:04, 25 October 2012 (UTC)
:I disagree, unless you have better choices. There are not that many images in this article for as long as it is. [[User:Veriss1|Veriss]] ([[User talk:Veriss1|talk]]) 15:48, 25 October 2012 (UTC)
:Disagree also.  As you know, WP has an unrelentingly restrictive image policy.  Accordingly, there are no pictures of McGovern before the 1960s, when he was already in Congress or a member of the Kennedy administration.  So we can either leave the first three sections of the article without images, or we can use some that visually convey what the text is talking about.  I chose the latter approach.  The picture of the B-24 is very similar to what McGovern would have been flying - same aircraft type, same base of Italy, one of his targets of Germany, and same time period in the war.  That's definitely useful to include, and other articles do similar things.  The photo of the Corn Palace shows the most distinctive thing about McGovern's hometown; I picked the most muted one, so that it wouldn't be jarring against the black-and-white images.  The photo of the Dust Bowl is from a nearby location and is meant to illustrate to readers what it looked like, and gives a more visceral understanding of McGovern's political philosophies that emerged partly as a result.  Like Veriss said, if you come up with additional choices, such as pre-1923 copyright photo of Mitchell or a government-taken photo of McGovern from World War II, by all means bring them forward.  But until then, I think the article is better served by these photos being included than excluded.

::Loath as I am to succumb to the ''USA Today'' approach to encyclopedia composition, I note that, for example, this picture (File:Mitchell Corn Palace in 1907.jpg) of the Corn Palace, from 1907, is a lot closer in time to 1928 than the 2000 picture is.  No great problem with dust bowl picture, but I do think the bomber is a bit of a stretch. --[[User:Piledhigheranddeeper|Piledhigheranddeeper]] ([[User talk:Piledhigheranddeeper|talk]]) 18:01, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

:::The bomber is the one closest to the McGovern's time and place of any of these.  I considered the Corn Palace 1907 one but was deterred by the [[Western use of the swastika in the early 20th century]].  Also it was rebuilt in 1921, will look for one of that vintage.

== Sargent Shriver and Watergate ==

[[Sargent Shriver]] was [[George McGovern]]'s final [[running mate]], therefore Shriver should be included in the template. Also, McGovern was the target of the [[Watergate scandal]], therefore IT TOO should remain in the template. Leave it alone.--[[Special:Contributions/24.186.96.236|24.186.96.236]] ([[User talk:24.186.96.236|talk]]) 23:23, 18 May 2015 (UTC)
:Not every single thing related to McGovern needs to be in the template. Also, demanding that we &quot;leave it alone&quot; is not how this project works. Please see [[WP:CONSENSUS]] and [[WP:BRD]]. - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 00:46, 19 May 2015 (UTC)

== Hyperlinks to children ==

The one to Ann links to an author who clearly isn't GM's daughter. The one to Theresa just links to this article and so is probably unnecessary. I think I'll take some bold action and remove those. [[User:Tigerman2005|Tigerman2005]] ([[User talk:Tigerman2005|talk]]) 03:01, 26 August 2015 (UTC)

:Right you are.  I've removed these links as part of some other changes I was making.   [[User:Wasted Time R|Wasted Time R]] ([[User talk:Wasted Time R|talk]]) 10:42, 27 August 2015 (UTC)

== New book ==

New book, may be of interest for improving the article: ''The Rise of a Prairie Statesman: The Life and Times of George McGovern'' by Thomas J. Knock, 2016, Princeton University Press/ [[User:Jodi.a.schneider|Jodi.a.schneider]] ([[User talk:Jodi.a.schneider|talk]]) 20:46, 21 March 2016 (UTC)

:I'm well aware of it, but haven't had a chance yet to read it or incorporate material from it here.  It's on my list.  Note however that two earlier, lengthy published essays by Knock are used as sources here in a number of places, as is a finding from the new book that achieved advanced public attention a while back.
