The '''Philippine Constabulary Band''' was the principal military band of the [[Philippine Constabulary]], and later, as the Philippine Army Orchestra, of the Army of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Between its establishment in 1901 and dissolution during [[World War II]], it registered a reputation for musical excellence both in the Philippines and the United States, and is credited with being the first band other than the United States Marine Band to provide the musical escort to the President of the United States during a U.S. presidential inauguration. The [[Philippine Army#Service support units|Philippine Army Band]] considers itself the successor to the Philippine Constabulary Band.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
[[File:Walter Loving.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Walter Loving was the first director of the Philippine Constabulary Band.]]
The Philippine Constabulary Band was formed on the orders of [[Colonel]] Henry Allen, the first chief of the Philippine Constabulary.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoder|first1=Robert|title=In Performance: Walter Howard Loving and the Philippine Constabulary Band|date=2013|publisher=National Historic Commission of the Philippines|isbn=9715382592}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Loving]], a former [[United States Army]] regimental band leader who had been educated at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]], successfully applied for the directorship of the new organization which saw its first public performance in late 1902 at the [[Manila]] [[Elks Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot;/&gt; The band's first members were recruited by Loving from community ensembles that performed in the small towns of [[Luzon]], some of whom were former musicians in [[Spanish Army]] bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pa&quot;/&gt; Auditions for the ensemble were fierce; 300 clarinetists, for instance, tried out for just eight billets.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot;/&gt;

As the constabulary's only band, it was a fixture of ceremonial and social engagements at [[Malacañang Palace]] where it met with the appreciation of [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] [[William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Philippine Constabulary Band|url=http://himig.com.ph/features/64-the-philippine-constabulary-band|website=himig.com.ph|publisher=[[Ayala Foundation]]|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taft responded favorably to virtually all of Loving's appropriations requests for the band; his support of the group led to the unofficial moniker &quot;Taft's Own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot;/&gt;

===St. Louis World's Fair===
[[File:PCBand1905.jpg|thumb|right|Either the Philippine Constabulary Band or the Band of the Philippine Scouts, leading the Philippine Scouts during a march-in at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]
The band's first overseas performance came just three years after its formation when it accompanied the [[Philippine Scouts]] to the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] of 1904 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Four companies of Scouts had been sent to the fair to drill the [[manual of arms]] for President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who requested that the Constabulary Band play one of his favorite marches, ''[[Garryowen (air)|The Garryowen]]'', which it obliged as the president &quot;clapped heartily.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westfall|first1=Matthew|title=The Devil's Causeway|date=2012|publisher=Globe Pequot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSBwFKP904wC&amp;pg=PT173&amp;lpg=PT173&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780762787463}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Philip Sousa]], who was in attendance at the fair, was among those who heard the Philippine Constabulary Band play and remarked, &quot;I am simply amazed. I have rarely heard such playing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownell|first1=Susan|title=The 1904 Anthropology Days and Olympic Games|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803210981|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8a0e4SUEyXEC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909 U.S. presidential inauguration===
[[File:Philippine Constabulary Band.png|thumb|left|300px|The Philippine Constabulary Band assembles in a snowstorm prior to the 1909 U.S. presidential inaugural parade.]]

The Philippine Constabulary Band was the lead unit in the [[United States]] [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inaugural parade]] of 1909, which saw its former patron William Howard Taft inaugurated as president of the United States. It was the first time a band other than the [[United States Marine Band]] served as the musical escort to the [[President of the United States]]. (The Band of the Philippine Scouts appeared at the 1905 inaugural of Theodore Roosevelt, but did not lead the procession.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handy|first1=Antoinette|title=Black Women in American Bands and Orchestras|date=1999|publisher=Scarecrow|isbn=0810834197|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hila|first1=Antonio|title=Believe it or not, a Philippine band had taken part in a US presidential inaugural|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/93653/believe-it-or-not-a-philippine-band-had-taken-part-in-a-us-presidential-inaugural|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1909 inaugural parade occurred in a record-setting snowstorm, and was the first time most of the bandsmen had seen [[snow]]. Afterwards, ''The New York Times'' wrote of the band's appearance:&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearty Cheers for Philippine Band|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9900E2D61031E733A2575BC0A9659C946897D6CF|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 March 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Howard Taft 1909.jpg|thumb|upright|William Howard Taft, Governor-General of the Philippines, was an early patron of the Philippine Constabulary Band, which took-on the moniker &quot;Taft's Own.&quot;]]

{{quote|President Taft to them is still 'the big Governor,' and as an officer who is traveling with the organization expressed it last night, &quot;the President is the only man on earth these little fellows would have tramped through that blizzard for.&quot; After their hard day's work as the musical escort for President Taft, the medical officers who have them in charge were apprehensive less some of them might develop pneumonia or other pulmonary trouble from exposure to weather so foreign to their native land.}}

The day after the inauguration the band was invited to perform for the president and Mrs. Taft at the [[White House]], becoming the first band in history from outside the [[continental United States]] to perform at a White House reception.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmea&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Michael|title=Reports of Research in Music Education Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Texas Music Educators Association San Antonio, Texas, February, 2004|url=http://www.tmea.org/assets/pdf/research/TexasMusicEducationResearch_2004.pdf|website=tmea.org|publisher=Texas Music Educators Association|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is also believed this may have been the first time an African-American conducted a musical performance at the White House, Loving being African-American.)&lt;ref name=&quot;tmea&quot;/&gt;

After its inaugural engagement, the band remained in the mainland United States for several months, performing at other public events. A concert at the [[New York Hippodrome]] met with a &quot;rousing reception&quot; in which &quot;encore after encore&quot; was demanded, the band finally concluding with the overture from ''[[Tannhäuser]]'' followed by the ''[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;/&gt; On April 17, 1909, the band returned to Washington at the request of [[Helen Taft]] to perform at the opening of [[West Potomac Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Lady Helen Taft's Luneta|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/first-lady-helen-tafts-luneta/p3|website=whitehousehistory.org|publisher=White House Historical Association|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it appeared in [[Seattle]] at the [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] to herald the arrival of President Taft for his inspection of the fairgrounds. The band then traveled to [[San Francisco, California]] to depart for the return voyage to the [[Philippines]]. As their troopship was departing, Taft ordered his own vessel to pull alongside. Seeing the president's ship approach, the band struck up ''[[Hail to the Chief]]'' prompting Taft to shout back &quot;goodbye, boys – I wish you a pleasant voyage!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ah&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cunningham|first1=Roger|title=The Loving Touch|url=http://www.history.army.mil/armyhistory/AH64%28W%29.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=Army History|date=Summer 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PC Band in Seattle newspaper article.png|thumb|left|A 1909 story from the ''Spokane Daily Chronicle'' reports on the Philippine Constabulary Band's appearance at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle.]]

===Panama Pacific International Exposition===
The band's third major overseas performance came in 1915 when it was engaged to appear at the [[Panama Pacific International Exposition]] in San Francisco. Its reputation by then well-secured in the United States, the band remained stationed in California for nearly a year, during which time it performed 115 public concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Leta|title=Music and Politics in San Francisco: From the 1906 Quake to the Second World War|date=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520268911|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NbOx9VMJGIC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time it again met John Philip Sousa, who on one occasion guest conducted the band and afterwards commented, &quot;when I closed my eyes, I thought it was the United States Marine Band.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tmea&quot;/&gt;

===Changing directors===
In 1915 Walter Loving sought, and was granted, a medical disability due to worsening [[tuberculosis]]. He was replaced as director of the band by Pedro B. Navarro. Navarro had been with the PC Band since 1902, served as Loving's assistant conductor since 1904, and took over when Loving fell ill during the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;Talusan, Mary. 2013. “Music, Race, and Imperialism: The Philippine Constabulary Band at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair,&quot; Chapter 5 in ''Mixed Blessing: The Impact of the American Colonial Experience on Politics and Society in the Philippines'' edited by Hazel M. McFerson. Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by José Silos in 1918. During this period the quality of the band suffered and, in 1920, Loving returned to the Philippines to rebuild the group. As part of his long-term plan to ensure the future stability of the band, he hand-picked bandsman Alfonso Fresnido to succeed him. Fresnido was sent to [[Ohio]] to study conducting at the Dana Music Institute (now the Dana School of Music at [[Youngstown State University]]) before returning to take over the band from Loving, who retired a second time in 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot; /&gt;
[[File:PedroNavarro.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pedro Navarro was the second director of the Philippine Constabulary Band.]]

===Reorganization as Philippine Army Orchestra===
With the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] in 1935, the Constabulary Band was officially renamed the Philippine Army Orchestra and redesignated a Philippine Army unit.  (After the Constabulary was reestablished, the band was not reassigned to it). Alfonso Fresnido continued as the band's director through 1937. That year, Walter Loving accepted an invitation from President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] to again take up direction of the unit at the rank of [[lieutnant-colonel]] in the Philippine Commonwealth Army and joint appointment as &quot;Special Adviser to the President of the Philippines&quot;. The band premiered the ''Collectivista March'', a tribute march composed by Loving and dedicated to President Quezon, at [[Rizal Park|Luneta Park]] later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot; /&gt;

In 1939, the Philippine government sent the band to represent the commonwealth at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alcazaren|first1=Paoulo|title=Loving's band|url=http://www.philstar.com/modern-living/635566/lovings-band|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=[[Philippine Star]]|date=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loving retired for the third time the following year; he remained in Manila and would occasionally take up the baton as guest conductor.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot; /&gt;

===Dissolution and legacy===
The band ceased to exist following the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbook&quot; /&gt; During the course of hostilities, most of its members were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHILIPPINE MUSIC: Artist and Organization|url=http://digitaleducation.net/epa-web/philippine-music-artist-and-organization/|publisher=CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, which neither Loving nor Fresnido survived, the Philippine Army organized a new group, the &quot;Philippine Army Band&quot;, as its premier musical ensemble under the direction of Lieutenant (later, Colonel) Antonino Buenaventura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Col. Antonino Buenaventura|url=http://himig.com.ph/features/62-col-antonino-buenaventura|website=himig.com.ph|publisher=[[Ayala Foundation]]|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014  CCP ORCHESTRA AND BA ND FESTIVAL : PART I CIPANTS|url=http://culturalcenter.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-CCP-ORCHESTRA-BAND-FESTIVAL-PARTICIPANTS.pdf|website=culturalcenter.gov.ph|publisher=Government of the Philippines|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Philippine Army Band considers itself the successor to the Philippine Constabulary Band. According to it, &quot;the PA Band is the fulfilment of the first American civil governor William Howard Taft’s promise of forming a Filipino military band that would be a counterpart of the famous US Marine Band.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=When Army goes ‘do, re, mi’|url=http://www.army.mil.ph/pr/oct/051012.html|website=army.mil.ph|publisher=Philippine Army|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and reception==
The U.S. military periodical ''Army and Navy Life'' described the band as &quot;one of the finest of all military bands in the world&quot;, and the ''Pacific Coast Musical Review'' considered the band &quot;in a class by itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tmea&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=David|title=Philippine Constabulary Band Concert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63M9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA6&amp;lpg=RA2-PA6&amp;dq=%22Philippine+constabulary+band%22+finest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D87eSmd1Gw&amp;sig=zyL-JM9zTAa3_WV0FmbY8Ul8oFQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwjOmuzts-vHAhVMMYgKHVTcDvo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Philippine%20constabulary%20band%22%20finest&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=Pacific Coast Musical Review|date=20 March 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Army and Navy Life, vol. 14|pages=286|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liowAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015|year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
