'''HMS ''Barbara''''' was an [[Adonis class schooner|''Adonis'' class]] [[schooner]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and launched in 1806. A French privateer captured her in 1807 and she became the French [[privateer]] ''Pératy''. The Royal Navy recaptured her in 1808. She was [[paid off]] in June 1814 and sold in February 1815.

==Capture==
''Barbara'' was commissioned under the command of Lieutenant Edward A. D'Arcey. 

On 14 September 1807 ''Barbara'' was returning to Demerara from Devils Island when she sighted a brig making for her. When the brig did not return the recognition signals D'Arcey sailed away, with the brig in chase. Next morning the brig resumed the chase. By mid-afternoon it was apparent that ''Barbara'' could not escape so D'Arcey turned to engage his pursuer. An engagement followed; after a well-contested action of half an hour the French were able to board and capture ''Barbara''. The British lost four men killed and six wounded, two mortally.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.120.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Some French,&lt;ref name=Demerliac&gt;Demerliac (2004), p. 323, no 2757.&lt;/ref&gt; and British records give the date of the action as 17 September.&lt;ref name=Norie&gt;Norie (1827), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; The same British source describes ''Barbara'' as a cutter, and states that the action took three hours. Another French source agrees on the date 15 September, but states that ''Barbara'' had a crew of 45 men.&lt;ref name=JPM&gt;''Journal politique de Mannheim'' (10 May 1808), p.2 &amp; (26 July 1808), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

The French brig was the privateer [[Général Ernouf (ship)|''Général Ernouf'']], which was under the command of Captain [[Alexis Grassin]].&lt;ref name=Demerliac/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPM/&gt; The French then took ''Barbara'' into Guadalupe, where her new owners gave her the name ''Pératy'',&lt;ref&gt;Demerliac (2004), p.323, no. 2759.&lt;/ref&gt; intending to use her as a privateer.{{#tag:ref|Demerliac also reports that a ''Barbara'', captured on 15 September 1807, became the privateer [[Dame Ernouf (ship)|''Dame Ernouf'']].&lt;ref name=Demerliac/&gt; However, the Royal Navy captured ''Pératy'' and recognized her as ''Barbara''. A British report states that her captors took ''Barbera'' into Cayenne.&lt;ref name=Norie/&gt; |group=Note}}

==Recapture==
In July 1808, the master of an American brig claimed the protection of a convoy from Jamaica, which the 64-gun [[HMS Veteran (1787)|HMS ''Veteran'']] was escorting. The American traveled with the convoy for part of its journey, but 24 hours after leaving its protection, he betrayed the convoy's strength and course to the French.&lt;ref name=LG16172&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16172|startpage=1126|date=16 August 1808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French privateer [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''Pératy'', under the command of M.&amp;nbsp;Maurison (or Moriseau&lt;ref&gt;''Revue de Paris: journal critique, politique et littéraire'' (1843), Vol. 16, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;), took up position in the convoy's path, hoping to capture some of the ships. {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}} surprised and captured the privateer on 17 July after a chase lasting 24&amp;nbsp;hours. The privateer was found to be the former ''Barbara''. The French prize crew had sailed ''Barbara'' on to [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], where she had been refitted. As ''Pératy'', she had sailed again on 10&amp;nbsp;July having been furnished with supplies and provisions for three months of raiding. ''Pératy'' was armed with twelve 18-pounder carronades and had a crew of 90 men.&lt;ref name=LG16172/&gt;

A prize crew took ''Pératy'' to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], where the Admiralty purchased her and took her back into service. Admiral [[Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet|Sir John Borlase Warren]] renamed her ''Somers'', after Admiral Sir [[George Somers]], but the Admiralty over-ruled the renaming and ''Somers{{'}}''s name reverted to ''Barbara''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bermudian'', (1976), Vol. 46, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==British service==
In 1809 Lieutenant George Duncan took command and sailed ''Barbara'' on the North American station. His replacement, in 1812, was Lieutenant William Douglas, who sailed her on the Downs station.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

In March 1812 Lieutenant James Morgan assumed command. He spent the rest of the year cruising of the north-west coast of Ireland, and then off Boulogne. At daybreak on 11 February 1813, ''Barbara'' found herself some three miles from the Boulogne pier and near an anchored French lugger. Morgan sailed towards the lugger, which had 14 guns, with the aim of capturing her. The lugger immediately cut her cables and made to join six other luggers, each armed with eight to 14 guns. The French vessels opened fire, attempting to prevent ''Barbara{{'}}''s escape. ''Barbara'' returned fire and repulsed two attempts to board her. At 9:15 am, the French vessels, having sustained four men killed and 11 wounded, including two mortally, retreated. ''Barbara'', though much shot up, had no casualties. The next day she drove a lugger ashore and destroyed it.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, pp.79-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next month ''Barbara'' joined Admiral [[George Hope (Royal Navy officer)|George Hope's]] squadron and with it sailed to the Baltic.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; This marked the start of a busy period for her.

''Barbara'' shared with {{HMS|Musquito|1804|2}} in the capture of ''Neptune'' on 11 February 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16924|date=9 August 1814|startpage=1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|A second-class share of the prize money was worth [[£sd|£]]2 6[[shilling|s]] 6[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 3s 9d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16960|date=26 November 1814|startpage=2347}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

A month later, on 13 April, ''Barbara'' was at [[Aalborg]] where she cut out of the anchorage a ship of 400 tons, two galliots, and a sloop, loaded with grain for the Norwegian market. She escaped with these prizes though nine Danish [[Gunboat War#Danish boat design|gunboats]] pursued her, fortunately never quite getting within range of their guns.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

Next she moved to the entrance of the [[Kattegat]], where she spent several months skirmishing with Danish naval vessels and flying batteries on shore. On 18 June ''Barbara'' boarded and examined a licensed Danish merchantman while being fired on by three brigs of the Danish navy, and six gunboats.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

Then on 3 July near [[Frederikshavn|Fladstrand]] ''Barbara'' engaged in an inconclusive engagement with the Danish [[pram (ship)|praam]] ''Norge'', which was supported by several other vessels. ''Norge'', of 80 men, was armed with two 32-pounder guns and six 18-pounder carronades. The next day ''Barbara'' drove a sloop on shore near [[The Skaw]]. Later that month ''Barbara'' visited Flagstrand under a flag of truce and anchored near ''Norge''. Her captain remarked that now that he had had the opportunity to see ''Barbara'' more closely he knew how to deal with her in the future. Morgan received permission to replace two of her 18-pounder carronades with two 6-pounder [[chase gun|bow chasers]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

The next month, on 11 August, 26 of ''Barbara{{'}}''s men in her boats landed on Great Grasholm island. There they destroyed a signal station and a battery of two guns. The Danes did not resist and so there were no casualties on either side. That same day ''Barbara'' again engaged ''Norge'' and some other vessels in another inconclusive action. Although ''Barbara'' only suffered one man wounded, she was badly damaged and had to put into Hawk [[roadstead|roads]], Gotenburg. While her crew was repairing her she took on so much water that she sank. Morgan was able to refloat her a few days later. ''Barbara'' again visited Flagstrand under a flag of truce. There he encountered an officer from ''Norge'' who reported that the last encounter with ''Barbara'' had cost ''Norge'' three men killed and six wounded.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

In the early evening of 6 October, Lieutenant Richard Banks of the gun-brig {{HMS|Forward|1805|2}} received intelligence that a Danish privateer of one gun was sailing towards an anchorage about four miles from Wingo Sound near Goteborg that English merchantmen were wont to use. ''Forward'' was in company with ''Barbara'' so when Banks set out in a boat with six or seven men, Morgan joined him in a boat with an equal handful. The British found the Dane at about 9:15 pm. The Danish vessel was armed with a howitzer and had a crew of 25 men. The British succeeded in capturing the vessel, killing five Danes and wounding the captain, a lieutenant, in their attack; British losses consisted of two men killed and three wounded, including Morgan.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

Three days later, ''Barbara'' was in company of the privateer ''Hawke'', of Hastings.{{#tag:ref|This was the privateer ''Hawke'', of 86 tons (bm) and four to six 6-pounder carronades under the command of John Phillips, which had received her [[letter of marque]] on 27 June 1811.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1812privateers.org/Great%20Britain/marque1793-1815.htm Letters of Marque against France, 1793-1815]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Two gigs from ''Hawke'' captured the Danish privateer ''Aalberg'' and recaptured her prize near [[Laeso]] despite fire from the guns of three Danish gunboats and ten privateers.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16799|startpage=2167|date=6 November 1813}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recaptured vessel was the Prussian bark ''Emma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16915|startpage=1397|date=9 July 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 November ''Barbara'' captured the Danish brig ''Wenskabet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16997|startpage=563|date=25 March 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later she captured ''Minerva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17017|startpage=1024|date=30 May 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime thereafter ''Barbara'' returned to Britain. In her nine months in the Baltic, she captured or destroyed 2,544 tons (bm) of shipping, and captured 136 seamen.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==Fate==
''Barbara'' returned to Plymouth and was paid off in June 1814. (Morgan resigned his commission in July to return to Gotenburg to salvage what he could of his affairs following the bankruptcy of his prize agents there.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;) ''Barbara'' was offered for sale at Woolwich on 9 February 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16979|startpage=152|date=28 January 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sold on that day for £610.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;
