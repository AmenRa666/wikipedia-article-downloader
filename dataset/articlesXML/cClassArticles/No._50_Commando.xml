'''No. 50 Commando''' was a [[battalion]]-sized [[British Commandos|British Commando]] unit of the [[British Army during the Second World War]]. The Commando was formed in 1940, from volunteers in [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Shortly after formation it was amalgamated with [[No. 52 Commando]] and became 'D' Battalion, [[Layforce]].

==Background==
The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of [[Winston Churchill]] the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. He called for specially trained troops that would &quot;develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy occupied territory, &lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1943 their role had changed into lightly equipped assault Infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was [[Admiral]] Sir [[Roger Keyes]] himself a veteran of the landings at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Galipoli]] and the [[Zeebrugge raid]] in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].&lt;ref name=haw48/&gt;

By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for Commando training, and what became known as the [[Special Service Brigade]] was formed into 12 units called Commandos.&lt;ref name=haw48&gt;Haskew, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Each Commando would number around 450 men commanded by a [[Lieutenant Colonel]]. They were sub divided into [[Troops]] of 75 men and further divided into 15 man [[Section (military unit)|sections]].&lt;ref name=haw48/&gt; Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments and retained their own [[cap badge]]s and remained on their regimental roll for pay.&lt;ref name=mo12&gt;Moreman, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; All volunteers went through the six week intensive commando course at [[Achnacarry]]. The course in the Scottish Highlands concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions both by day and by night.&lt;ref&gt;van der Bijl, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943 the Commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed in [[Brigade]]s of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller scale raids.&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, pp.84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1940 a [[Middle East]] Commando depot was formed with the responsibility of training and supplying reinforcements for the Commando units in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
No. 50 Commando was formed in the [[Middle East]] at [[Geneifa]] in August 1940, from volunteers from units serving in the Middle East and a small number of veterans from the [[Spanish Civil War]] who had escaped to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] after the [[Battle of France|French defeat]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=mo18&gt;Moreman, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[George Young (British Army officer)|George Young]], No. 50 Commando had an establishment of a small Headquarters and three [[Troop]]s. Each Troop had four sections  of one officer and 25 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. A total of 371 all ranks.&lt;ref name=mo18/&gt;

In February 1941,  No. 50 Commando was amalgamated with [[No. 52 Commando]], when a force of Commandos under Colonel [[Robert Laycock]] was formed to carry out raids in the eastern [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=Chappell15&gt;Chappell, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; This force known as '[[Layforce]]' was drawn from 'A' Troop, [[No. 3 Commando]], [[No. 7 Commando|No. 7]], [[No. 8 (Guards) Commando|No. 8 (Guards)]], [[No. 11 (Scottish) Commando|No. 11 (Scottish)]] and the amalgamated No.50/51 Commandos.&lt;ref name=Chappell15/&gt; For reasons of security, the unit was organised into four battalions and were re-designated as such. No. 7 Commando became 'A' Battalion, No. 8 (Guards) became 'B' Battalion, No. 11 (Scottish) became 'C' Battalion and No. 50/52 became 'D' Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; As 'D' Battalion they fought in the [[battle of Crete]] and were disbanded after the survivors returned to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;
