The '''Waco CG-4A''' was the most widely used [[United States]] troop/cargo [[military glider]] of [[World War II]]. It was designated the '''CG-4A''' by the [[United States Army Air Forces]],&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimons 1978, p. 1199.&lt;/ref&gt; and named '''Hadrian''' (after the [[Hadrian|Roman emperor]]) in British military service.

Designed by the [[Waco Aircraft Company]], flight testing began in May 1942, and eventually more than 13,900 CG-4As were delivered.

==Design and development==
The CG-4A was constructed of fabric-covered wood and metal and was crewed by a pilot and copilot. It had two fixed mainwheels and a tailwheel.

The CG-4A could carry 13 troops and their equipment. Cargo loads could be a {{frac|1|4}}ton truck (i.e. a [[Willys MB|Jeep]]), a [[M116 howitzer|75&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer]], or a {{frac|1|4}}ton trailer, loaded through the upward-hinged nose section. [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]s were usually used as tow aircraft. A few [[Curtiss C-46 Commando|C-46]] tugs were used during and after [[Operation Plunder]].

The USAAF CG-4A tow line was {{convert|11/16|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[nylon]], 350&amp;nbsp;feet (107&amp;nbsp;m) long. The CG-4A pickup line was {{frac|15|16}}inch- (24&amp;nbsp;mm)-diameter nylon, but only 225&amp;nbsp;ft (69&amp;nbsp;m) long including the doubled loop.

In effort to identify areas where [[strategic material]]s could be reduced, a single '''XCG-4B''' was built at the Timm Aircraft Corporation using wood for the main structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menomineemuseum.com/glider.htm &quot;WACO CG-4A glider information.&quot;] ''World War II Glider and Military Museum''.

==Production==
From 1942-1945, the Ford Motor Company's Kingsford plant built 4,190 Model CG-4A gliders for use in combat operations during World War II. The Kingsford plant built more CG-4A gliders than any other company in the nation at much less cost than other manufacturers. The primary builders of the Model CG-4A gliders were located in Troy, Ohio; Greenville, Michigan; Astoria, New York; Kansas City, Missouri; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Kingsford, Michigan.

The 16 companies that were prime contractors for manufacturing the CG-4A were:
*[[Babcock Aircraft Company]] of [[DeLand, Florida]] (60 at $51,000 each) &lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David D.[http://www.warbirdsandairshows.com/Aircraft%20manufacturing/glidermanufacturewwii.htm &quot;WWII US glider manufacturing sites.&quot;] ''Warbirds and Airshows''.

The factories ran 24-hour shifts to build the gliders. One night-shift worker in the Wicks Aircraft Company factory in Kansas City wrote,

{{cquote|On one side of the huge bricked-in room is a fan running, on the other a cascade of water to keep the air from becoming too saturated with paint. The men man the paint sprayers covering the huge wings of the glider with the Khaki or Blue and finishing it off with that thrilling white star enclosed in a blue circle that is winging its way around the world for victory ...

The wings are first covered with a canvas fabric stretched on like wallpaper over plywood then every seam, hold, open place, closed place, and edge is taped down with the all adhesive dope that not only makes the wings airtight, but covers my hands, my slacks, my eyebrows, my hair, and my tools with a fast-drying coat that peels off like nail polish or rubs off with a thinner that burns like Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Raph, Jane Beasley.

==Operational history==
[[File:Gliders-opn-market garden.jpg|thumb|During [[Operation Market-Garden]], Waco gliders are lined up on an English airfield in preparation for the next lift to the Netherlands.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0176, Normandie, zerstörter Lastensegler.jpg|thumb|German troops examine an abandoned Waco, Normandy, June 1944]]

[[Whiteman Air Force Base]] was originally activated on 6 August 1942 as [[Sedalia Glider Base]]. In November 1942 the installation became [[Sedalia Army Air Field]] and was assigned to the 12th Troop Carrier Command of the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. The field served as a training site for glider pilots and paratroopers. Assigned aircraft included the CG-4A glider, [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]], and [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]. The C-46 was not used as a glider tug in combat, however, until [[Operation Plunder]] (the crossing of the Rhine) in March 1945.

CG-4As went into operation in July 1943 during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. They were flown 450 miles across the Mediterranean from North Africa for the night-time assaults such as [[Operation Ladbrooke]]. Inexperience and poor conditions contributed to the heavy losses. They participated in the [[American airborne landings in Normandy]] on 6 June 1944, and in other important airborne operations in [[Europe]] and in the [[China Burma India Theater]]. Although not the intention of the Army Air Forces, gliders were generally considered expendable by high-ranking European theater officers and combat personnel and were abandoned or destroyed after landing. While equipment and methods for extracting flyable gliders were developed and delivered to Europe, half of that equipment was rendered unavailable by certain higher-ranked officers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Despite this lack of support for the recovery system, several gliders were recovered from Normandy and even more from [[Operation Market Garden]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Wesel (district)|Wesel]], Germany.

The CG-4A found favor where its small size was a benefit. The larger British [[Airspeed Horsa]] could carry more troopers (seating for 28 or a jeep or an [[anti-tank gun]]), and the British [[General Aircraft Hamilcar]] could carry 7 tons (enough for a [[light tank]]), but the CG-4A could land in smaller spaces. In addition, by using a fairly simple grapple system, an in-flight C-47 equipped with a tail hook and rope braking drum could &quot;pick up&quot; a CG-4A waiting on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oiUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Popular+Science+%22Silent+Partner+of+the+Plane%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q3LElSAVwy&amp;sig=02LiVhepb91N93M8mxNpZktD_0k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9n8PUZqaBIyBrQGE_oCICQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%20%22Silent%20Partner%20of%20the%20Plane%22&amp;f=true &quot;Silent Partner of the Plane.&quot;] ''Popular Science,'' February 1944, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was used in the 1945 high-elevation rescue of the survivors of the ''[[Gremlin Special]]'' 1945 crash, in a mountain valley of New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Glider rescue from New Guinea Shangril-la.&quot; ''The Sydney Morning Herald,'' 2 July 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CG-4A was also used to send supplies to [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisan]]s in [[Yugoslavia]].

After World War II ended, most of the remaining CG-4As were declared surplus and almost all were sold. Many were bought for the wood in the large shipping boxes. Others were bought for conversion to towed camping homes with the wing and tail end cut off and being towed by the rear section and others sold for hunting cabins and lake side vacation cabins.

The last known use of the CG-4A was in the early 1950s by the USAF with an Arctic detachment aiding scientific research. The CG-4As were used for getting personnel down to, and up from, floating ice floes, with the glider being towed out, released for landing, and then picked up later by the same type of aircraft, using the hook and line method developed during World War II. The only modification to the CG-4A was the fitting of wide skis in place of the landing gear for landing on the Arctic ice floes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true &quot;Ice Cube Airport.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1952, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several thousand spectators had gathered for the first public demonstration of the St. Louis-built glider, which was flown by 2 [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] crewmen and carried St. Louis mayor [[William D. Becker]], Robertson Aircraft co-founder Maj. [[William B. Robertson]], and 6 other VIP passengers; all 10 occupants perished in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;Mayor and 9 Die in St. Louis Glider Crash&quot;, ''The Dallas Morning News'', Dallas, Texas, Monday 2 August 1943, Number 306, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The accident is attributed to the failure of a defective wing strut fitting that had been provided by a subcontractor; the post-crash investigation indicts Robertson Aircraft for lax [[quality control]], and several inspectors are relieved of duty.&lt;ref name=Gero_24-25/&gt;
