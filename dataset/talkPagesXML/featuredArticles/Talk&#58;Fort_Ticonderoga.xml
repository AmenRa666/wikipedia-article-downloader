Look again. There is a statement saying that their article is from Wikipedia. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 06:26 May 12, 2003 (UTC)

: Perhaps we need to go after them then, for apparently claiming copyright on GFDL work. About time the shoe goes on the other foot. ;) -- [[User:JohnOwens|John Owens]] 06:41 May 12, 2003 (UTC)

I don't think they were claiming copyright over the article, just the rest of their site.

Hi all. Just added one of my all time favorite quotes. &quot;Where a goat can go, a man can go, where a man can go, he can drag a gun&quot;

actually it says on that site that their aticle was from Wiki...

==Ticonderoga during the French and Indian War==
It seemes to me that this section has been vandalised. It doesn't make sence, but when I look at the history, I see big sections have been removed. [[User:Shauni|Shauni]] 20:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
:You seem to be right.  Since there haven't really been any positive addintions since that edit done I've reverted back to an edit in September.  I also re-added the translation link you provided yesterday. --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 13:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

I am most displeased by the slanted view in this article, which does not service history kindly.  The fort was a high caliber structure built by the French with a state of the art design and considered the key to protecting New France's underbelly.  It was not some ramshackle British wooden fort like Fort William Henry.  Furthermore the British's unusual incompetence in the management of the Fort, which aided in its capture by militia should not in any way take away from the significance.  In fact it should be observed as the first in a long line of unusual British military incompetence which spanned the war.  After the French blew up the magazine and burned the buildings, the British fully rebuilt it so it was not in disrepair when the Americans seized it.  The British were so embarrassed by the loss of the fort that they relieved the commander of the force of duty and spent every effort recapturing and defending it.  Also the last British commander's decision to withdraw to Canada after the loss of the Saratoga Campaign is further incompetence.  He should have defended the position in case of a second invasion and the fort was the the principal entrance to Canada by the Americans just as it had been for the British in the earlier war between Britain and France.

== Name change ==

When exactly was the fort's name changed from Carillon to Ticonderoga, and why? Was Ticonderoga the name the British called it? [[User:Funnyhat|Funnyhat]] 22:41, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

     Carillion = French Name
     Ticonderoga = British Name  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:DeYoung9|DeYoung9]] ([[User talk:DeYoung9|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/DeYoung9|contribs]]) 05:19, 9 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Photos needed==
The one pic in the article now is not a very good one.  Multiple pics, inside and out, would be helpful. [[User:Doncram|doncram]] ([[User talk:Doncram|talk]]) 00:03, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
:Article has a gallery of pictures (some recent). ''[[User:Magicpiano|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:khaki;color:firebrick;&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt;]]''[[User_talk:Magicpiano|♪piano]] 16:30, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

== coordinates ==

There are two sets of coordinates here, one in the infobox and the other at the bottom.  Both are superimposed above the infobox.  They don't match.  I don't know which is more accurate and should be left. [[User:Lvklock|Lvklock]] ([[User talk:Lvklock|talk]]) 14:03, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

*They are both equally accurate - the fort is big enough that it encompasses both points.  I'm pretty sure there isn't a Wikipedia standard for what part of a large structure the coordinates listed should refer to, so pick the one you like best (or you can split the difference and get the center of the fort).  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:CruiserBob|CruiserBob]] ([[User talk:CruiserBob|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/CruiserBob|contribs]]) 04:20, 12 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==One Last Battle==

I found this section really unclear. It gave me the impression the American's attacks were failing and they withdrew, but then annouced they had freed prisoners and killed a lot of the British.
Could it be rewritten to make it easier to understand and follow the narrative?
Speaking as an impartial person who wanted to read about the Fort's History, this section was not easy to understand and left me feeling confused about what happened.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.107.57.81|88.107.57.81]] ([[User talk:88.107.57.81|talk]]) 14:19, 7 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Thanks for your feedback, I'll look at it.  The prisoners and such that were freed were ''outside'' the fort (which was not large enough to hold the British garrison, never mind the prisoners); the American attempt to take the fort itself is what failed.

== Starship Troopers ==

Just a query, but I spotted this on the main page and I had to ask. Is this where the station name in Starship Troopers came from? --&lt;font color=&quot;#009000&quot;&gt;[[User:Thejadefalcon|Thejadefalcon]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#03C03C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Thejadefalcon|&lt;sup&gt;''Sing your song''&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00A550&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Thejadefalcon|&lt;sub&gt;''The bird's seeds''&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 10:55, 27 October 2009 (UTC)</text>
