[[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Alwyn Ragnar Garrett''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]] (12 February 1900&amp;nbsp;– 4 November 1977) was a senior commander in the [[Australian Army]]. He served as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS) from 1958 to 1960. Born in [[Western Australia]], Garrett graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1921. He was [[adjutant]] and [[quartermaster]] in several [[regiment]]s of the [[Australian Light Horse]] before undertaking staff training in England, which he completed just as the Second World War broke out. Garrett joined the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] soon afterwards, and commanded the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Battalion]] in England before seeing action with Australian [[brigade]]s in [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] and [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] in 1941. Promoted to [[colonel]] the following year, he held senior staff positions with [[I Corps (Australia)|I&amp;nbsp;Corps]] in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[II Corps (Australia)|II&amp;nbsp;Corps]] on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]] in 1944–45. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for his staff work.

After the war, Garrett served two terms as commandant of the [[Army Command and Staff College, Queenscliff|Staff College, Queenscliff]], in 1946–47 and 1949–51. Between these appointments he was posted to Japan with the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. Promoted [[major general]], he became [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC) [[5th Military District (Australia)|Western Command]] in August 1951, and [[Deputy Chief of Army (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]] in January 1953. He took over Southern Command as a [[lieutenant general]] in October 1954, and was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1957. As CGS from March 1958, Garrett focused on rearmament and reorganisation, initiating the Army's short-lived restructure into a &quot;[[Pentropic organisation|pentropic]]&quot; formation. He was [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in 1959. After retiring from the military in June 1960, Garrett became [[Honorary Colonel]] of the [[Royal Australian Regiment]], and was principal of the [[Australian Administrative Staff College]]  until 1964. He died at [[Mornington, Victoria|Mornington]], Victoria, in 1977.

Following a three-month course at Staff College, Camberley, Garrett was appointed commandant of the [[Army Command and Staff College, Queenscliff|Staff College, Queenscliff]], Victoria, in June 1946.&lt;ref name=List/&gt; He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in July. The size and scope of the occupation declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Approximately 2,400 Australians, most from the [[67th Battalion (Australia)|67th Battalion]], remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo, ''The Australian Army'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 164–166&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Promoted temporary [[major general]], he was appointed [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC) [[5th Military District (Australia)|Western Command]], which covered the state of [[Western Australia]], in August 1951.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo, ''The Australian Army'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Deputy Chief of Army (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]] in February 1953.&lt;ref name=List/&gt;

In December 1953, Garrett succeeded Major General [[Eric Woodward]] as Adjutant-General and Second Military Member of the Military Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48931449 |title=Army changes |newspaper=The Advertiser |date=20 October 1953 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted temporary [[lieutenant general]] in October 1954 and appointed GOC Southern Command, which covered [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], and [[Tasmania]] and was, as of April 1953, the superior headquarters for several major [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizen Military Forces]] (CMF) formations including the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Brigade (Australia)|4th]] and [[6th Brigade (Australia)|6th Infantry Brigades]], the [[2nd Armoured Brigade (Australia)|2nd Armoured Brigade]], and two artillery groups.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 224, 238&lt;/ref&gt; His elevation to lieutenant general was made permanent in December 1954.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Garrett was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] on 13 June 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=41090 |date=13 June 1957|startpage=3407|supp=yes |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded Lieutenant General [[Henry Wells (general)|Sir Henry Wells]] as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS) on 23 March 1958.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Press&gt;{{cite media release |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media%2Fpressrel%2FHPR01001879%22|title=Chief of the General Staff&amp;nbsp;– extension of service|author=[[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]]|date=7 May 1959|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett was raised to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1959 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=41590 |date=1 January 1959 |startpage=38|supp=yes |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army underwent significant change during Garrett's term as CGS.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In March 1959, he chaired the first meeting of the Military Board at the new Army Headquarters in [[Canberra]], following its move from Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103093608 |title=Military Board in new headquarters|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=7 March 1959 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103127850 |title=Second Army move begins next Monday |newspaper=The Canberra Times |date=12 August 1959 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That August, he announced to his senior officers a radical reorganisation of the Army that would strengthen the regular forces and reduce reliance on the CMF, which since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] had formed the backbone of Australia's military. This plan included the abolition of [[National Service Act 1951|National Service]], to which the Federal government had already agreed, and the introduction of a &quot;[[Pentropic organisation|pentropic]]&quot; divisional structure.&lt;ref name=Horner176&gt;Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett championed the pentropic structure to overcome what he saw as the weakness of the traditional battalion for overseas deployments, and to ensure compatibility with the [[US Army]]'s [[pentomic]] formations. The Australian Army's traditional &quot;triangular&quot; divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters was to be replaced with an organisation consisting of five larger battalions (hence &quot;pentropic&quot;) without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters.&lt;ref name=Grey204&gt;Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 204–207&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was opposed by CMF officers as it would result in the disbandment of the citizens' brigades and many of the old militia battalions.&lt;ref name=Horner176/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grey204/&gt; Under the new structure the CMF would not only shrink, its units would lose traditional ties to local communities through the establishment of new multi-battalion state-based regiments, leading to suspicions that the entire process was designed to demolish the CMF.&lt;ref name=Grey204/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett was concerned not only with changing the Army's organisation but with upgrading its equipment; by the early 1960s the Army would acquire the [[FN FAL|FN 7.62mm rifle]], the [[M60 machine gun]], the [[M101 howitzer|M101 105mm howitzer]], the [[M113 armoured personnel carrier]], and new mortars and radios.&lt;ref name=Grey204/&gt; He also advocated strongly for the Army to operate its own helicopters and light aircraft; the [[Australian Army Aviation Corps]] was eventually established in July 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 295, 302&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett was scheduled to retire from the Army on his sixtieth birthday in February 1960 but the government extended his term.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt; He retired on 30 June 1960 and was succeeded by Lieutenant General [[Reg Pollard (general)|Reg Pollard]], whom Garrett had recommended for the post in the face of opposition from the [[Department of the Army (Australia)|Minister for the Army]], [[John Cramer (Australian politician)|John Cramer]], who had attempted to appoint Major General [[Ivan Dougherty]], a retired CMF officer.&lt;ref name=Horner194&gt;Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; Although Garrett's proposed reorganisation of the Army along pentropic lines went ahead under Pollard, it proved short-lived. The US Army abandoned the system in June 1961, and the Australian Army returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General [[John Wilton (general)|Sir John Wilton]], in October 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 419–420&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Upon retiring from the military, Garrett became principal of the [[Australian Administrative Staff College]], a private institution delivering courses to senior business and government personnel at [[Mount Eliza, Victoria|Mount Eliza]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dS9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QuYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1896%2C2368708|title=Garrett to Head Staff College|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=5 January 1960|page=7|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his four-year tenure, he lobbied for the reintroduction of conscription, and when the Federal government brought in a new [[National Service Act 1964|selective service scheme]] in 1965, he was invited to draw the first ballot of names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104286291 |title=Army call-up suggestion |newspaper=The Canberra Times |date=6 November 1963 |accessdate=19 May 2015 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105860929 |title=First 1966 call-up draw tomorrow |newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=9 September 1965 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett also advocated that the Army should have a division ready for war at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104286180 |title=Defence spending 'should increase' |newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=5 November 1963 |accessdate=19 May 2015 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[honorary colonel]] of the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] and the [[Royal Western Australia Regiment]] from 1960 until 1965, when he was appointed Chairman of the Western Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, a position he held until 1970.  He died on 4 November 1977 at [[Mornington, Victoria|Mornington]], Victoria, and was cremated. His wife had died earlier, and he was survived by his two children.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
