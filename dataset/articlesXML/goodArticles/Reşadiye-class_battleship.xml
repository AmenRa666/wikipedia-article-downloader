The '''''Reşadiye'' class''' was a group of two [[dreadnought battleship]]s ordered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] from Britain in the 1910s. The design for the ships was based on the British {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1911)|0}} battleships, although it incorporated several significant improvements. They carried the same {{convert|13.5|in|adj=on}} main battery guns as the British ships, but their secondary battery consisted of {{convert|6|in|adj=on}} guns, compared to the British vessels' {{convert|4|in|adj=on}} pieces. The first ship, ''Reşadiye'', was laid down in 1911 and completed in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]]; she was seized by the British [[Royal Navy]] and commissioned as {{HMS|Erin}}. The second ship, ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'', had only been ordered in April 1914 and little work had been done by the start of the war, so she was quickly broken up for scrap.

''Erin'' served with the [[Grand Fleet]] for the duration of the war, and saw action at the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May &amp;ndash; 1 June 1916. She holds the dubious distinction of being the only British [[capital ship]] engaged in the battle to not fire its main battery. The vessel served briefly as the [[flagship]] of [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore|The Nore]] in 1919, but her career was cut short by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. She was scrapped under the terms of the treaty in 1922&amp;ndash;23.

==Background==
[[File:SMS Kurfuerst Friedrich Wilhelm 1900-2.jpg|thumb|left|The German battleship {{SMS|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm||2}}, purchased in 1910 and renamed ''Barbaros Hayreddin'']]
The [[Ottoman Navy]] had languished since the 1870s, the result of decades of little funding for new ships, poor maintenance of existing vessels, and no serious training regimen. Efforts to modernize the fleet had occurred in fits and starts during the period, including the failed attempt to build the [[pre-dreadnought]] {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Abdül Kadir||2}} in the 1890s, and a major reconstruction program launched in the aftermath of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897, which had highlighted the poor condition of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 388–391&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1909, the Ottoman government began to seriously look for warships to purchase from foreign shipbuilders to counter the growing strength of the [[Greek Navy]], particularly the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Greek cruiser|Georgios Averof||2}}. As a stopgap measure, two German {{sclass-|Brandenburg|battleship|1}}s, ''[[SMS Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm|Barbaros Hayreddin]]'' and ''[[SMS Weissenburg|Turgut Reis]]'', were purchased in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, pp. 16&amp;ndash;17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman government then began looking for newer vessels to buy in late 1911, and first contacted [[Armstrong Whitworth]] about the possibility of acquiring the dreadnought [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']], then under construction for the [[Brazilian Navy]], along with {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}}, which had been commissioned into the Brazilian fleet in 1910. These deals fell through, so the Ottomans contacted [[Vickers]] to order two new battleships. [[Douglas Gamble]], who had previously served as a naval adviser to the Ottoman government, prepared two designs, the first of which was ordered as ''Mehmed Reşad V''; during construction, this ship was renamed ''Reşadiye''.&lt;ref name=LG17&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A second ship, to be named ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'', was ordered in April 1914.&lt;ref name=LG141&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordering the ''Reşadiye'' class started a significant naval [[arms race]] between the Ottoman Empire and Greece. The Greek Navy ordered the battleship {{ship|Greek battleship|Salamis||2}} in 1912 in response,&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; which prompted the Ottomans to resume their bid for ''Rio de Janeiro''. The contract to purchase the ship, to be renamed ''Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel'', was signed in January 1914. This in turn provoked the Greeks to order a second battleship, ''[[List of battleships of Greece#Vasilefs Konstantinos|Vasilefs Konstantinos]]'', which required a third Ottoman battleship to be ordered; this was the second ''Reşadiye''-class ship, ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, pp. 384, 388, 391&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Iron Duke class battleship - Jane's Fighting Ships, 1919 - Project Gutenberg etext 24797.png|thumb|Line-drawing of the British ''Iron Duke'' class; ''Reşadiye'' was very similar to this design]]
The design for the ''Reşadiye'' was based on the contemporary British {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1911)|4}}, with some improvements that had been incorporated into the subsequent {{sclass-|Iron Duke|battleship|4}} then under construction. Compared to the British ships, the ''Reşadiye''s carried their [[amidships]] main battery turret one deck higher, which improved its ability to be fired in heavier seas. They also carried a heavier secondary battery, composed of {{convert|6|in|abbr=on}} guns instead of the {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}} weapons in the ''King George V'' class. The hull was shorter and wider than the British ships, which improved her turning radius, but the lower displacement forced compromises in armor protection and coal capacity.&lt;ref name=GG36/&gt;

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ''Reşadiye'' design was {{convert|525|ft}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|559|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. The ships had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28|ft|10|in|abbr=on}}, with a designed displacement of {{convert|23000|MT}}.&lt;ref name=GG388&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In service, ''Erin'' displaced {{convert|22780|MT|abbr=on}} normally and up to {{convert|25250|MT|abbr=on}} at full load. ''Erin'' was completed with a single tripod mast atop the [[conning tower]], fitted with a [[spotting top]] to aid in gun-laying. She had a crew of 1,070&amp;nbsp;officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=GG36&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships were powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, with steam provided by fifteen [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] mixed coal and oil-fired [[water-tube boiler]]s. The boilers were trunked into a pair of closely spaced [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] directly aft of the conning tower. The engines were rated at {{convert|26500|shp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=GG388/&gt; ''Erin'' carried {{convert|2120|MT|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|710|MT|abbr=on}} of [[fuel oil]], and she had a cruising radius of {{convert|5100|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=GG36/&gt;

===Armament and armor===
As designed, the ''Reşadiye'' class was armed with a main battery of ten {{convert|13.5|in|adj=on}} 45-caliber guns and sixteen {{convert|6|in|abbr=on}} 50-caliber guns, and four {{convert|21|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=LG141/&gt; The 13.5&amp;nbsp;in guns were the [[BL 13.5-inch Mk V naval gun|Mark VI type]] manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth, and they were mounted in five twin turrets, all on the centerline. The first two were in a [[superfiring]] pair forward, one amidships directly aft of the funnels, and the last two were in another superfiring pair, aft of the rear conning tower. The 6&amp;nbsp;in guns were mounted individually in [[casemate]]s along the upper deck, eight to each beam. The torpedo tubes were submerged in the hull, two on each side of the ship. As completed, a number of smaller guns were added to ''Erin'', including six 6-pounder {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} guns and two {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} Mk I [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.&lt;ref name=GG36/&gt;

The ships were protected with an [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|12|in|abbr=on}} thick in the central portion, and reduced to {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}} on either end of the ship. The transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s that connected the ends of the belt were {{convert|8|in|abbr=on}} thick. Horizontal protection consisted of an armored deck that was {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} thick over the central part of the ship, where it covered the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces, and reduced to {{convert|1.5|in|abbr=on}} thick elsewhere. The forward conning tower had 12&amp;nbsp;in thick sides. The main battery gun turrets had {{convert|11|in|abbr=on}} thick faces, while the [[barbette]]s that supported them had {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} thick sides, with the lower section behind the main belt reduced to 3&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;ref name=GG36/&gt;

==Ships==
[[File:Launch of Reşadiye.png|thumb|''Reşadiye'' at her launching]]

The first ship of the class, ''Reşadiye'', was ordered on 8 June 1911. Work stopped in 1912 following the start of the [[First Balkan War]] due to the probability that the Ottoman government would run out of funds. Work resumed in May 1913 following the conclusion of the conflict. The second ship, ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'', was ordered on 29 April 1914 in response to the Greek order for ''Vasilefs Konstantinos'' in early 1914. The British government ordered work to stop in late July 1914, as a result of the growing tensions that culminated in the outbreak of [[World War I]] on the 28th; what material that had been assembled was dismantled on the [[slipway]] in August.&lt;ref name=LG141/&gt;&lt;ref name=GG388/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As it turned out, ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'' was laid down the day before ''Vasilefs Konstantinos''. See: Gardiner &amp; Gray, pp. 384, 391&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some confusion over the number and name of ships that were part of the ''Reşadiye'' class. Some sources report ''Reşadiye'' and ''Mehmed Reşad V'' as having been different ships;&lt;ref name=GG388/&gt; these were in fact the same vessel, ordered originally under the latter name.&lt;ref name=LG17/&gt; Similarly, ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'' is sometimes listed as ''Fatik''&lt;ref name=GG388/&gt; or ''Fatih''.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Another ship, ''Reshad-i Hammiss'', is sometimes reported to have been ordered in 1911 and cancelled in 1912,&lt;ref name=GG36/&gt; though according to Bernd Langensiepen and Ahmet Güleryüz in their authoritative ''The Ottoman Steam Navy'', the Ottomans initially only had ordered one vessel.&lt;ref name=LG17/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:HMS Erin (1913).jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Erin'' in 1918]]

By 21 July 1914, the British had postponed delivery of ''Reşadiye'' and ''Sultan Osman-ı Evvel'' as tensions flared in Europe following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] on 28 June. This action prompted a protest by [[Djemal Pasha]], the Ottoman naval minister, via France, in the hopes of securing the ships' delivery. A transport ship carrying crews for the two battleships departed [[Constantinople]] on 4 August, only to be recalled on 7 August after the Ottoman government was informed that the dreadnoughts would not be delivered.&lt;ref&gt;Langensiepen &amp; Güleryüz, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] ordered the [[Royal Navy]] to detain the two ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors boarded the ships and formally seized them. Since Britain was not yet at war, these actions were illegal; the British government nevertheless determined to present the Ottomans with a ''[[fait accompli]]''. On 3 August, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire informed the government that Britain had seized the ships.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, pp. 57&amp;ndash;58&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reşadiye'' and ''Sultan Osman-ı Evvel'' were then pressed into British service. ''Reşadiye'' was completed that month and commissioned as HMS ''Erin'', with ''Sultan Osman-ı Evvel'' entering service as HMS ''Agincourt''. In September, ''Erin'' joined the 2nd Battle Squadron of the [[Grand Fleet]], where she served for the duration of the conflict. She took part in the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May &amp; 1 June 1916.&lt;ref name=GG36/&gt; There, she was the fourth ship in the British [[line of battle]], along with her three surviving ''King George V''-class half-[[sister ship|sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; She did not fire her main battery during the battle, the only British capital ship not to do so during the engagement;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; her secondary battery fired only six shells.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, fire control directors were installed, and she received flying off platforms atop her forward superfiring and amidships turrets. After the end of the war, ''Erin'' was assigned to the [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore|Nore Reserve]] and served as its [[flagship]]. Her postwar career was cut short by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], signed in February 1922, which mandated significant draw downs in naval strength for the signatories.&lt;ref name=GG36/&gt; The Royal Navy had originally intended to keep ''Erin'' as a training ship under the terms of the treaty, but a change of plans led to {{HMS|Thunderer|1911|6}} taking her place as the training ship, which meant that ''Erin'' had to be scrapped. The ship was sold for scrap in December 1922, and subsequently broken up by the ship breaking firm Cox and Daniels, which finished scrapping ''Reşadiye'' in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;
