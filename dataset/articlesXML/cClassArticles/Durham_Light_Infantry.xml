The '''Durham Light Infantry''' (D.L.I.)  was a [[light infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]] in existence from 1881 to 1968. It was formed in 1881 under the [[Childers Reforms]] by the amalgamation of the [[68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry)]] and the [[106th Regiment of Foot (Bombay Light Infantry)]] along with the [[Militia and Volunteers of County Durham]].

The regiment served notably in the [[Second Boer War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]] and the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]]. During times of peace it had duty in India, China, West Germany and Cyprus.

In 1968, the regiment was amalgamated with the [[Somerset and Cornwall Light Infantry]], the [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry]] and the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] to form [[The Light Infantry]], which again amalgamated in 2007 with the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]], the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] and the [[Royal Green Jackets]] to form a new [[large regiment]], [[The Rifles]], which continues the lineage of the regiment.

==Formation==
{{see also|List of battalions of the Durham Light Infantry}}
As part of the [[Cardwell Reforms|Cardwell]] and [[Childers Reforms]] of the British Army's regiments, in 1881 the [[68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry)]] and the [[106th Regiment of Foot (Bombay Light Infantry)]] became the 1st and 2nd battalions of the '''Durham Light Infantry'''.  Both already had their depots at [[Sunderland Barracks]] in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], as was the Brigade Depot (No. 3).&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] battalions{{snd}}the 1st Durham Fusiliers and 2nd North Durham Militia{{snd}}became the 3rd and 4th battalions of the new regiment, with their depots in [[Barnard Castle]] and [[Durham, England|Durham City]].&lt;ref&gt;Vane p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; The five [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] battalions of Durham Rifle Volunteers{{snd}}the 1st to 4th Administrative battalions of the Durham Rifle Volunteers and the 3rd Durham Rifle Volunteer Corps{{snd}}became the 1st to 5th Volunteer battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Vane pp. 306—307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 263—264&lt;/ref&gt;

A new regimental badge was to be worn, a [[Tudor rose]], this was never worn on any article of clothing, but did appear on the colours until 1934. Instead the light infantry bugle horn was modified with a crown and the regiment's abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;Ward 246—247&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was designed to permit one regular battalion of a regiment to be stationed at home, providing trained recruits for the other on overseas service.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1881–99===
On formation of the regiment the 1st Battalion was in India at [[Meerut]] and the 2nd Battalion was in Ireland at [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vane121&quot;&gt;Vane p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the new regiment still maintained a separate and independent existence, as they had since being grouped together in 1873, however the introduction of shorter service (six years, then another six in the reserves) and the increase in cross posting of officers in the linked regular and Militia battalions, increased the assimilation into a single regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 245–254&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1882 the 2nd Battalion was sent to the garrison the Mediterranean, being split between [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], it was reunited in March 1883 at Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vane121&quot;/&gt;

In 1884, the Depot moved from Sunderland to [[Fenham Barracks]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] which it shared with the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] as there was no suitable site near Durham City &quot;which could not be relied upon as not being undermined&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; The move was not popular as it took the Depot out of the County, it was not to return until 1939, when it was transferred to [[Brancepeth Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 251—252&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885 the 2nd Battalion was transferred to Egypt to take part in the [[Mahdist War]] and was employed with the force under General Stephenson to repel attacks on the railway between Wadi Halfa and Akasha,&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; fighting at the [[Battle of Ginnis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vane pp. 122–127&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, while securing one of the Arab's [[Dahabeah|nuggers]] (supply boats), an Arab child of about two years was found by the battalion's mounted infantry. Brought back and baptised as James Francis Durham (Jimmy Durham) he would enlist with the regiment and become a corporal of buglers before dying in August 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vane p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=B.B.C.|title=BBC Where I Live|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/roots/2003/10/jimmydurham.shtml|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1887, the 2nd Battalion sailed from [[Suez]] to India, while in March the 1st Battalion returned from there to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Vane pp.126—127&lt;/ref&gt;

While in India, the 2nd Battalion came to dominate the Indian polo scene, winning 17 tournaments against &quot;rich men's regiments&quot; and cavalry regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897 and 1898, it assisted in combating outbreaks of the plague in [[Poona]] and [[Bombay]].&lt;ref&gt;Vane pp. 132–134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boer War===
The 1st battalion was dispatched from Britain to South Africa to take part in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]], arriving in November 1899, after local forces had been besieged in [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]], and the British forces stationed there had been surrounded in the town of [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was involved in General [[Redvers Buller]]'s unsuccessful attempts to approach Ladysmith across the Teluga river, in reserve for the [[Battle of Colenso]],&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; launching diversionary attacks to the east of [[Battle of Spion Kop|Spion Kop]],&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; and in early February attacked [[Battle of Vaal Krantz|Vaal Krantz]] with the battalion taking two hills of the ridge, before the position was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was in a supporting role for the [[Relief of Ladysmith]]&lt;ref name=&quot;vc10&quot;&gt;Vane ch10&lt;/ref&gt; and took little part in the offensive that ended with the annexation of the Transvaal in September 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

The war now became one of guerilla raids by the Boers against the British forces and their lines of communication. The battalion was deployed guarding a section of railway line in the Transvaal, while sending two platoon sized units to the mounted infantry.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 303–304&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the battalion was joined or reinforced by other units from the regiment. One company from the 2nd battalion came from India in January 1900 and formed part of the Burmah Mounted Infantry,&lt;ref name=&quot;vc10&quot;&gt;Vane ch10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; seeing action at [[Sanna's Post]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 309–311&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd and 4th battalions were embodied and also served in South Africa, the 3rd arriving in February 1900, where it guarded lines of communications in the Cape Colony and the Orange Free State, escorted convoys and garrisoned Dewetsdorp for 6 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vane p299&quot;&gt;Vane p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th arrived in February 1902 and was split into detachments serving in many places, and a mounted infantry company, which escorted convoys. The 4th returned to Britain in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vane p299&quot;/&gt; The volunteer battalions supplied contingents to form three special service companies, reinforcing the 1st battalion, which served individually between from March 1900 to April 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vane p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre First World War===
[[File:9th DLI colour party 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Colour party of the 9th Battalion Durham Light Infantry after receiving new colours from King Edward VII, 19 June 1909.]]
The 1st battalion and the company from the 2nd left South Africa for India at the end of October 1902, and on 15 November both battalions met at Calicut, before the 2nd battalion, which had been guarding Boer prisoners, left for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, as part of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907|Territorial Forces Act]], the 3rd and 4th battalions exchanged numbers and were recast as the 3rd (Reserve) and 4th (Extra Reserve) battalions in a draft finding role. The 1st to 5th Volunteer battalions were renumbered as the 5th to 9th battalions Durham Light Infantry of the [[Territorial Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 252–267&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th formed part of the [[150th (York and Durham) Brigade|York and Durham Brigade]] and the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th battalions forming the [[151st (Durham Light Infantry) Brigade|Durham Light Infantry Brigade]] of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|Northumbrian Division]] (eventually the 150th (York and Durham) Brigade and 151st (Durham Light Infantry) Brigade respectively of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division when the territorial formations were given numbers in May 1915).
In 1911, the 1st battalion took part in the [[Delhi Durbar#Durbar of 1911|Delhi Durbar]], receiving new colours from the King.&lt;ref&gt;Vane p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
{{see also|List of battalions of the Durham Light Infantry#First World War}}
During the [[First World War]], the D.L.I. expanded to 42 battalions, comprising two Regular, two Militia, 17 Territorial (1st, 2nd and 3rd line, some never completed) and 21 service and other types (some short lived),&lt;ref name=JamesTableB&gt;{{harvnb|James|1978|loc=Table B, Appendix I to Part II}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 22{{efn|Battalions that served overseas in World War I were the 1st and 2nd (Regular), 1/5th, 1/6th, 1/7th, 1/8th, 1/9th, 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th, 2/9th (Territorial), 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 22nd and 29th (Service).&lt;ref name=NEMedals&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.northeastmedals.co.uk/british_regiment/durham_light_infantry.htm | title=Medals of the Regiments: The Durham Light Infantry | publisher=North East Medals | date=2007 | accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} seeing active service overseas – on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] (at [[Ypres#World War I|Ypres]], [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]], [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]), in [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]], [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Egypt]], [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Salonika]] and [[Military history of the North-West Frontier|India]]. Some battalions were part of the Army of occupation in Germany after the War. In addition, ten battalions of County Volunteers were raised under the terms of the 1859 Volunteer act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 334&quot;&gt;Ward p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

When War was declared, the 1st battalion was in India part of the Nowshera Brigade, [[1st (Peshawar) Division]],&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of only eight of 52 British Army regular infantry battalions to remain in India. When volunteers for drafts to fight in France were called for, 880 out of 900 responded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 438&quot;&gt;Ward p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2nd battalion was in [[Whittington Barracks]], assigned to the [[British 18th Infantry Brigade|18th Brigade]] of the [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 337&quot;&gt;Ward p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; The Territorial battalions had been withdrawn early from their summer training camp to their home mobilisation stations.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

====1914====
The 6th Division reached France on 10–11 September as part of the British Expeditionary Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 337&quot;/&gt; By this time the German Army's advance had been halted on the Marne and pushed back to beyond the Ainse. The 6th Division was dispersed among the units of the BEF holding the line on the ridge of the Chemin des Dames, with 2nd battalion the penultimate battalion on the right of the line.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September the Germans attacked the junction of the British and French forces but were held; in this introduction to the war the battalion lost in one day almost as many men as the 1st battalion lost in the whole of the Boer War.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies and the Germans now began a series of moves to try and outflank each other resulting in a northwards movement called the [[Race to the Sea]]. Rejoining the rest of the Division in early October during this northward movement the 2nd battalion fought at the [[Battle of Armentières]], dispersed in companies to reinforce other units to the south-east of Armentiers.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 341–343&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of October when it was withdrawn from the front, the 2nd battalion had lost over 80% of its original complement killed or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December, the 18th battalion (a Pals battalion) became the first New Army battalion to come under enemy fire when two companies on coastal defence duty at Hartlepool suffered 5 dead and 11 wounded when the town [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|came under fire]] from the battlecruisers [[Derfflinger-class battlecruiser#SMS Derfflinger|SMS Derfflinger]], [[SMS Von der Tann]] and [[SMS Blucher]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 328–329&lt;/ref&gt;

====1915====
After the failure of British attacks at [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]] and the French in [[First Battle of Champagne|Champagne]], the Germans attacked at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Ypres]] on 22 April. By this time the territorial battalions of the regiment had just landed in France with the 50th (Northumbrian) Division on 17–18 April.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Without any 'nursery' period the brigades of the Division were deployed as needed in the northern part of the salient around St Julian and the Gravenstafl Ridge. Repeated German attacks throughout late April and May forced a withdrawal toward Ypres. Between 25 and 27 April, the 8th battalion was reduced to the effective strength of one company after being enfiladed at Boetleer's Farm with the 8th Canadian battalion and is credited with saving the flank of the 85th Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt; In late May, the 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th battalions were part of the forces that slowed the German assault on the Bellewaarde Ridge the last battle of the Second Ypres.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its losses, in June the 8th battalion was merged with the 6th battalion to form the 6th/8th Composite battalion, which separated back into its components in August after reinforcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 353&quot;&gt;Ward p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the service battalions of the New Army, the 10th battalion of the [[43rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|43rd Brigade]], [[14th (Light) Division]] and the 11th battalion which were pioneers of the [[20th (Light) Division]], arrived in France in May and July respectively. The 5th battalion was converted to the (50th) Division pioneer battalion on 16 May 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 353&quot;/&gt;

In July, the 41st Division was in the line in the Ypres salient at the chateax of Hooge, where the Germans held the house and the allies the stable block, just north of the Menin road.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July, the Germans used [[Flamethrower]]s, which threw back the [[41st Brigade (United Kingdom)|41st Brigade]] and pushed the front line south back to Zouave and Sanctuary Woods. The 6th Division was tasked to retake the old line of late July. The now reinforced 2nd battalion had to face a 500-yard advance paralleling the German line before reaching its objective.  In the early hours of 9 August, together with the 1st [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry|K.S.L.I.]] on its left, the battalion overran the German trenches at bayonet point and re-established the British line on the north of the Menin road at a cost of nearly 200 dead and 270 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;W358&quot;&gt;Ward p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Praise was received from the brigade, Division, corps and Army commanders and [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] commander of the BEF said of the assault it was &quot;...one of the best conducted of the smaller operations of the campaign&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;W358&quot;/&gt;

Four more service battalions arrived in France, the 12th and 13th of the [[68th Brigade (United Kingdom)|68th Brigade]] of the [[23rd Division (United Kingdom)|23rd Division]] in late August and the 14th and 15th of the [[64th Brigade (United Kingdom)|64th Brigade]] of the [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]] in early September.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pps. 358, 362&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st and 24th Divisions were chosen as part of the reserve for the [[Battle of Loos]] despite being newly arrived in France and having had comparatively little training.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=23 October 2014|publisher=The Long Long Trail|title=24th Division|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/24div.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long night march,&lt;ref name=&quot;W361&quot;&gt;Ward p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; dawn found the battalions between Loos and Hulluch with a German redoubt on Hill 70 to their right. Over the course of the day, both essentially untrained battalions attacked a total of five times unsupported by artillery but were beaten back. The 14th battalion lost 294 killed and wounded, the 15th 642.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  In late November, the 14th battalion joined the 2nd in the 18th Brigade of 6th Division.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 358—362&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November, the regiment won its first VC of the war when Pte Thomas Kenny of the 13th battalion rescued a wounded officer.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 362—363&lt;/ref&gt;

====1916====
The arrival of service battalions of the regiment continued: the 19th battalion (Bantams) in the [[106th Brigade (United Kingdom)|106th Brigade]] of the [[35th Division (United Kingdom)|35th Division]] on 29 February, the 20th battalion (Wearsiders) in the [[123rd Brigade (United Kingdom)|123rd Brigade]] of the [[41st Division (United Kingdom)|41st Division]] and the 22nd battalion which landed on 16 June attached to the [[19th (Western) Division]], but quickly transferred to the [[8th Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]] as Division pioneers.  The 18th battalion (Pals) had arrived in March from Egypt where it had garrisoned the Suez Canal at Qantara as part of [[93rd Brigade (United Kingdom)|93rd Brigade]] of the [[31st Division (United Kingdom)|31st Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=23 October 2014|publisher=The Long Long Trail|title=The Durham Light Infantry|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/D.L.I..htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Somme
[[File:British plan Somme 1 July 1916.png|thumb|left|British front line Divisions on the first day of the Somme]]

The Somme offensive was originally planned, earlier in the year, as a joint British-French offensive but due to the increasing pressure on the French at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] was fought in part to relieve that pressure without much of the expected French support. [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig#Prelude to the Somme|General Haig]] felt that he lacked sufficient artillery and that many of the New Army Divisions were not yet fully trained but was pressured into starting the offensive at the start of July.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 2014 pp. 209–219&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment had two battalions in action on the [[First day on the Somme|first day of the Somme]], 1 July, the 18th (31st Division) opposite Serre and the 15th (21st Division) north of Fricourt. The 15th battalion, aided by its Division artillery's used of a rolling barrage,&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; captured the German front line trenches and pressed on, until by the afternoon the battalion advanced an additional 600 yards to the edge of Shelter Wood, beating off a counterattack until relieved that night.&lt;ref&gt;Miles pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Casualties amounted to 440 officers and other ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Miles p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The planned advance of D company of the 18th battalion that morning was overlooked by German forces in the ruins of Serre and together with the other assaulting troops of the first wave suffered grievous losses and gained no ground. The retaliatory German shelling virtually destroyed the front line and communication trenches and the remaining companies of the 18th and other battalions were ordered to prepare a defence in case of counterattack. They remained in these shattered trenches, attempting to repair them and rescuing the wounded from no-mans land, under at times intense bombardment, until relieved during the night of 4 July. When reassembled the battalion had 14 officers and 357 men, having lost 58% of its strength killed and wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles pp. 50–52&lt;/ref&gt;

British tactics now changed; instead of attacks aiming for deep penetrations, smaller objectives were set, the first at Bezatin Ridge on 14 July. The 12th and 13th battalions fought between Poiziers and Martinpuich up to the end of July, the 19th although only in a supporting role, had still lost more than 250 officers and men near Guillemont at the end of July, the 10th fought in Delville Wood in August, and the 11th, a pioneer battalion, was fighting in the trenches near Ginchy in early September.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 366–368&lt;/ref&gt;

The next objective was on a 10-mile front between the villages of Flers and Courcelette in mid September. The 2nd and 14th battalions were part of the attack that took the Quadrilateral strong point near Ginchy. The territorials and the 10th, 15th and 20th battalions were also involved in this phase, with the 5th battalion having only 92 officers and men fit by 19 September.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 369–373&lt;/ref&gt; Le Transloy ridge was the next target in the increasingly wet autumn, this involved the 2nd battalion, the 6th, 8th (temporarily joined with the 1/5th Borderers) and 9th territorials and the 12th and 13th service battalions. These last two captured the village of Le Sars in what the Official History called &quot;...the striking success of the day.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 374–377&lt;/ref&gt; The territorials were again involved in the last assault of the Somme offensive, on the [[Attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt|Butte de Warlencourt]], the 1/6th, 1/8th and 1/9th losing between them nearly 940 officers and men killed, wounded or missing for no gain.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 375–377&lt;/ref&gt;

In early November the 2/5th and the 2/9th battalions consisting of category B fitness men separately embarked for Salonika and the front against Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

====1917====
;Arras
The attack along the line at [[Arras|Battle of Arras (1917)]], starting on 9 April was intended as a diversion for the French attack at Nivelle. In the first phase of the attack, the 10th battalion had advanced ~4000 yards through the Hindenburg trench system until relieved on the night of 10 April. The 15th battalion also fought on the first day taking the front line trench (at ~1000 yards) but being held up afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 379–381&lt;/ref&gt; The territorial battalions were in action in mid and late April south of the village of Guemappe.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coalfields of Lens the 2nd and 14th battalions fought the Germans over a feature called 'Hill 70' between April and July, adding it as a battle honour to the regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 383—384&lt;/ref&gt;

;Messines
The set piece battle of [[Messines 1917|Messines]] was intended to take high ground to the south of Ypres prior to the [[Battle of Passchendaele|northern offensive]]. After an intense bombardmant, the explosion of underground mines and following a creeping barrage the 12th and 13th battalions near Hill 60 advanced ~1000 yards and the 20th battalion starting from St Eloi advanced nearly 4000 yards with fewer losses than previous operations.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

;Third Ypres
[[File:Durham Light Infantry signallers Battle of Menin Road 1917 IWM Q 5968.jpg|thumb|right|A signal section of the 13th battalion D.L.I. on the Menin Road ridge September 1917]]
The next battle around the Ypres salient was to clear the Germans from the remaining high ground to the East of the city. The 20th battalion was involved in the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge|first day's attacks]] on 31 July, advancing alongside the Ypres-Comines canal for the loss of 8 officers and 431 other ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;W386&quot;&gt;Ward p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; The next advance was held up until near the end of August by heavy rains and was directed along the Menin Road, here the 10th battalion attempted to take and hold Inverness Copse losing over half its original strength by 25 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;W386&quot;/&gt; [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|General Plumer's]] methodical advance began on 20 September on the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge|Menin Road ridge]]. The 20th battalion's advance on 21 September was checked after 200 yards, the 13th battalion reached their objective with both battalions losing around 300 men.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 387–388&lt;/ref&gt; The third of General Plumer's steps, the [[Battle of Broodseinde]] on 4 October involved the 15th battalion on the extreme right of 21st Division, despite being reduced to two composite companies by German heavy bombardment, they advanced south of Polygon Wood achieving the objective of the village of Reutel. When the battalion was relieved on 6 October it was commanded by a Lieutenant and had lost 430 officers and men.&lt;ref&gt;Miles pp. 190–192&lt;/ref&gt;

For the remainder of the Third Ypres the regiment's battalions were in reserve positions, the Territorials during [[Second Battle of Passchendaele]], or holding the line, and the 19th battalion (which had ceased to be a 'Bantam' unit in January&lt;ref&gt;Miles p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;) at Weidendreft in early November and the 10th battalion at Passchendaele in December. The Pioneer battalions, 11th and 22nd, also served with their respective Divisions (20th and 8th) during the Battle.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

;Italy
When the Central Powers forced a retreat on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], 5 British and 2 French Divisions were sent to Italy. The British Divisions contained the 12th and 13th battalions (23rd Division) and the 20th battalion (41st Division) leaving the Ypres Salient between the end of October and mid November and arriving in at the Italian front between the end of November and early December.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles pp. 232, 236&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cambrai
[[File:Battle of cambrai 3 - British Offensive.png|thumb|left|Initial British gains at Cambrai]]
The [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] was the first successful use of maturing [[combined arms]] tactics by the British. On 20 November the 2nd and 14th battalions of the 6th Division were to pass through the assaulting forces and take the Hindenburg Line support trench; both battalions reached their objective with a total loss of 30 killed or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 391–393&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, 3 companies from 14th battalion assisted tanks and squadron of cavalry in taking the village of Cantaing (north-west of Marcoing).&lt;ref&gt;Miles p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The advance came to a halt as the Germans brought their reserves into the battle. The 11th battalion had been consolidating the ground behind the 4 mile advance of 20th Division but on 29 November its scattered companies were involved in fighting the German counter-attack on the ridges north of Gouzeacourt.&lt;ref&gt;Miles pp. 219–223&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th battalion (together with the 1st battalion [[Shropshire Light Infantry]]) was ordered across the Canal du Nord on the night of 2 December to trenches facing Masniere, one of which was only 2–3 feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;Miles p226&lt;/ref&gt; After beating off one attack they were forced to withdraw back over the canal and over the next few days withdrew to the &quot;Flesquires Line&quot; and, for the British the disappointing end of the Battle.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

====1918–19====
With the [[Eastern Front (World War I)#1918|Russians out of the war]], Germany was able to transfer forces and at last outnumber the Allies on the Western Front before the arrival of the [[United States in World War I|Americans]] in force. Large numbers of [[stormtrooper]]s were to be used, together with new artillery tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 2014 p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies knew what was in store and began to prepare a defence in depth with varying degrees of effectiveness. As a result of manpower shortages (some politically induced), in February the British Army was reorganised from a four battalion to a three battalion infantry brigade structure, with many infantry battalions being disbanded to strengthen remaining battalions. In this way the 10th and 14th battalions were disbanded, reinforcing the other battalions of the regiment while the 9th was converted to a pioneer battalion and joined the [[62nd (2nd West Riding) Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 396–397&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th battalion returned from Italy to the Western Front with its Division in early March.&lt;ref&gt;Miles p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Spring Offensive]]
On the first day of the German &quot;[[Operation Michael]]&quot; the 2nd battalion was in the front line north of the Bapume-Cambrai road. After losing the two forward companies, the infantry withdrew in the evening mist with the remains of the 1st battalion [[West Yorkshire Regiment]]. At dusk on the 22nd, out of an original strength of 30 officers and 639 other ranks, the battalion had two officers and 58 men unwounded with six officers and 286 other ranks wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 399–400&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th pioneer battalion was building a supply railway in the 20th Division's rear, in the Saint-Quentin area around Ham.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, M. 11th Durham Light Infantry: In Their Own Names https://eleventhdli.wordpress.com/2014/03/24/21-march-1918/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; It was scattered during the week long battle, and only a few men regrouped in Amiens at its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth pp. 125–130&lt;/ref&gt;
All the regiment's battalions on the Western Front suffered heavy losses as a result of the weight of numbers and new tactics of the Germans. The 18th, 19th and 20th battalions also fought on the Somme.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 401–405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles pp. 281–284&lt;/ref&gt; The 9th battalion fought before Bucquoy at the end of March where Pte Young won the V.C. for rescuing 9 men under fire. When relieved on 1 April, the battalion had lost 492 officers and men,&lt;ref name=&quot;W405&quot;&gt;Ward p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; and the 15th battalion reduced to one company.&lt;ref name=&quot;W403&quot;&gt;Ward p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

The territorials of the 50th Division, the 5th, 6th and 8th battalions and 7th pioneers were particularly unfortunate, forced into the long retreat on the Somme, they were reinforced by drafts from the [[British Army First World War reserve brigades|graduated battalions]] and sent to the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Ypres salient]] in April where, after the initial assault they were only saved by the German looting: {{Quote|text=I think the only thing that saved us that night was the amount of liquor the Boche found in Estairs and Neuf-Berquin, as I have never heard such a noise in my life as they made singing.|sign=5th Battalion officer |source=&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 408&quot;&gt;Ward p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;}} Reduced to a total of a battalion in strength,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 408&quot;/&gt;  The 151st Brigade was then sent to the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne]] to recuperate where a third German attack found them on 26 May, 21 days after arriving. The scattered parties were forced back to south of the Marne where eventually the Durham battalions of 151 brigade could only muster 103 men of all ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 410–412&lt;/ref&gt;
Also on the Lys, the 18th battalion fought in retreat south and west around Bailleul and, when taken out of the line on 14 April was formed into a composite battalion with the 15th [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] which totalled around 450 men.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 408–409&lt;/ref&gt;

The 22nd pioneer battalion fought as infantry on the Aisne on 27 May; after losing 513 officers and men in continual withdrawal, it was absorbed into the 8th Division Composite Battalion.
In June, the remains of the 5th, 6th and 8th battalions were reduced to cadre strength and were sent to the Dieppe area while the 22nd battalion was absorbed by the 7th pioneer battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

The 62nd Division arrived on the eastern flank of the [[Second Battle of the Marne|new salient]] 2 days after the start of the German attack on 17 July. The 9th battalion was used as infantry for the counter-offensive along the Ardre river, and on 20 July fought through thick woods and captured the village of Cuitron on 22 July at a cost of 294 officers and men killed wounded and missing.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Hundred Days Offensive]]
The German offensive had petered out without the decisive breakthrough that was desired and the German high command knew that the allies would respond, knowing of the German losses, and bolstered by the arrival of the Americans and the reinforcement of the British and French making up for some of the losses from the spring offensive. The first blow fell on 8 August at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]] in which the regiment had no part. This signalled the beginning of a general advance of the five British Armies through Picardy on 21 August and Flanders on 28 September, four of which contained battalions from the regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 415—418&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining battalions of the regiment participated in this advance being joined in France by the 2/6th battalion in May as part of the 177th brigade of the [[59th (2nd North Midland) Division|59th Division]], the 29th battalion reinforcing the [[41st Brigade (United Kingdom)|41st Brigade]] of the [[14th (Light) Division|14th Division]] and the 13th battalion returning from Italy in September to join the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th brigade]] in the [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 334&quot;/&gt;

On the Somme with the Third Army the 15th battalion made a night advance of over 3000 yards on 23/24 August and fought again on the Hindengurg Line in mid September. In the Fourth Army the 2nd battalion attacked the Hindenburg Line near St Quentin over terrain that was &quot;...a bare, glacis-like slope devoid of cover...&quot; and lost over 300 men for only 200 yards gained.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 419–420&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13th battalion attacked the reserve line of the Hindenburg system on 6 October near Villers-Outreaux, with the 15th battalion attacking the same day a few miles to the North.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt; In Flanders, the clearing of the German's spring salient and subsequent advance over the battlefields of the last four years at Ypres was shared by the 18th, 19th, 20th, 2/6th and 29th battalions. The 29th battalion's only battle was the crossing of the Lys near Comines on 15 October. The 2/6th fought on the Premesques ridge and went on with the Division to cross the Scheldt.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 424–426&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd, 13th and 15th battalions took part in the final advance across the Selle and Sambre rivers, the 15th having to drive out the Germans at Limont-Fontaine at bayonet point losing 127 men on 7 November.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 427–429&lt;/ref&gt;

;Italy
[[File:Battle of Vittorio Veneto.jpg|thumb|right|The Italian Campaign]]
The British Divisions were deployed between [[Lake Garda]] and the Piave River, however in February the 41st Division with the 20th battalion was returned to the Western Front. In June the Austrians launched the [[Battle of the Piave River]] with the 12th and 13th battalions facing the northern pincer which made no progress against the British, the two battalions losing six dead and 61 wounded during the day.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th battalion returned to the Western Front in September. At the end of October the 12th battalion took part in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] assaulting across the Piave River before being relieved on 30 October.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

;Macedonia
Initially both 2/5th and 2/9th battalions were employed on guard duties in and around Salonika where the 2/9th battalion remained until the end of the War. In March 1917 the 2/5th battalion was brigaded into the independent [[228th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|228th Brigade]] and sent into the line west of Lake Butkovo. There it stayed until the Bulgarian armistice on 1 October 1918 when it began to advance with the brigade under Greek command. When the Turkish armistice was signed on 31 October the battalion was sent with the 2/5th battalion Seaforth Highlanders to occupy the ports of Varna and Burgas. While overseas the battalion lost two men from wounds but 21 from disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 436–437&lt;/ref&gt;

;Russia
The 2/7th battalion joined the [[Allied Intervention in Russia]] in Archangel, Northern Russia as a garrison battalion, arriving on 7 October 1918. It did not see action and was withdrawn in January 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 438&quot;/&gt;

;[[Army of Occupation (Germany)|Army of Occupation]]
In November and December the 2nd and 9th battalions were among the British forces that marched to the Rhine as part of the Army of Occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 431–432&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1919 the 51st and 52nd (Graduated) battalions together with the 20th battalion formed the 3rd Northern Brigade of the Northern Division with the 53rd battalion, reduced to cadre, supplying reinforcements; all were based in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;Miles p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The 1st battalion remained in India throughout the First World War, suffering a continual drain of drafts for the Western Front. In August 1914 it was part of the Nowshera Brigade of the [[Peshawar Division]], and served on the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–55)|North West Frontier]] in 1915, and 1916–17 in campaigns against the [[Mohmands]]. The battalion was in Rawalpindi in 1919 at the outbreak of the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in which it played a mostly supporting role. Demobilising its time expired men, a cadre of the battalion returned to Britain in February 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 438–446&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war===
[[File:1DLI 1937.jpg|thumb|left|1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry leaves Farnborough in October 1937 on the first stage of their journey to Shanghai]]
By 1920, the service battalions had been disbanded with their King's colours laid up in [[Durham Cathedral]] except for the 20th battalion's at [[Sunderland Minster|the parish church of Bishopwearmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles pp. 369–370&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st battalion was reformed with drafts from the 3rd (the last act of the Militia) and left for Germany, still understrength, in March 1921 for duty in Upper [[Silesia]], returning to Britain in July 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 449–451&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion spent 3 years in Egypt again returning to Britain in April 1930. Joining the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division it took part in experiments in infantry mechanisation. It was then sent to [[Shanghai]] arriving in November 1937, reinforced by personnel from the 2nd battalion at Port Sudan. In October 1938 the battalion moved to Tientsin and was there when Britain declared war against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 451–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd battalion returned to Britain from Germany in April 1919 as a cadre; the battalion reformed and was sent to Batoum in South Russia in October 1919 to police territorial terms of the Armistice.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 449&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1920 it was sent to the Izmit in Turkey to police the terms of the Turkish armistice until November. From here they went to India and in February 1927 were deployed to Shanghai to protect the International Settlement. Returning to India in August, it fought against the Mahsuds, relieving the post of Datta Khel in May 1930. The battalion arrived back in Britain in November 1937 after a few months in Egypt, replacing the 1st battalion in the [[6th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Infantry Brigade]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 455–458&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1920 the Territorial Force was re-raised and later in the year renamed the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. In the 1930s as part of the growing realisation of the threat of air power, numbers of territorial battalions were converted to an air defence role, either as Anti-Aircraft gunners or search light regiments, in this way the D.L.I. lost the 5th and 7th battalions. These units were no longer a [[List of battalions of the Durham Light Infantry#Inter-War|part of the Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
{{see also|List of battalions of the Durham Light Infantry#Second World War}}
During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the D.L.I. raised 15 battalions, two Regular, six 1st and 2nd line Territorial (one renamed and transferred to another regiment), and the remainder war formed (mostly so called 'Dunkirk' battalions), with 10 seeing active service overseas in [[Battle of France|France]], [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], and [[Western Front (World War II)|France and Germany]]. The low number of battalions raised compared to the First World War was due to the increasing specialisation of a more mechanised army and its associated support requirements. Additionally, twenty six battalions of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] wore the D.L.I. cap badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-guard.org.uk/hg/struc.html|title=Home Guard: Structure|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Field Marshal Montgomery was to write,{{quote|text =Of all the infantry regiments in the British Army, the DLI was one most closely associated with myself during the war. The DLI Brigade [151st Brigade] fought under my command from Alameim to Germany ...It is a magnificent regiment. Steady as a rock in battle and absolutely reliable on all occasions. The fighting men of Durham are splendid soldiers; they excel in the hard-fought battle and they always stick it out to the end; they have gained their objectives and held their positions even when all their officers have been killed and condition were almost unendurable.&lt;ref&gt;Delaforce (50/15) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The remaining first line territorial battalions once again formed the [[151st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|151st Infantry Brigade]] of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], initially a two brigade motorised Division. The territorials again raised second line battalions now numbering them sequentially, 10th, 11th and 12th battalions, these were now part of [[70th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|70th Infantry Brigade]] of the [[23rd (Northumbrian) Division]] the 2nd line copy of the 50th Division.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th battalion was named as a Tyneside Scottish unit and on 31 January 1940 the battalion left the regiment to become 1st battalion, [[Tyneside Scottish]] of the [[Black Watch|Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 461&quot;&gt;Ward p. 461&lt;/ref&gt;

When the War broke out the 1st battalion was in China at Tientsin, the 2nd battalion at Woking in the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Infantry Division]] and the territorial battalions had already begun to form their 2nd line.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

====France 1940====
The 2nd battalion arrived in France with the 2nd Infantry Division as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|BEF]] in late September 1939 and was quickly deployed on the border with Belgium. The 151st brigade arrived in late January 1940 with 50th Division, with training still to be completed for some men, and moved up to the border at the end of March. The second line battalions (and the Tyneside Scottish) arrived in the part trained [[23rd (Northumbrian) Division|23rd Division]] in early April, with no artillery or mortars and a reduced rear echelon with orders to complete their training and construct airfields. In the 70th brigade, 1400 men had not fired a [[Bren gun]] and 400 had not completed the war course with the [[SMLE|rifle]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Manstein Plan|Germans attacked]] on 10 May the 2nd battalion had moved into Belgium to the River Dyle by late on the 11th, 151st brigade was to be held in reserve. On the Dyle, the 2nd battalion held the Germans for two days until ordered to withdraw on 16 May, with Lt Annand winning the Army's first V.C. of the War.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 12–15&lt;/ref&gt; The 151st brigade was ordered to move forward to the River Dendre on 16 May, only to begin to fall back on the 18th.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to delay the German armoured thrust, the rear echelon, including 70th brigade, was ordered into its path. After a series of marches and counter marches that began on 13 May the brigade, on 20 May, was spread along the roads south of Arras travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 473&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt; Here they were ambushed by German armour, without heavy weapons their defence became a series of isolated and confused company actions. At St Pol the next day the brigade headquarters, the survivors of the three battalions and some engineers amounted to 14 officers and 219 other ranks, joined by other stragglers in the next few days they total ~800 men.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 473–474&lt;/ref&gt; On the claim that the action south of Arras delayed the German advance by five hours, the official history states: {{Quote|text=It is a modest estimate of what these two Territorial Divisions did to damage and delay the enemy's forces. But it may perhaps be accepted, with this important rider – at this time every single hour's delay was of incalculable service to the rest of the British forces in France.|source=&lt;ref&gt;Ellis p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;}} The remains were formed into &quot;Marleyforce&quot; and as such it reached Dunkirk to be [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated]] on 31 May.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 151st brigade, after a series of marches west and south, was chosen as part of the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras counter-attack]]. The 6th and 8th battalions were to support the 4th and 7th Royal Tank Regiments respectively, with the 9th battalion in reserve. After initial successes to the west of Arras the Germans counter-attacked, and the British forces were withdrawn to Vimy Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade was then ordered north on 25 May to plug the gap of the impending [[Battle of Belgium#Belgian surrender|Belgian surrender]]. To do this it had to extract itself from fighting on the Le Bassee Canal, the 8th battalion having to recapture the village of Carvin north of the canal, and only on the 27th could the brigade move north following the rest of 50th Division to Ypres.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Division had been sent to man 21 miles of the western side of the Dunkirk corridor with the 2nd battalion positioned near [[Saint-Venant|St. Venant]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebag-Montefiore p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; From 24 to 27 May the Division held off attacks by four Panzer Divisions ([[3rd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd]], [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|4th]], [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th]] and S.S. [[3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf|Totenkopf]]),&lt;ref&gt;Sebag-Montefiore pp. 522–523&lt;/ref&gt; ending with over 70% of the Division becoming casualties and the massacre of 97 men of the 2nd battalion, [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]] at [[Le Paradis massacre|La Paradis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebag-Montefiore ch22&lt;/ref&gt; When the 2nd battalion reformed in Britain after evacuation from Dunkirk on the night of 29 May it consisted of the remains of D company and the battalion's B echelon, stragglers and convalescents, some 180 men.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at Ypres 151st brigade was almost immediately forced back, and the retreat to the [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk perimeter]] began. By 30 May the brigade was entrenched between the Bergues and Ringsloot canals and reinforced by some remnants from 70th Brigade, after repulsing German attacks on the 31st, the brigade embarked for Britain from the Dunkirk mole late on 1 June.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iceland====
British forces had [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded Iceland]] in May 1940, and in October the 10th Battalion arrived followed by the rest of 70th Brigade a month later replacing [[148th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|148th Brigade]] in [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delaforce (49) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  While there the division used the empty terrain of the island to train using live ammunition, the 70th brigade left in December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Delaforce (49) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Africa, the Middle East and the Mediterranean 1940–43====
The 1st battalion left China and arrived in [[North Africa campaign|North Africa]] in January 1940&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion played a supporting role in Lieutenant-General [[Richard O'Connor|O'Connor's]] [[Operation Compass|offensive]] in December except for a composite company which advanced as far as Sidi Barani.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 50–53&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the [[22nd Guards Brigade]] in January 1941 and trained for amphibious operations at Qassassin, only to be returned to the desert in March when [[Erwin Rommel]] [[Operation Sonnenblume#Rommel goes on the offensive|counter-attacked]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Counter attacking at [[Halfaya 1941|Halfaya Pass]] the battalion used primitive motorised tactics and communications (flag signals), the attack failed and the battalion lost more than half its strength including the whole of D company.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt;  In June the reinforced battalion was deployed as part of the take-over of Vichy controlled Syria, but in October 1941 it moved back to North Africa as part of the rotation of forces in the [[Siege of Tobruk|besieged Tobruk garrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Here they patrolled and raided the German and Italian lines, and in early December extended the perimeter near El-Adem as part of the lifting of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 61–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, 50th Division with 151st Brigade had been sent to the Middle-east arriving early July 1941 and at the end of the month deployed to [[Cyprus]] to improve the islands defences.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis pp. 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; From there the 50th Division was sent to Palestine in November and then on to Irbil in Iraq to be part of the [[Ninth Army (United Kingdom)|forces]] to meet an anticipated German advance from southern Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis pp. 50–54&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1942 the 1st Battalion was moved to garrison [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]], returning to North Africa in June 1943 after losing only a few men to air attack.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 70–74&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1942 the 50th Division was recalled to the Western Desert and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] and found itself on the Gazala line. For some months the Durham battalions patrolled no mans land disrupting and stealing German and Italian supply lines in front of them, 'commerce raiding' &lt;ref&gt;Lewis ch7 &amp; 8&lt;/ref&gt; and then attacking the supply columns for Rommel's armoured thrust which began the [[Battle of Gazala|Gazala]] on 27 May. The Division's 150th brigade was forced to surrender on 1 June and Axis forces were now west, south and east of the remaining brigades. Forming columns most of the 6th and 8th battalions broke out west through Italian then German lines on the night of 14/15 June, then travelled  south past the German armoured thrust and east to the Egyptian border. The 9th battalion and a party from the 6th were forced to take the coastal route after the Italians and Germans had been alerted to the western breakout and fought through German positions west of Tobruk,&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; they were reunited with the rest of the division on 16 June.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Tobruk the division was now placed on an escarpment south of the town of [[First Battle of El Alamein#Battle of Mersa Matruh|Mersa Matruh]] and on 27 June held attacks by the German [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] during which Pte [[Adam Wakenshaw|A H Wakenshaw]] won a posthumous V.C. but after which the 9th battalion positions were isolated and overrun with only the headquarters company escaping.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; The division was ordered to withdraw on 28 June again in column formation but this time over ground broken by [[wadi]]s. In one of these the 8th battalion lost its D company to a German ambush and the rendezvous point, Fuka, was in German hands leading to the capture of some un-diverted columns.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; When reassembled the 50th Division was withdrawn behind the Alamein line to rest and reorganise after suffering over 8000 casualties since the start of the Gazala battle.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

While behind the lines the 6th, 8th and 9th battalions each contributed a company to a composite battalion for an attack on the southern part of [[First Battle of El Alamein#Miteirya Ridge (Ruin Ridge)|Ruin Ridge]] on 27/28 July, while the [[24th Brigade (Australia)|Australians]] attacked the northern part. Although the position was taken, almost the entire composite battalion was killed or captured by the German counterattack.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis pp. 127–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The 50th Division returned to the front line on 4 September, and during the first days of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] stayed in reserve in the southern part of the line. On 28 October the 151st Brigade was moved north and with the [[152nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|152nd Brigade]] came under command of the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] for [[Second Battle of El Alamein#Phase four: Operation Supercharge|Operation Supercharge]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Early on 2 November the three battalions advanced through the smoke and dust of the bombardment which reduced visibility to 50 yards&lt;ref&gt;Delaforce (50/15) p30&lt;/ref&gt; and facing scattered German resistance reached their objective by the dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; Here they witnessed the destruction of [[9th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Brigade]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; and were subject to German shelling before being relieved on the evening of 3 November, having lost nearly 400 men.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The British Army in Tunisia 1943 NA1344.jpg|thumb|right|A wounded soldier from the Durham Light Infantry shares a cigarette with a wounded German prisoner during the Mareth line battle, 22–24 March 1943.]]
The 50th Division returned to the front line when the Eighth Army reached the [[Mareth Line]] in February 1943. On the night of 20/21 March the 8th and 9th battalions [[Battle of the Mareth Line|attacked]], crossing the wadi and fighting the dug in Italians of the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|Young Fascist Division]], with the 6th battalion the tanks of [[50th Royal Tank Regiment|50th R.T.R.]] following&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks were unable to cross the wadi that night, however the next night after the 6th battalion and the 5th battalion [[East Yorkshire Regiment]] reinforced the penetration, some 40 tanks were able to cross.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March the Germans counterattacked with the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the infantry battalions were forced to withdraw, crossing back over the wadi at first light on 23 March.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th battalion, which started the battle with a strength of only ~300 of all ranks, was reduced to 65 unwounded men by the end of the battle, the 8th and 9th were in a similar condition. Shortly after the division was withdrawn from the front and sent to Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 117—118&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 1943 the 16th Battalion landed at Algiers with the [[139th (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire) Brigade|139th Brigade]] of the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Division]], part of the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]]. It moved into Tunisia it fought at the [[Battle of Sedjenane#First battle, February–March 1932|first battle of Sedjenane]], where they were forced to withdraw by 4 March after losing nearly half their number.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; First Army's offensive was resumed in April and on 22 April the 16th Battalion attacked the hill of Sidi Barka held by men of the [[Herman Goering Division]], after gaining a false crest instead of the summit, the battalion held on through mortar bombardment until the Germans pulled out the next night.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

With the defeat of the Germans in North Africa the 6th 8th and 9th battalions were withdrawn to Alexandria, reinforced and trained in amphibious techniques for the invasion of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Deleforce (50/15) p44&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th Battalion, after taking part in the victory parade in Tunis, was sent to Algiers for training.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1943 a second incarnation of the 18th Battalion was raised at Genefia in Egypt from convalescents of the other D.L.I. battalions as the infantry component of [[Beach groups|36th Beach Brick]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 3–4 (footnote)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving back in Africa in June 1943 the 1st battalion was moved to Syria where it was attached to the [[10th Indian Infantry Division]]. The battalion was chosen to be sent to invade the island of [[Battle of Kos|Kos]], the first company arriving on 16 September but not until the end of the month was the whole battalion on the island, during which time German bombing was increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; After 10 days of fighting paratroopers and other German forces the remaining men of the battalion were taken off the island by the [[Special Boat Service|SBS]] on 13 October.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was gradually rebuilt from the 129 officers and men who assembled at Genefia at the end of October, and retrained and reinforced until at full strength by the end of March 1944.{{efn|Informed by GHQ that there were over 1000 members of the regiment employed in other duties in the Middle East, by March just over one third of the Battalion were D.L.I. men and 29 other regiments were represented by drafts of five men or more.}}&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; In April the battalion was deployed to Alexandria to contain a mutiny by the Greek Brigade, but by the end of the month had set sail for Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rissik p. 220&quot;&gt;Rissik p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burma 1941–45====
[[File:IND 003698 Garrison Hill Kohima.jpg|thumb|left|Garrison Hill, Kohima]]
The 2nd battalion was sent to India in April 1942 with the 2nd Division, arriving in June. For some months it was trained in Jungle fighting and in amphibious assault methods. Later in that year the 6th brigade was made an independent formation.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade fought in the [[Arakan Campaign 1942-1943|Arakan]] early 1943 at Donbiak on the Mayu peninsular with the brigade making little progress against strong Japanese positions. It was forced to withdraw when the Japanese cut off the peninsular at Indin bridge, the brigade fought its way out, arriving back in India in May.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 168–182&lt;/ref&gt;  After more amphibious training in the rest of 1943 and early 1944 the 2nd Division was sent relieve [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]] in April 1944. Here the 2nd battalion fought on Garrison Hill and F.S.D. Ridge in late April and early May while overlooked by the guns of the Japanese on Kuki Piquet. Withdrawn to Diampaur in early May the battalion could only muster three companies of two platoons each.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 182–193&lt;/ref&gt; By June the battalion was taking its turn as the lead of the advance, with supporting armour, along the Imphal road, when its 'A' company made contact with the lead elements of [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] on 22 June and the siege of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] was lifted:{{Quote|text=Then the tanks spotted more movements away forward where the elephant grass gave way to trees and began to brass it up properly.

A Company 2nd D.L.I. |source=&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Division was rested until December when it continued its advance into central [[Burma Campaign 1944-1945|Burma]] encountering light but continual resistance. The 6th brigade was in reserve when [[Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay|Mandaly]] was taken,&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 199–206&lt;/ref&gt; after which the battalion was returned to India and reacquainted with its previous amphibious training for the attack on [[Operation Dracula|Rangoon]], in the event they entered the undefended city on 13 May.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was withdrawn back to India in September 1945 to prepare for occupation duties in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Rissk p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

The 151st brigade was chosen as an assault brigade for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] on 10 July 1943 with the 6th and 9th battalions leading.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor weather both landed late and in the wrong place but against light resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; After advancing inland and breaking up attacks from the [[54th Infantry Division Napoli|54th (Napoli) Division]] on 12 July, the Durham battalions were ordered to [[Operation Fustian|Primosole bridge]] after [[Operation Fustian|its capture]] by [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|British Paratroopers]] of the [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]] arriving on 15 July after a forced march of 25 miles and the paratroopers had been forced from the bridge. After 2 days of ferocious battle against men of the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|1st Fallschirmjager Division]] the bridge was retaken at a cost of 500 casualties to the brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; After entering Catania on 5 August after the Germans withdrew the advance northward was contested in a landscape of terraced hillsides and stone walls.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of resistance in Sicily the brigade rested and was informed it was to return to Britain in October.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th battalion landed in Italy at [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] as part of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]], attached to [[United States Army North|US Fifth Army]], on 9 September in the second wave, and defended the perimeter of the beach-head until 15 September.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th battalion was also part of the landings at Salerno (with two companies) in its role as a beach group. The 16th battalion fought toward, and entered Naples on 6 October, then on 12 October made a silent crossing of the River Volturno reaching its first objective before the Germans noticed.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; It held the bridgehead it established for 8 days until relieved.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 513–514&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion took part in the forcing of the [[Winter Line]], at the end of October at the Bernhardt line, (after which it was reinforced by drafts from the regiment's 70th battalion) and in January 1944 forcing the main Gustav line.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 514–516&lt;/ref&gt;  In February the 46th Division was withdrawn for rest and retraining to Egypt and Palestine, where the battalion aided the civil authorities during a riot in Tel-Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Italy in July, it fought hard on the [[Gothic Line#Adriatic front (British 8th Army)|Gothic Line]] advancing along the road to Gemmano in early September and crossed the Cosina Canal in November.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 518–522&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 151–155&lt;/ref&gt; In December the battalion was sent to [[Greek Civil War|Greece]] as part of the efforts to keep the peace and then to forestall a communist take over. Initially deployed to Athens, a platoon accidentally occupied the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] after turning left instead of right.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 2010 p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  It became involved in fighting [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] at Phaleron&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 156–159&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 1945, Patras.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 2010 p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion returned to Italy in April 1945, but did not see action.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the 1st battalion had returned to Italy in May 1944 the where it joined the [[10th Indian Infantry Brigade]] in the [[10th Indian Infantry Division]] and by 19 May was back in the line north of Ortona.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rissik p. 220&quot;/&gt; Transferred to the Tiber valley in June, it fought toward the Gustav Line until September, then was transferred once more to the Adriatic coast&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; fighting though the Gothic Line when it was relieved in February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the Adriatic coast in April it [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|crossed the Sillaro]] on 15 April, the battalion heard news of the Armistice while in billets in Ferrara.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Douet 11 June.jpg|thumb|left|Officer, NCO and men of 'A' Company, 6th Durham Light Infantry, 50th Division, in the village of Douet, 11 June 1944.]]
The 50th Division with its 151st brigade was withdrawn to Britain in October 1943 to be trained for the [[Normandy landings]], General Montgomery had wanted veteran divisions to be part of the invasion. The news that it was to be an assault division was not universally well received by the other ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delaforce (50/15) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams p.35&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade landed in the second wave on [[Gold Beach]] King sector on which the 18th battalion was also present in its capacity as a reserve beach group. Advancing inland they faced the grenadiers of the [[Panzer Lehr Division]] in the [[bocage]] around St Pierre, Verrieres and Tilley-sur-Seulles throughout mid June.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 528–535&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10th and 11th battalions were landed with the 49th Infantry Division on 10 June and were committed to the attempt to [[Operation Epsom|outflank]] Caen. The 70th brigade with support of the tanks of the [[Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry]] captured Rauray (11th battalion) and the high ground beyond (10th battalion) on 27–28 June.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; The German counter-attack by troops of [[II SS Panzer Corps]] was held by the 11th and Tyneside Scottish battalions after such hard fighting that [[Lord Haw Haw]] called the division the ''Polar Bear Butchers'' (referencing their formation sign).&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delaforce (49) pp. 93–99&lt;/ref&gt; After some days rest and reinforcement the five D.L.I. battalions in Normandy were briefly together when 70th brigade relieved 151st brigade around Tilley-Sur-Seulles on 7 July.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month the brigade was transferred to the east of Caen and covered the right flank of [[Operation Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; Advancing to Mezidon on the River Dives after the German defeat at Falaise, the brigade fought its last action on 18 August, after which the brigade (as a second line formation) received news it was to be disbanded to reinforce other units of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt;

The 151st brigade advanced in line with the other advances made by the allies in July and by early August was attacking hills south of St.Pierre la Vielle on what was to become the northern edge of the [[Falaise pocket]].&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; After the break out from Normandy the division crossed the Seine on 29 August and reached the Belgian border on 6 September.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief rest in Brussels the brigade was tasked to cross the Albert canal in the wake of 69th brigade, and take the village of Gheel. After holding a series of counter-attacks the [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division|15th Division]] entered the village o 12 September without a shot being fired, as the Germans had retreated.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 271–280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 543&quot;&gt;Ward p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; In October the division was moved to the 'Island', the low-lying ground between the Wall and the Lower Rhine north of Eindhoven.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; After a short operation to expand the bridgehead the brigade garrisoned the area in the early winter.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In December, due to its heavy losses, the 50th Division was broken up to reinforce other formations, the 6th and 8th battalions were reduced to a training cadres of time expired men and returned to Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 543&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU2836.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the 9th Durham Light Infantry clearing resistance in the village of Weseke, 29 March 1945.]]
The 9th battalion was reinforced and transferred to [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]], [[131st Infantry Brigade]], as a motorised battalion fighting at the [[Operation Blackcock|Roer Triangle]] in January 1945 and the town of Ibbenbüren in March. The battalion ended the war near Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th battalion had been serving as [[lines of communications]] troops of [[21st Army Group]], however one company fought the Germans during an attack from besieged Calais in February 1945, the battalion was disbanded at Calais in August 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 463&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 3–4 footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

====Home Front 1939–45====
Some battalions raised by the regiment were destined not to leave Britain. A [[Home Service Battalions|Home Defence]] battalion, the 13th, was formed from the Durham Group (No. 41) [[National Defence Companies|National Defence Company]] in December 1939. It divided in September 1940, producing the 2/13th (Home Defence) battalion which was renamed as the 18th battalion in March 1941. The 1/13th battalion then re-joined the 18th battalion to form the 30th battalion in November 1941 applying the numbering used nationally for 'B' category fitness battalions.&lt;ref name=&quot;W464-5&quot;&gt;Ward pp. 464–465&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 it was briefly organised as a field force unit (a standard army battalion with 'A' category fitness men), until it was disbanded in November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Army's evacuation from Dunkirk, 60 so called 'Dunkirk' infantry battalions were raised in the country that summer, three of which were D.L.I., the 14th, 16th and 17th battalions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 461&quot;/&gt;  All three were brigaded in the [[206th Independent Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|206th Independent Infantry Brigade]] initially in Scotland, and then on the South coast of England.  The 14th and 17th were used as a source of trained reinforcements to the front line.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1943 the 14th battalion was sent to Durham as a rehabilitation unit for convalescing troops and ex-PoWs where it stayed until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik pp. 313–315&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th was disbanded in September 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 463&quot;&gt;Ward p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th battalion was raised from the 50th&lt;ref name=&quot;Rissik p. 317&quot;&gt;Rissik p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; (or 15th &lt;ref name=&quot;Ward p. 463&quot;/&gt;) Holding battalion in October 1940 and took up the role of coastal defence. In November 1941 it was converted to an armoured unit as [[155th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|155th Regiment]] of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], retaining the D.L.I. cap badge on the black beret of the RAC.&lt;ref&gt;Forty p 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The 70th (Young Soldiers) battalion was formed in December 1940 at School Aycliffe near Darlington, for men too young for [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#Second World War|conscription]] (20 years at the time). Instead of disbanding when the conscription age was lowered to 18 years in 1942 it was chosen to be a demonstration battalion for the G.H.Q. Battle School at [[Barnard Castle]]. The battalion was disbanded in August 1943, over 400 of its men being sent overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rissik p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

On their return from the front line in December 1944 the territorial battalion cadres of the 6th and 8th battalions were sent to Yorkshire and were given the task of training service corps soldiers as infantry until the battalions were placed into suspended animation in January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis pp. 299–304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post War===
Post war, the 1st battalion was active in the [[Greek Civil War]] between January 1946 and June 1948, returning to Britain on 23 July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 559–560&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd battalion was sent to Singapore from November 1945 to January 1947 when it returned to Burma. By March it was conducting operations against [[Dacoity|dacoits]] around [[Tatkon, Naypyidaw Union Territory|Maymyo]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward pp. 558-559&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|Demobilisation]] had reduced the battalion to 30 men when it returned to Singapore in November and it returned to Britain on 18 February 1948 as a cadre.&lt;ref name =&quot;W559&quot;&gt;Ward p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th, 8th and 9th territorial battalions were reformed as part of the Territorial Army in March 1947, with the 9th battalion being renaming in July 1948 as the 17th battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 1948 the remaining cadre of the 2nd battalion was absorbed into the 1st battalion. The battalion served as part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation forces in Germany]], stationed in Dortmund in 1949 and Berlin in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;W560&quot;&gt;Ward p. 560&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd battalion was reformed in 1952{{efn|On of only seven regiments to do so, the others were the [[Green Howards]], [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]], [[Black Watch]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]].&lt;ref name =&quot;W559&quot;/&gt;}} and was sent to Germany, substituting for the 1st battalion which had been sent to Korea, the battalions re-amalgamated in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;W560&quot;/&gt;

====Korea====
While in Germany the battalion learned that it was due for a tour of service in [[Korea]], after leave and training in Britain it arrived in September 1952, and was made part of [[28th Commonwealth Brigade]] of the [[1st Commonwealth Division]] part of the [[United Nations]] forces in Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;W560&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses pp. 6–9&lt;/ref&gt; During its year there up to 50% of its strength was composed of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Servicemen]] and resulted in a high turnover of men.&lt;ref&gt;Moses pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|One of the Regular officers who joined the battalion was 2nd Lt. [[Peter de la Billière]] a.k.a. &quot;Eddie Smith&quot;. There were already many &quot;Peters&quot; in the battalion and the soldiers could not get their tongues around his surname.&lt;ref&gt;Moses p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;}} After initial training in theatre the battalion was first stationed at Neachon (Point 159) in late September, to be greeted by the Chinese by name on arrival (on this and subsequent movement into the front line, as were other battalions).&lt;ref&gt;Moses pps. 16, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Here it began the never-ending process of attempting to make its trenches clean and habitable,&lt;ref&gt;Moses p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Nearby Australian battalions called this &quot;Trench Beautification&quot;.}} and began patrolling to dominate no-mans-land. In November two trench raids were mounted to try and capture Chinese soldiers, but these were unsuccessful in spite of reaching the Chinese lines due to defensive fire and the extensive use of dugouts by the Chinese in their trench system.&lt;ref&gt;Moses pp. 34-38&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of December in the cold of a Korean winter, the battalion took over and began repairing the trenches at Point 210, and continued patrolling, they were relieved by the Americans at the end of January.&lt;ref&gt;Moses pp. 39–42&lt;/ref&gt;

In early April 1953, after being joined by a draft of 94 Korean soldiers who wore British uniform and the D.L.I. cap badge, the battalion relieved the Americans on Point 355, also known as &quot;little Gibraltar&quot; for its steep sides.&lt;ref&gt;Moses p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion continued to patrol vigorously, encountering Chinese patrols on occasion. On the night of 2 July, to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, a patrol from A Company staked out the letters &quot;EIIR&quot; in red and yellow fluorescent aircraft recognition panels about ten metres below the Chinese forward trenches.&lt;ref name =&quot;M46&quot;&gt;Moses p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=So the first thing we saw at daybreak were these panels that stood out brilliantly. About half way through the morning every 25-pounder gun in the Commonwealth Division began firing red, white and blue smoke on the Chinese lines in front of us. While this was going on, the men in the forward positions jumped on the trench parapets and gave three cheers for Her Majesty. There was some concern that the Chinese might take advantage of the cover provided by the smoke and attack us, but they behaved themselves and probably thought that we were all mad.|sign=Capt Burini, D.L.I.|source=&lt;ref name =&quot;M46&quot;/&gt;}}

At 22:00 hours 27 July, after continued patrolling and ambushes defending the position in the closing stages of the conflict, the battalion buglers sounded &quot;ceasefire&quot;. The battalion had lost 24 dead (including 2 attached Koreans) and three missing and 124 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Moses pps. 56, 58&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion left Korea in September.

====Post Korea====
From Korea the 1st battalion was stationed in Egypt, where buglers from the battalion took part in the unveiling of the El-Alamein Memorial on 24 October 1954.&lt;ref&gt;County Durham Books picture 147&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion returned to Britain in June 1955.&lt;ref name =&quot;W560&quot;/&gt;

In 1955 the 3rd and 4th battalions were finally disbanded, they had been in suspended animation since 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Order of Service (4th)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Suez Crisis]] the battalion was flown to [[Aden]] on 4 November 1956 for possible deployment to [[Kuwait]]. Most of the battalion returned in February 1957, except for one company which assisted in repelling a Yemeni incursion in the Wadi Harib area.&lt;ref name =&quot;W560&quot;/&gt;

On 17 May 1958 a bicentenary parade was held at Brancepeth Castle in the presence of Princess Alexandria of Kent to commemorate the raising of the regiment. Present were the 1st battalion and one company each from the 6th and 8th battalions as well as their massed bands and bugles, and detachments from 437th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment R.A. (D.L.I.) T.A.,{{efn|Formed from the merger of the 589th and 590th Searchlight Regiments R.A. (DLI), both reformed in April 1947 from the wartime R.A. regiments that were originally the [[List of battalions of the Durham Light Infantry#Inter-War|1/5th and 2/5th]] battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;}} 463th (7 D.L.I.) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment R.A. T.A. and the 17th battalion The Parachute Regiment (9 D.L.I.) T.A.. The associated Artillery and Parachute Regiments also provided troops who lined the route from the castle gates to the parade area.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p. 564–565&lt;/ref&gt;

====Borneo====
While in Hong Kong in June 1965 the battalion was informed it was to be deployed to [[Borneo]] as part of Britain's response to the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]]. Here they patrolled the Jungle taking part in the secret 'Claret' operations across the border into Indonesia alongside the [[Gurkha]]s and Australians.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison ch. 6 &amp; 8&lt;/ref&gt; During one of these operations the D.L.I. suffered its last combat fatality, Pte Thomas Griffiths on 26 February 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amalgamation===
Finally in 1968, whilst the battalion was again serving in Cyprus, it was announced that the Durham Light Infantry would join with three other county light infantry regiments to form one large Regiment, [[The Light Infantry]], it was to be renamed the 4th battalion the Light Infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/infantry/light-infantry.html|title=The Light Infantry|publisher=British Army units 1945 on|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 1968 the 1st battalion laid up its colours in a service in Durham Cathedral, attended by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]], the Regiment's last Colonel in Chief, who inspected the battalion and veterans of the D.L.I. Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamrecordoffice.org.uk/Pages/AdvancedSearchCatalogueDetail.aspx?SearchType=Param&amp;SearchID=c3b90919-53a2-4c96-a01c-d41250817f54&amp;Display=50&amp;Page=3&amp;ImageView=List&amp;ItemID=165091&amp;ImageID=320644|title=Photograph of Princess Alexandra talking to soldiers, 13 December 1968|publisher=Durham Record Office|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==D.L.I. Museum==
The [http://www.dlidurham.org.uk/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx D.L.I. Museum] ({{Coord|54.7844|-1.5811|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}) (now closed) was the official museum of the Durham Light Infantry. Located in [[Durham, England]], the museum featured displays about the regiment's history, with an emphasis on World War I and World War II activities. Exhibits included uniforms, weapons, medals, flags, hats, letters, photographs, badges, ceremonial regalia and other artefacts. The museum was located on the first two floors, with the Durham Art Gallery located on the third floor.
In October 2015 Durham County Council announced the closure of the D.L.I. Museum as a cost saving exercise. This decision sparked the formation of a campaign to see the museum saved led by John Richardson.

==D.L.I. Memorial==
In July 2012, the Durham Light Infantry Association Memorial was dedicated at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Durham Light Infantry memorial unveiled in Staffordshire|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18941423|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was attended by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/CourtCircular Court Circular]&lt;/ref&gt;
