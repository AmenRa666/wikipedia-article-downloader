'''No. 76 Wing''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] that operated during World War II. Initially based in [[Far North Queensland]], its headquarters transferred to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, in September 1944 to take control of three [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] units: [[No. 20 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;20]], [[No. 42 Squadron RAAF|42]], and [[No. 43 Squadron RAAF|43 Squadrons]]. The prime task of these squadrons was [[Minelayer|minelaying]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]], and they conducted these operations as far afield as Java, Borneo, the Philippines, and China. As well as minelaying, No.&amp;nbsp;76 Wing's Catalinas flew bombing, patrol, and transport missions, and dropped millions of [[propaganda]] leaflets in the closing months of the war. The wing headquarters disbanded in November 1945.

==History==
No. 76 Wing headquarters was established at [[Townsville]], Queensland, on 3&amp;nbsp;January 1944, and moved to Cairns mid-month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monograph&quot;&gt;AWM, ''Squadrons, Formations &amp; Units of the Royal Australian Air Force and Their Deployment'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Reginald Burrage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_22855.asp Air Commodore Reginald Bruce Burrage] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 26 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/22.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 362–365]&lt;/ref&gt; it transferred to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, in September to coordinate and control [[Minelayer|minelaying]] operations in the [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]] by [[No. 20 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;20]], [[No. 42 Squadron RAAF|42]], and [[No. 43 Squadron RAAF|43 Squadrons]]. Each of the squadrons was equipped with [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] flying boats, nicknamed &quot;Black Cats&quot;; No.&amp;nbsp;20 had been based in Cairns with No.&amp;nbsp;76 Wing headquarters, No.&amp;nbsp;42 had just been formed at Darwin in August, while No.&amp;nbsp;43 had been operating out of Darwin since March. Minelaying missions carried out by the RAAF over the past year had been credited with successfully disrupting enemy shipping for a much smaller outlay of operating hours than conventional bombing, and were thus considered profitable enough to dedicate a wing with three squadrons to furthering the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 168–171&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Catalinas were relatively slow and susceptible to enemy fighter attack, their loss rate was no more than one per 95 [[sortie]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/26.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 518]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its flying squadrons, the wing controlled No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Boat Maintenance Unit, No.&amp;nbsp;11 Air Sea Rescue Flight, and No.&amp;nbsp;3 Mobile Torpedo Unit. All units were located in Darwin except No.&amp;nbsp;42 Squadron, which was based at [[Gove Airport|Melville Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Forgotten Air Force'', pp. 195, 207&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:43 sqn (AWM 128022).jpg|thumb|left|260px|Catalina of No. 43 Squadron|alt=Black-painted twin-engined military amphibious aircraft in flight]]
The Catalina squadrons were expected to carry out a total of 100 missions per month from Darwin.  In their first three weeks of operation from 13&amp;nbsp;September 1944 they accomplished 98, mining targets in [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Java]], and [[Surabaya]]. In October, they were able to use the recently liberated island of [[Morotai]] as a forward base for operations against [[Balikpapan]] and [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp. 365–372&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 365–372&lt;/ref&gt; On 14&amp;nbsp;December, No.&amp;nbsp;43 Squadron, augmented by Catalinas from [[No. 11 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron]] based at [[RAAF Base Rathmines|Rathmines]], New South Wales, mined [[Manila Bay]] to keep Japanese shipping &quot;bottled up&quot;, thus supporting the [[Battle of Mindoro|Allied landing at Mindoro]] taking place the next day. Flying from [[Leyte Island|Leyte]], the 24 Catalinas successfully dropped 60 mines in the heavily defended target area for the loss of one of their number, and returned to base at the limit of their fuel reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/23.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 375–376]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=275 RAAF Catalinas mine Manila Bay] at [http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Home.aspx Air Power Development Centre]. Retrieved on 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of 1945, monsoonal weather in Darwin reduced the number of missions flown by No.&amp;nbsp;76 Wing. On the night of 5/6&amp;nbsp;April, three Catalinas kept watch on the Japanese cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Isuzu|''Isuzu'']], which was subsequently struck by Allied bombers and sunk by submarines.&lt;ref name=&quot;43Sqn&quot;&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; During the month, the Catalinas mined [[Hong Kong]] harbour, as well as targets on the coast of mainland China, flying up to sixteen hours per mission. On 26&amp;nbsp;May, they undertook the RAAF's most northerly operation during the Pacific War, against [[Wenzhou|Wenchow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp. 365–372&quot;/&gt; The same month, [[Group Captain]] Stuart Campbell, former leader of No.&amp;nbsp;42 Squadron, took over command of the wing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170182b.htm Campbell, Stuart Alexander Caird] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]. Retrieved on 26 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In May–June, reinforced by a detachment from No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron, No.&amp;nbsp;76 Wing flew mining and bombing missions in support of the forthcoming Operation Oboe Six, the [[Battle of North Borneo]], and Oboe Two, the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Battle of Balikpapan]]. Before Oboe Six, while some of the Catalinas concentrated on mining the approaches to Surabaya harbour, others bombed airfields in Java and Celebes in concert with RAAF [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]]. The Catalinas and Liberators combined again in the lead-up to Oboe Two to raid any Japanese airfields that could threaten Balikpapan, in some cases bombing the same target around the clock, the Catalinas by night and Liberators by day.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 475–476]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NWA0981No.42SqnCatalina1945.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Catalina of No. 42 Squadron at Darwin, 1945|alt=Twin-engined military amphibious aircraft in harbour]]
With the Allies' decision to confine RAAF minelaying operations to areas south of China from June onwards, the number of worthwhile targets for the Catalinas was reduced. Sorties for the month were down to 58, a number of which were carried out from [[Labuan]] against [[Bangka Strait|Banka Strait]]. The wing's last minelaying missions of the war took place in July, again in the Banka Strait. In the final months before the Japanese surrender, the Catalinas also delivered [[propaganda]] leaflets around the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[South China Sea]], dropping over a million in June alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp. 365–372&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;76 Wing and its squadrons remained at Darwin in the immediate aftermath of the war, conducting routine patrols, transporting supplies and medicine to prisoners-of-war in the South West Pacific, and assisting in the repatriation of Australian personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;43Sqn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;20Sqn&quot;&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/20sqn.htm No 20 Squadron] at [[RAAF Museum]].
