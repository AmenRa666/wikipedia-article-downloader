'''HMS ''Prince of Wales''''' was a [[King George V-class battleship (1939)|''King George V''-class]] [[battleship]] of the [[Royal Navy]], built at the [[Cammell Laird]] shipyard in [[Birkenhead]], England. She was involved in several key actions of the Second World War, including the [[battle of Denmark Strait]] against the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], operations escorting convoys in the Mediterranean, and her [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|final action and sinking]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] in 1941.

''Prince of Wales'' had an extensive battle history, first seeing action in August 1940 while still being outfitted in her [[drydock]], being attacked and damaged by German aircraft. Her brief but storied career ended 10 December 1941, when ''Prince of Wales'' and [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] became the first capital ships to be sunk solely by air power on the open sea, a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was subsequently to play in naval warfare. The wreck lies upside down in {{convert|223|ft|m}} of water, near [[Kuantan]], in the [[South China Sea]].

== Construction ==
In the aftermath of the First World War, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an [[arms race]] developing between Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the [[tonnage]] of all [[capital ships]] at 35,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the [[London Naval Treaty|Treaty of London]], however, by the mid-1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties, and the British became concerned about a lack of modern battleships within their navy. As a result, the [[Admiralty]] ordered the construction of a new battleship class: the ''King George V'' class. Due to the provisions of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the Treaty of London, both of which were still in effect when the ''King George V''s were being designed, the main armament of the class was limited to the {{convert|14|in|mm|sing=on|0}} guns prescribed under these instruments. They were the only battleships built at that time to adhere to the treaty, and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements, it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;K20&quot;&gt;Konstam, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prince of Wales'' was originally named ''King Edward VIII'' but upon the abdication of [[Edward VIII]] the ship was renamed even before she had been [[keel|laid down]]. This occurred at [[Cammell Laird]]'s shipyard in [[Birkenhead]] on 1 January 1937, although it was not until 3 May 1939 that she was launched. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her construction schedule, and that of her [[sister ship|sister]], {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}, to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the late delivery of gun mountings caused delays in her outfitting.&lt;ref name=&quot;G177&quot;&gt;Garzke p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

During early August 1940, while she was still being outfitted and was in a semi-complete state, ''Prince of Wales'' was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the [[bilge keel]]. The explosion took place about six feet from the ship's port side in the vicinity of the after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the [[shell plating]] took place over a distance of 20 to {{convert|30|ft|m}}, rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;G177&quot; /&gt;

The water was pumped out through the joint efforts of a local fire company and the shipyard, and ''Prince of Wales'' was later dry docked for permanent repairs. This damage and the problem with the delivery of her main guns and turrets delayed her completion. As the war progressed there was an urgent need for capital ships, and so her completion was advanced by postponing compartment air tests, ventilation tests and a thorough testing of her bilge, [[Ballast tank|ballast]] and fuel-oil systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;G177&quot; /&gt;

== Description ==
{{Main|King George V-class battleship (1939)}}

''Prince of Wales'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|36727|LT|t|-2}} as built and {{convert|43786|LT|t|-2}} fully loaded. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|745|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|103|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|29|ft|m|1}}. Her designed [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m}} at normal load and {{convert|8|ft|1|in|m}} at deep load.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau (Conways) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving four propeller shafts. Steam was provided by eight [[Admiralty boiler]]s which normally delivered {{convert|100000|shp|lk=in}}, but could deliver {{convert|110000|shp|abbr=on}} at emergency overload.{{#tag:ref|The [[King George V-class battleship (1939)#Machinery|''King George V''-class]] battleships had their steam plant specifications revised during the building phase, and as built the ships actually produced 110,000 shp at 230 rpm, and were designed for an overload power of 125,000 shp, which was exceeded in service.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts pp.284 and 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garzke p. 191&quot;&gt;Garzke p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}
This gave ''Prince of Wales'' a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;K20&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; The ship carried {{convert|3542|LT|t|-2}} of fuel oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;G253&quot;&gt;Garzke p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; She also carried {{convert|180|LT|t|-2}} of diesel oil, {{convert|256|LT|t|-2}} of reserve feed water and {{convert|444|LT|t|-2}} of freshwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;G253&quot; /&gt; During full power trials on 31 March 1941, ''Prince of Wales'' at 42,100 tons displacement achieved 28 knots with 111,600 shp at 228 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.73&amp;nbsp;lb per shp.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1995, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;''Prince of Wales'' had a range of {{convert|3100|nmi}} at {{convert|27|kn}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;C6&quot; /&gt;

=== Armament ===
''Prince of Wales'' mounted 10 [[BL 14 inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 14-inch (356 mm) Mk VII guns]]. The 14-inch guns were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one [[aft]]. The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: turret &quot;A&quot;, 286 degrees; turret &quot;B&quot;, 270 degrees; turret &quot;X&quot;, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was done by hydraulic drives, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun [[broadside]] weighed {{convert|15950|lb|kg}}, and a [[salvo]] could be fired every 40 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary armament consisted of 16 [[QF 5.25 inch Mark I naval gun|QF 5.25-inch (133 mm) Mk I guns]] which were mounted in eight twin mounts, weighing 81 tons each.&lt;ref name=&quot;G229&quot;&gt;Garzke p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum range of the Mk I guns was {{convert|24070|yd|m|1}} at a 45-degree elevation, the anti-aircraft ceiling was {{convert|49000|ft|m|1}}. The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The normal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute, but in practice the guns could only fire seven to eight [[rounds per minute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;G229&quot; /&gt; Along with her main and secondary batteries, ''Prince of Wales'' carried 32 [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2 pdr (1.575-inch, 40.0 mm) Mk.VIII]] &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns. She also carried 80 [[Unrotated Projectile|UP projectors]], which were short range rocket firing anti-aircraft weapons used extensively in the early days of the Second World War by the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;C6&quot; /&gt;

== History of operation ==

=== Action with Bismarck ===
{{main|Battle of the Denmark Strait}}

On 22 May 1941, ''Prince of Wales'', the [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Hood (51)|''Hood'']] and six destroyers were ordered to take station south of [[Iceland]] and intercept the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] if she attempted to break out into the Atlantic. [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] knew that main-battery breakdowns were likely to occur, since [[Vickers Armstrongs]] technicians had already corrected some that took place during training exercises in [[Scapa Flow]]. These technicians were personally requested by the captain to remain aboard. They did so and played an important role in the resulting action.&lt;ref name=&quot;G177-179&quot;&gt;Garzke pp. 177–179&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day ''Bismarck'', in company with the [[heavy cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]'', was reported heading south-westward in the [[Denmark Strait]]. At 20:00 [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]], in his [[flagship]] ''Hood'', ordered the force to steam at 27 knots, which it did most of the night. His battle plan called for ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Hood'' to concentrate on ''Bismarck'', while the cruisers [[HMS Norfolk (78)|''Norfolk'']] and [[HMS Suffolk (55)|''Suffolk'']] would handle ''Prinz Eugen''. However the two cruisers were not informed of this plan because of strict [[Radio silence#Military|radio silence]]. At 02:00, on 24 May, the destroyers were sent as a screen to search for the German ships to the north, and at 02:47 ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'' increased speed to 28 knots and changed course slightly to obtain a better target angle on the German ships. The weather improved, with ten-mile (16&amp;nbsp;km) visibility, and crews were at action stations by 05:10.&lt;ref name=&quot;G177-179&quot; /&gt;

At 05:37 an enemy contact report was made, and course was changed to starboard to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. ''Hood'', designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate horizontal protection and would have to close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. ''Prince of Wales'', with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than {{convert|17000|ft|m}}, but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their [[aft]] turrets could not fire. ''Prinz Eugen'', with ''Bismarck'' [[wikt:astern#Adverb|astern]], had the ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Hood'' slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full [[broadside]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;G179&quot;&gt;Garzke p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

At 05:53, despite seas breaking over the bows, ''Prince of Wales'' opened fire on ''Bismarck'' at 26,500 yards.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 234/509&quot;&gt;ADM 234/509&lt;/ref&gt; There was some confusion among the British as to which ship was ''Bismarck'' and thirty seconds earlier ''Hood'' had mistakenly opened fire on ''Prinz Eugen'' as the German ships had similar profiles. ''Hood''{{'}}s first salvo straddled the enemy ship, but ''Prinz Eugen'', in less than three minutes, scored 8-inch-shell hits on ''Hood''. The first shots by ''Prince of Wales'' – two three-gun salvoes at ten second intervals – were 1,000 yards over.&lt;ref name=&quot;G179&quot; /&gt; The turret rangefinders on ''Prince of Wales'' could not be used because of spray over the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and fire was instead directed from the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} rangefinders in the control tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;G180&quot;&gt;Garzke p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth, ninth and thirteenth salvos were straddles&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 234/509&quot;/&gt; and two decisive hits were made on ''Bismarck''. One shell holed her bow and caused ''Bismarck'' to lose 1,000 tons of fuel oil, mostly to salt-water contamination. The other fell short, and entered ''Bismarck'' below her side armour belt, the shell exploded and flooded the auxiliary boiler machinery room and forced the shutdown of two boilers due to a slow leak in the boiler room immediately aft. The loss of fuel and boiler power were decisive factors in the ''Bismarck''{{'}}s decision to return to port.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/bismarck/history/bisescapes.html Asmussen, John. The Bismarck Escapes ]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Prince of Wales'', &quot;A1&quot; gun ceased fire after the first salvo due to a defect.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 234/509&quot;/&gt; Sporadic breakdowns occurred until the decision to turn away was made, and during the turn &quot;Y&quot; turret jammed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 234/509&quot;/&gt;

Both German ships initially concentrated their fire on ''Hood'' and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire blazed high above the first superstructure deck. At 05:58 at a range of 16,500 yards, the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on ''Bismarck''. As the turn began, ''Bismarck'' straddled ''Hood'' with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near ''Hood''{{'}}s masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On ''Prince of Wales'', it seemed that ''Hood'' collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. ''Prince of Wales'' made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris and in doing so further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, ''Hood'', the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;G180&quot; /&gt;

''Prince of Wales'' fired unopposed until she began a port turn at 05:57, when ''Prinz Eugen'' took her under fire. After ''Hood'' exploded at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on ''Prince of Wales'', with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as ''Prince of Wales'' manoeuvred through the wreckage of ''Hood''. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the starboard side of the compass platform and killed the majority of the personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;G180&quot; /&gt; A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on the starboard side of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.&lt;ref&gt;Raven and Roberts p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

At 06:05 Captain Leach decided to disengage and laid down a heavy smokescreen to cover ''Prince of Wales''{{'}}s escape. Following this, Leach radioed the ''Norfolk'' that the ''Hood'' had been sunk and then proceeded to join the ''Norfolk'' roughly 15 to 17 miles astern of the ''Bismarck''. Throughout the day the British ships continued to chase the ''Bismarck'' until at 18:16 when ''Suffolk'' sighted the ''Bismarck'' at 22,000 yards. ''Prince of Wales'' then proceeded to open fire on ''Bismarck'' at an extreme range of 30,300 yards, she fired twelve salvos but owing to the range all of them missed. At 01:00 on 25 May ''Prince of Wales'' once again regained contact and proceeded to open fire at a radar range of 20,000 yards, after observers believed that she had scored a hit on ''Bismarck'', ''Prince of Wales's'' &quot;A&quot; turret temporarily jammed, leaving her with only six operational guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 234/509&quot;/&gt; After losing the ''Bismarck'' owing to poor visibility and after searching for twelve hours, ''Prince of Wales'' headed for Iceland and would take no further part in actions against the ''Bismarck''.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atlantic Charter meeting ===
[[File:Prince of Wales-2.jpg|thumb|right|''Prince of Wales'' off Newfoundland, 10–12 August 1941, after bringing Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Atlantic Charter Conference]]

Following repairs at [[Rosyth]], ''Prince of Wales'' transported Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] across the Atlantic for a secret conference with [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;C12&quot;&gt;Chesneau p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August Roosevelt boarded the cruiser {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|6}} from the [[presidential yacht]] {{USS|Potomac|AG-25|2}}. ''Augusta'' proceeded from Massachusetts to [[Placentia Bay]] and Argentia in Newfoundland in company with the cruiser {{USS|Tuscaloosa|CA-37|6}} and five destroyers, arriving on 7 August while the presidential yacht played a decoy role by continuing to cruise New England waters as if the President were still on board. On 9 August Winston Churchill arrived in the bay aboard ''Prince of Wales'', escorted by the destroyers [[USS Shubrick (DD-268)|HMS ''Ripley'']], {{HMCS|Assiniboine|I18|6}} and {{HMCS|Restigouche|H00|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; At Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, Roosevelt transferred to the destroyer {{USS|McDougal|DD-358|6}} to meet Winston Churchill on board ''Prince of Wales''. The conference continued from 10 to 12 August aboard the heavy cruiser USS ''Augusta'', and at the end of the conference, the [[Atlantic Charter]] was proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Following the declaration of the charter, ''Prince of Wales'' arrived back at Scapa Flow on 18 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;C12&quot; /&gt;

=== Mediterranean duty ===
In September following the meeting with President Roosevelt ''Prince of Wales'' was assigned to [[Force H]], in the Mediterranean. On 24 September ''Prince of Wales'' formed part of Group II, led by Vice-Admiral [[Alban Curteis]] and consisting of the battleships ''Prince of Wales'' and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}, the cruisers {{HMS|Kenya|14|2}}, {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|2}}, {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}} and {{HMS|Euryalus|42|2}}, and twelve destroyers. The force provided an escort for [[Operation Halberd]], a supply convoy from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September the convoy was attacked by Italian aircraft, with ''Prince of Wales'' shooting down several with her [[QF 5.25 inch Mark I naval gun|{{convert|5.25|in|mm|adj=on}} guns]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garzke p. 191&quot; /&gt; Later that day there were reports that units of the Italian Fleet were approaching. ''Prince of Wales'', the battleship ''Rodney'' and the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} were despatched to intercept, but the search proved fruitless. The convoy arrived in Malta without further incident, and ''Prince of Wales'' returned to Gibraltar, before sailing on to Scapa Flow, arriving there on 6 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;C12&quot; /&gt;

{{Main|Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse}}

On 25 October ''Prince of Wales'' and a destroyer escort left home waters bound for [[Singapore]], there to rendezvous with the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} and the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|2}}. ''Indomitable'' however ran aground off [[Jamaica]] a few days later and was unable to proceed. Calling at [[Freetown]] and [[Cape Town]] South Africa to refuel and generate publicity, ''Prince of Wales'' also stopped in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Maldive Islands]]. ''Prince of Wales'' reached [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], on 28 November, joining ''Repulse'' the next day. On 2 December the fleet docked in Singapore.&lt;ref name=&quot;C12&quot; /&gt; ''Prince of Wales'' then became the flagship of [[Force Z]], under the command of [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Tom Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;Dull p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prince of Wales and Repulse.jpg||thumb|left|''Prince of Wales'' (left, front) and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} (left, behind) under Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941. The destroyer in the foreground is {{HMS|Express|H61|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen and Grove p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Japanese troop convoys were first sighted on 6 December. Two days later, [[Bombing of Singapore (1941)|Japanese aircraft raided Singapore]]; although the ''Prince of Wales''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, they scored no hits and had no effect on the Japanese aircraft. A signal was received from the [[Admiralty]] in London ordering the British squadron to commence hostilities, and that evening, confident that a protective air umbrella would be provided by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] presence in the region, Admiral Phillips set sail. Force Z at this time comprised the battleship ''Prince of Wales'', the battlecruiser ''Repulse'', and the destroyers {{HMS|Electra|H27|2}}, {{HMS|Express|H61|2}}, {{HMS|Tenedos|H04|2}} and {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;C12-13&quot;&gt;Chesneau pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The object of the sortie was to attack Japanese transports at [[Kota Bharu]], but in the afternoon of 9 December the Japanese submarine I-56 spotted the British ships, and in the evening they were detected by Japanese aerial reconnaissance. By this time it had been made clear that no RAF fighter support would be forthcoming. At midnight a signal was received that Japanese forces were landing at Kuantan in Malaya. Force Z was diverted to investigate. At 02:11 on 10 December the force was again sighted by a Japanese submarine and at 08:00 arrived off Kuantan, only to discover that the reported landings were a diversion.&lt;ref name=&quot;C12-13&quot; /&gt;

[[File:HMS Prince of Wales in first torpedo attack-EN.svg||thumb|left|''Prince of Wales'' in first torpedo attack]]
At 11:00 that morning the first Japanese air attack began. Eight [[Mitsubishi G3M|Type 96 &quot;Nell&quot;]] bombers dropped their bombs close to ''Repulse'', one passing through the hangar roof and exploding on the 1-inch plating of the main deck below. The second attack force, comprising seventeen &quot;Nells&quot; armed with torpedoes, arrived at 11:30, divided into two attack formations. Despite reports to the contrary, ''Prince of Wales'' was struck by only one torpedo,&lt;ref name=&quot;explorers1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Expedition 'Job 74' survey report |url=http://www.explorers.org/flag_reports/Flag_118_-_Kevin_Denlay_-_Update.pdf |author=Denlay, Kevin |publisher=Explorers.org |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Garzke, William |author2=Dulin, Robert |author3=Denlay, Kevin |url=http://www.rina.org.uk/c2/uploads/death%20of%20a%20battleship.pdf |title=Death of a Battleship: A Reanalysis of the Tragic Loss of HMS ''Prince of Wales'' |publisher=Royal Institution of Naval Architects |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was enough to prove fatal, (while ''Repulse'' avoided the seven torpedoes aimed at her, as well as bombs dropped by six other &quot;Nells&quot; a few minutes later).

The torpedo struck ''Prince of Wales'' on the port side aft, abaft &quot;Y&quot; Turret, wrecking the outer propeller shaft on that side and destroying bulkheads to one degree or another along the shaft all the way to B Engine Room. This caused rapid uncontrollable flooding&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; and put the entire electrical system in the after part of the ship out of action. Lacking effective damage control, she soon took on a heavy list.&lt;ref name=&quot;C13&quot;&gt;Chesneau p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

A third torpedo attack developed against ''Repulse'' and once again she avoided taking any hits.

A fourth attack, conducted by torpedo-carrying [[Mitsubishi G4M|Type 1 &quot;Bettys&quot;]], developed. This one scored hits on ''Repulse'' and she sank at 12:33. Six aircraft from this wave also attacked ''Prince of Wales'', hitting her with three torpedoes,&lt;ref name=&quot;explorers1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; causing further damage and flooding. Finally, a {{convert|500|kg|adj=on}} bomb hit ''Prince of Wales'''s catapult deck, penetrated to the main deck, where it exploded, causing many casualties in the makeshift aid centre in the Cinema Flat. Several other bombs from this attack scored very 'near misses', indenting the hull, popping rivets and causing hull plates to 'split' along the seams and intensifying the flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; At 13:15 the order to abandon ship was given, and at 13:20 ''Prince of Wales'' capsized and sank; Vice-Admiral Phillips and Captain Leach were among the 327 fatalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;C13&quot; /&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
[[File:HMS POW Bell.jpg|thumb|The ship's bell on display at the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] in Liverpool]]

''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' were the first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by land-based rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' were her surface-scanning [[radar]] being inoperable, depriving Force Z of one of its most potent early-warning devices and the early critical damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to ''Prince of Wales''{{'}}s demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving ''Prince of Wales'' of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;
The sinking was the subject of an inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice Bucknill, but the true causes of the ship's loss were only established when divers examined the wreck after the war.  The Director of Naval Construction's report on the sinking claimed that the ship's anti-aircraft guns could have &quot;inflicted heavy casualties before torpedoes were dropped, if not preventing the successful conclusion of attack had crews been more adequately trained in their operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=4547444&amp;CATLN=6&amp;accessmethod=5|title=''Loss of HMS PRINCE OF WALES: reports of 2nd Bucknill Committee, etc|publisher=The Admiralty|accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The wreck ===
The wreck lies upside down in {{convert|223|ft|m}} of water at {{Coord|3|33|36|N|104|28|42|E}}. A Royal Navy White Ensign attached to a line on a buoy tied to a propeller shaft is periodically renewed. The wreck site was designated a 'Protected Place' in 2001 under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]], just prior to the 60th anniversary of her sinking. The ship's bell was manually raised in 2002 by British technical divers with the permission of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and blessing of the Force Z Survivors Association. It was restored, then presented for permanent display by [[First Sea Lord]] and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral [[Alan West, Baron West of Spithead|Sir Alan West]], to the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] in Liverpool. It is currently traditional for every passing Royal Navy ship to perform a remembrance service over the site of the wrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Rasor p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, Expedition 'Job 74',&lt;ref name=&quot;explorers1&quot; /&gt; a dedicated survey of the exterior hull of both ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'', was conducted. The expedition's findings sparked considerable interest among naval architects and marine engineers around the world; as they detailed the nature of the damage to ''Prince of Wales'' and the exact location and number of torpedo hits. Consequently, the findings contained in the initial expedition report&lt;ref name=&quot;explorers1&quot; /&gt; and later supplementary reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/ships/hms/prince_of_wales/pow-stern-damage.pdf |title=HMS ''Prince of Wales'' &amp;ndash; Stern Damage Survey |author=Denlay, Kevin |publisher=Pacific Wrecks.com |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/ships/hms/prince_of_wales/pow-hull-damage.pdf |title=Description of the Lower Hull Identation Damage on the ''Prince of Wales'' |author=Denlay, Kevin |publisher=Pacific Wrecks.com |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were analysed by the SNAME (Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sname.org/Home/ Home – Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]. Sname.org. Retrieved on 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine Forensics Committee, and a resultant paper was drawn up entitled &quot;Death of a Battleship: A Reanalysis of the Tragic Loss of HMS ''Prince of Wales''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; This paper was subsequently presented at a meeting of RINA (Royal Institution of Naval Architects)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rina.org.uk/ The Royal Institution of Naval Architects].

Retrieved on 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; members in London by Mr. William Garzke.

In October 2014, the Daily Telegraph reported that both ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' were being &quot;extensively damaged&quot; with explosives by scrap metal dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/11187603/Celebrated-British-warships-being-stripped-bare-for-scrap-metal.html|title=Celebrated British warships being stripped bare for scrap metal|author1=Julian Ryall, Tokyo  |author2=Joel Gunter|work=Daily Telegraph|date=25 October 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refits ==
During her career, ''Prince of Wales'' was refitted on several occasions, to bring her equipment up-to-date. The following are the dates and details of the refits undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
