'''Ray Fletcher Farquharson''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (4 August 1897 – 1 June 1965) was a Canadian doctor, university professor, and medical researcher. Born in [[Claude, Ontario]], he attended and taught at the [[University of Toronto]] for most of his life, and was trained and employed at [[Toronto General Hospital]]. With co-researcher [[Arthur Squires]], Farquharson was responsible for the discovery of the Farquharson phenomenon, an important principle of [[endocrinology]], which is that administering external hormones suppresses the natural production of that hormone.

He served in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, earning appointment as a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for his medical work during the latter. He chaired the Penicillin Committee of Canada and served as a medical consultant for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. He was awarded the Queen's Coronation Medal in 1953 for his work for the Defence Review Board. Farquharson was also a charter member of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]].

Farquharson was heavily involved in Canadian medical research and education. As a member of the [[National Research Council of Canada]], his &quot;Farquharson Report&quot; led to the establishment of the [[Medical Research Council of Canada]], of which he was the first president. He received numerous honorary degrees from Canadian universities, and served on the first Board of Governors of [[York University]]. He died in 1965, leaving a wife and two daughters. Farquharson was posthumously inducted into the [[Canadian Medical Hall of Fame]] in 1998.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Rff-ww1.JPG|thumb|left|Farquharson in training during the First World War]]
Farquharson was born in [[Claude, Ontario]] (a small town northwest of [[Toronto]]), on 4&amp;nbsp;August 1897 to Reverend William Farquharson, a [[Presbyterian]] minister, and Annie McDonald Coutts.&lt;ref name=ww55&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Who's Who|chapter=Farquharson, Ray Fletcher|page=349|volume=7|date=1955–57|publisher=Trans-Canada Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=proc&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada, series 4|volume=4|year=1966|author=Dauphinee, James|chapter=Ray Fletcher Farquharson|pages=83&amp;ndash;89}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Charles also became a doctor, while another brother, Robert, became the managing editor for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and was later an advisor at the Canadian Embassy to the United States.&lt;ref name=proc/&gt;&lt;ref name=globe2/&gt; &quot;Farquy&quot;, as he was nicknamed by friends,&lt;ref name=globe2/&gt; received his early education at [[Durham, Ontario|Durham]] and graduated from [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name=proc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mac/&gt; He briefly attended the [[University of Toronto]]'s medical school before being drafted into the Canadian Army on 15&amp;nbsp;May 1918, serving in the [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery|Canadian Field Artillery]] (67th&amp;nbsp;Battery) as a [[gunner (rank)|gunner]].

[[File:Rff-ww2.JPG|thumb|Ray Fletcher Farquharson during the Second World War]]
On 25 August 1943, Farquharson enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) and was assigned to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Air Command, based in [[Trenton, Ontario]].

He also appointed the first full-time clinical investigators to the Toronto medical school faculty and increased total faculty numbers from 40 to over 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deptmedicine.utoronto.ca/About_Us/History.htm|accessdate=30 October 2011|publisher=University of Toronto|title=Ray F.

Through his research in [[endocrinology]] with colleague Arthur Squires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Macallister W|author2= Squires, AH|author3=Farquharson, RF|date=November 1951|title= The effect of prolonged administration of thyroid|journal= Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=35|issue=5|pages=1008&amp;ndash;1022|pmid=14885883|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-35-5-1008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farquharson discovered what became known as the &quot;Farquharson Phenomenon&quot;: that the introduction of continuous [[exogenous]] [[Hormone#Pharmacology|hormone doses]] suppresses the natural production of that hormone in the patient and causes temporary atrophy in the producing organ.&lt;ref name=proc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mac/&gt; This phenomenon became one of the basic principles of endocrinology and a key factor in the etiology of hormonal abnormalities.&lt;ref name=proc/&gt;&lt;ref name=hot&gt;{{cite video|title=Hot docs: heroes of Canadian medicine|medium=CD|publisher=Canadian Medical Hall of Fame|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farquharson also made significant contributions related to [[anemia]] and [[secondary metabolism|pigment metabolism]].&lt;ref name=proc/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was the first Canadian doctor to publicize [[Sheehan's syndrome]], and the first North American to report on [[Simmond's disease]].&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Modern Medicine|title=Contemporaries|pages=85&amp;ndash;86|date=11 November 1963|volume=31|issue=23|editor=Page, Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an educator and researcher, he was an early promoter of laboratory testing in the evaluation of illness; he was known for advocating both this and awareness of potential psychological issues in patients.&lt;ref name=proc/&gt;

Farquharson became a member of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] in 1951,&lt;ref name=hot/&gt; and in 1957 was named the director of the Division of Medical Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|title=James Bertram Collip, 1892&amp;ndash;1965|volume=19|date=December 1973|author1=Barr, ML |author2=Rossiter, RJ |pmid=11615724|pages=235–267 [250]|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1973.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he chaired a [[Privy Council]] Committee tasked with producing a report on the state of medical research in Canada; this charge was in response to a 1957 report by the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges to the Prime Minister, which suggested that medical research in Canada was underfunded.&lt;ref name=proc/&gt; While researching his report, he visited the Soviet Union in 1959 as part of a contingent representing the Research Council; he remarked on the country's apparent emphasis on scientific research, and invited Soviet scientists to visit Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Globe and Mail|title=Canadians see USSR stressing research|date=19 November 1959|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farquharson concluded that existing government support for research in Canada failed to specifically address medical research as an independent discipline and was financially insufficient.&lt;ref name=mac&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Farquharson, Ray Fletcher|title=MacMillan Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=MacMillan|year=1978|edition=4th|editor1=Wallace, W.

Farquharson became the Regent of the American College of Physicians in 1958 after having spent three years as the organization's Ontario representative.

==Retirement and legacy==
In 1960, having reached the University of Toronto's compulsory retirement age,&lt;ref name=proc/&gt; Farquharson left the university and the hospital. In recognition of his work for Toronto General Hospital, the twelve-bed Clinical Investigation Unit was named after him in 1961, and the Farquharson Foundation was established to support research conducted by the university's teaching hospitals.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Globe and Mail|title=Hospital unit honors Dr. Farquharson; foundation will support research|author=Hollobon, Joan|page=3|date=14 December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1961, Farquharson visited India, later remarking on the societal respect for doctors there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Globe and Mail|title=MD advises patients to clarify symptoms|date=28 February 1961|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued to advocate for support for universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Globe and Mail|title=Plan to use funds to assist research|date=23 June 1961|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
