{{DISPLAYTITLE:USS ''Cole'' bombing}}
The '''USS ''Cole'' bombing''' was a [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]] against the [[United States Navy]] [[guided-missile destroyer]] {{USS|Cole|DDG-67}} on 12 October 2000, while it was being refueled in [[Yemen]]'s [[Aden]] harbor. Seventeen American sailors were killed and 39 injured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq56-1.htm | title=Casualties: U. S. Navy and Marine Corps   Personnel Killed and Wounded in Wars, Conflicts, Terrorist Acts, and Other Hostile Incidents | publisher=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the deadliest attack against a United States naval vessel [[USS Stark incident|since 1987]].

The terrorist organization [[al-Qaeda]] claimed responsibility for the attack. A U.S. judge has held [[Sudan]] liable for the attack, while another has released over $13 million in Sudanese frozen assets to the relatives of those killed. The United States Navy has reconsidered their [[rules of engagement]] in response to this attack.

==Attack==
[[File:INTEL-COGNITIVE-Cole.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Cole'' after the attack]]
On the morning of Thursday, 12 October 2000, USS ''Cole'', under the command of [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Kirk Lippold]], docked in Aden harbor for a routine fuel stop. ''Cole'' completed mooring at 09:30; refueling started at 10:30. Around 11:18 local time (08:18 [[UTC]]), a small fiberglass boat carrying explosives and two suicide bombers approached the port side of the destroyer and exploded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H7fT0BQxwDsC&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Encyclopedia of Terrorism |first1= Cindy C. |last1= Combs |first2= Martin W. |last2= Slann |publisher= [[Infobase Publishing]] |year= 2009 |ISBN= 9781438110196 |page= 353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a {{convert|40|by|60|ft|adj=on}} gash in the ship's port side, according to the memorial plate to those who lost their lives. Former CIA intelligence officer Robert Finke said the blast appeared to be caused by explosives molded into a [[shaped charge]] against the hull of the boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0010/18/bp.00.html | work=CNN | accessdate=27 May 2010 | title=Burden of Proof}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around {{convert|400|to|700|lbs}} of explosive were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian Bomb Type&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/aug/21/alqaida.iraq |title=Bomb type and tactics point to al-Qaida |last= Whitaker|first=Brian |date=21 August 2003&lt;!-- 09.00 BST --&gt;|work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=11 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the blast entered a mechanical space below the ship's [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], violently pushing up the deck, thereby killing crew members who were lining up for lunch.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan010901&gt;{{cite news | title=&quot;I Survived a Terrorist Attack&quot;: Jennifer Kudrik talks about the attack on the USS Cole | publisher=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]] | date=1 September 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew fought flooding in the engineering spaces and had the damage under control after three days. Divers inspected the hull and determined that the [[keel]] was not damaged.

Seventeen sailors were killed and 39 were injured in the blast. The injured were taken to the [[United States Army]]'s [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] near [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]], Germany, before being sent to the United States. The attack was the deadliest against a U.S. naval vessel since the Iraqi [[USS Stark incident|attack on USS ''Stark'']] on 17 May 1987. The [[asymmetric warfare]] attack was organized and directed by the terrorist organization [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name=CNN-05-15&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/05/15/cole.bombing.charges/index.html | title=Yemeni pair charged in USS Cole bombing | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=15 May 2003 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030602143447/http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/05/15/cole.bombing.charges/index.html | archivedate = 2 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/26/terror/main3414029.shtml Yemen Frees USS Cole Bomb Plotter.

Al-Qaeda had previously attempted a similar but less publicized attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer {{USS|The Sullivans|DDG-68|6}} while in port at Aden on 3 January 2000, as a part of the [[2000 millennium attack plots]]. The plan was to load a boat full of explosives and explode it near ''The Sullivans''. However, the boat was so overladen that it sank, forcing the attack to be abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terrorism&quot;&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.htm Terrorism 2000/2001].

Planning for the attack was discussed at the [[Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit]] shortly after the attempt, which was held from 5 to 8 January 2000. Along with other plotters, it was attended by future [[September 11 attacks|11 September]] [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijacker]] [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], who then traveled to [[San Diego]], California, where he established a close relationship with &quot;9/11 imam&quot; [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], who was later linked to numerous plots and attacks, including the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood shooting]]s and the [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253|&quot;underwear bomber&quot;]] of 2009 and was subsequently put on a [[targeted killing]] list by [[U.S. President|President]] [[Barack Obama]] as a terrorist threat. On 10 June 2000, Mihdhar left San Diego to visit his wife in Yemen at a house also used as a communications hub for al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;Nova: The Spy Factory television show.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;9/11 and Terror Travel, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ksm&quot;&gt;[[s:Substitution for the Testimony of KSM|Substitution for the Testimony of KSM]] at the trial of [[Zacarias Moussaoui]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the bombing, Yemeni Prime Minister [[Abdul Karim al-Iryani]] reported that Mihdhar had been one of the key planners of the attack and had been in the country at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;Smith (2005), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later return to the United States to participate in 9/11 on [[American Airlines Flight 77]], which flew into [[the Pentagon]], killing 184 victims.

===Rescue===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016|reason=No sources provided}}
The first naval ship on the scene to assist the stricken ''Cole'' was the [[Royal Navy]] [[Type 23 frigate]], {{HMS|Marlborough|F233|6}}, under the command of Capt Anthony Rix, RN. She was on passage to the UK after a six-month deployment in the Gulf. ''Marlborough'' had full medical and damage control teams on board and when her offer of assistance was accepted she immediately diverted to Aden. Eleven of the most badly injured sailors were sent via [[Medical evacuation|MEDEVAC]] to a French military hospital in [[Djibouti]] and underwent surgery before being sent to Germany.

The first U.S. military support to arrive was a [[U.S. Air Force Security Forces]] [[Quick Reaction Force]] from the 363d Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron, 363d Air Expeditionary Wing, based out of [[Prince Sultan Air Base]], [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], transported by [[C-130 Hercules|C-130]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}  They were followed by another small group of United States Marines from the Interim [[Marine Corps Security Force]] Company, [[Bahrain]] flown in by [[P-3 Orion|P-3]].  Both forces landed within a few hours after the ship was struck and were reinforced by a U.S Marine platoon with the 2nd [[Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team]] Company (FAST), based out of [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. The Marines from 4th Platoon, 2nd FAST arrived on the 13th from a security mission in [[Qatar]]. The FAST platoon and security forces airmen secured USS ''Cole'' and a nearby hotel that was housing the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen.{{citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=No reliable sources provided for entire section, &quot;I was there&quot; is not a valid source.}}

{{USS|Donald Cook|DDG-75|6}} and {{USS|Hawes|FFG-53|6}} made best speed to arrive in the vicinity of Aden that afternoon providing repair and logistical support. {{ship|USNS|Catawba|T-ATF-168|6}}, {{USS|Camden|AOE-2|6}}, {{USS|Anchorage|LSD-36|2}}, {{USS|Duluth|LPD-6|2}} and {{USS|Tarawa|LHA-1|2}} arrived in Aden some days later, providing watch relief crews, harbor security, damage control equipment, billeting, and food service for the crew of ''Cole''. [[LCU 1666]] provided daily runs from ''Tarawa'' with hot food and supplies and ferrying personnel to and from all other Naval vessels supporting ''Cole''. In the remaining days LCU 1632 and various personnel from LCU 1666 teamed up to patrol around ''Cole'' while the {{MV|Blue Marlin}} was preparing to take up station to receive ''Cole''.

[[File:MV Blue Marlin carrying USS Cole.jpg|thumb|left|{{MV|Blue Marlin}} carrying USS ''Cole'']]

==Investigation==
In a form of transport pioneered in 1988 by {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} aboard the ''[[Mighty Servant 2]]'', ''Cole'' was hauled from Aden aboard the Norwegian semi-submersible [[Heavy-lift ship#Submerging types|heavy lift salvage ship]] {{MV|Blue Marlin}}. She arrived in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]], on 24 December 2000, where she was rebuilt.

U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]] agents sent to Yemen to investigate the bombing worked in an extremely hostile environment. They were met at the airport by Yemen special forces with &quot;each soldier pointing an [[AK-47]]&quot;. Speakers in the [[House of Representatives (Yemen)|Yemeni parliament]] &quot;calling for jihad against America&quot;, were broadcast on local television each night. After some delay, the Yemenis produced a CCTV video from a harborside security camera, but the crucial moment of the explosion was deleted.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower'', Knopf, (2006), p. 325, ISBN 0-375-41486-X.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;There were so many perceived threats that the agents often slept in their clothes and with their weapons at their sides&quot;. At one point, the hotel where the agents stayed &quot;was surrounded with men in traditional dress, some in jeeps, all carrying guns&quot;. Finally the agents abandoned their hotel to stay at a Navy vessel in the Bay of Aden, but they still did not feel safe. After being granted &quot;permission from the Yemeni government to fly back to shore&quot;, an agent said their helicopter took evasive action during the flight due to fears of shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles.&lt;ref name=Tower&gt;Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower'', Knopf, (2006), pp. 322–331, ISBN 0-375-41486-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility ==
On 14 March 2007, a federal judge in the United States, [[Robert G. Doumar]], ruled that the Sudanese government was liable for the bombing.&lt;ref name=Michael2-&gt;{{cite web

| title=Federal judge rules Sudan responsible for USS ''Cole'' bombing in 2000

| publisher=NBC News
| author=NBC News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling was issued in response to a lawsuit filed against the Sudanese government by relatives of the victims, who claim that al-Qaeda could not have carried out the attacks without the support of Sudanese officials. The judge stated, &quot;There is substantial evidence in this case presented by the expert testimony that the government of Sudan induced the particular bombing of the ''Cole'' by virtue of prior actions of the government of Sudan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E5DC1E31F936A25750C0A9619C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Judge Finds Sudan Is Liable in Cole Case | date=15 March 2007 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 2007, Doumar ordered the Sudanese government to pay $8 million to the families of the 17 sailors who died. He calculated the amount they should receive by multiplying the salary of the sailors by the number of years they would have continued to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6916598.stm Sudan must pay USS ''Cole'' victims]. 25 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan's Justice Minister [[Mohammed al-Mard]] has stated that Sudan intends to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/B868384.htm Sudan to appeal verdict in USS ''Cole'' bombing case]. 26 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2008, all defendants convicted in the attack had escaped from prison or been freed by Yemeni officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to the Pentagon, the charges have been defined as &quot;organizing and directing&quot; the bombing of USS ''Cole''.  The charges still must be approved by a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] official who oversees [[Guantanamo military commission|military commissions]] set up for terrorism suspects.  [[The Pentagon]] will seek the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Aftermath==

===Rules of engagement===

The destroyer's rules of engagement, as approved by the Pentagon, kept its guards from firing upon the small boat (which was not known to be loaded with explosives) as it neared them without first obtaining permission from the ''Cole''{{'}}s captain or another officer.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{Cite journal

Petty Officer John Washak said that right after the blast, a senior chief petty officer ordered him to turn an M-60 machine gun on the ''Cole''{{'}}s fantail away from a second small boat approaching.  &quot;With blood still on my face&quot;, he said, he was told: &quot;That's the rules of engagement: no shooting unless we're shot at.&quot; He added, &quot;In the military, it's like we're trained to hesitate now. If somebody had seen something wrong and shot, he probably would have been court-martialed&quot;. Petty Officer Jennifer Kudrick said that if the sentries had fired on the suicide craft &quot;we would have gotten in more trouble for shooting two foreigners than losing seventeen American sailors&quot;.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;

=== Consequences ===
President [[Bill Clinton]] declared, &quot;If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable&quot;.

On 19 January 2001, the U.S. Navy completed and released its [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] Manual (JAGMAN) investigation of the incident, concluding that ''Cole''{{'}}s commanding officer Commander [[Kirk Lippold]] &quot;acted reasonably in adjusting his force protection posture based on his assessment of the situation that presented itself&quot; when ''Cole'' arrived in Aden to refuel. The JAGMAN also concluded that &quot;the commanding officer of ''Cole'' did not have the specific intelligence, focused training, appropriate equipment or on-scene security support to effectively prevent or deter such a determined, preplanned assault on his ship&quot; and recommended significant changes in Navy procedures.  In spite of this finding, Lippold was subsequently denied promotion and retired at the same rank of commander in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts, John 2008&quot;&gt;Roberts, John, and Jamie McIntyre, &quot;Exclusive Interview With Former USS ''Cole'' Captain&quot;, ''The Situation Room'', [[Cable News Network]], 1 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Afghanistan the bombing was a &quot;great victory for [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]]. [[Al-Qaeda]] camps...filled with new recruits, and contributors from the Gulf States arrived … with [[petrodollar]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tower /&gt;

Both the [[Clinton Administration]] and the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] have been criticized for failing to respond militarily to the attack on USS ''Cole'' before 11 September 2001. The ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]'' cites one source who said in February 2001, &quot;[bin Laden] complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked [in response to the ''Cole'']... Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger.&quot;&lt;ref name=911CommissionChap6&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch6.htm |publisher=[[9/11 Commission]] |title=Chapter 6 |accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of [[al-Qaeda]]'s involvement was inconclusive for months after the attack. The staff of the [[9/11 Commission]] found that al-Qaeda's direction of the bombing was under investigation but &quot;increasingly clear&quot; on 11 November 2000. It was an &quot;unproven assumption&quot; in late November. By 21 December the CIA had made a &quot;preliminary judgment&quot; that &quot;al Qaeda appeared to have supported the attack&quot; without a &quot;definitive conclusion&quot;.&lt;ref name=911CommissionStaffStatement8&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_8.pdf |publisher=[[9/11 Commission]] |title=Staff Statement 8 |accessdate=4 March 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts thereafter are varied and somewhat contradictory. Then-[[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] told the Commission that when the administration took office on 20 January 2001, &quot;We knew that there was speculation that the 2000 ''Cole'' attack was al Qaeda...We received, I think, on January 25 the same assessment [of al-Qaeda responsibility]. It was preliminary. It was not clear.&quot;

''The Washington Post'' reported that, on 9 February, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was briefed on bin Laden's responsibility &quot;without hedge.&quot;&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost020119&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A8734-2002Jan19 |title=A Strategy's Cautious Evolution: Before Sept. 11, the Bush Anti-Terror Effort Was Mostly Ambition |author=Barton Gellman |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=20 January 2002 |accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' reported that on the following day, &quot;six days after Bush took office&quot;, the FBI &quot;believed they had clear evidence tying the bombers to Al Qaeda&quot;.&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news |url=http://foi.missouri.edu/terrorismfoi/whatwentwrong.html |title=The inside story of the missed signals and intelligence failures that raise a chilling question: did September 11 have to happen? |author=Michael Hirsh, Michael Isikoff |work=Newsweek |date=27 May 2002 |accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conclusions are contrasted by testimony of key figures before the [[9/11 Commission]], summarized in the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]''. Former CIA Director [[George Tenet]] testified (page 196) that he &quot;believed he laid out what was knowable early in the investigation, and that this evidence never really changed until after 9/11.&quot;&lt;ref name=911Commission /&gt;
The report suggests (pages 201–202) that the official assessment was similarly vague until at least March 2001:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On January 25, Tenet briefed the President on the ''Cole'' investigation. The written briefing repeated for top officials of the new administration what the CIA had told the Clinton White House in November. This included the &quot;preliminary judgment&quot; that al Qaeda was responsible, with the caveat that no evidence had yet been found that Bin Ladin himself ordered the attack... in March 2001, the CIA's briefing slides for Rice were still describing the CIA's &quot;preliminary judgment&quot; that a &quot;strong circumstantial case&quot; could be made against al Qaeda but noting that the CIA continued to lack &quot;conclusive information on external command and control&quot; of the attack.&lt;ref name=911Commission&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm |publisher=[[9/11 Commission]] |title=911 Commission Report |accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Rice, the decision not to respond militarily to the ''Cole'' bombing was President Bush's. She said he &quot;made clear to us that he did not want to respond to al Qaeda one attack at a time. He told me he was 'tired of swatting flies.'&quot; The administration instead began work on a new strategy to eliminate al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=911Commission040408&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/archive/hearing9/9-11Commission_Hearing_2004-04-08.htm |publisher=[[9/11 Commission]] |title=Hearing transcript from 8 April 2004 |accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the USS ''Cole'' bombing, the U.S. Navy began to reassess its anti-terrorism and force protection methods, both at home and abroad.  The Navy stepped up Random Anti-Terrorism Measures (RAM), which are meant to complicate the planning of a terrorist contemplating an attack by making it difficult to discern a predictable pattern to security posture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/congress/2001_hr/01-06-28bouchard.htm Statement of Captain Joseph F. Bouchard, USN, Commanding Officer, NS Norfolk to the Special Oversight Panel on Terrorism of the House Armed Service Committee]. via GlobalSecurity.org 28 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, the Navy opened an Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection Warfare Center at Naval Amphibious Base (NAB) Little Creek, in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], with the objective of developing tactics, equipment and training to combat terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/June/Pages/US_Navy4066.aspx U.S. Navy Raises Barriers To Protect Base at Norfolk] National Defense Magazine. June 2002. [[National Defense Industrial Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2002, the [[CIA]] fired an [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missile from a [[RQ-1 Predator|Predator UAV]] at a vehicle in Yemen carrying [[Abu Ali al-Harithi]], a suspected planner of the bombing plot. Also in the vehicle was [[Ahmed Hijazi]], a U.S. citizen. Both were killed.

On 29 September 2004, a Yemeni judge sentenced [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]] and [[Jamal al-Badawi]] to death for their roles in the bombing. Al-Nashiri, believed to be the operation's mastermind, was detained by the United States at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;odni14&quot;&gt;[http://www.odni.gov/announcements/content/DetaineeBiographies.pdf Biographies of 14 detainees], [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]].&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Badawi, in Yemeni custody, denounced the verdict as &quot;an American one&quot;. Four others were sentenced to prison terms of five to 10 years for their involvement, including one Yemeni who had videotaped the attack.

In October 2004 the Navy consolidated the forces it deploys for anti-terrorism and force protection under a single command at NAB Little Creek. The new Maritime Force Protection Command (MARFPCOM) was activated to oversee the administration and training of the expeditionary units the Navy deploys overseas to protect ships, aircraft and bases from terrorist attack. MARFPCOM aligned four existing components: the Mobile Security Forces, [[Naval Coastal Warfare]], [[United States Navy EOD|Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD), and [[United States Navy Diver|Expeditionary Mobile Diving and Salvage Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15309 &quot;Maritime Force Protection Command to Activate Oct. 1.&quot;] United States Navy News. 27 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2006, 23 suspected or convicted Al-Qaeda members escaped from jail in Yemen. This number included 13 who were convicted of the bombings of USS ''Cole'' and the French tanker ''[[Limburg (tanker)|Limburg]]'' in 2002. Among those who reportedly escaped was Al-Badawi. Al-Qaeda's Yemeni number two Abu Assem al-Ahdal may also have escaped.&lt;ref name=Bbc&gt;{{cite news |date= 4 February 2006 |title=Hunt on for Yemeni jailbreakers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4682214.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikinews|Conspirator of USS Cole attack freed from prison}}
On 17 October 2007, al-Badawi surrendered to Yemeni authorities as part of an agreement with al-Qaeda militants. Following his surrender, Yemeni authorities released him in return for a pledge not to engage in any violent or al-Qaeda-related activity, despite a US$5 million reward for his capture. Two other escapees remained at large.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]].

In June 2008 the United States charged [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]] with planning and conducting the attack.  The US planned to seek the death penalty in his case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts, John 2008&quot; /&gt; On 5 February 2009, the United States dropped all charges against al-Nashiri &quot;without prejudice&quot; to comply with President Obama's order to shut down the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, but reserved the right to file charges at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN25491168 |title=U.S. drops Guantanamo charges per Obama order |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=6 February 2009 |date=6 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209093839/http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN25491168 |archivedate=9 February 2009  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were reinstated in 2011.

In 2009, U.S. federal judge [[Kimba Wood]] released $13.4 million in frozen assets belonging to [[Sudan]] to be awarded to 33 spouses, parents, and children of the sailors killed in the attack. The money was awarded based on the 2002 [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]] and spearheaded by Miami Attorney Andrew C. Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Anti-Terror Attorney: Andrew Hall’s Life Is a Story of Survival Against Tyranny|journal=ABA Journal|date=1 September 2011|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_anti-terror_attorney_andrew_halls_life_is_a_story_of_survival_against/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the court had found Sudan culpable in facilitating the attack on the destroyer. Said John Clodfelter, father of Kenneth Clodfelter who was killed in the bombing, &quot;It's about time something was done.

The USS ''Cole'' bombing plays a highly visible role in Navy damage-control training, which begins in boot camp with a pre-graduation Battle Stations event. &quot;The ''Cole'' Scenario&quot; launched in 2007 takes place aboard a realistic destroyer mock-up housed at Naval Station [[Great Lakes, Illinois|Great Lakes]], Illinois. The training focuses on preparing recruits for damage control challenges they may face in the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;McMichael, William H.

A memorial to the victims of the attack was dedicated at [[Norfolk Naval Station]] in Virginia on 12 October 2001. It was erected along the shore of [[Willoughby Spit|Willoughby Bay]], and overlooks the channel used by Navy ships transiting to sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/07/uss-cole-memorial-0 | title=USS Cole Memorial | publisher=Pilot Online| accessdate=10 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen low-level markers stand for the youthfulness of the sailors, whose lives were cut short. Three tall granite monoliths, each bearing brass plaques, stand for the three colors of the [[American flag]]. A set of brown markers encircling the memorial symbolize the darkness and despair that overcame the ship. In addition, 28 black pine trees were planted to represent the 17 sailors and the 11 children they left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=63224 |title= USS Cole Remembers 'Hero Sailors' Lost During 2000 Attack |newspaper= US Navy News Service Story Number: NNS111012-19 |date= 2001-10-12 |accessdate= 2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial was funded by contributions from thousands of private individuals and businesses to the [[Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society]], which gave the memorial to the Navy. Its design originated as a vision of USS ''Cole'' crew members, who then teamed with Navy architects and the Society to finalize the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.public.navy.mil/surflant/ddg67/Pages/Memorial.aspx | title=USS Cole Memorial | publisher=US Navy | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=44664 | title=Navy Dedicates Cole Memorial Oct. 12 | publisher=U.S. Department of Defense | date=10 October 2001 | accessdate=15 July 2012 | author=Rhem, Kathleen T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stripes.com/01/oct01/ed101301o.html | title=One year later, memorial to fallen USS Cole sailors is dedicated | publisher=Stripes | accessdate=12 October 2009 | author=Jontz, Sandra|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030627105202/http://www.stripes.com/01/oct01/ed101301o.html|archivedate=27 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cole'' memorial is located about 500 feet west of the Naval Station memorial for the [[USS Iowa turret explosion]].
