'''28th (Thames and Medway) Anti-Aircraft Brigade''' was an air defence formation of Britain's [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] created in 1925 to command anti-aircraft units in [[Kent]] and around the militarily important [[Medway Towns]], which it defended during the [[Battle of Britain]] and [[The Blitz]].

==Origin==
[[German strategic bombing during World War I|German air raids]] by [[Zeppelin]] airships and [[Gotha G.IV|Gotha]] bombers on London and other British cities during [[World War I]] had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) was reformed in the 1920s it included a number of dedicated AA units of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) and [[Royal Engineers]] (RE). At first these were concentrated in London under [[26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|26th]] and [[27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|27th Air Defence Brigades]], but in 1925 [[55th (Kent) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|55th (Kent) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA]] was formed to defend the [[Medway Towns]] of North Kent. '''28th Air Defence Brigade''' (ADB) was then formed at [[Tunbridge Wells]]. to command the AA defences in the area, even though it only had 55th AA Bde under its command, and that in turn consisted only of 163rd (Kent) AA Battery at Tunbridge Wells. (There were also [[29th (Kent) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|313 and 314  independent AA searchlight companies of the RE (TA)]] in Kent, but these were not formally subordinated to 28 ADB at this time.)&lt;ref&gt;Litchfield, pp. 112–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Monthly Army List'' 1925–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH36&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/1-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1936-38-.pdf 1 AA Division 1936–39 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.slv.vic.gov.au/view/action/singleViewer.do?dvs=1392113637069~863&amp;locale=en_US&amp;metadata_object_ratio=10&amp;show_metadata=true&amp;preferred_usage_type=VIEW_MAIN&amp;frameId=1&amp;usePid1=true&amp;usePid2=true ''Titles and Designations'' 1927.]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, 28th ADB was subordinate to the Home Counties Area of [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]], but as Britain's AA defences expanded during the 1930s, higher formations became necessary. [[1st Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|1st AA Division]] was formed to cover London and the [[Home Counties]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The 28th AD Bde was reorganised as '''28th (Thames &amp; Medway) Anti-Aircraft Group''', based at [[Kitchener Barracks]], [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], and commanding all the gun and searchlight units in the area.&lt;ref name = BMH36/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Monthly Army List'' January 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BMH39&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/6-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1939-.pdf 6 AA Division 1939 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

===Order of Battle 1939===
By 3 Sep 1939 the London and searchlight units had left 28th AA Brigade, which was now entirely composed of Heavy AA artillery regiments drawn from Kent. It was serving in [[6th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|6 AA Division]], which was formed in 1939 to take responsibility for air defence of the [[Thames Estuary]], [[Essex]] and Kent.&lt;ref name = BMH39/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=6697&amp;page=1 AA Command at Patriot Files]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 89th AA Regiment sailed for Egypt in December 1939.&lt;ref name = BMH39/&gt;

===Phoney War===
Opportunities for action were rare during the [[Phoney War]], but on the night of 22/23 November 1939 the HAA guns of 28 AA Bde ('Thames South') combined with those of [[37th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|37 AA Bde]] on the other bank of the river ('Thames North') to engage at least two enemy mine-laying aircraft that had strayed into the mouth of the Estuary. One wrecked aircraft was found on the marshes and credited to 206 Bty of 58th HAA Rgt at [[Allhallows, Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, pp. 374–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, AA units equipped with [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch]] and similar guns were redesignated 'Heavy Anti-Aircraft' (HAA), while units equipped with guns like the [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] were designated 'Light Anti-Aircraft' (LAA).

In the summer of 1940, the brigade was joined by [[53rd (City of London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|53rd (City of London) HAA Regiment]], which had been evacuated (without guns) from [[Marseille]] after the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]].&lt;ref name = WD53&gt;53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940–41, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives, Kew]] (TNA) file WO 166/2343.&lt;/ref&gt;

28 AA Bde was responsible for the defences on the south side of the Thames Estuary (Thames South) including the [[Chatham Dockyard|Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham]], as well as the [[Port of Dover]].&lt;ref name = BMH40&gt;[http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/6-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1940-.pdf 6 AA Division 1940 at British Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page53.html 6 AA Division at RA 39-45]&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 July 1940, the Thames South AA layout operated by 28 AA Bde had a total of 70 HAA guns (3.7-inch and [[QF 4.5-inch Mk I – V naval gun#Land service|4.5-inch]]).&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Britain===
The brigade was heavily engaged throughout the Battle of Britain. On 18 August, for example, German air raids appeared over RAF airfields at [[RAF West Malling|West Malling]], [[RAF Manston|Manston]], [[RAF Kenley|Kenley]], [[RAF Biggin Hill|Biggin Hill]], [[RAF Gravesend|Gravesend]] and the town of [[Sevenoaks]], all within four and a half hours in the afternoon. The guns of 28 AA Bde and its neighbours were in action and accounted for 23 enemy aircraft. Four days later a mass raid flew up the Thames Estuary to attack [[RAF Hornchurch]] on the Essex shore: the raid was broken up by 28 and 37 AA Bdes, and then the fighters of [[No. 11 Group RAF]] attacked. Follow-up raids were marked for the fighters by 'pointer' rounds of HAA fire. On 1 September over 200 aircraft attacked [[Maidstone]], Biggin Hill, Kenley and Chatham: in joint action with the fighters, the guns broke up the formations and shot down four aircraft, but the airfields at Biggin Hill and Kenley were badly hit. Next day a mass raid arrived over the Medway and flew up the Thames towards Hornchurch. They came under heavy fire from the 3.7s and 4.5s of 28 and 37 AA Bdes and 15 were shot down before the fighters took over. On 7 September heavy raids up the estuary attacked oil wharves at [[Thameshaven]], [[Tilbury Docks]] and [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]]: a total of 25 aircraft were destroyed by AA guns and fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge, pp. 385–6&quot;&gt;Routledge, pp. 385–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the lessons of the Battle of Britain was that day bombers needed to fly in tight formation for mutual protection against fighters, but in doing so they were vulnerable to AA fire. On 8 September a formation of 15 [[Dornier Do17]]s flew along the Thames at 15,000 feet. The opening salvo from a troop of four 3.7-inch guns of 28 AA Bde brought down the three leading aircraft and scattered the others in disorder, jettisoning their bombs as they escaped.&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September, remembered as the zenith of the battle, the guns of 28 AA Bde were in prolonged combat, especially with aircraft over Chatham in the morning, and again in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge, pp. 385–6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = Farn110&gt;Farndale, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Blitz===
[[File:4.5 inch AA gun Kent 1941.jpg|thumb|right|4.5 inch anti-aircraft gun and crew of 207 Battery, 58th HAA Regiment, near [[Sittingbourne]], Kent, January 1941]]
After 15 September the intensity of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' day raids declined rapidly, and it began a prolonged night bombing campaign over London and industrial towns ([[The Blitz]]). This meant that 28 Bde was in action night after night as the bomber streams approached the London Inner Artillery Zone, but even with the assistance of searchlights, the effectiveness of HAA fire and fighters was greatly diminished in the darkness. By now Thames South had a planned layout of 25 HAA sites (of which only 16 were occupied). It ran from Dartford to Chatham, where there was a strongly defended area containing the naval dockyards at Chatham and [[Sheerness]] and the aircraft factory at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]. This was controlled from a Gun Operations Room (GOR) at Chatham. 28 AA Bde was so stretched that 6 AA Division gave responsibility for LAA cover for Vulnerable Points (VPs) at [[Crayford]], [[Northfleet]], Rochester and the [[Isle of Grain]] to [[56th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|56 LAA Bde]]. The searchlight layout in Thames South had the dual role of assisting guns or night fighters. The whole was under the operational control of No 11 Group RAF.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, pp. 387–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, Annex D, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational research===
One of the operational sites in Thames South, TS21, was taken over by AA Command's Operational Research Group under [[Patrick Blackett]] ('Blackett's Circus') to combat-test and develop the new technologies coming forward such as Gun-Laying (GL) Radar and Searchlight Control (SLC) Radar. Improved [[GL Mk. I radar|GL Mark I E/F]] sets began to appear in November 1940, replacing sound-location for HAA sites, and the number of rounds that required to be fired for each 'kill' began to fall. The GL radar was also effective in providing target heights for fighters, and the SL batteries were able to pass these to the night fighter controllers at RAF Kenley.&lt;ref name = Farn110/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, pp. 392–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order of Battle, Winter 1940–41===
On 24 November 1940, 75th HAA Regiment was transferred to [[62nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|62 AA Bde]] to defend the North Midlands,&lt;ref name = BMH39/&gt; but 28 AA Bde was strengthened by 90th HAA and 4th LAA regiments:
* [[90th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|90th HAA Regiment]], RA (TA). ''HAA Regiment raised in April 1939.''&lt;ref name = BMH40/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Litchfield, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 90HAA&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page53.html 90 HAA Regt at RA 39-45]&lt;/ref&gt;
** HQ at Southgate
** 272th Battery at Southgate
** 284th Battery at Southgate
** 285th Battery at Southgate
* [[4th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|4th (Ulster) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment]], RA (SR). ''Supplementary Reserve regiment formed from 3rd (Ulster) Searchlight Regiment, which had served in France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] and had been evacuated (without equipment) from [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]''.&lt;ref name = BMH40/&gt;&lt;ref name = 4LAA&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/laa/page4.html 4 LAA Regt at RA 39-45]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/sl/page3.html 3 SL Regt at RA 39-45]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Brigstock 'Royal Artillery Searchlights', presentation to Royal Artillery Historical Society at Larkhill, 17 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1941, 53 (City of London) HAA Regiment moved to [[Croydon]] and transferred to the command of [[48th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|48 AA Bde]].&lt;ref name = WD53/&gt; In November 1942, 55 (Kent) HAA Regiment sailed from the UK to the Middle East, where it joined [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]],&lt;ref name = 55HAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 466–7, 484, 487.&lt;/ref&gt; while 58 (Kent) HAA Regiment went to North Africa with [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]].&lt;ref name = 58HAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 465, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1944, 90th HAA and 4th LAA Regiments left AA Command and joined [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] to prepare for the Normandy Landings ([[Operation Overlord]]).&lt;ref name = 90HAA/&gt;&lt;ref name = 4LAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947,  the Thames and Medway AA Brigade was reformed, now numbered as '''54 (Thames and Medway) AA Brigade''' (the TA AA brigades were now numbered 51 and upwards, rather than 26 and upwards as in the 1930s; the wartime [[54th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|54 AA Bde]] was renumbered 80). Once again, it had the two Kent HAA regiments under its command, now renumbered 455 and 458 rather than 55 and 58. It also had 564 Searchlight Regiment, the prewar 29 (Kent) Searchlight Regiment. It was based at [[Gillingham, Kent]],  and was subordinate to 1 AA Group (AA Command's corps and divisions had been disbanded in 1942 and a group structure introduced; 1 AA Group controlled the air defences of the London region). However, 54 AA Bde was disbanded the following year, completely disappearing in September 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbat.com/site/history/library-new/1946-1990/britishempire/ta47.html Graham Watson, ''The Territorial Army 1947'' at Orbat.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303000000/http://www.orbat.com/site/history/library-new/1946-1990/britishempire/ta47.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/aa-brigades-67-106.html AA Brigades 30–66 at British Army Units 1945 on]&lt;/ref&gt;
