The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T3''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''78 T''''', a {{sclass2-|250t|torpedo boat|1}} built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, she was allocated to the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], which subsequently became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T3''.

''T3'' was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941 and, after her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, although she was only used for coastal and second-line tasks. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was captured by Germany, and after being fitted with additional [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns she served with the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] or the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]] as '''''TA48'''''. In German/Croatian service her crew of 52 consisted entirely of [[Croats|Croatian]] officers and enlisted men. She was sunk by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft in February 1945 while in the port of [[Trieste]].

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at [[Bay of Kotor|Cattaro]] to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The T-group designation signified the builder, STT.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The {{sclass2-|250t|torpedo boat|0}}, T-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|262|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|320|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by a [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] steam turbine driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. They carried {{convert|18|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|24|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|980|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The T-group had one [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] rather than the two funnels of the later groups of the class. While the 250t-class T-group boats barely exceeded the specifications laid down for a coastal torpedo boat, they were classified as capable of operating on the open sea. The 250t-class, T-group were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were originally to be armed with three [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}}L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and three {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed,{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} to standardise the armament with the F-group to follow. They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. ''78 T'' was the fifth of its class to be built. She was laid down on 22 October 1913, launched on 4 March 1914, and completed and commissioned on 23 August 1914. Eight T-group boats were completed between February and December 1914, designated ''74 T'' – ''81 T''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1914, one {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]] was added.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

==Career==

===World War I and interwar period===
During [[World War I]], ''78 T'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian Adriatic coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''78 T'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for &quot;high seas&quot; operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at [[Pula|Pola]] to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible that one of these was ''78 T''. This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=229}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 11 May 1917, the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|H1}} stalked ''78 T'' off Pola, firing two torpedoes at her. The British captain had kept his submarine's [[periscope]] extended too far and for too long, and the tell-tale &quot;feather&quot; had alerted the crew of ''78 T'', allowing her to avoid the incoming torpedoes.{{sfn|Compton-Hall|1991|p=242}}

''78 T'' survived the war intact,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] concluded in September 1919, she was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia) in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} along with three other 250t-class, T-group boats, ''76 T'', ''77 T'' and ''79 T'', which all served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|KSCS Navy]] (later the Royal Yugoslav Navy, {{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In Yugoslav service, ''78 T'' was renamed ''T3''. At the time of their transfer, the 250t-class torpedo boats were the only modern warships in the Yugoslav fleet.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=426}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy,{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} but by 1932, the British naval attaché was reporting that Yugoslav ships were engaging in few exercises or manoeuvres due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T3'' was assigned to the Southern Sector of the KJRM's Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with her [[sister ship]] [[Yugoslav torpedo boat T1|''T1'']], several [[minesweeper]]s and other craft.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013}} ''T3'' was captured in port by the [[Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) and was operated by them under her Yugoslav designation. She was fitted with two {{convert|76|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} L/30 anti-aircraft guns in place of her {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} Due to her obsolescence, the Italians only used ''T 3'' for coastal and second-line duties.{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}}

When the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kriegsmarine}}) seized ''T3'' in the port of [[Rijeka]] and renamed her ''TA48''. She was commissioned on 15 August 1944, and was used for patrol and escort work in the northern Adriatic.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=81}} The Germans added to her armament, fitting her with two single {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft guns in addition to the guns fitted by the Italians, and removing two of her torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=107}} She was either crewed exclusively by [[Croats|Croatian]] officers and sailors but remained under German control,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} or was transferred to the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]] but then repossessed by the Germans on 14 December 1944 due to the unreliable nature of the Croatian personnel.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=81}} Her complement was also increased to 52 during her German/Croatian service.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She was active in the northern Adriatic but saw little action.{{sfn|O'Hara|2013|p=181}} She was sunk in the port of Trieste by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft on 20 February 1945.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}{{refn|Sources conflict on who sank ''TA48''. Gardiner and Lenton state that they were Allied aircraft without specifying their nationality,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=110}} while Chesneau states they were British aircraft,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and Wilmott states that US aircraft carried out the attack.{{sfn|Willmott|2010|p=209}}|group = lower-alpha}}
