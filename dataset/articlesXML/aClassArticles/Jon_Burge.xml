'''Jon Graham Burge''' (born December 20, 1947) is a convicted [[Felony|felon]] and former [[Chicago Police Department]] [[Police detective|detective]] and commander who gained notoriety for [[torture|torturing]] more than 200 criminal suspects between 1972 and 1991 in order to force confessions. A decorated [[United States Army]] veteran, Burge served tours in [[South Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and continued as an [[enlisted]] [[United States Army Reserve]] soldier where he served in the [[military police]].  He then returned to the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side of Chicago]] and began his career as a police officer. Allegations were made about the methods of Burge and those under his command. Eventually, hundreds of similar reports resulted in a decision by Illinois Governor [[George Ryan]] to declare a moratorium on [[death penalty]] executions in [[Illinois]] in 2000 and to clear the state's [[death row]] in 2003.

The most controversial arrests began in February 1982, in the midst of a series of shootings of Chicago law enforcement officials in Police Area 2, whose detective squad Burge commanded. Some{{how many?|date=January 2013}} of the people who confessed to murder were later granted new trials and a few{{how many?|date=January 2013}} were acquitted or pardoned. Burge was acquitted of police brutality charges in 1989 after a first trial resulted in a [[hung jury]]. He was suspended from the Chicago Police Department in 1991 and fired in 1993 after the Police Department Review Board ruled that he had used torture.

After Burge was fired, there was a groundswell of support to investigate convictions for which he provided evidence. In 2002, a [[special prosecutor]] began investigating the accusations. The review, which cost $17 million, revealed improprieties that resulted in no action due to the [[statute of limitations]]. Several convictions were reversed, remanded, or overturned.  All Illinois death row inmates received reductions in their sentences. Four of Burge's victims were pardoned by then-Governor Ryan and subsequently filed a consolidated suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] against the City of Chicago, various police officers, [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] and various [[State's Attorney]]s. A $19.8 million settlement was reached in December 2007, with the &quot;city defendants&quot;. Cases against Cook County and the other current/former county prosecutors continue as of July 2008. In October 2008, [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] had Burge arrested on charges of [[obstruction of justice]] and [[perjury]] in relation to a civil suit regarding the torture allegations against him. On April 1, 2010, Judge [[Joan Lefkow]] postponed the trial, for the fourth time, to May 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/24-7/2135813,jon-burge-torture-trial-delay-040110.article|title= Burge trial delayed for fourth time |accessdate=April 2, 2010|date=April 1, 2010|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burge was convicted on all counts on June 28, 2010. He was sentenced to four-and-one-half years in federal prison on January 21, 2011 and was released in October 2014.

==Early life==
Raised in the [[South Deering, Chicago|South Deering]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] on the [[Southeast Side, Chicago|Southeast Side]] of Chicago,&lt;ref name = TOT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/policetorture/050402|accessdate=October 2, 2007|publisher=Chicago Reader|date=February 4, 2005 |title=Tools of Torture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burge was the second eldest son of Floyd and Ethel Burge.  Floyd was a [[blue collar]] worker of Norwegian descent and Ethel was an aspiring fashion writer of mixed Western European descent.&lt;ref name=Conroy61&gt;Conroy, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Burge attended [[Bowen High School]] where he showed a keen interest in the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (JROTC). There he was exposed to [[military drill]], weapons, leadership and [[military history]].&lt;ref name = TOT/&gt;  He attended the [[University of Missouri]] but dropped out after one semester,&lt;ref name=Conroy61/&gt; which ended his [[Conscription in the United States|draft deferment]].&lt;ref name = TOT/&gt; He returned to Chicago to work as a stock clerk in the [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel]] supermarket chain in 1966.&lt;ref name=Conroy61/&gt;

In June 1966, Burge enlisted in the [[army reserve]] and began six years of service, including two years of [[active duty]].  He spent eight weeks at a [[military police]] (MP) school in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name = TOT/&gt;  He also received some training at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, where he learned [[interrogation]] techniques.&lt;ref name=Conroy61/&gt;  He volunteered for a tour of duty in the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref name=Conroy61/&gt; but instead he became an MP trainer and then served as an MP in [[South Korea]], gathering five letters of appreciation from superiors. On June 18, 1968, Burge volunteered for duty in [[Vietnam]] a second time,&lt;ref name=Conroy61/&gt; and was assigned to the Ninth Military Police Company of the Ninth Infantry Division. He reported to division headquarters, where he was assigned to provide security as a sergeant at his division base camp, which was named [[Đồng Tâm Base Camp|Đồng Tâm]] by [[William Westmoreland]].&lt;ref name = TOT/&gt;  Burge described his military police service as time spent escorting convoys, providing security for [[forward support base]]s, supervising security for the divisional central base camp in Dong Tam, and then serving a tour as a provost marshal investigator.&lt;ref name = TOT/&gt;

During his military service, Burge earned a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], a [[Purple Heart]], the [[Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry]] and two [[Army Commendation Medal]]s for [[WIKT:valor|valor]], for pulling wounded men to safety while under fire.&lt;ref name=Conroy61/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tadeo/&gt;  Burge claimed no knowledge of or involvement in prisoner interrogation, brutality or torture in Vietnam.&lt;ref name = TOT/&gt;    Burge was honorably discharged from the Army on August 25, 1969.&lt;ref name = TOT/&gt;
However, when reporting on the Chicago Police Department's ongoing legacy of torture, [[Ryan Cooper]], reporting in ''[[The Week magazine]]'', asserted that Burge probably learned to torture in Vietnam, because his preferred technique was to use a hand-cranked generator, a common technique in Vietnam, where hand-cranked field telephones were widely available.&lt;ref name=TheWeek2015-03-02/&gt;

Burge became a police officer in March 1970 at age 22 on the [[South Side of Chicago]]. In 20 years of service, he earned 13 commendations and a letter of praise from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name=Tadeo/&gt;  In May 1972, he was promoted to detective and assigned to Area 2 (Pullman Area) [[Robbery]].&lt;ref name=TOT/&gt;  He was later promoted to field lieutenant in the Monroe Street District. From 1981&amp;ndash;1986 he served as the [[Commander#United States police rank|commander]] of the Area 2 [[Violent crime|Violent Crimes]] Unit until he was promoted to commander of the Bomb and Arson Unit in 1986.&lt;ref name=Bthbaau&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36D1AC13FD28C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Burge to head bomb and arson unit |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |date=August 14, 1986 |publisher=[[Newsbank]] |work=Chicago Sun-Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804013329/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004 |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}  &lt;!--on trying to open this link I (Test35965/Alexander Riccio) get an &quot;requester private data is incorrect&quot; error, nothing else on page--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Burge became Area 3 (Brighton Park) detective commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DB094C9F2FB&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=51 cops get new jobs in shakeup of Martin staff |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |date=January 27, 1988 |publisher=Newsbank |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author1=Casey, Jim  |author2=Phillip J.

===Turning point===
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', federal prosecutors stated that Burge's use of torture began in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Guarino, Mark (October 2, 2014). [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/chicago-police-commander-jon-burge-torture-released &quot;Disgraced Chicago police commander accused of torture freed from prison&quot;]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunropbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB3731E5C31EC46&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Davis urges new review of police brutality cases|accessdate=July 14, 2008|date=December 25, 1990|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the most prominent example occurred in 1982. On February 9, 1982, there was an incident on the streets in which a suspect took a police officer's weapon, then shot and killed both the officer and his partner.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, pp. 21&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/10075-patrolman-richard-james-obrien|title=Patrolman Richard James O'Brien|publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/4708-patrolman-william-p.-fahey|title=Patrolman William P. Fahey|publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident occurred within Burge's jurisdiction; he was then a lieutenant and commanding officer of Area 2.  The two fatalities brought the total to five officers (including two [[Cook County Sheriff's Office]]rs wounded and a rookie Chicago police officer shot and killed on a [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] bus on February 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/4279-police-officer-james-e.-doyle|title=James E. Doyle|publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who had been shot in the {{convert|60|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area of the South Side within about a month.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial interrogation procedures allegedly included shooting pets, handcuffing subjects to stationary objects for entire days, and holding guns to the heads of minors.  [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Operation PUSH]] spokesmen, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' and black Chicago Police officers were outraged.  [[Renault Robinson]], president of Chicago's [[Afro American Police League]] characterized the dragnet operation as &quot;sloppy police work, a matter of racism&quot;, comparing the police action to that of a southern sheriff leading a posse that turned into a lynch mob.&lt;ref name = ReaderScoop/&gt; Jackson complained that the black community was being held under [[martial law]].&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, pp. 23&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; After all of the police excesses, mere coincidence enabled the capture of the suspects for the most recent two killings.  Tyrone Sims identified Donald &quot;Kojak&quot; White as the shooter, and Kojak was linked to Andrew and Jackie Wilson by having committed a [[burglary]] with them earlier on the day of the killings.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The torture===
Andrew Wilson was arrested on the morning of February 14, 1982 for the murder of the two police officers, and by the end of the day he was in [[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center]] with lacerations on various parts of his head, including his face, chest bruises and [[burn|second-degree]] thigh burns.&lt;ref name=PBSHTT/&gt;  It was clear that Wilson had received sufficient injuries to be sent to the hospital, with more than a dozen of them caused while in [[police custody]].&lt;ref name=Tadeo/&gt;  During a two-week trial in 1983, Andrew Wilson was convicted of the killings and given a death penalty sentence, while his brother, Jackie, was convicted as an accomplice and given a life sentence.&lt;ref name=JEMNTIKOC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF640A79C01FD89&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Judge's Error Means New Trial In Killing Of Cops|accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=December 21, 1985|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Mount, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, Jackie's conviction was overturned by the [[Illinois Appellate Court]] because his right to remain silent had not been properly explained.&lt;ref name=JEMNTIKOC/&gt;  Because Andrew was given a death sentence, his case was not reviewable on the same grounds by the Appellate Court and went directly to the [[Illinois Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=JEMNTIKOC/&gt;  In April 1987, the Supreme Court overturned Andrew's conviction with a ruling that his [[Confession (law)|confession]] had been coerced involuntarily out of him while under duress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF68411CF68622C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Verdict Overturned In Killing Of 2 Cops|accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=April 3, 1987|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Tybor, Joseph R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1987, the appellate court further ruled that Jackie Wilson should have been tried separately from his brother and that evidence against Andrew Wilson regarding other matters for which the police wanted him was incorrectly admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36D8A9CCCDFFE&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=2nd brother wins new trial in cop killings|accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=October 1, 1987|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Cose, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1988, Andrew was re-convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DFEF86911DF7&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Man Is Found Guilty 2D Time In Cop Killings|accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=June 21, 1988|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author1=Seigel, Jessica  |author2=Matt O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with ten women in favor and two men opposed, the jury was unable to agree on his eligibility for the death penalty after five days of deliberation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7E026AAA16658&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Cop Killer Spared Death As 2 On Jury Hold Out|accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=June 28, 1988|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author1=Seigel, Jessica  |author2=Matt O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following month he was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7E0904CB0662F&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Andrew Wilson Gets Life Sentence In Killing Of Cops|accessdate=August 4, 2008|date=July 13, 1988|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author=O'Connor, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years after the original arrest, Andrew filed a [[civil suit]] stating that he had been beaten, suffocated with a plastic bag, burned (by [[cigarette]] and [[radiator]]), treated with [[electric shock]], and been the victim of the pattern of a cover-up.  Although the suit was against four detectives, a former police superintendent and the City of Chicago, it hinged on the testimonies of plaintiff Wilson and commander Burge, who oversaw all of the alleged activity.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, pp. 60-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electric cattle prod.jpg|thumb|Burge was accused of using a [[cattle prod]].]]
Burge and other Chicago Police officers allegedly used methods of torture that left few marks. They were accused of slamming telephone books on top of suspect's heads. There were also three separate electrical devices that Burge and his detectives were accused of using: a [[cattle prod]], a hand cranked device, and a [[violet wand]]. They allegedly used a [[Tucker telephone]], an old-style hand cranked telephone which generated electricity, and attached wires to the suspect's genitals or face. According to veteran sergeant D. J. Lewis, this is a method of torture common in the Korean War, and usually results in a confession. Burge has denied ever witnessing such telephone torture procedures.&lt;ref name=TOT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TMTD/&gt; The violet wand was said to be regularly placed either on the [[anus]], into the [[rectum]] or against the victim's exposed [[genitals]].&lt;ref name=TMTD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/policetorture/thirddevice/|accessdate=October 4, 2007|title=The Mysterious Third Device|publisher=Chicago Reader Inc.|author=Conroy, John|date=February 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also used [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]]s and adapted [[hair dryer]]s.&lt;ref name=Dunropbc/&gt; Burge and officers under his command also allegedly engaged in mock executions, in putting plastic bags over heads, cigarette burnings and severe beatings.

In 1991, Gregory Banks filed suit against Burge, three colleagues and the City of Chicago for condoning brutality and torture.  The allegation was related to a false 1983 confession to murder obtained by placing a plastic bag over Banks' head, putting a gun in his mouth and other acts.  There were eleven other suspects that the officers allegedly abused with brutality such as [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electro-shock]].  The suit was brought by the same attorneys who represented Andrew Wilson in the previous 1989 brutality case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB37372C79B26D6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=$16 million suit alleges torture by city cops|accessdate=July 15, 2008|date=October 11, 1991|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Rossi, Rosalind}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 1972&amp;ndash;1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FFF0740F4B6EA83&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Lawsuit Charges Police Brutality|accessdate=July 15, 2008|date=October 11, 1991|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third suit was brought against Burge in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4211807EE8E92&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Cop Accused in Torture Suit - Shock Treatment Used to Get Confession, Youth Says |accessdate=July 15, 2008|date=January 14, 1993|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Seibel, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FFEC65464171A9B&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Suit Alleges Cop Torture Of Youth|accessdate=July 15, 2008|date=January 14, 1993|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author1=McMahon, Colin  |author2=Christine Hawes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Banks suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abusive handling.

Mayor Daley and all law enforcement officials who had been deposed were excluded from the report.  Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked with the report focusing on doubts about the actual torture of pardoned death row inmates.

On the same day of the initial ruling to release the special report was made, the 36th session of the [[United Nations]] Committee Against Torture issued its &quot;Conclusions and recommendations of the Committee against Torture&quot; report of the United States. The document states, &quot;The Committee is concerned at allegations of impunity of some of the State party's law-enforcement personnel in respect of acts of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Committee notes the limited investigation and lack of prosecution in respect of the allegations of torture perpetrated in areas 2 and 3 of the [[Chicago Police Department]] (art. 12). The State party should promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigate all allegations of acts of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by law-enforcement personnel and bring perpetrators to justice, in order to fulfil its obligations under article 12 of the Convention. The State party should also provide the Committee with information on the ongoing investigations and prosecution relating to the above-mentioned case.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions and recommendations of the Committee against Torture : United States of America. 07/25/2006.&quot;&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/e2d4f5b2dccc0a4cc12571ee00290ce0/$FILE/G0643225.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Special State's Attorney (a/k/a &quot;[[special prosecutor]]&quot;) Egan was appointed by Judge Paul P. Biebel, Jr., Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the [[Cook County, Illinois#Government and politics|Circuit Court of Cook County]], who directed Egan to investigate (and, if appropriate, prosecute) the accusations. Egan's review, which cost [[U.S. Dollar|$]]17 million, revealed improprieties that resulted in no action due to the [[statute of limitation]]s.&lt;ref name=Brdtws/&gt;

Four of Burge's [[death row]] inmate victims—Aaron Patterson, LeRoy Orange, Stanely Howard, and Madison Hobley—filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] against the City of Chicago, Burge, several of Burge's former subordinate police detectives, [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], and a few current and former [[State's Attorney]]s and assistant state's attorneys of Cook County (the precise list of police officers and prosecutors varied somewhat from plaintiff to plaintiff).  Although each case was randomly assigned to a different [[United States federal judge|district judge]], the parties all consented to have the four cases consolidated for discovery management before [[United States magistrate judge|Magistrate Judge]] Geraldine Soat Brown.  A settlement of $19.8 million was reached in December 2007 between the plaintiffs and the so-called &quot;city defendants&quot; consisting of the City of Chicago, Burge, the other former detectives, and former Cook County State's Attorney (and Mayor of Chicago at the time of the settlement) [[Richard M.

Although Burge had been presumed to be protected by a statute of limitations, the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, [[Patrick Fitzgerald]], in October 2008 charged Burge with two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of perjury.&lt;ref name=ELtBIA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/us/22chicago.html|title=Ex-Officer Linked to Brutality Is Arrested |accessdate=December 28, 2008|date=October 21, 2008|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author1=Saulny, Susan  |author2=Eric Ferkenhoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/21/jon-burge-indictment_n_136559.html|title=Jon Burge Indictment|accessdate=October 22, 2008|date=October 21, 2008|publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|work=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burge was arrested on October 21, 2008 at his home in Apollo Beach by FBI agents.&lt;ref name=TW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1853310,00.html|title=The World|accessdate=December 28, 2008|date=October 23, 2008|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Barovick, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the charges, Burge could have been subject to 40 years in prison for the two obstruction counts and five years on the perjury count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/1233077,jon-burge-cop-torture-chicago-arrested-102108.article|title=Ex-Chicago cop Burge arrested in torture cases|accessdate=October 22, 2008|date=October 21, 2008|publisher=Digital Chicago, Inc.|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Main, Franklin|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081022174856/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/1233077,jon-burge-cop-torture-chicago-arrested-102108.article &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges were the result of convicted felon Madison Hobley's 2003 civil rights lawsuit alleging police beatings, electric shocks and death threats by Burge and other officers against dozens of criminal suspects.&lt;ref name=TW/&gt;

Also in April, Cortez Brown, who had sought a new trial with respect to two 1990 murders and who had already subpoenaed two Chicago police detectives for his May 18, 2009 hearing, won the right to subpoena Burge from a Cook County Judge.  Burge was expected to exercise his 5th Amendment right not to incriminate himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=127E60BFED056BD0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Convicted murderer gets OK on Burge subpoena |accessdate=May 17, 2009|date=April 30, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Walberg, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Florida judge refused to grant such a subpoena given the likelihood that Burge would exercise this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1282A92D178FFB80&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Florida judge refuses to grant Burge subpoena |accessdate=May 17, 2009|date=May 13, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;
