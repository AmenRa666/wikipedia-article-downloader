{{nihongo|'''''Kawachi'''''|河内}} was the [[lead ship]] of the two-ship {{sclass-|Kawachi|battleship|0}} [[dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the first decade of the 20th century. Following the [[Japanese ship-naming conventions]], ''Kawachi'' was named after [[Kawachi Province]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; now a part of [[Osaka prefecture]]. During [[World War I]] she bombarded German fortifications at [[Tsingtao]] during the [[Battle of Tsingtao]] in 1914, but saw no other combat. She sank in 1918 after an explosion in her ammunition [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] with the loss of over 600 officers and crewmen.

==Background==
[[File:Kawachi-classDrawing.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and plan of the ''Kawachi''-class battleships from [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1915]]
The ''Kawachi'' class was ordered on 22 June 1907 under the 1907 Warship Supplement Program after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] as Japan's first dreadnoughts,&lt;ref name=l4/&gt; although their construction was delayed by a severe [[depression (economics)|depression]].&lt;ref name=g8/&gt; Their design was based on the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Aki||2}} with a uniform {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} main-gun armament, although cost considerations prevented all the guns from having the same barrel length.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and description==
The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|526|ft|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|84|ft|3|in|m|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27|ft|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|20823|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load. Her crew ranged from 999 to 1100 officers and enlisted men. ''Kawachi'' was fitted with a pair of [[license-built]] Curtis [[steam turbine]] sets, each set driving one propeller, using steam from 16 Miyabara [[water-tube boiler]]s. The turbines were rated at a total of {{convert|25000|shp|lk=in}} for a design speed of {{convert|21|kn}}. She carried enough coal and [[fuel oil]] to give her a range of {{convert|2700|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|18|kn}}.&lt;ref name=j7&gt;Jentschura, Jung &amp; Mickel, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kawachi''{{'}}s main armament consisted of four 50-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[BL 12 inch Mk XI – XII naval gun|12-inch 41st Year Type guns]] in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the [[superstructure]], and eight 45-caliber [[EOC 12 inch/45 naval gun|12-inch 41st Year Type]] guns mounted in four twin-gun turrets, two on each side of the superstructure.&lt;ref name=j7/&gt; ''Kawachi''{{'}}s [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] was ten 45-caliber [[6-inch/45 41st Year Type naval gun|6-inch 41st Year Type guns]], mounted in [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull, and eight 40-caliber [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 4.7-inch Gun Mk I–IV|4.7-inch 41st Year Type]] guns.&lt;ref name=g8&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was also equipped with a dozen 40-caliber [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|3-inch 4th Year Type]] guns&lt;ref name=j7/&gt; and four others were used as [[saluting gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the battleship was fitted with five submerged {{convert|18|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]] and one in the stern.&lt;ref name=p6&gt;Preston, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] of the ship had a maximum thickness of 12 inches [[amidships]]. It tapered to a thickness of {{convert|5|in|mm|0}} at the ends of the ship.&lt;ref name=g8/&gt; A {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} [[strake]] of armor protected the casemates. The barbettes for the main guns were {{convert|9|-|11|in|mm|0}} thick. The armor of ''Kawachi''{{'}}s main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 11 inches. The [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{convert|29|mm|1|disp=flip}} thick and the [[conning tower]] was protected by 6 to 10 inches of armor.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 76, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
[[File:Japanese battleship Kawachi in early postcard.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard of ''Kawachi'' at anchor]]
''Kawachi'' was [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] on 1 April 1909. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 October 1910&lt;ref name=g8/&gt; in a ceremony attended by [[Emperor Meiji]] and completed on 31 March 1912 at a cost of [[¥]]11,130,000.&lt;ref name=l4&gt;Lengerer, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 October 1912, the ship was present when the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}} had a fire that was started by a sailor in the forward magazine. It was flooded before the fire could get out of control and ''Kawachi'' sent over fire-fighting teams to assist ''Mikasa''{{'}}s crew in case they were needed.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsepp 2008, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; When [[World War I]] began in August 1914, ''Kawachi'' was at Yokosuka.&lt;ref name=p6/&gt;

Together with her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Settsu||2}}, she bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 during the final stage of the [[Battle of Tsingtao]].&lt;ref&gt;Hackett &amp; Kingsepp&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was present in Yokosuka on 8 January 1915 when the victorious Second Squadron returned to Japan after the Battle of Tsingtao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/121877406?searchTerm=kawachi&amp;searchLimits=l-category=Article|title=Return of Japanese Squadron|date=12 January 1915|work=Queensland Times (Ipswich), Australia|page=3|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was assigned to the First Squadron from 1915–1917 and refitted that latter year.&lt;ref name=p6/&gt;

''Kawachi'' rejoined the First Squadron after her refit commanded by Captain [[Yoshimoto Masaki]] and entered [[Tokuyama, Yamaguchi|Tokuyama Bay]] on the evening of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor for the rest of the day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret and between the first and second [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s. Two minutes later, she began to [[list (watercraft)|list]] to starboard and [[capsized]] at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion.&lt;ref name=l3/&gt; Over a thousand men were aboard ''Kawachi'' at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.&lt;ref name=l3/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Sources differ widely on the exact number of men killed. Gardiner and Gray and Jentschura, Jung and Mickel agree on 700,&lt;ref name=g8/&gt;&lt;ref name=j7/&gt; but Lengerer says 600&lt;ref name=l3&gt;Lengerer, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and Kingsepp gives 618 killed from a crew of 960.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsepp 2007, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

The Imperial Japanese Navy convened a commission to investigate the explosion the day after the incident with [[Vice Admiral]] [[Murakami Kakuichi]] as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the [[cordite]] in her [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. ''Kawachi''{{'}}s magazines had been inspected in January–February 1918, however, and no problems were discovered, which made that possibility less likely. The commission made recommendations on tighter control of production and handling of cordite that were successfully adopted by the navy. The Japanese Navy considered [[marine salvage|salvaging]] ''Kawachi'', but ultimately decided that it would be too expensive and would delay the construction of one [[battlecruiser]] by over a year. Stricken from the [[navy list]] on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an [[artificial reef]].&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;
