The '''''Aosta'' Mechanized Brigade''' is a mechanized [[infantry]] [[brigade]] of the [[Italian Army]], based on the island of [[Sicily]]. The Brigade is one of the oldest of the Italian Army and the name connects the brigade to its original area of recruitment the [[Aosta Valley]].

== History ==

=== 1831 to 1914 ===
After the ascension to the throne of [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] on 27 April 1831 a major reform of the military of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont]] was undertaken. Thus on 25 October 1831 the ''Aosta'' Brigade was raised with two infantry regiments. These two regiments were the &quot;His Royal Highness [[Fusilier]] Regiment&quot; (''Reggimento Fucilieri di Sua Altezza Reale'') founded on 20 February 1690 and a newly raised Infantry Regiment. From 1 November 1815 to 25 October 1831 the &quot;HRH [[Fusilier]] Regiment&quot; was known as &quot;Brigade of Aosta&quot; (''Brigata di Aosta''), however in size and function this brigade was an infantry regiment with just two battalions. Between 1774 and 1799 the &quot;HRH [[Fusilier]] Regiment&quot; was known as the &quot;Regiment of Aosta&quot; (''Reggimento di Aosta''). Initially each regiment consisted of three battalions: the 1st and 2nd battalions fielded each three companies of [[fusilier]]s and one company of [[grenadier]]s, while the third battalions consisted of four companies of [[skirmisher]]s. A fourth battalion was added to each regiment and the companies personnel strength was increased. By 1839 each regiment fielded four battalions, which in turn fielded 4 companies of 250 men each. In 1839 the regiments of the ''Aosta'' were numbered and renamed as 5th Infantry Regiment ''Aosta'' Brigade and 6th Infantry Regiment ''Aosta'' Brigade.

The brigade participated in the [[First Italian War of Independence]] fighting in the battles of [[Battle of Santa Lucia|Santa Lucia]], [[Battle of Goito|Goito]], [[Skirmish of Pastrengo (1848)|Pastrengo]] and [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Novara]], where the 5th Regiment was awarded a [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]]. In 1855 the brigade provided two battalions for the [[Sardinian Expeditionary Corps in the Crimean War|Sardinian Expeditionary Corps]] in the [[Crimean War]]. In the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] the brigade was employed in the battles of [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]] and [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]]. The brigade was awarded a [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] for its conduct at Solferino. Furthermore, the IV Battalion of the 5th Regiment was awarded a [[Bronze Medal of Military Valor]] for its conduct during the [[Battle of Aspromonte]]. In the following years the brigade was employed in [[Calabria]] and the region of [[Salerno]] to suppress the [[Brigandage in the Two Sicilies|popular revolt of the peasant population]] against the annexation of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] into the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. In the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] the brigade fought in the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]].

Single battalions of the brigade were employed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] and the [[Italo-Turkish War]].

=== World War I ===
[[File:Rombon Chuklja.jpg|thumb|right|Monte Rombon]]

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] the brigade was based in the city of [[Gemona del Friuli|Gemona]] with its two regiments fielding three battalions each and each of the battalions consisting of four companies and a machine gun section. The 6th Regiment was the first to see action on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] when it tried to conquer the [[Pl√∂cken Pass]] on 3 July 1916. Afterwards the brigade reinforced by two battalions of [[Alpini]] was given the task to conquer [[Monte Rombon]]. In 1916 the brigade was engaged in combat in the region of [[Kras]]. From 22 to 26 November 1917 the brigade defended the summit of [[Col della Berretta]] on the [[Monte Grappa]] massif during the [[Battle of Monte Grappa]], which managed to end the Austrian advance after the [[Battle of Caporetto]].

In October 1918 the brigade conquered the summit of [[Monte Valderoa]] and held it against repeated Austrian counterattacks. For this last engagement of the World War I the ''Aosta'' brigade was awarded its second [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]].

=== World War II ===
{{main|28 Infantry Division Aosta}}

After the end of World War I the brigade moved to [[Sicily]] and was garrisoned in the city of [[Palermo]]. In 1926 the brigade gained the 85th Infantry Regiment ''Verona'' and changed its name to XXVIII Infantry Brigade. Along with the 22nd Artillery Regiment the brigade formed the 28th Division. In 1939 the brigade lost the 85th Infantry regiment and was renamed 28th Infantry Division ''Aosta''. This binary division consisted of only two infantry regiments (5th and 6th) and the 22nd Field Artillery Regiment. The division remained based in Sicily and was tasked to defend the island against landings by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].

On 9 July 1943 the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began and the division was badly mauled by [[United States Army|US Army]] troops during the [[Battle of Troina]] in the North of the island. The remnants of the division were evacuated to mainland Italy between 9 and 12 August 1943. After the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]] of 8 September 1943 the division was disbanded by German Forces.

On 20 September 1944 the ''Aosta'' was raised again on [[Sicily]] as part of the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]]. The new unit was named  ''Aosta'' Internal Security Division and consisted of the III and IV Internal Security Brigades.

=== Cold War ===
On 15 August 1946 the ''Aosta'' Internal Security Division renamed and reformed as ''Aosta'' Infantry Brigade on Sicily. On 1 September 1946 the regiments of the division returned to their old names 5th respectively 6th Infantry Regiment ''Aosta'' and were based in [[Messina]] and [[Palermo]]. With the expansion of the Italian Army after World War II the brigade was expanded to a full division on 1 February 1948 and the two ''Aosta'' infantry regiments were joined by the 46th Infantry Regiment ''Reggio'' and the 22nd and 24th Field Artillery Regiment. However already on 15 June 1955 the division began to shrink with the disbandment of the 6th Infantry Regiment. The III Battalion of the 5th Infantry Regiment received the colors and traditions of the disbanded regiment. The Division was under the command of the XI Military Territorial Command/Sicily Military Region in [[Palermo]], which had administrative command of all units based in Sicily and was tasked with the defense of the islands of [[Sicily]], [[Pantelleria]] and [[Pelagie Islands|Pelagie]].

On 21 February 1961 the division was reduced once more to infantry brigade and consisted now of the 5th Infantry Regiment ''Aosta'' (with three infantry battalions), the LXII Armored Battalion and the Field Artillery Group ''Aosta''. Minor units of the brigade were a Signals and an Engineer company. During the next years the ''Aosta'' Logistic Battalion was raised in Messina. The 46th Infantry Regiment ''Reggio'' turned into a training unit under direct command of the XI Military Territorial Command.

On 1 October 1975 the Italian Army abolished the regimental level and battalions came under direct command of the brigades. Therefore, the 5th Regiment was disbanded and its three battalions came forthwith under direct command of the ''Aosta'' Motorized Infantry Brigade. The new organization of the brigade was therefore:

:* ''Aosta'' Command and Signal Battalion, in [[Messina]]
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA btg carri 062.png|25px]] 62nd Armored Battalion ''[[Gold Medal of Military Valor|M.O.]] Jero'', in [[Catania]], (with a mix of [[Leopard 1|Leopard 1A2]] [[main battle tank]]s and [[M113 armored personnel carrier|VCC-2]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carriers]])
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA rgt fanteria 005.png|25px]] 5th Motorized Infantry Battalion ''Col della Berretta'', in Messina (former I Battalion 5th Infantry Regiment)
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA rgt fanteria 062.png|25px]] 62nd Motorized Infantry Battalion ''Sicilia'', in Catania (former II Battalion 5th Infantry Regiment)
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA rgt fanteria 141.png|25px]] 141st Motorized Infantry Battalion ''Catanzaro'', in [[Palermo]] (former III Battalion 5th Infantry Regiment)
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA rgt artiglieria 024.png|25px]] 24th Field Artillery Group ''Peloritani'', in Messina, ([[M114 155 mm howitzer|M114 155/23]] towed [[howitzer]]s)
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA btg logistico aosta.png|25px]] ''Aosta'' Logistic Battalion, in Messina
:* ''Aosta'' Anti-tank Company, in Messina
:* ''Aosta'' Engineer Company, in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]

The brigadecontinued to be under command of the XI Military Territorial Command/Sicily Military Region in [[Palermo]]. As the command was tasked with defending the outlying islands of [[Pantelleria]] and [[Pelagie Islands|Pelagie]] a battalion staff was activated on Pantelleria and ''Aosta'' units rotated to the island on garrison duties. Besides the ''Aosta'' the following units were part of the XI Military Territorial Command:

:* Command Battalion XI Military Territorial Command, in Palermo
:* ''Minor Islands'' Infantry Battalion, on [[Pantelleria]]
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA rgt fanteria 045.png|25px]] 46th Infantry (Training) Battalion ''Reggio'', in Palermo (disbanded in 1978)
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA btg fanteria 060.png|25px]] 60th Infantry (Training) Battalion ''Col di Lana'', in [[Trapani]]
:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA btg genio 051.png|25px]] 51st Engineer Battalion ''Simeto'', in Palermo
:* 30th Light Aviation Squadrons Group ''Pegaso'', at [[Catania-Fontanarossa Airport|Catania-Fontanarossa Air Base]]
:* 46th Signal Battalion ''Mongibello'', in Palermo
:* 11th Mixed Transport Battalion, in Palermo
:* 11th Medical Company, in Palermo
:* 11th Maintenance Company, in Palermo
:* 11th Supply Battalion, in Messina

With the end of the [[Cold War]] the Italian Army began to disbanded a large number of its mechanized brigades in Northern Italy in 1991 and redistribute their material: the ''Aostas'' infantry battalions received [[M113 armored personnel carrier|VCC-2]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carriers]], while the 24th ''Peloritani'' was equipped with [[M109 howitzer|M109]] [[Self-propelled artillery|self-propelled howitzers]]. Accordingly, the brigade changed its name on 18 August 1992 to ''Aosta'' Mechanized Brigade. In the same year the brigade began its six-year involvement in the [[Operation Sicilian Vespers (1992-1998)|Operation &quot;Sicilian Vespers&quot;]] a security and policing operation in [[Sicily]] undertaken by the [[Italian armed forces]] between 25 January 1992 and 8 July 1998.

After the end of the Cold War the brigade continuously changed composition as the Italian Army was drawing down its forces and moving a large number of units from the North to the South of the country, as most volunteers came from the economically less developed [[Southern Italy|Southern regions]].

* 21 April 1991 the 141st Motorized Infantry Battalion ''Catanzaro'' disbands
* 7 May 1991 the 6th Tank Squadrons Group ''Lancieri di Aosta'' of the [[Vittorio Veneto Armored Brigade|''Vittorio Veneto'' Armored Brigade]] leaves [[Cervignano del Friuli]] and moves to [[Palermo]]
* 31 March 1992 the 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion ''Castel di Borgo'' of the [[Ariete Armored Brigade|''Ariete'' Armored Brigade]] leaves [[Spilimbergo|Tauriano]] and moves to [[Trapani]]
* 27 August 1992 the 62nd Armored Battalion ''M.O. Jero'' merges with the 62nd Mechanized Infantry Battalion ''Sicilia'' to form the 62nd Armored Infantry Regiment ''Sicilia''
* 31 August 1992 the 5th Mechanized Infantry Battalion ''Col della Berretta'' changes its name to 5th Infantry Regiment ''Aosta''
* 2 September 1992 the 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion ''Castel di Borgo'' changes its name to 12th Bersaglieri Regiment
* 19 September 1992 the 51st Pioneer Battalion ''Simeto'' in [[Palermo]] becomes 4th Engineer Regiment and joins the brigade
* 16 October 1992 the 24th Field Artillery Group ''Peloritani'' changes its name to 24th Self-propelled Field Artillery Regiment ''Peloritani''
* 3 March 1993 the 6th Tank Squadrons Group ''Lancieri di Aosta'' changes its name to 6th Regiment ''Lancieri di Aosta''
* 1 January 1996 the 62nd Armored Infantry Regiment ''Sicilia'' becomes the 62nd Tank Regiment ''Sicilia''
* during 2001 the 62nd Tank Regiment ''Sicilia'' becomes again a mechanized infantry regiment
* 15 April 2005 the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment changes its name to 6th Bersaglieri Regiment

During the late 1990s the ''Lancieri di Aosta'' regiment exchanged its [[Leopard 1|Leopard 1A2]] [[main battle tank]]s for [[B1 Centauro|Centauro]] wheeled [[tank destroyer]]s, while the rest of the brigade received new vehicles after 2010. In 2013 the brigade gained the ''Aosta'' Logistic Regiment in Messina. Today the brigade is composed of the following units:

:* [[Image:CoA mil ITA btg logistico aosta.png|25px]] ''Aosta'' Combat Service Support Battalion in [[Messina]]
