'''SMS ''Helgoland'''''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In [[German language|German]], &quot;SMS&quot; means ''&quot;Seiner Majestät Schiff&quot;'' (in English: &quot;His Majesty's Ship&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Novara class cruiser|''Novara''-class]] [[scout cruiser]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] right before [[World War I]]. ''Helgoland'' participated in several raids on the ships defending the [[Strait of Otranto]], including the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]] in May 1917. She was transferred to Italy in 1920 in accordance with the peace treaties ending World War I and renamed ''Brindisi''. After modifications, the ship was assigned to the squadron responsible for the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] until 1924. She spent the next five years based in [[Libya]] and Italy before ''Brindisi'' was disarmed and turned into a [[depot ship]] in 1929. The ship was stricken from the [[Navy List]] in 1937 and later disposed of.

==Design and description==
The ship measured {{convert|130.64|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length overall|overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.79|m|ftin|sp=us}}. ''Helgoland'' had a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|4.6|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|3500|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load. At [[deep load]], she displaced {{convert|4017|t|LT|sp=us}}. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of [[AEG]]-Curtis [[steam turbine]]s driving two propeller shafts. They were designed to provide {{convert|25600|shp|lk=in}} and were powered by 16 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]]&lt;ref name=f7/&gt; [[water-tube boiler]]s. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|27|kn}}.&lt;ref name=gg6&gt;Gardiner &amp; Grey, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; ''Helgoland'' carried about {{convert|710|t|LT|sp=us}} of coal that gave her a range of approximately {{convert|1600|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|24|kn}}. The ship had a crew of 340 officers and men.&lt;ref name=f7/&gt;

''Helgoland'' was armed with nine 50-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] {{convert|10|cm|adj=on|1|sp=us}} guns in single pedestal mounts. Three were placed forward on the [[forecastle]], four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were side by side on the [[quarterdeck]]. A 50-caliber {{convert|6.6|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[anti-aircraft gun]] and six {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s in twin mounts were added in 1917. The navy planned to remove the guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and replace them with a {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|1|sp=us}} guns fore and aft, but nothing was done before the end of the war.&lt;ref name=gg6/&gt;

The ship was protected by a waterline [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. The [[conning tower]] had 60&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides, and the deck was {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=f7/&gt;

==Service history==
''Helgoland'' was [[Keel|laid down]] at the [[Danubius (shipbuilder)|Danubius]] shipyard in [[Fiume]] on 28 October 1911 and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 November 1912. The ship was completed on 5 September 1914, a month after the start of World War I.&lt;ref name=f7/&gt; 

One day after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, ''Helgoland'' and two [[destroyer]]s engaged and sank the {{ship|Italian destroyer|Turbine|1901|6}}.&lt;ref name= &quot;Fraccaroli p. 66&quot;&gt;Fraccaroli 1970, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August 1915, ''Helgoland'', her [[sister ship]] {{SMS|Saida||2}}, and four destroyers bombarded Italian forces on the island of [[Pelagosa]] which had recently been occupied by the Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 1994, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began a series of raids against the merchant ships supplying [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces in [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. On the night of 22/23 November 1915, ''Helgoland'', ''Saida'', and the [[1st Torpedo Division]] raided the Albanian coast and sank a pair of Italian transports carrying flour. To facilitate these raids, ''Helgoland'', her sister {{SMS|Novara|1912|2}}, six modern [[Tátra class destroyer|''Tátra''-class destroyers]], six [[250t-class torpedo boat|''250t''-class T-group torpedo boat]]s and an [[oiler (ship)|oiler]] were transferred to [[Cattaro]] to facilitate further raids on 29 November.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 1994, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; ''Helgoland'', together with five destroyers, participated in another of these raids at the end of December. On the night of 28/29 December 1915, while making her sortie, ''Helgoland'' rammed and sank the French submarine [[French submarine Monge (Q67)|''Monge'']] between [[Brindisi]] and the [[Albania]]n port of [[Durazzo]]. ''Helgoland'' and the destroyers attacked shipping in Durazzo the following morning. Two of the destroyers struck [[naval mine|mines]] while after sinking several ships in the port and had to be abandoned. The Austro-Hungarians managed to evade the Allied pursuit only when darkness fell. On the night of 31 May/1 June 1916, the ship covered a raid by two destroyers and three [[torpedo boat]]s on the [[drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]]s defending the [[Strait of Otranto]] against submarines trying to exit the [[Adriatic Sea]], sinking one.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2004, pp. 7–8, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Erich Heyssler assumed command of ''Helgoland'' in April 1917 and [[Miklós Horthy]] planned another raid on the drifters using a force composed of the three ''Novara''-class cruisers. The three cruisers were to attack separately while two destroyers made a diversionary attack on the drifters near the Albanian coast. On the night of 14 May, the ships departed port and managed to pass through the line of drifters in the darkness without being identified. As the sounds from the diversionary attack were heard, the drifters released their nets and began to head towards [[Otranto]]. ''Helgoland'' turned around and attacked the westernmost group of drifters as dawn began on the morning of 15 May. Between the three cruisers, they sank 14 drifters and badly damaged an additional four. The [[Sea captain|skipper]] of the drifter ''Gowan Lea'', [[Joseph Watt]], refused to surrender and abandon ship when demanded by ''Helgoland'', despite the cruiser only being {{convert|100|yd}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2004, pp. 44–46, 48, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; Watt's crew only managed to fire one shot before their single {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} six-pounder gun was disabled. Watt's refusal to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds was recognized after the battle by the award of the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2004, pp. 62–66&lt;/ref&gt;

''Helgoland'' did not linger to ensure that ''Gowan Lea'' was sunk, but proceeded to attack other drifters. She did, however, pause briefly to rescue 18 survivors from other drifters before turning for home. The Austrian ships were first contacted during their retreat by a group of three French destroyers led by a small Italian scout cruiser, ''Carlo Mirabello'', but the heavier guns of the Austrian ships dissuaded the Allied commander from closing the range. They were intercepted shortly afterward by a stronger group of two British [[protected cruiser]]s, {{HMS|Bristol|1910|2}} and {{HMS|Dartmouth|1911|2}}, escorted by four Italian destroyers. ''Dartmouth'' opened fire with her {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} guns at a range of {{convert|10600|yd}} and Horthy ordered his ships to make [[smoke screen|smoke]] several minutes later. This nearly caused the three Austrian cruisers to collide in the dense smoke, but covered them against the fire from the British ships as they closed the range. When they emerged, the Austrian ships were only about {{convert|4900|yd}} from the British, a range much more suitable for the smaller Austrian guns.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2004, pp. 63, 72, 74–75, 80–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The three cruisers were gradually drawing away from their pursuers when ''Novara'', leading the Austrian ships, was hit several times; most critically in the engine room that knocked out half her boilers. ''Helgoland'' was also hit five times, but not seriously, aside from one gun disabled. One crewman had been killed and 16 were wounded. The British ships turned away, around the time that ''Novara'' had to extinguish her remaining boilers and went dead in the water, upon learning that more Austrian ships were approaching. ''Saida'' was preparing to take ''Novara'' under tow when several Italian destroyers attacked in succession. The weight of fire from the three cruisers prevented them from closing to torpedo range and they scored no hits. The Allied ship returned to Brindisi and the Austrians slowly proceeded back to base. ''Helgoland'' had fired 1052 shells from her 10&amp;nbsp;cm guns. Heyssler received the [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Order of Leopold]] with crossed swords in recognition of his leadership during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2004, pp. 86–96, 102, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

''Helgoland'' and six destroyers attempted to duplicate the success of the earlier raid on 18–19 October, but they were spotted by Italian aircraft and turned back in the face of substantial Allied reinforcements alerted by the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2004, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt; She was caught under the guns of several mutinous [[armored cruiser]]s during the [[Gulf of Kotor Mutiny]] in February 1918, but managed to escape without damage.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2003, pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt;
The ship was tasked to participate in a major attack on the Allied ships defending the Strait of Otranto on 11 June, but it was called off after the [[dreadnought]] {{SMS|Szent István}} was sunk by an Italian [[motor torpedo boat]] en route to the rendezvous for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2004, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] between Italy and Austria-Hungary on 3 November, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet was transferred to the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 1994, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian service==
Italy received ''Helgoland'' from Austria-Hungary on 19 September 1920 as part of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] that ended the country's participation in World War I.&lt;ref name=f7/&gt; Renamed ''Brindisi'' and anchored at [[Bizerte]], [[Tunisia]], when the transfer was made, the ship was rated as an ''esploratore'' ([[scout cruiser]]) by Italy, and reached [[La Spezia]] on 26 October where she was assigned to the Scouting Group (''Gruppo Esploratori''). The ship was modified to suit the Italians at La Spezia from 6 April to 16 June 1921 before she entered service. She became the flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Massimiliano Lovatelli]], commander of the Light Squadron, upon recommissioning. ''Brindisi'' sailed for [[Istanbul]] on 3 July, visiting a number of ports in Italy, Greece, and Turkey en route. She relieved the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|San Giorgio||2}} as flagship of the Eastern Squadron upon her arrival on 16 July. The ship was replaced as flagship on 6 October and remained assigned to the Eastern Squadron until she returned to Italy on 7 January 1924.&lt;ref name=f7&gt;Fraccoli 1976, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brindisi'' hosted King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] aboard during the ceremonies that transferred [[Fiume]] to Italian control in accordance with the [[Treaty of Rome (1924)|Treaty of Rome]] in February–March 1924.&lt;ref name=f7/&gt; The ship was then transferred to Libya where she spent the next year. ''Brindisi'' returned to Italy the following year and was briefly assigned to the Scout Squadron on 1 April 1926 before she was placed in reserve on 26 July. The ship was reactivated on 1 June 1927 when she was assigned as the flagship of the 1st Destroyer Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral [[Enrico Cuturi]]. Six months later, she was relieved as flagship and was transferred to the Special Squadron where she became flagship of Rear Admiral [[Antonio Foschini]] on 6 June 1928. In May–June 1929, ''Brindisi'' made a cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean where she visited ports in Greece and the [[Dodecanese Islands]]. Rear Admiral [[Salvatore Denti]] relieved Foschini on 15 October and the ship was disarmed on 26 November. She was used as a depot ship at [[Ancona]], [[Pula]], and [[Trieste]] until she was stricken from the Navy List on 11 March 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Fraccoli 1976, pp. 317–18&lt;/ref&gt;
