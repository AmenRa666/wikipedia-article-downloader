::: yeah, we are an encyclopedia. As long as there isn't credible confirmation on his death, it won't hurt us to say there isn't credible confirmation on his death.

If too late, I presume someone else will deal with it and update the article as needed.&lt;/strike&gt; Muammar was apparently speaking about his grandfather, also named Khamis!?

This guy should be in the Guinness Book of World Records for dying and rising again. Guy must be a cat with all the lives. I agree with Smart30 ([[User:Kennvido|Kennvido]] ([[User talk:Kennvido|talk]]) 23:47, 21 October 2012 (UTC))

== Seventh and youngest son  ==
How can Khamis be the &quot;seventh and youngest son&quot; when all media today report that Saif al-Arab was the youngest son? [[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 05:29, 1 May 2011 (UTC)
: Following the claimed death of Saif al-Arab, some media outlets got it wrong initially. [[Saif al-Arab al-Gaddafi|Saif al-Arab]] was born in 1982 and second youngest. Khamis, born in 1983, is younger. [[User:RN1970|RN1970]] ([[User talk:RN1970|talk]]) 14:45, 3 May 2011 (UTC)

== Regarding the latest claims of Khamis' death ==
Okay, so I noticed that some of us have already jumped the gun over the recent rebel claims of Khamis' death in which, as far as I could tell, ''has not been independently verified by any other sources outside the rebel ranks.'' At the moment, most sources are only relaying the claim without actually confirming it, as shown in entries like these: [http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-aug-5-2011-1414]  [http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/08/05/libyan-rebels-say-gadhafi-son-killed-in-nato-strike/] Also, let us not forget that throughout the conflict the rebels, like the Jamahiriya, have a tendency to exaggerate far too many claims that turned out to be contradictory and/or unreliable. So until more sources emerge actually confirming his death, I ''strongly'' suggests that we continue to have this article treat the subject in hand as a (at least ''possibly'') living person. [[User:FineHourglass|FineHourglass]] ([[User talk:FineHourglass|talk]]) 11:46, 5 August 2011 (UTC)

: Khamis is probably alive. Even Al Jazeera is very skeptical with this claim and say that all point to show that it is not a valid claim. Rebels are probably trying to hide their last defeat in Zlitan. This is not the first time that the rebels do this kind of things. When Saif el Arab was killed the governement was the first to announce it. The rumor of Khamis death has to be treated as only what it is, a simple rumor.--[[User:FreemanSA|FreemanSA]] ([[User talk:FreemanSA|talk]]) 12:14, 5 August 2011 (UTC)

:It probably was, but there's so much doubt surrounding this story, that I don't think this article can say for certain if he is alive or not. Both sides have lied and abused the media in the past for their own reasons, and I don't see reliable sources stating 100% that he is alive. I've tried to keep the page neutral, but phrases &quot;he is proven to be alive&quot;, &quot;Libyan TV showed substantial evidence&quot; and similar break with this neutrality. We don't need to be certain, and its better if we just state the facts, as reported by reliable sources, in the format of &quot;on ''this date'', ''this happened'' according to ''this source''&quot; rather than try to make definitive statements, which are likely to be POV.--[[User:Objectively|Objectively]] ([[User talk:Objectively|talk]]) 18:12, 11 August 2011 (UTC)

== Recent death? ==
Can we ''please'' hold off on reporting this guy dead until it's been 100% confirmed by reliable sources?

: Given the repeated claims of his death (not four times as suggested in the above, but three: 20 March, 5 August, and now 29 August), we do need a confirmation before we declare him dead. For people not aware of the rules, I suggest they read [[WP:RS]] and [[WP:BLP]].

:As a preponderance of [[WP:RS]] seem to be reporting that Khamis Gaddafi is apparently dead (with ''The Daily Mail'' seeming especially convinced), with corroboration coming from captured loyalist soldiers, and no denial issued by the Gaddafi government, I'm withdrawing my objection to Khamis being classified as a recent death. No one seems to be saying he's still alive, and in the absence of denial... -[[User:Kudzu1|Kudzu1]] ([[User talk:Kudzu1|talk]]) 23:55, 3 September 2011 (UTC)

:: I reverted back because the death of Khamis is only a rumor. Not only the loyalists have denied his death, http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/final-battle-imminent-says-libya-rebel-leader/ http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/10202013-libyan-television-denies-death-of-muammar-gaddafis-military-son,  but the rebels have declared him dead wrongly 5 times, and it's clear at this point they are engaged in a propaganda battle on Khamis.  No other son of Gaddafi have been claimed dead by the rebels, just Khamis. And they already lied about &quot;confirmed reports&quot; too many times to be taken seriously. The rebels have not 1% of credibility on Khamis and they can't even agree on one version, contradicting themselves each day. Khamis death is just a rumor created by the rebels at this point. --[[User:ChronicalUsual|ChronicalUsual]] ([[User talk:ChronicalUsual|talk]]) 18:29, 4 September 2011 (UTC)

Rebels are a joke of a source regarding Khamis, and even other Gaddafi sons. They should not even be taken seriously with them caught up lying 5 times on the death of Khamis. But still, rebels sympathizer still try to push rebels views in the page of Khamis, making it less reliable.--[[User:ChronicalUsual|ChronicalUsual]] ([[User talk:ChronicalUsual|talk]]) 19:53, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
: To be fair, both sides (pro-Gaddafi and anti-Gaddafi) have repeatedly been shown to be unreliable in this conflict, which is why any statement based on one of the sides should be clearly identified as such (&quot;according to rebels&quot;, &quot;according to spokesman for Gaddafi&quot;, &quot;rumored&quot;, and alike). The problem in your edit and the reason I reverted it is that you have to provide a source ‚Üí [[WP:V]]. Although I suspect the most recent (29 August) claimed death is wrong, I have yet to see a source from the pro-Gaddafi that has denied it. Considering the changes on the ground during the last few weeks they might be busy with other things, but we still need a source that &lt;u&gt;clearly&lt;/u&gt; shows the pro-Gaddafi side denying it. In any case the sentence was largely a repeat of the section just above it; the major difference is that only three times are mentioned there. I do invite you to add a sentence on the missing fourth time which is already mentioned in the main &quot;Rumors of death&quot; section, but please do remember to use [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] wording. If you are able to locate a source that confirms the denial by the pro-Gaddafi of his most recent claimed death you can easily add it to the already existing intro, e.g. 
: &quot;''Most recently the rebels claimed that he died on 29 August 2011 when a NATO helicopter destroyed the car he was travelling in, but &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;this was denied by [whoever denied it+your reference] and&lt;/span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt; later reports suggested that he was still alive''.&quot; [[User:RN1970|RN1970]] ([[User talk:RN1970|talk]]) 23:25, 12 September 2011 (UTC)

::: Do consider reading [[WP:CIVIL]]. You evidently haven't. And in the future, do consider adding the citation to the article if you know of one. It is not my job to check if there are citations on the talk page or elsewhere on the net that are valid for sentences ''you'' put in the article. Only citations in the article count. If you put a sentence in the article, it is ''you'' who should provide the citation in the article ‚Üí [[WP:V]].

Xinhua is [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-11/22/c_122314971.htm reporting] that an unnamed source in the NTC claims Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said Khamis Gaddafi is still alive, and for some reason, they believe him. For what it's worth, the article ''also'' claims the NTC has pinpointed his location and is readying a mission to capture him. I have no idea if this is credible or not, but Xinhua is generally considered [[WP:RS]]. The thing is, it appears to be the only agency reporting this, it quotes no named sources, and all other sources say he's dead.

Kudzu1
I have also read this article and  I am confused. I am very skeptical about Khamis death in Tarhuna 29th August. Why? Go to youtube, and find a SkyNews video in what a young man, who said that he was personal bodyguard of Khamis, said that Khamis was killed by NATO airstrike AND that Muammar Gaddafi left Bani Walid to Sabha. Now we know, that Muammar was never in Bani Walid that time, so the credibility of this bodyguard is below zero. And the second argument, why they didnt show the place where they buried Khamis?

:I read the article provided from UPI.  The information doesn't seem reliable.  An anonymous government official told Xinhua that saif claimed khamis was alive and near tarhuna, and area controlled by NTC forces for weeks, and he's been there since the fall of tripoli.  The fact that no one has heard ANYTHING from him in months, and that apparently he's been sitting on his hands for months while his brothers and father have been actively directing forces seems suspicious.  He was the most involved with the military prior to and during the war, and now is just twiddling his thumbs? Not very likely. It also seems suspicious that this source ONLY told Xinhua, and no one else.  All things considered, this doesn't seem to be a very reliable piece of information.

:::His official rank was captain. As for promotion, it may have happened, it may have not but since we have no reports about it, it remains just speculation. And as for generals, only his sister was general. Probably because she is hot. Even Mutassim was just a major.

==Khamis rumorology again==
Something had to be done with the issue of Khamis supossed death. If WP want to be a serious encyclopedia and not loose credibility, it cannot kill or resurrect Khamis everytime the so-called ex-&quot;rebels&quot; claim his death, arrest, etc..., as it seems to be a distraction technique. Only when there are real proofs we can assure it. Regards.--[[User:HCPUNXKID|HCPUNXKID]] ([[User talk:HCPUNXKID|talk]]) 21:19, 21 October 2012 (UTC)

He should have category ''Possibly Living People'', it's unknown did he is dead (sorry for bad English).  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚Äî&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/185.28.251.241|185.28.251.241]] ([[User talk:185.28.251.241|talk]]) 14:01, 8 February 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Again - No proofs for being dead or alive ==

Sorry for bad English. Most wikipedias not listed him as deceased, he should have category &quot;missing people&quot; or &quot;possible living people&quot;. [[Special:Contributions/37.152.18.170|37.152.18.170]] ([[User talk:37.152.18.170|talk]]) 15:47, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Khamis Gaddafi]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=706883992 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20121124025315/http://www.boston.com:80/news/world/middle-east/2012/10/21/libyan-turmoil-persists-year-after-gadhafi-death/FVo38xuWBp6DgD2aS06jRI/story.html to http://www.boston.com/news/world/middle-east/2012/10/21/libyan-turmoil-persists-year-after-gadhafi-death/FVo38xuWBp6DgD2aS06jRI/story.html

== Semi-protected edit request on 16 March 2016 ==

{{edit semi-protected|Khamis Gaddafi|answered=y}}
&lt;!-- Be sure to state UNAMBIGUOUSLY your suggested changes; editors who can edit the protected page need to know what to add or remove. Blank edit requests WILL be declined. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
In the infobox, in alma mater, IE Business School should be removed, as Gaddafi was expelled from this institution and never graduated, as explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamis_Gaddafi#cite_ref-Bloomberg4March_5-0. 

In the &quot;Soviet military academies&quot; line, there is also a link to a El Pais article that has nothing to do with the &quot;Soviet military academies&quot; and should be removed.

So alma mater should be changed from this:

|alma_mater     = [[Soviet military academies#M.V. Frunze Military Academy|Frunze Military Academy]]&lt;br&gt;[[General Staff Academy (Russia)|General Staff Academy]]&lt;br&gt;[[IE Business School]]

To the following:

|alma_mater     = [[Soviet military academies#M.V. Frunze Military Academy|Frunze Military Academy]]&lt;br&gt;[[General Staff Academy (Russia)|General Staff Academy]]
&lt;!-- End request --&gt;

:{{Not done}} I can't find any specific advice on almer mata lists, but as stated at [[WP:ALUMNI]] - all notable alumni &quot;are to be included on an alumni list, regardless of how much time they have spent on a school roll, from one day to several years, and whether or not they graduated.&quot; so the fact that he was &quot;expelled from this institution and never graduated&quot; appears to be irrelevant.  The reference supports his attendance at [[IE Business School]] so I have moved it to the right place. - [[User:Arjayay|Arjayay]] ([[User talk:Arjayay|talk]]) 17:56, 16 March 2016 (UTC)</text>
