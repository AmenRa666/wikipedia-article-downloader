{{Campaignbox Ottoman–Habsburg Wars}}
{{Campaignbox Little War in Hungary}}
The the [[Habsburgs]] and their allies and the [[Ottoman Empire]] engaged in a series of military campaigns against one another in Hungary between 1526 and 1568. While overall the Ottomans had the upper hand, the war failed to produce any decisive result. The Ottoman army remained very powerful in the open field but it often lost a significant amount of time besieging the many fortresses of the Hungarian frontier and its communication lines were now dangerously overstretched. At the end of the conflict, Hungary had been split into several different zones of control, between the Ottomans, Habsburgs, and [[Principality of Transylvania|Transylvania]], an Ottoman vassal state.

==1530s==

Following Suleiman's unsuccessful Siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand I launched a counter-attack in 1530 to regain the initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman's 120,000 strong army.

Suleiman's response came in 1532 when he led a massive army of over 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna again. Ferdinand withdrew his army, leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend Güns ([[Kőszeg]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, Stephen 1699. pg 51&quot;&gt;Turnbull, Stephen. The Ottoman Empire 1326–1699. New York: Osprey, 2003. pg 51&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Siege of Güns]], the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha|Ibrahim Pasha]], did not realize how poorly defended Koszeg was; in fact Constantinople [[Fall of Constantinople|in 1453]] stood a better chance.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Nonetheless, under the leadership of [[Croats|Croatian]] Captain [[Nikola Jurišić]], the city fought off every assault. The exact outcome of the battle is unknown, since it has two versions which differ depending on the source. In the first version Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and in the second version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. In any case, the Ottomans withdrew at the arrival of the August rains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, Stephen 1699. pg 51&quot;/&gt; During their retreat, they suffered a defeat at [[Battle of Leobersdorf|the battle of Leobersdorf]] against an imperial army led by Frederick II, elector palatine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The [[Treaty of Constantinople (1533)]] was signed between Ferdinand and Suleiman. John Szapolyai was recognized as King of Hungary as an Ottoman vassal. However, the Ottomans recognized the land under Habsburg rule in Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, Stephen 1699. pg 52&quot;&gt;Turnbull, Stephen. The Ottoman Empire 1326–1699. New York: Osprey, 2003. pg 52&lt;/ref&gt;

This treaty did not satisfy John Szapolyai or Ferdinand whose armies began to skirmish along the borders. Ferdinand decided to strike a decisive blow in 1537 at John by sending his ablest generals&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, Stephen 1699. pg 52&quot;/&gt; to take [[Osijek]], thereby violating the treaty. The siege failed and led to the [[Battle of Gorjani]], which was a disaster of similar magnitude to that of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] with an Ottoman relief army smashing the Austrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, Stephen 1699. pg 52&quot;/&gt;

However, rather than attack Vienna again, Suleiman sent an army of 8,000 light [[cavalry]] to attack [[Otranto]] in southern Italy the same year. The troops were withdrawn from Italy after an expected French invasion designed to coordinate with Ottoman efforts failed to materialize. Nonetheless, an Ottoman victory at the naval [[Battle of Preveza]] in 1538 gave the Habsburg-led coalition another defeat.

==1540s==

In 1541, the Ottomans failed to take the fortress of [[Szigetvár]]. However a humiliating defeat was inflicted on the Habsburgs in the [[Siege of Buda (1541)]]. John Szapolyai had died in 1540 and his son was only a few weeks old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull, Stephen 1699. pg 52&quot;/&gt; An Austrian attack on Buda followed the news of the death of John, but the appeals of John's widow to Suleiman were not unanswered and in 1541 the elderly General Rogendorf was defeated outside of Buda, before he could even cross the Danube to take it. The next year Ferdinand [[Siege of Pest|besieged Pest]] but was repulsed.

In April 1543 Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, bringing back Bran and other forts so that much of Hungary was under Ottoman control. As part of a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] (see also: [[Franco-Hungarian alliance]] and [[Petar Keglević]]), French troops were supplied to the Ottomans in Hungary: a French artillery unit was dispatched in 1543–1544 and attached to the [[Ottoman Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;''The Ottoman Empire and early modern Europe'' by Daniel Goffman, p.111 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uJzjatjTL4C&amp;pg=PA111]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mx7jSZjIC p.38&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=epaMx7jSZjIC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Firearms of the Islamic world'', p.38]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AuJvd2Tyt8C p.328&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4AuJvd2Tyt8C&amp;pg=PA328 ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p.328]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1543, the Ottoman succeeded in the [[Siege of Esztergom (1543)|Siege of Esztergom]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandler&quot;&gt;''Ground warfare: an international encyclopedia'' by Stanley Sandler p.387 [https://books.google.com/books?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&amp;pg=PT423]&lt;/ref&gt; The siege would be followed by the capture of the Hungarian coronation city of [[Székesfehérvár]] in September 1543.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3orG2yZ9mBkC&amp;pg=PA59 ''Slovak history: chronology &amp; lexicon'' Július Bartl p.59]&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities that were captured during this campaign are [[Siklós]] and [[Szeged]] in order to better protect [[Buda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandler&quot;/&gt; However, continuous delay of the push toward the west, because of the siege of these fortresses, meant that the Ottomans could not launch any new offensive against Austria.

From 1548 to the end of the war, a [[Tercio|Habsburg Spanish infantry tercio]] which had fought in the [[Schmalkaldic War]], led by [[Maestre de campo]] [[Bernardo de Aldana]], was detached in Hungary to fight against John Zápolya's supporters on behalf of Ferdinand.&lt;ref&gt;Korpás, Zoltán: '' La correspondencia de un soldado español de las guerras de Hungría a mediados del siglo XVI. Comentarios al diario de Bernardo de Aldana (1548-1552)''. In: ''Hispania'', Vol. 60, no 206, 2000, pp. 881-910&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] sent Spanish troops to help his brother regularly from 1527 to 1553, a support that proved instrumental in Hungary remaining inside [[Western Christianity|Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, C. Scott; Fuchs, Martina: ''The histories of Emperor Charles V: nationale Perspektiven von Persönlichkeit und Herrschaft''. Münster: Aschendorff, 2005. ISBN 3402065746, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Peace was finally concluded in [[Edirne]] in 1568, and renewed in 1576, 1584, and 1591. War would not again break out between the Habsburgs and Ottomans until 1593, in the [[Long Turkish War]]. However, throughout this period of peace small-scale warfare continued, a conflict known as the &quot;Little War&quot; ({{lang-de|Kleinkrieg}}). No large armies or sustained campaigns were launched, but authorities on both sides continually struggled with hostile raiders and forays across the poorly-demarcated border. Both sides, however, desired that peace continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkel |first=Caroline |title=The Administration of Warfare: The Ottoman Military Campaigns in Hungary, 1593-1606 |year=1988 |place=Vienna |publisher=VWGÖ |isbn= 3-85369-708-9 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
