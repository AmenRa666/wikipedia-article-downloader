'''''Dmitrii Donskoi''''' ({{lang-ru|Дмитрий Донской}}) was an [[armoured cruiser]] built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the early 1880s. She was designed as a [[commerce raider]] and equipped with a full suite of sails to economize on coal consumption. The ship spent the bulk of her career abroad, either in the [[Far East]] or in the [[Mediterranean]]. ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron after the Japanese destroyed the Russian ships deployed in the Far East during the early stages of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05. The squadron was intercepted by the Japanese fleet in May 1905 in the [[Battle of Tsushima]] after a lengthy voyage from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. The cruiser was not seriously damaged during the initial fighting and tried to continue on to [[Vladivostok]] after the first day's fighting. She was spotted by several groups of Japanese warships the following day and was badly damaged in the resulting combat. Her [[captain (nautical)|captain]] ordered the crew ashore off [[Ulleungdo]] Island and had ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' [[scuttling|scuttled]] offshore.

==Design and description==
''Dmitrii Donskoi'' was classified as a semi-[[armoured frigate]] and was an improved version of her [[sister ship|half-sister]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Vladimir Monomakh||2}}. The ship was designed with long endurance and high speed to facilitate her role as a commerce raider. She was laid out as a [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclad]] with her armament concentrated amidships. The iron-hulled ship was fitted with a [[Naval ram|ram]] and was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce [[biofouling|fouling]]. Her crew numbered approximately 550 officers and men.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 123–24, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was {{convert|93.4|m|ftin|disp=flip}} [[overall length|long overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.7|m|ftin|disp=flip}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|7.8|m|ftin|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref name=w7&gt;Wright, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The ship displaced {{convert|5593|LT|MT}} at [[deep load]]. ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' had two three-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Compound|compound steam engines]] driving a single propeller shaft. Steam was provided by eight cylindrical [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=w68&gt;Watts, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The engines were designed to produce {{convert|7000|ihp|lk=in}}, but produced {{convert|6609|ihp|abbr=on}} during [[sea trial]]s which gave the ship a maximum speed around {{convert|16.5|kn|lk=in}}. The ship normally carried {{convert|900|LT|t}} of coal which gave her an economical range of {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}, but she is known to have loaded {{convert|1625|LT}} in May 1889.&lt;ref name=w44&gt;Wright, pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[ship rig]]ged with three masts&lt;ref name=s9&gt;Silverstone, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; and had a total sail area of {{convert|26000|sqft}}. To reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]] while under sail, her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s were retractable. The highest speed that she made solely under sail was {{convert|10.5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=w44/&gt;

''Dmitrii Donskoi'' was armed with two 30-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} Model 1877 guns, on [[sponson]]s on the upper deck between the funnels. The fourteen 28-calibre Model 1877 {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} guns were mounted in casemates on the main deck. Anti-[[torpedo boat]] defence was provided by a number of nine-pounder ({{convert|42|mm|abbr=on}}), four-pounder ({{convert|34|mm|abbr=on}}) and {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} five-barreled revolver [[Hotchkiss gun]]s.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Sources disagree on the numbers of each weapon at any time.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was also equipped with four above-water {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=w44/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 127, 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ck7&gt;Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] was composed of [[compound armour]] and extended the full length of the ship. It was six inches thick amidships, but reduced to {{convert|4.5|in|0}} at the ship's ends. It extended {{convert|2|ft|1}} above the waterline and {{convert|5|ft|1}} below.&lt;ref name=w7/&gt; Transverse bulkheads {{convert|3|-|4|in|0}} thick protected the guns in the [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] from [[raking fire]]. The sponsons of the 8-inch guns were equally thick.&lt;ref name=w68/&gt; The protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|0.5|in|mm|0|adj=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=w7/&gt;

[[File:DmitriyDonskoy1893New-York.jpg|''Dmitrii Donskoi'' at the Columbian Exposition, 1893|thumb|left]]
Construction began on ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' on 22 September 1880&lt;ref group=Note&gt;All dates used in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]&lt;/ref&gt; at the New [[Admiralty Shipyard]] in [[St. Petersburg]], although the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May 1881. She was launched on 30 August 1882 and completed in early 1885. The ship's total cost was 3,421,468 [[ruble]]s. The ship was named after [[Dmitry Donskoy]], [[Grand Duke of Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 124, 127, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

She sailed to the Mediterranean on 8 August 1885 and remained there until she arrived at Port Said on 6 March 1887 en route to the Far East. ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' reached [[Nagasaki]], Japan, on 19 May and remained in Japanese waters for several months. The ship arrived at Vladivostok on 20 July and accidentally grounded on 12 October whilst conducting torpedo practice. Only lightly damaged, she was refloated the following day. ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' wintered in Japan that year and made port visits to [[Chefoo]] and [[Shanghai]] in February 1888. She was refitted in Yokohama before she began her return to the Baltic on 20 January 1889. The ship was inspected by [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]] after her arrival at [[Kronstadt]] on 12 June. She began a lengthy [[wikt:overhaul|overhaul]] in preparation for her next foreign cruise shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=w9&gt;Wright, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dmitrii Donskoi'' began her second foreign cruise on 3 October 1891 when she sailed for the Mediterranean, visiting [[Brest, France]] en route. She was reclassified as a cruiser of the first rank on 13 February 1892 and remained in the Mediterranean for another month or so. The ship reached Vladivostok on 29 June, stopping at [[Aden]], [[Singapore]], and [[Hong Kong]] en route. ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' served as the [[flagship]] of [[Rear Admiral]] Tirtov several times during the year. She spent the winter in Yokosuka and Nagasaki before she sailed in early 1893 to America for a goodwill visit to mark the [[World's Columbian Exhibition|400 anniversary of America's discovery]]. In Algiers in March, the ship picked up [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia]] and became flagship of Rear Admiral Kaznakov who commanded all the Russian ships at the exhibition. ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' reached [[New York City]] on 25 April and participated in the [[Presidential Review]] two days later. She made port visits to [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]] before she arrived back at Kronstadt in early September.&lt;ref name=w9/&gt;

During the ship's lengthy 1893–95 refit, she was rearmed with six 45-calibre six-inch guns, ten 45-calibre {{convert|4.7|in|adj=on}} guns, and six {{convert|47|mm|adj=on}} guns.&lt;ref name=s9/&gt; Her boilers may have been replaced at this time and her sailing rig was replaced by three pole masts.&lt;ref name=w7/&gt; [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]] was appointed as the ship's captain in late 1895 and ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' began her voyage to the Far East on 10 November. She was one of the Russian ships that occupied [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]] in March 1898 and participated in suppressing the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in mid-1900. The ship was ordered home in late 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 139, 142&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' was refitted again upon her arrival and six of her 4.7-inch guns were replaced by six {{convert|75|mm|adj=on}} guns and two additional 47&amp;nbsp;mm guns.&lt;ref name=s9/&gt;

After the completion of her refit, she escorted a group of seven destroyers and five torpedo boats to the Mediterranean in October 1903 where they were assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Virenius. The Naval Staff decided to reinforce the Pacific Squadron with the Mediterranean Squadron in December, but its departure was delayed by repairs to the [[battleship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Oslyabya||2}} after it had grounded. When the Russo-Japanese War began in February, the squadron was in the [[Red Sea]] and was recalled to the Baltic lest it be caught and destroyed en route by the Japanese.&lt;ref name=w2&gt;Wright, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dmitrii Donskoi'' was assigned to the cruiser force of the Second Pacific Squadron and departed [[Liepāja|Libau]] on 15 October 1904 bound for Vladivostok with [[Captain 1st Rank]] Lebedev in command. En route in the North Sea, she was damaged by friendly fire from seven sister ships in mistake for a Japanese vessel during the [[Dogger Bank Incident]] of 21/22 October.  The ship passed the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 20 December. Whilst approaching the [[Strait of Tsushima]] on 27 May 1905, the Russian force was intercepted by the Japanese in the Battle of Tsushima. The cruiser was assigned to defend the transport ships at the rear of the Russian formation and was not seriously engaged during the day. She became separated from the rest of the fleet during the early evening and attempted to steam north to [[Vladivostok]] through the Japanese fleet. ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' was unsuccessfully attacked by Japanese destroyers and torpedo boats during the night. The following morning, she helped to transfer the badly wounded squadron commander, [[Vice Admiral]] [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]], from the [[destroyer]] ''[[Russian destroyer Buinyi|Buinyi]]'' to the destroyer ''Biedovi'' and then was forced to scuttle ''Buinyi'' when the destroyer's machinery broke down. The destroyer's crew as well as some 205 survivors from ''Oslyabya'' were transferred to the cruiser before ''Buinyi'' was scuttled. As the ship sailed northward, she was spotted late in the day by several groups of Japanese ships and badly damaged in the ensuing combat. Captain Lebedev decided to run his ship aground on [[Ulleungdo]], but the ship anchored instead and all of the men aboard were taken to the island. Roughly 60 men of the ship's crew had been killed and another 120 wounded during the fighting. The next morning, 29 May, ''Dmitrii Donskoi'' was scuttled about a mile and a half (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) offshore, approximately at {{Coord|37|30|N|130|57|E|display=inline,title}}. The survivors were taken prisoner that afternoon by landing parties from the Japanese destroyer ''[[Japanese destroyer Fubuki (1905)|Fubuki]]'' and the Japanese [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Kasugu Maru''.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 142, 144&lt;/ref&gt;
