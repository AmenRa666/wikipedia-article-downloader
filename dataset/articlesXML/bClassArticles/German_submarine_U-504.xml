'''German submarine ''U-504''''' was a [[German Type IX submarine#Type IXC|Type IXC]] [[U-boat]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. The submarine was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 29 April 1940 at the [[Deutsche Werft]] yard in [[Hamburg]] as yard number 294, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 24 April 1941 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 30 July 1941 under the command of ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' [[Fritz Poske|Hans-Georg Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Poske]]. Initially attached to the [[4th U-boat Flotilla]] for training, the U-boat was transferred to the [[2nd U-boat Flotilla|2nd flotilla]] on 1 January 1942 for front-line service.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboatnet&quot;/&gt; She was a member of six [[wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s.

==Design==
[[German Type IX submarine#Type IXC|German Type IXC submarines]] were slightly larger than the original [[German Type IXB submarine|Type IXB]]s. ''U-504'' had a displacement of {{convert|1120|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|1232|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}} The U-boat had a total length of {{convert|76.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|58.75|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[MAN SE|MAN]] M 9 V 40/46 [[supercharged]] four-stroke, nine-cylinder [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|4400|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[Siemens-Schuckert]] 2 GU 345/34 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|1000|shp|PS kW|-1}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.92|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|18.3|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.3|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|63|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|13450|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-504'' was fitted with six {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 [[torpedo]]es, one [[10.5 cm SK C/32 naval gun|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/32 naval gun]], 180 rounds, and a {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} as well as a {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of forty-eight.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}}

==Service history==

===1st patrol===
''U-504''{{'}}s first war patrol took her from [[Kiel]] in Germany, to her [[home port]] of [[Lorient]], in occupied France, between 6 and 20 January 1942 without incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd patrol===
On 25 January 1942 ''U-504'' sailed from Lorient, and headed across the Atlantic to the Florida coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1072.html

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, at 04:55 on 22 February, she attacked the unescorted and unarmed American 5,287 ton [[Tank ship|tanker]] ''Republic'' about {{Convert|3.5|nmi}} north-east of [[Jupiter Inlet Light]], [[Florida]]. Struck by two torpedoes, the ship settled by the stern, and the crew abandoned ship and rowed to shore. The badly damaged ship eventually drifted onto reefs about five miles (8 km) due east of [[Hobe Sound, Florida]] and finally sank on the afternoon of 23 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the U-boat sank another ship, torpedoing the unescorted and unarmed American 10,227 ton tanker ''W.D. Anderson'' at 01:32 on 23 February, about {{convert|12|nmi}} north-east of Jupiter Inlet Light. Loaded with {{convert|133360|oilbbl|m3}} of [[crude oil]], the ship burst into flames, killing all but one of the crew of 36, and later sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''U-504'' struck again on 26 February sinking the unescorted Dutch 8,245 ton tanker ''Mamura'' about {{convert|230|nmi}} off the coast of Florida. The ship, loaded with [[gasoline]], was hit by two torpedoes, setting it on fire and breaking it in two. The ship sank within eight minutes, killing all 49 of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''U-504''{{'}}s final victim was the unescorted British 5,966 ton merchant ship ''Stangarth'', sunk on 16 March, by a single torpedo, north-east of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. There were no survivors from her crew of 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-504'' arrived back at Lorient on 1 April after 67 days at sea.

===3rd patrol===
The U-boat then sailed for a patrol in the [[Caribbean Sea]], departing Lorient on 2 May 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1073.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first success came on 29 May when she sank the unescorted British 1,597 ton cargo ship ''Allister'', en route from [[Kingston, Jamaica]], to [[Tampa, Florida]], with a cargo of 500 tons of bananas. The ship was torpedoed {{convert|54|nmi}} south of [[Grand Cayman]] Island, losing 15 of her crew of 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June ''U-504'' struck twice, east of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. At 06:59 she sank the unescorted 3,901 ton [[Honduras|Honduran]] merchant ship ''Tela'' with two torpedoes, sinking her within five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18:06 the U-boat opened fire with her [[deck gun]] on the unescorted British 1,512 ton merchant ship ''Rosenborg'', after missing the ship with two torpedoes. She fired 60 shells, of which about 30 hit. Four of the crew were killed, the remaining 23 were later picked up and landed in [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U-boat struck again twice in a single day, 11 June, off [[Honduras]]. She sank the unescorted Dutch 4,282 ton passenger ship ''Crijnssen'' at 02:10 with three torpedoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the unescorted and unarmed American 4,846 ton merchant ship ''American'' at 18:01. The ship, carrying 6,500 tons of [[manganese]] [[ore]], coffee, [[gunny sack]]s, [[jute]] and oil, from [[Port of Santos|Santos, Brazil]], to [[New Orleans]], was hit by two torpedoes, and then a third eleven minutes later. The ship sank in 25 minutes. The crew of eight officers and 30 men abandoned ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-504'' arrived back at Lorient on 7 July after 67 days at sea.

===4th patrol===
''U-504'' left Lorient again on 19 August 1942 and sailed south to the waters off [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] as part of [[Wolfpack Eisbär]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1074.html

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, on 17 October, about {{convert|450|nmi}} south of [[Cape Town]], she torpedoed and sank the unescorted British 5,970 ton ''[[Empire Chaucer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the 26th she attacked the unescorted American 7,176 ton [[Liberty ship]] ''Anne Hutchinson''. The crew abandoned their vessel after she was hit by two torpedoes and fatally damaged. However the ship remained afloat, and on the 29th was taken in tow by the South African [[armed trawler]] HMSAS ''David Haigh'' (T13) and a harbour tug. Lacking sufficient power to tow the ship to port explosive charges were set, cutting the ship in two. The aft section sank, and the fore section was towed into [[Port Elizabeth]]. Part of the crew were picked up at sea, while the rest made it to land in their lifeboats.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat.net&quot;/&gt;

''U-504'' sank two more British merchant ships on 31 October, about {{convert|200|nmi}} east of [[Durban]]. First the unescorted 7,041 ton ''[[List of Empire ships (G)#Empire Guidon|Empire Guidon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the unescorted 5,113 ton ''Reynolds'', which, hit amidships and in the stern, capsized and sank within seconds.&lt;ref&gt;other sources credit the [[German auxiliary cruiser Michel|raider ''Michel'']] with sinking ''Reynolds''&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally on 3 November she sank the unescorted and unarmed [[Brazil]]ian 5,187 ton cargo ship ''Porto Alegre'' en route from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to [[Durban]], off Port Elizabeth. Hit by a single torpedo, the crew abandoned ship before the U-boat delivered the [[coup de grâce]]. Only one crew member was lost. The survivors were questioned by the Germans, and later made landfall about {{convert|50|nmi}} from Port Elizabeth on 7 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-504'' arrived back at Lorient on 11 December 1942 after a patrol lasting 115 days.

===5th and 6th patrol===
''U-504'' left Lorient on 19 January 1943, now under the command of ''Kapitänleutnant'' Wilhelm Luis, and headed out into the Atlantic waters south of the [[Azores]]. She was subjected to attacks by unidentified Allied aircraft outbound on 21 January and inbound on 12 March, but was not damaged by either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
