[[File:The grave of Sir Patrick Lindesay, Inveresk.JPG|thumb|The highly obscured grave of Sir Patrick Lindesay, Inveresk]]

'''Sir Patrick Lindesay''', [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Royal Guelphic Order|KCH]] (24 February 1778 – 14 March 1839) was a military officer during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and [[Peninsular War]] but is most noted as having served as Acting Governor of [[New South Wales]], Australia in 1831. [[Mount Lindesay (Queensland)]], [[Mount Lindesay (New South Wales)]] and Lindesay River in Australia are all named after him.

==Life==
He was born in [[Musselburgh]], [[East Lothian]], [[Scotland]], the son of Lt. Col. John Lindesay.

He was educated at [[Edinburgh University]] and in 1793 joined the army as an [[Ensign]]. He was thereafter gazetted as a lieutenant in the famed [[78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]]. He was promoted to Captain in September 1795. He moved to the [[39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot]] in October 1796 and was there promoted to Major in 1807. He then saw considerable action in Spain and Portugal during the [[Peninsular War]].

In 1811 he saw his most major action, and received a medal for his actions in the [[Battle of Albuera]].

In 1814, his obituary states, he had a “final brush” with the Americans in the [[War of 1812|final battles between these countries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36862741&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1824 to 1826 he served in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], commanding a division of the Expeditionary Army.

==Australia==
In November 1827, aged 49, he arrived in [[Sydney, Australia]] to succeed Col. William Stewart in the command of the garrison at [[Port Jackson]]. He became a member of the Legislative Council for the colony and when the post of lieutenant-governor was abolished he took over the required duties of the post. From April 1829 he was a member of the Executive Council. After the controversial departure of the governor [[Sir Ralph Darling]] on 22 October 1831, Lindesay played the role of Acting Governor until the appointment of Sir [[Richard Bourke]] as governor on 2 December 1831.

During this period he permitted one of the Captains in his Regiment, Captain [[Charles Sturt]] to take a leave of absence to explore the [[Murray River]]. On Sturt’s return he brought many bird skins which were then delivered by Lindesay to the Edinburgh Museum. A later donation to Prof. [[Robert Jameson]] caused Jameson to state that Lindesay was “a distinguished officer and a very active naturalist”.

Sturt later named a tributary of the [[Murray River]] the Lindesay River, in gratitude to his commanding officer.

The explorer [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]] later named a mountain on the border of New South Wales, in the [[McPherson Range]],  “Mount Lindesay” but this was later (c.1840) renamed [[Mount Barney]]. The name [[Mount Lindesay (Queensland)|Mount Lindesay]] was then used to replace a mountain previously named “Mount Hooker” just north within Queensland. A second [[Mount Lindesay (New South Wales)]] was later named by Sir Thomas Mitchell, attaching to a dominant mountain in the [[Nandewar Range]].

==Late Life==

In 1832 he was dispatched to India to command the garrisons at [[Bangalore]]. After the surrender of [[Mercara]] he received a bounty of £10,000. He then commanded the entire British forces in southern [[Madras]] until late 1835.

He returned to Britain in 1836 and was promoted Major General on 10th Jan 1837 and knighted, [[Knight Commander of the Bath]].

He is buried in St. Michael’s Churchyard in [[Inveresk]] west of the main church in the older section. His grave is currently (2014) wholly obscured by two yew trees.
