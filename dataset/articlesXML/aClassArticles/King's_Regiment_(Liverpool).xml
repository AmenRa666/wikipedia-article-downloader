::''See also [[List of battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool)]]''

The '''King's Regiment (Liverpool)''' was one of the oldest [[Line infantry|line]] [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s of the [[British Army]], having been formed in 1685 and numbered as the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot]] in 1751. Unlike most British Army infantry regiments, which were associated with a [[county]], the King's represented the city of [[Liverpool]], one of only four regiments affiliated to a city in the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;The other &quot;city&quot; regiments were the [[Royal Fusiliers|Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]], the [[Highland Light Infantry|Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment)]] (from 1923), and the [[Manchester Regiment]].&lt;/ref&gt; After 273 years of continuous existence, the regiment was amalgamated with the [[Manchester Regiment]] in 1958 to form the [[King's Regiment|King's Regiment (Liverpool and Manchester)]], which was later amalgamated with the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]] and the [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] to form the present [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]].

The King's notably saw active service in the [[Second Boer War]], the two [[world war]]s, and the [[Korean War]]. In the [[World War I|First World War]], the regiment contributed dozens of battalions to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Salonika]], and the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]]. More than 13,000 men were killed. In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the 5th and [[Liverpool Irish|8th (Irish)]] battalions landed during [[Operation Overlord]], the 1st and 13th fought as [[Chindits]] in the [[Burma Campaign]], and the 2nd Battalion served in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and [[Greek Civil War|Greece]]. The King's later fought in the Korean War, earning the regiment's last [[battle honour]].

Nine [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded to men of the regiment, the first in 1900 and the last in 1918. An additional two were awarded to [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] officer [[Noel Godfrey Chavasse]], who was attached to the [[Liverpool Scottish|10th (Scottish) Battalion]] during the Great War.

In peacetime, the regiment's battalions were based in the United Kingdom and colonies in the [[British Empire]]. Duties varied: riots were suppressed in Belfast, England, and the Middle East; bases were garrisoned in places such as the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] and [[West Germany]]; and reviews and parades conducted throughout the regiment's history.

[[File:D Company, King's R, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;D&quot; Company of the 1st King's, Wellington Barracks, [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], early 1890s.]]

The [[Cardwell reforms|Cardwell]]&amp;ndash;[[Childers reforms]] from the 1860s to the 1880s substantially reorganised the British Army,&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc1&quot;&gt;Chandler (2003), pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; principally by amalgamating single-[[battalion]] regiments to form regiments of multiple battalions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the [[List of British Army regiments (1881)|list of British Army regiments]] for details of the 1881 structure.&lt;/ref&gt; The King's, which already had two regular battalions, did not amalgamate, but did adopt a new title on the numbering system's abolition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 57–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, on 1 July 1881, the two battalions of the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, '''The King's (Liverpool) Regiment'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=24992|startpage=3300|date=1 July 1881|accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th Foot had been associated with Liverpool since 1873, when it became allocated to the town's 13th Brigade Depot.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Regular regiments gained auxiliary battalions through the integration of the [[militia]] and [[Volunteer Army (British)|volunteers]], of which nine from [[Lancashire]] and the [[Isle of Man]] transferred to the King's and ultimately became part of the Special Reserve and [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new system, it was envisaged that one regular battalion would be based in the United Kingdom and one overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc1&quot;/&gt; The 1st Battalion had been in [[North West England]] since the late 1870s and had been bombed while based at Salford Barracks in 1881.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc&quot;/&gt; The attack had been the first in a [[dynamite]] campaign instigated by the Irish Republican [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]].&lt;ref&gt;McConville, Seán (2002), ''Irish Political Offenders: Theatres of War'', p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; The barracks sustained only minor structural damage from the explosion, which killed a child and badly wounded its mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc&quot;/&gt; Soon afterwards, rioting during mineworkers' strikes in [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Chowbent]], [[Wigan]], and [[Warrington]] required the battalion's intervention to prevent further disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cannon|Cannon, Richard]] &amp; Robertson, Alexander Cunningham (1883), ''Historical Record of the King's Liverpool Regiment of Foot'', pp. 204–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, the battalion moved to Ireland, based in [[Curragh Camp|the Curragh]]. During the otherwise uneventful posting, the 1st responded to riots in [[Belfast]]. The sectarian disorder coincided with the introduction of the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|1886 Home Rule Bill]] in the [[British House of Commons|British Parliament]]. The battalion returned to England three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0vT4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25&amp;lpg=PT25&amp;dq=King%27s+Regiment+Liverpool+Belfast+1886&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ORnXyIxRFz&amp;sig=MbkUzRhYbiTuyJSKFe4JwkVtz5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiF8YnU6YvKAhUEbxQKHZdsBtcQ6AEIKDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=King's%20Regiment%20Liverpool%20Belfast%201886&amp;f=false|title=James Connolly, A Full Life: A Biography of Ireland's Renowned Trade Unionist and Leader of the 1916 Easter Rising|first=Donal|last= Nevin|publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd King's had been on the [[Indian subcontinent]] since 1877 and had fought in the [[Second Afghan War]]. The [[Third Burmese War]] punctuated the battalion's overseas service in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc&quot;/&gt; Intent on deposing [[Upper Burma]]'s [[Thibaw Min|King Thibaw]] and imposing imperial rule, Britain issued an ultimatum consisting of demands that were rejected as anticipated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burma&quot;&gt;Raugh, Harold E. (2004),''The Victorian's at War, 1815–1914'', pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion began in November 1885 in the form of the Burma Field Force, which progressed up the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] via transports, enabling the rapid capture of frontier forts and the capital [[Mandalay]]. After the capital's seizure, the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of Thibaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc&quot;/&gt; A [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma's annexation on 1 January 1886, lasting for at least five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burma&quot;/&gt; For more than a year, the King's operated in small groups pursuing guerrillas in the Burmese jungle. Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion had returned to India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Struc&quot;/&gt; In early 1900 the 2nd Battalion Liverpool Regiment was stationed at [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=15 January 1900 |page_number=7 |issue=36039| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overseas service for the 1st King's included a two-year residence in [[Nova Scotia]], beginning in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;''Two Famous Regiments'', Daily Mail and Empire, 23 November 1895, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1895, the battalion provided a 100-man [[guard of honour]] when the body of Canadian Prime Minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|John Thompson]] was returned from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''A Sad Return'', The Toronto Daily Mail, 2 January 1895, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion subsequently became stationed in the West Indies, then [[Cape Colony]] in 1897. The [[Second Boer War]] began two years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natal&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the outbreak of the war, as the discord between the British and [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] escalated, the 1st King's formed a company of [[mounted infantry]] and underwent intensive training at [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], [[Natal Colony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Natal&quot;/&gt; War was declared on 11 October and Natal invaded by a Boer force under General [[Piet Joubert]]. General [[George White (British Army officer)|George White]] held authority over 13,000 British personnel dispersed throughout Natal.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899–1902'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy losses were incurred by the British in the first major engagements of the war, at [[Battle of Talana Hill|Talana Hill]] and [[Battle of Elandslaagte|Elandslaagte]]. Retreat to Ladysmith, where the British concentrated its largest contingent, ensued.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899–1902'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Having besieged [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafikeng]], Boers converged upon Ladysmith and positioned artillery pieces on surrounding hills overlooking the town.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham, p.106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Positions round Ladysmith - November 1899 - Project Gutenberg eText 16466.jpg|thumb|A map of Ladysmith, November 1899.]]
On 30 October, General White ordered an attack on northern Boer positions. White's plans were described as vague, ambitious, and complicated, and the battle proved a disaster that became known to the British as &quot;Mournful Monday&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899–1902'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;Cassar, George H. (1985), ''The Tragedy of Sir John French'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st King's were allocated to Colonel Grimwood's column, which intended to advance on and secure Long Hill, believed to constitute the Boer's left flank. Unbeknownst to Grimwood, almost half of the brigade separated from the column during the night march while following a rightward deviation by the artillery batteries,&lt;ref name=&quot;LadysmithA&quot;&gt;''A Handbook of the Boer War'', pp.53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; including the oblivious 1st King's and [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Griffith|Griffith, Kenneth]] (1974), ''Thank God We Kept the Flag Flying: The Siege and Relief of Ladysmith, 1899–1900'', p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; In the morning light, the brigade discovered that its right flank was exposed by the distance of [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French's]] cavalry and that Long Hill was unoccupied.&lt;ref name=&quot;LadysmithA&quot;/&gt; Grimwood and French's men became pinned down by heavy rifle and artillery fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt; Amidst rumours of an attack against the town being imminent and failure evident, White ordered the column to retreat at noon.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LadysmithA&quot;/&gt; The artillery provided cover during the chaos that followed and prevented greater loss of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt; At Nicholson's Nek, to the north-west of Long Hill, the Boers took more than 1,000 prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boers enclosed Ladysmith on 2 November, beginning a [[Siege of Ladysmith|118-day siege]]. The King's, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Llewelyn Mellor, became assigned to the north-eastern defensive sector under Colonel Knox, a disciplinarian who instituted a programme of fortification development in his area.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm (1979), ''Ladysmith'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladysmith Kings&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the defences occurred mostly at night, although rain, oppressive heat, and cold limited the opportunity to rest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladysmith Kings&quot;/&gt; On 6 January, the King's mounted infantry helped repulse a Boer attempt to penetrate the southern perimeter. By late January, the scarcity of supplies had become particularly acute. Disease pervaded while the town resorted to consuming the garrison's horses and mules.&lt;ref&gt;(1902), ''The Rifle Brigade Chronicle'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinforcements began to arrive in South Africa in November under General [[Redvers Buller]]. The relief of the three besieged garrisons became the general's priority. He divided his corps and assumed personal command of the Ladysmith expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes (2003), ''The Boer War 1899–1902'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The relief effort was hindered by three successive defeats in December, termed by the British as &quot;[[Black Week]]&quot;, and further reverses in January and early February. The siege of Ladysmith ended on 28 February. The King's then gained a volunteer company and had its mounted infantry absorbed by an MI battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain eventually extended its prosecution of the war into the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal Republic]]. On 21 August, at Van Wyk's Vlei, Sergeant [[Harry Hampton|Hampton]] and Corporal [[Henry James Knight|Knight]] held their positions and evacuated wounded mounted Kingsmen under heavy fire, for which they received the Victoria Cross. Two days later, Boer forces attacked the 1st Battalion while it was at the forefront of an advance south of Dalmanutha. The protracted engagement ended when the King's were ordered to withdraw, having almost expended their ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Casualties exceeded 70, while Private [[William Edward Heaton|Heaton]] earned the Victoria Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle (1900), ''The Great Boer War'', p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nominal annexation of the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic in May and September did not resolve the war. Instead, the Boer commandos transitioned to [[guerrilla warfare]] and resisted the British until 1902. The King's concentrated in the Eastern Transvaal, where Boers under [[Louis Botha|Botha]] and Viljoen operated. Detachments occupied networks of [[blockhouse]]s and provided complements for [[armoured train]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; One such detachment was overwhelmed at Helvetia on 29 December. Situated near the [[Lydenburg]]&amp;ndash;[[Machadodorp]] railway, Helvetia was garrisoned primarily by a contingent of the King's equipped with a 4.7-in gun nicknamed &quot;Lady Roberts&quot;. The nocturnal attack, conducted in fog, yielded considerable success for the Boers with scores of prisoners taken and the gun captured. Only King's Kopje withstood the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice &amp; Grant (1910), ''History of the War in South Africa, 1899–1902'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances were controversial and a general court-martial later sentenced Major Stapleton Cotton, who ordered the surrender, to be [[Degradation Ceremony|cashiered]] and dismissed from the army. Author [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] publicly questioned the decision and contended that the wounds Major Cotton sustained merited &quot;some revision&quot; of the officer's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle (2004), ''The Great Boer War'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copley, [http://limpopomed.co.za/journal/archives/vol1no2/laffaire%20cotton.htm, limpopomed.co.za. Retrieved 25 March 2007.]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the continuation of the war in South Africa, a number of regiments containing large centres of population formed additional regular battalions. The King's (Liverpool Regiment) formed 3rd and 4th regular Battalions in February 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The War - Infantry and Militia battalions|day_of_week=Monday |date=19 February 1900 |page_number=12 |issue=36069|}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the militia battalions were relabeled as the 5th and 6th battalions. The Boer War also provided the first opportunity for the regiment's volunteer battalions to serve overseas with regular forces, supplying individual detachments and service companies. The militia battalions, numbered the 5th and 6th during the war, contrastingly deployed to South Africa intact late in the conflict. A memorial sculpted by [[William Goscombe John]] to commemorate the regiment's service in Afghanistan, Burma, and South Africa was erected in [[St John's Gardens]], Liverpool and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on 9 September 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Parkhouse, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment fielded at least 49 battalions during the [[World War I|First World War]], from a pre-war establishment of two [[Standing army|regular]], two [[militia (United Kingdom)|militia]], and six [[Territorial Force|territorial]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Batt&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp.240–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those battalions, 26 served abroad,&lt;ref name=&quot;Batt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The last surviving volunteer battalion, the 7th Isle of Man, mobilised two service companies for Salonika.&lt;/ref&gt; receiving 58 [[battle honour]]s and six [[Victoria Cross]]es for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Balkans]], [[North-West Frontier in World War I|India]], and [[Russian Civil War|Russia]]. Some 13,795 Kingsmen died during the course of the war, the battalions suffering an average of 615 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook (2000), p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands more would be wounded, sick, or taken prisoner. Of specific formations, the four [[Liverpool Pals]] battalions had nearly 2,800 casualties, while the [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th (West Lancashire) Division's]] [[165th (Liverpool) Brigade]], composed entirely of battalions from the King's, incurred 1,672 dead, 6,056 wounded, and 953 missing during the period of 3 January 1916 and 11 November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Coop (1919/2001), p.183.&lt;/ref&gt;

A vigorous [[Recruitment to the British Army during the First World War|recruiting campaign]] involving pre-war personalities such as [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] and [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] facilitated the rapid expansion of the British Army. Territorial units formed duplicate battalions from August 1914 to May 1915. To differentiate them, they were, for instance, designated the 2/5th and 3/5th battalions, respectively. Second-line battalions had been raised for home service and recruit training, but were ultimately dispatched to the Western Front and replaced by the third-line.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook (2000), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Driven by a conviction that the war would not be resolved quickly and seeking an alternative to the Territorial Army, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener appealed for an initial 100,000 volunteers to form a [[Kitchener's Army|&quot;New Army&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook (2000), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, [http://www.1914-1918.net/kitchen.htm The New Armies: &quot;Kitchener's Men&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630103310/http://www.1914-1918.net/kitchen.htm |date=30 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th Earl of Derby proposed forming a battalion of [[Pals battalion|&quot;Pals&quot;]] for the King's Regiment, to be recruited from men of the same workplace. His proposal proved successful. Within a week, thousands of Liverpudlians had volunteered for service, to eventually be formed into the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Battalions. Collectively, the battalions became known as the City of Liverpool battalions or &quot;[[Liverpool Pals]]&quot;. Lord Derby addressed recruits on 28 August:

{{cquote|This should be a battalion of Pals, a battalion in which friends from the same office will fight shoulder to shoulder for the honour of Britain and the credit of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks (1991), p. 24 [http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.165&amp;chapterId=1264 Full speech], mersey-gateway.org. Accessed 28 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mobilisation began at the onset of the war, in August 1914, at which time the 1st King's was based at [[Aldershot]]. Under command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.S. Bannatyne, the 1st King's boarded the SS ''Irrawaddy'' at [[Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp.2–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion landed at [[Le Havre]] on 13 August with the [[6th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Brigade]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], one of the original components of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF). The BEF first engaged the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] at [[Battle of Mons|Mons]], Belgium, after which it went into a retreat that was sustained until 5 September, when the Allies resolved to [[First Battle of the Marne|stand at the Marne]], a river east of Paris. Having acted as a rearguard to the 2nd Division, the 1st King's and its brigade prevented a German force cutting off the [[4th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th (Guards) Brigade]], forming the rearguard at [[Villers-Cotteréts]], and 70th Battery, [[Royal Field Artillery]]. The brigade extricated the guns, earning it praise from the 2nd Division's commanding officer, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Charles Carmichael Monro|Monro]].&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] halted the German advance in the First Battle of the Marne; the ensuing retreat, which prompted an Allied counter-offensive, ended at [[First Battle of the Aisne|the Aisne]]. After both battles had been fought, the battalion moved north to [[Ypres]], during the so-called &quot;[[Race to the Sea]]&quot;. In an action at [[Langemarck]] during the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the battalion captured the small village of Molenaarelstoek, just north-east of [[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke|Polygon Wood]]. As the battle progressed, the German command sought a decisive victory against the outnumbered BEF and launched First Ypres' last major assault on 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winston Groom|Groom, Winston]] (2003), ''A Storm in Flanders: The Ypres Salient, 1914–1918: Tragedy and Triumph on the Western Front'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, ''First Ypres, 1914'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Located to the south of Polygon Wood, the 1st King's was one of only a few units available to defend British lines. A force of &quot;12 and a half&quot; divisions, including a composite of the élite [[Prussian Guard]], attacked at 0900 along a {{convert|9|mi|km}} front extending from [[Mesen|Messines]] to Polygon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Neillands|Neillands, Robin]] (2005), ''The Old Contemptibles: The British Expeditionary Force, 1914'', pp.318–9&lt;/ref&gt; Some German units breached the front in places but quickly lost momentum and were gradually pushed back by a desperate defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poly&quot;&gt;Neillands, Robin (2005), p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussian Guard had advanced in dense formations, each guardsman effectively side-by-side and led by sword-wielding officers.&lt;ref&gt;Carew, Tim (1974), ''Wipers: First Battle of Ypres'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In the defence of Polygon Wood, the 1st King's held on and virtually destroyed the 3rd Prussian Foot Guards with concentrated rapid-fire and artillery support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p&lt;/ref&gt; By battle's end, the 1st King's casualties numbered 33 officers and 814 other ranks from an original strength of 27 officers and 991 other ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the battalion's dead was Lieutenant-Colonel Bannatyne, killed by a [[sniper]] on 24 October.&lt;ref&gt;French, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British infantry skirmish 1914.jpg|thumb|[[German Army (German Empire)|German forces]] advancing against the 4th King's on 12 June 1915.]]
By the end of March 1915, the King's had eight battalions on the Western Front. The 1st and 1/5th participated in a &quot;holding&quot; attack at [[Givenchy-en-Gohelle|Givenchy]] designed to support the Allied offensive at [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; An ineffectual preliminary bombardment failed to destroy much of the [[barbed wire]], fatally impeding the 1st King's.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The withering hail-of-fire inflicted heavy casualties on the King's, one of whom was the wounded Lieutenant-Colonel Carter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuve Chapelle&quot;&gt;Wyrall (2002, pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; A platoon under Lieutenant Miller managed to reach German lines and blockade itself in a communications trench for over an hour, under fire from Allied artillery, until withdrawing to British lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuve Chapelle&quot;/&gt; The battalion's casualties amounted to 61 killed, 115 wounded, and 62 missing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuve Chapelle&quot;/&gt;

One-month later, on 24 April, a German offensive began [[Second Battle of Ypres|Second Ypres]], which became the 4th and [[Liverpool Rifles|1/6th]] King's first major battle. In the second subsidiary action of the offensive, at [[Saint-Julien, Belgium|Saint-Julien]], the 4th King's sustained more than 400 casualties over a four-day period, the majority, some 374, while supporting the [[4th Gurkha Rifles|1/4th Gurkha Rifles]] on the 27th.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liverpool Rifles|1/6th]] supported 1st [[Cheshire Regiment|Cheshires]] in the defence of [[Battle of Hill 60 (Western Front)|Hill 60]]. After the regiment's involvement in 'Second Ypres' receded, four battalions fought at [[Battle of Festubert|Festubert]], collectively incurring in excess of 1,200 casualties. [[Lance corporal|Lance Corporal]] [[Joseph Harcourt Tombs|Tombs]] became the regiment's first Victoria Cross recipient of the war for assisting wounded soldiers during the battle. The [[Liverpool Scottish|1/10th Battalion]] fought its first battle on 16 June, in a &quot;local&quot; action at [[Battle of Bellewaarde|Bellewaarde]]. Losses for the Liverpool Scottish neared 400 killed, wounded and missing, with just two of 24 officers present surviving unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British instigated a new offensive on 25 September, at [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], to coincide with French offensives in the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Artois]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer (2005), ''Encyclopedia of World War I'', p.1247&lt;/ref&gt; The King's were represented in the offensive by eight battalions, from standard infantry to [[Combat engineering|pioneer]]s. Some 150 tons of [[Chlorine gas]] was used on the first day of the battle, discharged via thousands of cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;Mauroni, Albert J. (2003), ''Chemical and Biological Warfare: A Reference Handbook'', p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Strong winds blew the gas backwards, hindering the advance of the 1st King's and other units having to also contend with partially uncut barbed wire. The advance of the 1/9th King's also stalled, though they took about 300 Germans prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion later assisted in the repulse of a German counter-attack on 8 October. More battalions arrived before the year ended, including the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Liverpool Pals, which formed the [[89th Brigade (United Kingdom)|89th Brigade]], [[30th Division (United Kingdom)|30th Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried at the Zantvoorde British Cemetery]]

The Liverpool Pals' first battle came during &quot;The Big Push&quot; on 1 July 1916, on the [[First day on the Somme|first day]] of the [[Battle of the Somme]], the worst single day for casualties in British military history. The 89th Brigade, under the Earl of Derby's brother Brigadier F.C. Stanley,&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield, Gary (2004), ''The Somme'', p.64&lt;/ref&gt; still comprised the 17th, 19th, and 20th Pals, but had the 18th reassigned to the [[21st Brigade (United Kingdom)|21st Brigade]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks (1991), p.208.&lt;/ref&gt; The 30th Division formed part of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]], which attacked towards [[Montauban-de-Picardie|Montauban]], south of where Britain suffered the majority of its nearly 60,000 casualties on the 1st. At 07:30, the 30th Division began its advance on the left of the French [[French XX Corps|Corps de Fer]]. Meeting limited opposition, the Pals completed their objectives with comparatively minimal casualties. Grievous losses were, however, incurred by the 18th from heavy machine-gun fire during its advance towards the Glatz Redoubt. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Henry Trotter|E.H. Trotter]], killed by a shell on 8 July, intentionally underestimated the battalion's casualties of about 500 to avoid the deployment of brigade reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks (1991), p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;

More battalions entered the fray throughout the offensive. Some 14 battalions contributed to five attempts to capture the village of [[Guillemont]] between July and September.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early hours of 8 August, in the third attempt, the 1st, 1/5th, and [[Liverpool Irish|1/8th]] attacked in conditions that rendered visibility poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillemont&quot;&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp. 303–306.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st and 1/8th reached the German front-line trenches and entered the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillemont&quot;/&gt; Their situation deteriorated, however, and the 1/8th's support battalion was driven back by Germans who continued to occupy the first-line trenches. Isolated and contained by counter-attacks, the 1/8th and three companies of the 1st were surrounded and mostly captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillemont&quot;/&gt; The 1/8th had been annihilated, with losses amounting to 15 killed, 55 wounded, and 502 missing, while the 1st lost its commanding officer, Colonel Goff, and sustained 239 casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillemont&quot;/&gt; The 1st later received a draft of 20 officers and 750 men from the [[Manchester Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p.347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanting to alleviate the pressure on the French to the south and believing there might still be some holding out,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillemont2&quot;&gt;Giblin (2000), pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; high command ordered the 2nd and 55th divisions to resume the battle on the 9th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillemont&quot;/&gt; The attack failed and proved to be ill-prepared and disorganised, with an identical starting time and objectives. For his actions during the battle, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Noel Godfrey Chavasse|Chavasse]], attached to the Liverpool Scottish, gained the first of two VCs for attending to and rescuing wounded in no man's land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillemont2&quot;/&gt; The village would not be captured until the final struggle began on 3 September, by which time the 12th was the King's only contribution,&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and the regiment had more than 3,000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2004), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Somme Offensive ended in November, the Allies began to prepare for a series of combined Allied offensives in April 1917. These plans would not be significantly disrupted by the German Army's strategic withdrawal to the &quot;[[Hindenburg Line]]&quot; in northern France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindenburg&quot;&gt;Simkins (2002), ''The First World War'', p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The phased withdrawal, conducted from February to April, reduced the German front by {{convert|25|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindenburg&quot;/&gt; The regiment's six second-line battalions arrived on the Western Front with the [[57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division]] in February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;

To support the ill-fated [[Nivelle Offensive]], Britain initiated the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of the Scarpe]], in the [[Arras]] area on 9 April, which involved the regiment's 11th, 13th, and Liverpool Pals battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp.389–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th moved forward with the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]] at 0530, near [[Tilloy-les-Mofflaines]], capturing almost 500 men and completing its objectives. To the south, barbed wire obstructed the Pals with varied results. The 18th consolidated in front of the wire until relieved on the 10th, while the 19th and 20th were eventually withdrawn, having suffered heavy losses within about {{convert|100|yd|m}} of the wire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arras&quot;&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp. 393–402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks (1993), p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; Casualties for the King's during the initial phase of the Arras Offensive exceeded 700.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arras&quot;/&gt;

While the battle raged in Arras, the Allies prepared for an offensive in the north, in [[Flanders]]. &quot;Third Ypres&quot; (or [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]) became notorious for conditions that transformed the terrain of shell holes and trenches into a quagmire of mud.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow (2005), ''The Great War: An Imperial History'', p.192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/battle_passchendaele.shtml Battle of Passchendaele: 31 July – 6 November 1917], bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 13 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ten of the regiment's battalions were active in the first stage, the Battle of Pilkem Ridge (31 July – 2 August). Six belonged to the 55th Division, situated in the [[Wieltje]] sector, north of the Liverpool Pals. The territorial battalions overcame their first and second objectives, but progress was difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Ypres&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion prevailed during the 18th King's and [[Wiltshire Regiment|2nd Wiltshires]] nocturnal advance through Sanctuary Wood.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p.494.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks (1993), p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pals battalions had to consolidate in front of the 30th Division's initial objective.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks (1993), p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; The King's losses accumulated, surpassing 1,800 by the 3rd, with the supporting 1/8th's casualties the heaviest at 18 officers and 304 other ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p.508.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th's medical officer, Captain Chavasse, received a posthumous, second Victoria Cross for attending to, and recovering, wounded in spite of his own wounds and fatigue during the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Ypres&quot;/&gt; He succumbed to his wounds on 4 August.&lt;ref&gt;McGilchrist, Archibald M. (1930/2005), ''Liverpool Scottish 1900–1919'', p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

An account by Captain Wurtzburg, 2/6th Liverpool Rifles, described the conditions endured by soldiers in the Ypres area:

{{cquote|...Those who took part in it will never erase from their minds its many ghastly features, among which the mud and the multitude of dead will stand out pre-eminent. Of the former it must be said that the sodden condition of the ground, though it stopped our advance, certainly prevented many casualties from shell-fire, but at the same time many a wounded man was sucked down into the horrible quagmire and stretcher-bearers found their task in many cases beyond their powers.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p.538.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===1918===
[[File:Western front 1918 german.jpg|thumb|left|Map detailing Germany's Spring Offensive between 21 March-18 July 1918.]]
The King's contributed to the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917 and assisted in defensive actions as the new year neared.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Acute manpower shortages in the BEF on the Western Front left many divisions understrength and so it was decided to adopt a nine-battalion system through amalgamations and disbandments.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Martin (1995), ''Command or Control?: Command, Training and Tactics in the British and German Armies, 1888–1918'' p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th, 8th, 9th, and 10th King's integrated with their second-line, while hundreds of their men were distributed to other King's battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp. 607–8&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th disbanded in February, with its strength dispersed to the other Liverpool Pals.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p. 614&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] emboldened the Allies, Germany prepared for a final attempt to achieve a decisive victory before the US contingent on the Western Front surged further.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Keith (2002), ''The First World War'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March, a five-hour artillery and gas shell barrage across a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} front signified the beginning of the Battle of St. Quentin ([[Operation Michael]]) and the [[Spring Offensive]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John (1998), ''The First World War'', p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; Although roled as [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s, the 11th King's occupied frontline trenches near [[Urvillers]] when the attack began.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its companies engaged troops at Lambay Wood and [[Benay]] and the battalion's casualties for the day exceeded 160.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; The Liverpool Pals, in reserve on the 21st, hurried to the front on the 22nd to undertake localised counter-attacks, with the first and largest conducted by the 19th against the village of [[Roupy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PalsQuen&quot;&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp. 620–1&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion advanced in darkness after 0115, uncertain of German positions, but retook the original frontline trenches unopposed. They later came under sustained attack, holding out without support until Lieutenant-Colonel Peck ordered a withdrawal at about 1600. The Germans overwhelmed the survivors, capturing the wounded Peck and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Graham (1990), pp. 184–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation became dire, forcing troops to withdraw towards [[Ham]], which itself had to be evacuated.&lt;ref name=&quot;PalsQuen&quot;/&gt; The Third and Fifth Armies went into retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpringOff&quot;&gt;Gray, Randal (1991), ''Kaiserschlacht 1918'': the Final German Offensive'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st King's, occupying positions near Vélu Wood during the Battle of [[Bapaume]], came under attack on the 24th but held out until their deteriorating flanks compelled a retreat that was covered by about 30 men from its headquarters. The battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel [[David Murray-Lyon|Murray-Lyon]], had just 60 men at his command when they arrived at [[Beaulencourt]] later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp. 630–1&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March, the offensive was extended to [[Arras]], which was soon repulsed by the Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpringOff&quot;/&gt; Having lost its momemtum and suffered about 250,000 casualties, comparable to Allied losses, Germany abandoned the operation on 5 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;KeeOffe&quot;&gt;Keegan, John (1990), ''The First World War'', pp. 433–4&lt;/ref&gt; The German Army did not relent and launched Operation Georgette in Flanders on 9 April. The first-day of the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] involved the three King's battalions of the 165th Brigade, situated at [[Estaires]]. The bombardment against Allied positions began at 0410 and the subsequent infantry attack displaced Portuguese forces by 0800, exposing the left flank of the 165th. The King's repulsed the frontal assaults with heavy casualties but continued to be attacked from the flanks. Counter-attacks by the 1/7th King's and 2/5th [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] took up to 500 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall, (2002), pp. 641–3&lt;/ref&gt;

German forces made significant gains, capturing [[Armentières]]. On 11 April, British Commander-in-Chief, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]], issued his &quot;backs to the walls&quot; order of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;KeeOffe&quot;/&gt; Five days later, Private [[Jack Thomas Counter|Counter]], 1st King's, volunteered as a messenger, having witnessed five preceding runners killed. He was awarded the regiment's last Victoria Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th King's experienced heavy fighting near [[Méteren]] and by 19 April had at least 489 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall, pp. 646–7&lt;/ref&gt; Despite relentless battles, the Allies stabilised their front and Georgette was discontinued on 29 April after the Battle of the Scherpenberg. The Liverpool Pals fought in that climax, with the 17th having to withdraw with the loss of &quot;A&quot; Company, while the 18th and 19th repelled their attackers.&lt;ref&gt;Maddock (1990), pp. 190–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Army halted its offensives in July. The King's 11th Battalion disbanded in April, followed in May by the temporary consolidation of the Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 137th Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall, pp. 664–8&lt;/ref&gt; In August, after four months of being on the defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against [[Amiens]], in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them the element of surprise when it began on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer (2005), ''Enyclopaedia of World War I'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; In the following [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]], begun on the 21st, the 13th King's suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of [[Ervillers]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall, pp. 672–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The war's end in Europe came with the signing of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]]. The 9th Battalion's history illustrated the initial reaction of soldiers:
{{cquote|While on parade on the morning of the 11th November it was announced to the men that the Armistice had been signed. The news of the cessation of hostilities was received by the soldiers without any manifestation of the joy or excitement that marked the occasion at home. The parade continued and the rest of the day was spent quite as usual. The news for which the men had waited so long seemed when it came to be almost too good to be true.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Glynne Roberts (1922), [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16974 ''The Story of the 9th King's in France''], p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
On 11 December 1918, the remnants of the 1st King's marched across the German frontier &quot;at ease&quot;, bayonets fixed and their colours uncased.&lt;ref name=&quot;End&quot;&gt;Wyrall, (2000), pp. 702–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion would be based at [[Düren]] and Berg Neukirchen for about five months as part of the [[British Army of the Rhine]], joined by other battalions such as the 13th. Some, including the 25th (Reserve), served in Egypt and Belgium before the majority disbanded by late 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;End&quot;/&gt;

Hostilities did not end for the 17th King's on 11 November; the battalion had sailed for [[Murmansk]], Russia, in October as part of an Allied intervention force assembled to support the [[White movement|&quot;White&quot; forces]] in their [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[Bolshevik]]s. The battalion was moved to [[Archangelsk|Archangel]], where it was based intact for a short period. The battalion's companies served separately for the duration of their stay in Russia, until the 17th left in September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall (2002), pp.693–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Territorial Force]] was disbanded and later reformed as the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and the regiment's battalions were also reformed. However, inter-war reductions and reorganisations reduced the regiment's territorial battalions from six to just one by 1937. The [[Liverpool Irish|8th]] disbanded in the early 1920s, the 9th was absorbed by the Royal Engineers, and a restructuring of the Territorial Army's infantry in the mid-1930s converted the [[Liverpool Rifles|6th]], 7th, and [[Liverpool Scottish|10th]] to new roles.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts (1922), [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16974 The Story of the 9th King's in France], p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th were transferred to the [[Royal Engineers]] and became [[Liverpool Rifles|38th (King's) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Engineers]]. The 7th joined the [[Royal Tank Regiment]] and became the [[40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment]], and the 10th became a battalion of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1st King's===
As Britain's control of Ireland eroded in 1920 during the [[Irish War of Independence]], the 1st Battalion deployed to [[Bantry]], [[County Cork]]. The county was a ferment of Republican activity where British forces frequently subjected the movement's supporters to oppressive measures in an attempt to curtail escalating violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiIre&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 131–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other regiments operating in the county, such as the [[Essex Regiment]], the King's acquired a favourable reputation among its adversaries for their professionalism and humane treatment of prisoners—which reputedly saved the lives of some Kingsmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ireland&quot;&gt;[[Tom Barry (soldier)|Barry]] (1993), ''Guerilla Days in Ireland'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Their conduct was described by [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]], a prominent [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] leader, as &quot;exemplary in all the circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ireland&quot;/&gt; After the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in the south, the battalion moved to [[Northern Ireland]] to be stationed in [[Derry]] and [[Omagh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MiIre&quot;/&gt;

After a brief deployment to Turkey as part of the army of occupation, the battalion returned to England in 1924 and resumed overseas service in 1926 with postings to [[Malta]], [[Sudan]], and [[Egypt]]. While much of the battalion's time in Egypt was peaceful and comfortable, they occasionally dealt with [[riot]]ing, and on one occasion a company had to be deployed to [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil33&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1931, [[Greek Cypriot]]s in [[Cyprus]] uprised demanding [[Enosis|union]] with Greece. The battalion reinforced the British garrison with two companies; C Company arrived via eight [[Vickers Victoria]] air transports, followed by the sea-transported &quot;D&quot;. India was the 1st King's next posting, initially in [[Jubbulpore]]. The battalion relocated to [[Landi Kotal]], [[Khyber Pass]], in 1937. Service in the volatile [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] continued into the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/research/famous-units/kings-regiment-liverpool|title=King's Regiment (Liverpool)|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd King's===
[[File:King's Regiment battalion HQ, Star Chamber (1).JPG|thumb|King's Regiment's 2nd Battalion HQ in 1941 was in [[Star Chamber Cave]] within the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] ]]
The 2nd Battalion continued to serve in India following the Armistice and mobilised during the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War|Third Afghan War]] in 1919. Leading a &quot;Special Column&quot;, the battalion reached the [[Toba Kakar Range|Toba Plateau]], some {{convert|8000|ft|m}} high, but the war was concluded before the battalion could engage Afghan forces.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrall, (1935/2000), p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those personnel who remained after the majority demobilised in 1920 joined the [[Sudan]] garrison, where the battalion reformed. Postings to Hong Kong and [[Guangdong|Canton]] followed in 1922, then to India in 1924, and finally [[Iraq]] the next year. Stationed near [[Baghdad]], its residence lasted for two years, uneventful but with the distinction of being the last British battalion to serve there until the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil33&quot;/&gt;

Immediately after returning to England, the 2nd King's became the first battalion of the regiment to undertake [[public duties]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil33&quot;/&gt; The battalion was based in various parts of the country for nearly a decade until 1938, when it became part of the [[Gibraltar]] garrison.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperd, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
[[File:9th King's Regiment, Sussex, 1941.JPG|thumb|[[Universal Carrier]]s of the 9th King's moving through a [[Sussex]] village, 3 July 1941.]]

For the regiment, expansion was on a more modest scale than that of the [[World War I|Great War]]. Ten battalions (see [[List of battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool)]]) were formed between 1939 and 1940, including the reconstituted [[Liverpool Irish|8th (Liverpool Irish) Battalion]]. Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941: the 11th became the [[152nd Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|152nd Regiment]] in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], but continued to wear their King's Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC, as did all infantry units converted in this way,&lt;ref&gt;George Forty (1998), &quot;British Army Handbook 1939–1945&quot;, Stoud: Sutton Publishing, pp. 50–1.&lt;/ref&gt; while the 12th transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] as [[101st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick, John Bassett Moore (1969), ''Lineage book of the British Army; Mounted Corps and Infantry, 1660–1968'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1941, the regiment had three battalions (1st, 2nd, and 13th) stationed abroad with the remainder poised to defend the United Kingdom against a possible [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]]. The 1st and 13th battalions serve in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] as [[Chindits]], the 2nd in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and Greece during the [[Greek Civil War]], and the 5th and 8th in [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front of World War II]]. The 9th Battalion, formed as a duplicate of the 5th in 1939, served with the [[164th (North Lancashire) Brigade|164th Brigade]], [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th Division]], transferring to [[165th (Liverpool) Brigade|165th Brigade]] in April 1943. Of the battalions that had switched to other roles, only the [[40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment|40th RTR]] (7th King's) experienced active service. With the [[23rd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|23rd Armoured Brigade]], the 40th RTR fought in the [[North African Campaign]], where they acquired the nickname &quot;[[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Monty's]] Foxhounds&quot;, Italy, and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liverpoolremembrance.weebly.com/local-regiments.html|title=Local regiments|publisher=Liverpool And Merseyside Remembered|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy and Greece===
Having spent five years in [[Gibraltar]] with the [[1st Gibraltar Brigade]], the 2nd Battalion King's departed in December 1943 with the [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Infantry Brigade]] (previously 1st Gibraltar Brigade) to reinforce the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]] in Egypt. The battalion landed in Italy with the 4th when the division joined [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|the campaign]] in March 1944. On 11 May, the division conducted an opposed crossing of the [[Gari River]] during the final [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino]]. The 2nd King's constituted, along with the 2nd [[Somerset Light Infantry|Somersets]], the main element of [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Infantry Brigade's]] initial assault. Behind schedule by 35 minutes and thus lacking artillery support, the battalion attempted to traverse the Gari under sustained mortar and artillery fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monte Cassino&quot;&gt;Ellis, John (2003), ''Cassino: The Hollow Victory'', pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt; Many boats capsized because of the strong current with resultant losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monte Cassino&quot;/&gt; The 4th Division collectively struggled to consolidate its bridgehead and minefields and a determined German defence inflicted casualties on the 2nd King's and mortally wounded their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Garmons-Williams. Depleted and disorganised, the remnants withdrew from an untenable bridgehead on the 14th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monte Cassino&quot;/&gt; The 2nd King's by then had 72 men killed or missing and many wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (2004), ''Tug of War: The Battle for Italy 1943–45'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; After five months and four battles, Monte Cassino was captured on 18 May by the [[Polish II Corps]] and the [[Gustav Line]] broken.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Jr., Ernest F. (1993), ''Mediterranean Theater of Operations: Cassino to the Alps'', p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] captured Rome in June and the 2nd King's fought in the subsequent advance to the [[Trasimene Line]]. The King's captured [[Gioiella]] in a fierce battle that had involved the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|2/4th Hampshires]] (part of 28th Brigade),&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Ian Stanley Ord (1987), ''The Mediterranean and Middle East'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and later secured and defended [[Tuori]] against counter-attack,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Hugh C.B. (1987), ''The Battle Honours of the British and Indian Armies'', 1662–1982, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; earning the regiment a unique battle honour in the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/lancs/history/index.htm The History of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920105838/http://www.army.mod.uk/lancs/history/index.htm |date=20 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In about nine months of service, in difficult, mountainous terrain, with heavy casualties, the battalion was awarded four [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], nine [[Military Cross|MCs]], three [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCMs]], four [[Military Medal|MMs]], and six [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the recipients were Sergeant Welsby, who single-handedly secured a fortified farmhouse, and Major J. A. de V. Reynolds, for his leadership and conduct around Casa Arlotti.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy&quot;/&gt;

In December, the 4th Infantry Division was deployed to Greece to reinforce British forces embroiled in the country's [[Greek Civil War|civil war]]. Conflict in Greece between government forces and [[Communist]] partisans followed the vacuum created by the German withdrawal. The partisans ([[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]]) sought to establish themselves as the new political authority and confronted the British-supported government-in-exile when ordered to disband and disarm.&lt;ref&gt;Iatrides, John O. &amp; Wrigley, Linda (2004), ''Greece at the Crossroads: the Civil War and its Legacy'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 24 hours of being flown to [[Piraeus]] on 12 December, the 2nd King's had to engage partisans in a brief action, seizing occupied barracks at a cost of 14 casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greece&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; During a seven-week internal security employment, there were many instances of house-to-house and street fighting in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greece&quot;/&gt; By mid-January 1945, the city had been cleared of insurgents and a ceasefire agreed upon, followed by the Varkiza Agreement in February.&lt;ref&gt;Clogg, Richard (2002), ''A Concise History of Greece'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The King's remained for a year to support a tense peace until they left for [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=bau&gt;{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/infantry/king-s-regiment.html|title=King's Regiment (Liverpool)|publisher=British Army units 1945 on|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burma===
[[File:Chindit column, Operation Longcloth.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Chindit]] column crossing a river in [[Burma]].]]

The 13th Battalion, King's Regiment, was raised in October 1940 for coastal defence in England and assigned to the [[208th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]]. The battalion sailed for [[British Raj|India]] in December 1941, coinciding with [[Empire of Japan|Japan's]] entrance into the war. Intended for internal security and garrison duties, the 13th's strength contained many men categorised as old or of a medically downgraded condition with the result that few men were well trained.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; After Japan occupied Burma in 1942, the Allies formed a unit intended to penetrate deep behind Japanese lines from India. The 13th King's provided the majority of the British contingent for the &quot;[[Chindits]]&quot;, which was formally designated as the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]] and commanded by [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Orde Wingate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-10-19|publisher=Order of Battle|title=77 Brigade|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=6171&amp;Tab=Uhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organised into two groups, the Chindits' first operation (codenamed Longcloth) began on 8 February 1943. No. 2 Group, commanded by [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] S.A. Cooke, was formed from the 13th King's and divided into five independent columns, two of which (Nos 7 and 8) were commanded by majors from the battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 155. Majors Ken Gilkes and Walter 'Scotty' Scott commanded Nos 7 and 8 Columns respectively. Scott would subsequently command the 1st King's in 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; No Japanese opposition was encountered initially, allowing the Chindits to cross the Chindwin River and advance into Burma unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;(2002), ''The Second World War: Asia and the Pacific'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st Battalion also took part in a similar operation in 1944 and formed 81 and 82 Columns. As in the first expedition in 1943 the Chindits again suffered heavy casualties and fought behind the Japanese lines at [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]] and [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]]. After Orde Wingate was killed in a crash in March 1944, it was decided to break up the remaining Chindit formations and some of them were to be converted into [[Airborne forces|airborne infantry]] battalions. The 1st King's was converted to become the [[15th (King's) Parachute Battalion]] of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and joined the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th Indian Parachute Brigade]] attached to the [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Indian Airborne Division]] where it remained for the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-10-19|publisher=Order of Battle|title=77 Brigade Subordanates|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=10073&amp;Tab=Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normandy and Germany===
[[File:Infantry waiting to move off 'Queen White' Beach.jpg|thumb|A group of British infantry waiting to leave [[Sword Beach]], 6 June 1944.]]

In 1943, the 5th and 8th King's (Liverpool Irish) received specialist training at [[Ayrshire]] in preparation for a planned [[invasion of Normandy|invasion of France]]. They had been selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th [[Beach Group]]s, which would have the objectives of maintaining beach organisation, securing positions, and providing defence against counter-attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilD&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

As invasion neared in mid-1944, the two battalions moved from their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard [[troopship]]s and [[landing ship tank]]s. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the ''Ulster Monarch'', a passenger ship that had served on the [[Belfast]]-Liverpool line before the war.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons (2004), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Having been delayed, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. Both King's battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] with the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd British Infantry Division]] and the Liverpool Irish at [[Juno Beach|Juno]] with the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Granatstein, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Two companies of the Liverpool Irish landed in the assault wave with the [[Royal Winnipeg Rifles]]. Under intense machine gun and mortar fire, the landing of Major Max Morrison's &quot;A&quot; Company proceeded well, allowing some to establish a command-post upon reaching the sand dunes. In contrast, in &quot;B&quot; Company's sector, the late arrival of the reconnaissance party and [[DD tank]]s exposed the landing infantry to heavy machine gun fire. The company's officer commanding, Major O'Brien, and the second-in-command were among those wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons (2004), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; At Sword, as the 3rd Division moved inland, the 5th King's attempted to neutralise hostile positions and snipers. Casualties included Lieutenant-Colonel D. H. V. Board, killed by a sniper, and the OC of 9 Platoon, Lieutenant Scarfe, mortally wounded in an attack on a German position that captured 16 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilD&quot;/&gt;

Under fire, the beach groups collected the wounded and dead, located and marked [[minefield]]s, attempted to maintain organisation, and directed vehicles and troops inland.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilD&quot;/&gt; The two battalions operated with the beach groups for a further six weeks. While the depleted Liverpool Irish disbanded in August, much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements,&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; the 5th King's survived as a reduced cadre. Disbandment had only been avoided through the determination of Lieutenant Colonel G.D. Wreford-Brown, who argued that the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit active in the Territorial Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;5 King's/No 2 T Force&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060728141301/http://www.army.mod.uk/kings/the_association/5_kings_2_t_force.htm 5 King's/No 2 T Force (Archive)], army.mod.uk. Retrieved 13 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Allies advanced into Nazi Germany in February 1945, the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) began to form dedicated units to secure important objectives—equipment, installations, intelligence, and personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;5 King's/No 2 T Force&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/Occ-GY/ch17.htm| chapter = Chapter XVII Zone and Sector| last = Ziemke| first = Early F.| title =The U.S. Army in the Occupation of Germany 1944–1946| page = 313 | publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] | id = CMH Pub 30-6| year = 1990| origyear = 1975| location = Washington, D.C.| series = American Historical Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th King's provided the nucleus for No. 2 [[T-Force|T (Target) Force]]. Elements of the 5th reached the naval port of [[Kiel]] in May 1945, securing the [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'']] and taking 7,000 sailors prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion continued to conduct intelligence operations until disbandment in July 1946 during the demoblisation process. Reconstitution into the Territorial Army followed in 1947 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby|Edward Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Second World War (1945–1958)==

The 1st King's, still roled as [[15th (King's) Parachute Battalion]], remained in India with responsibility for the area around [[Meerut]], north-east of [[New Delhi]]. After reconverting to standard infantry, the battalion departed for Liverpool in late 1947. In April 1948, the 2nd King's deployed to the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] for two weeks. The battalion carried out internal security duties in the prelude to [[Israel]]'s establishment for two weeks before its return to Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; When the army reduced its strength, the 2nd King's chose to be absorbed by the 1st rather than have its lineage terminated. On 6 September 1948, the two battalions amalgamated in a ceremonial parade attended by honorary Colonel of the Regiment, Major-General [[Alfred Dudley Ward|Dudley Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was posted to [[West Germany]] shortly afterwards and moved to [[West Berlin]] in February 1951.&lt;ref name=bau/&gt;

===Korean War===
[[File:King's Regiment group, Korea 1952.jpg|thumb|Men of &quot;A&quot; Company constructing a [[bunker]] while on the frontline, December 1952.]]

The battalion was ordered to Korea in June 1952. By then, the [[Korean War]] had entered a period of stalemate, with [[trench warfare]] prevailing.&lt;ref&gt;''The Korean War: An Encyclopedia'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; At Liverpool, the King's embarked aboard the troopship ''Devonshire'' for Hong Kong, where it underwent training before landing at [[Pusan]], Korea, in September. Replacing the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment|1st Royal Norfolk Regiment]] in the [[British 29th Infantry Brigade|29th Infantry Brigade]], [[1st Commonwealth Division]],&lt;ref&gt;McInnes, Colin (1996), ''Hot War, Cold War: The British Army's Way in Warfare, 1945–95'', p.191&lt;/ref&gt; the 1st King's took up defensive positions on moving to the frontline, about {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrival&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp.189–90&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the battalion's time at the front proved uneventful, its night patrols often clashed with Chinese troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrival&quot;/&gt; In 1953, the battalion withdrew to reserve for three months. A tactically important feature known as [[Battle for the Hook|&quot;The Hook&quot;]], a crescent shaped ridge, was the scene of intense fighting between Commonwealth forces and the Chinese in May. On the night of 20 May, Chinese forces commenced a sustained bombardment of the Hook, defended by the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]]. Two days later, a company from the King's conducted a nighttime diversionary raid on Chinese positions known as &quot;Pheasant&quot;. During the raid, Second-Lieutenant Caws' 5 Platoon, intended to execute the actual attack, inadvertently stumbled upon an uncharted [[land mine|minefield]], suffering 10 wounded from a strength of 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korea&quot;&gt;Mileham (2000), pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack had to be abandoned, forcing the company to withdraw with its wounded back to British lines under the protection of artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (1974), ''Fortune Favours the Brave&amp;nbsp;— the Battle of the Hook, Korea, 1953'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King's Regiment, Korea 1952.jpg|thumb|A Kingsman cleaning his [[Browning Model 1919 machine gun|.30 cal Browning]] machine gun in a trench, 2 December 1952.]]
The King's moved to the right sector of the Hook on 27 May, excepting &quot;D&quot; Company's 10 Platoon and &quot;B&quot; Company (as reserve), which became attached to the Dukes. At 1953 hours, on 28 May, the battle began when a heavy artillery barrage targeted the Dukes' positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korea&quot;/&gt; Within minutes, the first of four successive Chinese waves attacked. Two King's platoons had to be moved forward to reinforce the Point 121 position, which soon after came under attack by two infantry companies. After the attack was repulsed with the assistance of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[artillery]], the Chinese directed their attention to the King's on Point 146. As their troops assembled at Pheasant at around 2305, 1st King's Lieutenant-Colonel A.J. Snodgrass called in artillery, [[Centurion tank]], and machine-gun fire that effectively destroyed the battalion-sized formation.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston, Peter (1976), ''Thirty-Eighth Parallel: The British in Korea'', p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting continued until the British cleared the remaining troops from the Hook at approximately 0330. British casualties numbered 149, including 28 killed, while Chinese losses were estimated to be 250 killed and 800 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Jaques, Tony (2007), ''Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O'', p.455&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st King's left Korea for Hong Kong in October, by which time the battalion had suffered 28 dead and 200 wounded. Of some 1,500 men that served with the King's in Korea, 350 were regular soldiers, the rest being conscripts on [[national service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Korea&quot;/&gt; The King's moved to Britain in 1955, were posted to West Germany the following year, and made its final return home in May 1958.&lt;ref name=bau/&gt;

===Amalgamation===

The [[1957 Defence White Paper]] (known as the &quot;Sandys Review&quot; after Secretary of State for War [[Duncan Sandys]]) announced the government's intention to reduce the army's overseas responsibilities and abolish national service.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2003), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Regiments and other units were rationalised through amalgamation or disbandment. The decision to merge the King's and Manchesters dismayed many serving and retired personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Mileham (2000), p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; The regiments did, however, share an historical connection through the [[63rd Regiment of Foot|63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot]], constituted as the 8th Foot's second battalion in 1756 and redesignated the 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=24992|startpage=3300|endpage=3301|date=1 July 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, at [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], the colours of the two regiments were paraded for the last time in the presence of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother]]. The [[King's Regiment|King's Regiment (Manchester and Liverpool)]] formally came into being on 1 September 1958. On 1 July 2006, the successor regiment amalgamated, joining with two others to form the [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korbr.co.uk/KORBR/z1%20future%20of%20KORBR%201.htm |title=Duke of Lancaster's Regiment |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving territorial battalion of the King's (Liverpool), the 5th, retained its identity until reduced to &quot;B&quot; Company, [[Lancastrian Volunteers]] in 1967.
