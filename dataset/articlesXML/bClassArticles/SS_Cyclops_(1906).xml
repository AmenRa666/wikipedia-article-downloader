'''SS ''Cyclops''''' was a British cargo [[steamship]] of Alfred Holt and Company ([[Blue Funnel Line]]). She was built in Glasgow in 1906, served in both the First and Second World Wars and survived two German submarine attacks in 1917. A German submarine sank her in January 1942 off the coast of [[Nova Scotia]], killing 87 of the men aboard her. This was the first attack of the [[Kriegsmarine]]'s [[Second Happy Time|''Unternehmen Paukenschlag'' (&quot;Operation Drumbeat&quot;)]] to destroy Allied merchant shipping in the Western Atlantic.&lt;ref name=U1243 /&gt;

This ''Cyclops'' was the second of four Alfred Holt ships to bear the name. The first was a two-masted sail and steamship built in 1880, transferred in 1894 to Alfred Holt's [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[joint venture]] Nederlandsche Stoomvaart Maatschappij Oceaan and sold in 1902 to [[Uruguay]]an buyers who renamed her ''Iberia''. The third was a motor ship built in 1948, renamed ''Automedon'' in 1975 and scrapped in 1977. The fourth was built in 1975, sold to [[Greece|Greek]] buyers in 1983 and renamed ''Procyon''.&lt;ref name=Swiggum&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/bluefunnel.shtml |title=Blue Funnel Line |last1=Swiggum |first1=Susan |last2=Kohli |first2=Marjorie |work=The Ships List |publisher=Susan Swiggum &amp; Stephen Morse |date=17 October 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building and equipment==
[[D. and W. Henderson and Company|D&amp;W Henderson &amp; Co]] of Glasgow built ''Cyclops'' in 1906 for [[Blue Funnel Line|Ocean Steam Ship Co]], Alfred Holt's ship-owning company. She had twin [[Propeller|screws]], each powered by its own three-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engine]]. Between them the two engines developed 585 [[Horsepower#Nominal horsepower|nhp]]&lt;ref name=LR30&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=33b0234.pdf |year=1930 |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamships and Motor Ships |location=London |publisher=[[Lloyd's Register]] |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the ship a speed of {{convert|13.5|kn|km/h|0}}.

''Cyclops'' had been equipped with wireless by 1930&lt;ref name=LR30/&gt; and wireless [[direction finding]] by 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=33b0234.pdf |year=1933 |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamships and Motor Ships |location=London |publisher=[[Lloyd's Register]] |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War service==
On 11 February 1917 the [[German Type UB III submarine]] {{SMU|U-60}} unsuccessfully chased ''Cyclops'' southwest of Ireland. On 11 April that year west of the [[Isles of Scilly]] ''Cyclops'' evaded a torpedo fired by another Type UB III submarine, {{SMU|U-55}}.&lt;ref name=U1243&gt;{{cite web

==Second World War service==
''Cyclops'' had a speed of {{convert|13.5|kn|km/h|0}}, and when the UK entered the Second World War in 1939 she was 33 years old. Nevertheless, she made most of her wartime voyages unescorted, and seldom had the protection of a [[Convoy#World War II|convoy]].

In September 1939 ''Cyclops'' was in the [[Far East]]. She called at [[Port of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Port of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Ho Chi Min City|Saigon]] before reaching [[Port of Singapore|Singapore]] on 1 October. She left on 23 October, called at [[Penang]] in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and then crossed the [[Indian Ocean]] ''via'' [[Colombo Harbour|Colombo]] in [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] to [[Suez]].&lt;ref name=Hague&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=CYCLOPS~armain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Cyclops |work=Ship Movements |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She passed through the [[Suez Canal]] to [[Port Said]], where she joined [[List of Allied convoy codes during World War II#H|Convoy HG]] 9. This left on 19 November and reached [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool]] on 8 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/hg/index.html?hg.php?convoy=9!~hgmain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Convoy HG.9 |work=HG Convoy Series |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cyclops'' spent Christmas 1939 in Liverpool and left port on 30 December. She reached [[Port of Southampton|Southampton]] on New Year's Day 1940 and then made two round trips across the [[English Channel]] to [[Port of Le Havre|Le Havre]] and back. Her movements, if any, for the next six weeks are unrecorded. ''Cyclops'' left Southampton on 9 March and reached the [[Firth of Clyde]] three days later. She left the Clyde on 25 March and reached [[the Downs]] [[roadstead]] in the [[North Sea]] by 31 March.&lt;ref name=Hague/&gt;

In April and May 1940 ''Cyclops'' took part in the Franco-British [[Norwegian Campaign]]. She left Leith with [[List of Allied convoy codes during World War II#N|Convoy NM]] 1 on 15 April, reached [[Scapa Flow]] the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/misc/index.html?yy.php?convoy=NM.1!~miscmain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Convoy NM.1 |work=Shorter Convoy Series |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then continued to [[Narvik]] where she arrived on 24 April. Three days later she left, reached Le Havre on 1 May and then returned to northern Norway. On 18 May she left [[Harstad]] under naval escort, reaching the Firth of Clyde five days later.&lt;ref name=Hague/&gt;

In June 1940 ''Cyclops'' took part in [[Operation Ariel]], the evacuation of Allied forces from western France. She left the Clyde on 7 June, called at [[HMNB Devonport|Plymouth]] 8–13 June, reached [[Brest, France|Brest]] in [[Brittany]] the next day and on 16 June returned to Plymouth. On 21 June she left [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and four days later she sailed from [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] in southwest France, reaching [[Cardiff Docks|Cardiff]] on 29 June.&lt;ref name=Hague/&gt;

After calls at [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Milford Haven]], ''Cyclops'' returned to deep ocean service. She left Milford Haven on 19 July, joining Convoy OB 186 which then dispersed in the North Atlantic on 22 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/ob2/index.html?ob.php?convoy=186!~obmain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Convoy OB.186 |work=OB Convoy Series |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called at [[Port of Durban|Durban]] 22–31 August and [[Colony of Aden|Aden]] 14–19 September. There she joined [[List of Allied convoy codes during World War II#B|Convoy BN]] 5, which was ''en route'' from [[Mumbai Harbour|Bombay]] to Suez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/bn/index.html?bn.php?convoy=5!~bnmain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Convoy BN.5 |work=BN Convoy Series |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She passed through the Suez Canal, called at Port Said, and reached [[Alexandria Port|Alexandria]] on 30 September. She left Alexandria on 19 October, called at [[Port of Haifa|Haifa]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] and got back to Alexandria on 25 October.&lt;ref name=Hague/&gt;

''Cyclops'' left Alexandria on 6 November 1940, passed through the Suez Canal and reached [[Port Sudan]] on 15 November. Shere she joined Convoy BS 8B, which left port on 18 November and dispersed off Aden three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/misc/index.html?yy.php?convoy=BS.8B!~miscmain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Convoy BS.8B |work=Shorter Convoy Series |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called at [[Kilindini Harbour|Mombasa]] in [[Kenya Colony in World War II|Kenya]] from 29 November to 1 December, Durban 9–21 December and [[Port of Cape Town|Cape Town]] from Christmas Day to 28 December. She spent New Year's Day 1941 at sea, reaching [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]] on 12 January.&lt;ref name=Hague/&gt; There she joined [[List of Allied convoy codes during World War II#S|Convoy SL]] 63, which left Freetown on 20 January and reached Liverpool on 9 February. ''Cyclops''{{'}} cargo on this voyage was [[cotton]]seed [[Press cake|cake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/sl2/index.html?sl.php?convoy=63!~slmain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Convoy SL.63 |work=SL/MKS Convoy Series |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 1941 ''Cyclops'' left Liverpool with Convoy OB 209, which dispersed in the North Atlantic on 19 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/ob2/index.html?ob.php?convoy=309!~obmain |last=Hague |first=Arnold |title=Convoy OB.309 |work=OB Convoy Series |publisher=Don Kindell, ConvoyWeb |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called at Cape Town on 17–24 May, Durban from 28 May to 2 June and Aden on 15 June before reaching Suez on 21 June. She passed through the Suez Canal, left Port Said on 9 July and was in Alexandria 10–18 July before returning to Port Said. She entered the canal again on 19 July, called at Aden from 28 July to 6 August and sailed to the Far East, where [[Pacific War#Tensions between Japan and the West|tensions between Japan and the West]] were building up towards the [[Pacific War]]. She was in Singapore 20–22 August, Hong Kong from 29 August to 3 October, and Singapore again 9–22 October.&lt;ref name=Hague/&gt;

''Cyclops'' then sailed to [[Australasia]]. She was in [[Fremantle Harbour|Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]] 2–10 November 1941 and then crossed the [[Tasman Sea]] to New Zealand. On 1 December she left [[Ports of Auckland|Auckland]] for home, spending Christmas 1941 crossing the [[Pacific Ocean]] and reaching [[Balboa, Panama]] on 29 December. She spent New Year's Day 1942 in [[Panama]], passed through the [[Panama Canal]] and on 2 January left [[Cristóbal, Colón]]&lt;ref name=Hague/&gt; for [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] with the intention of joining an eastbound [[HX convoys|HX-series convoy]] to Liverpool.

==Loss==
''Cyclops''{{'}} [[Ship's company|complement]], including her [[Sea captain|Master]], Leslie Webber Kersley, was 96 officers and men plus seven [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship|DEMS]] gunners. She was also carrying another 78 Chinese sailors as passengers to join other merchant ships at Halifax or in the UK. At least one of the passengers was the survivor of a previous sinking.&lt;ref name=U1243/&gt;

After nightfall 11 January 1942 about {{convert|125|nmi|km}} southeast of [[Cape Sable Island|Cape Sable]], Nova Scotia the [[German Type IXB submarine]] {{GS|U-123|1940|2}} fired a [[G7a torpedo]] at ''Cyclops'' at close range, hitting her [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side abreast of her Nos 6 and 7 holds.&lt;ref name=U1243/&gt; After settling by the stern she stayed afloat, but Captain Kersley's damage assessment was that she could not be saved. Ordering the ship to be abandoned, Kersley also ensured that the radio officer had both sent a [[distress signal]] and received an acknowledgement from a shore radio station.&lt;ref name=Slader&gt;{{harvnb|Slader|1988|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''Cyclops''{{'}} [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] were launched and got clear, Kersley and some of his officers remained aboard to ensure that everyone who was still alive had left. 29 minutes after the first attack ''U-123'' fired a second torpedo from one of her stern tubes, which hit ''Cyclops''{{'}} [[Port and starboard|port]] side.&lt;ref name=U1243/&gt; The ship immediately started to break up and sank within five minutes. Some of those remaining aboard managed to reach a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)#Liferaft versus lifeboat|liferaft]] that the [[Chief mate|Chief Officer]] had released only minutes before.&lt;ref name=Slader/&gt;

The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Bangor|minesweeper}} {{HMCS|Red Deer|J255|6}} rescued Captain Kersley, 55 crew, six DEMS gunners and 33 passengers and landed them at Halifax. 40 crew, 46 passengers and one gunner had been killed;&lt;ref name=U1243/&gt; some by the explosion and sinking; others by [[Hypothermia|exposure]] in the cold water.&lt;ref name=Slader/&gt; One of ''Cyclops''{{'}} survivors, [[Midshipman]] Desmond Stewart, was awarded [[Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/30/a8649930.shtml |last=de Neumann |first=Bernard |title=Lloyd’s War Medal for Bravery at Sea (Part Two) |work=WW2 People's War |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=19 January 2006 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successor ships==
''Cyclops'' was one of at least 30 ships that Alfred Holt lost in the Second World War. After the [[German surrender at Lüneburg Heath|German]] and [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese]] [[unconditional surrender]]s in 1945 the company started to restore its fleet. In 1948 [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] of [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]] completed a new ''Cyclops'' that was a {{GRT|7632}} [[motor ship]]. In July 1975 she was renamed ''Automedon'' and in December she was transferred to [[Elder Dempster Lines]]. She was scrapped in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.red-duster.co.uk/BLUEFUN16.htm |title=Alfred Holt &amp; Co the Blue Funnel Line (page 16) |publisher=Merchant Navy Association |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for renaming the 1948 ship was to release the ''Cyclops'' name for a new {{GRT|32576|link=off}} [[Oil tanker|product carrier]] that [[Van der Giessen de Noord]] of [[Krimpen aan den IJssel]] built for Alfred Holt in 1975. This ship was in the fleet until 1983 when she was sold to [[Greece|Greek]] buyers and renamed ''Procyon''. She was subsequently renamed ''Nova Europa'' and then ''Demos'', latterly registered in [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.red-duster.co.uk/BLUEFUN20.htm |title=Alfred Holt &amp; Co the Blue Funnel Line (page 21) |publisher=Merchant Navy Association |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
