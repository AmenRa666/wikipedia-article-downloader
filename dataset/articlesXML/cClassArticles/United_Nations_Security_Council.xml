The '''United Nations Security Council''' ('''UNSC''') is one of the [[United Nations#Structure|six principal organs]] of the [[United Nations]], charged with the maintenance of [[international security|international peace and security]] as well as accepting new members to the United Nations and approving any changes to its [[United Nations Charter]]. Its powers include the establishment of [[peacekeeping]] operations, the establishment of [[international sanctions]], and the authorization of [[war|military action]] through [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolution]]s; it is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions to member states. The Security Council held its first session on 17 January 1946.

Like the UN as a whole, the Security Council was created following [[World War II]] to address the failings of a previous international organization, the [[League of Nations]], in maintaining world peace. In its early decades, the body was largely paralyzed by the [[Cold War]] division between the US and USSR and their respective allies, though it authorized interventions in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Congo Crisis]] and peacekeeping missions in the [[Suez Crisis]], [[Cyprus]], and [[West New Guinea]]. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale, and the Security Council authorized major military and peacekeeping missions in [[Gulf War|Kuwait]], [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group|Namibia]], [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[United Nations Protection Force|Bosnia]], [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|Somalia]], [[War in Darfur|Sudan]], and [[Kivu conflict|the Democratic Republic of Congo]].

The Security Council consists of fifteen members. The [[great power]]s that were the [[Allies of World War II|victors of World War II]]— the [[Soviet Union]] (now represented by [[Russia]]), the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (now represented by the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), and the [[United States]]—serve as the body's five permanent members. These permanent members can [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] any substantive Security Council resolution, including those on the admission of new member states or candidates for Secretary-General. The Security Council also has 10 non-permanent members, elected on a regional basis to serve two-year terms. The body's [[President of the United Nations Security Council|presidency]] rotates monthly among its members.  Critics of the council often describe it as an undemocratic international body, and argue it fails its principal task, mainly because of the veto power of the permanent members.

Security Council resolutions are typically enforced by [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeepers]], military forces voluntarily provided by member states and funded independently of the main UN budget. As of 2016, 103,510 peacekeeping soldiers and 16,471 civilians are deployed on 16 peacekeeping operations and 1 special political mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/factsheet.shtml|title=Peacekeeping Fact Sheet|date=30 April 2016|publisher=United Nations|access-date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluations of the Security Council's effectiveness are mixed, and calls for its reform predate the body's first meeting; however, little consensus exists on how its structure should be changed.

== History ==

=== Background and creation ===
In the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=5}} Following the catastrophic loss of life in [[World War I]], the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] established the [[League of Nations]] to maintain harmony between the nations.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=8}} This organization successfully resolved some territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such as postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be absorbed into the UN.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=10}} However, the League lacked representation for colonial peoples (then half the world's population) and significant participation from several major powers, including the US, USSR, Germany, and Japan; it failed to act against the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]], the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1935, the 1937 [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]], and German expansions under [[Adolf Hitler]] that culminated in [[World War II]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=13–24}}

[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&amp;W).jpg|thumb|British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and Soviet General Secretary [[Joseph Stalin]] at the [[Yalta Conference]], February 1945]]
The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] in 1939.{{sfn|Hoopes|Brinkley|2000|pp=1–55}} Roosevelt first coined the term ''United Nations'' to describe the [[Allies of World War II|Allied countries]].&quot;On New Year’s Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, [[Maxim Litvinov]], of the USSR, and [[T. V. Soong]], of China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/declaration.shtml|title=Declaration by United Nations|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''United Nations'' was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration. By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed.{{sfn|Osmańczyk|2004|p=2445}}  
&quot;[[Four Policemen]]&quot; was coined to refer to the four major Allied countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China, which was emerged in Declaration by United Nations&lt;ref name=&quot;sheriff&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Urquhart|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Urquhart|title=Looking for the Sheriff|publisher=New York Review of Books, July 16, 1998|accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the foundation of an executive branch of the United Nations, the Security Council.{{sfn|Gaddis|2000}}

In mid-1944, the delegations from the Allied &quot;[[Four Policemen|Big Four]]&quot;, the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[United States|US]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], met for the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] in Washington, D.C. to negotiate the UN's structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|year =1944| title =Video: Allies Study Post-War Security Etc. (1944)|url =https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39024| publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]]| accessdate =November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the composition of the UN Security Council quickly became the dominant issue. France, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], the Soviet Union, the UK, and US were selected as permanent members of the Security Council; the US attempted to add Brazil as a sixth member, but was opposed by the heads of the Soviet and British delegations.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|p=9}} The most contentious issue at Dumbarton and in successive talks proved to be the veto rights of permanent members. The Soviet delegation argued that each nation should have an absolute veto that could block matters from even being discussed, while the British argued that nations should not be able to veto resolutions on disputes to which they were a party. At the [[Yalta Conference]] of February 1945, the American, British, and Russian delegations agreed that each of the &quot;Big Five&quot; could veto any action by the council, but not procedural resolutions, meaning that the permanent members could not prevent debate on a resolution.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=10–13}}

On 25 April 1945, the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|UN Conference on International Organization]] began in San Francisco, attended by 50&amp;nbsp;governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name=unmilestones&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/aboutun/milestones.htm |title=Milestones in United Nations History |publisher=Department of Public Information, United Nations |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conference, [[H. V. Evatt]] of the Australian delegation pushed to further restrict the veto power of Security Council permanent members.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2003|p=196}} Due to the fear that rejecting the strong veto would cause the conference's failure, his proposal was defeated twenty votes to ten.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=18–19}}

The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five then-permanent members of the Security Council and by a majority of the other 46 signatories.&lt;ref name=unmilestones /&gt; On 17 January 1946, the Security Council met for the first time at [[Church House, Westminster]], in London, United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/sc/about/ |title=What is the Security Council? |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Church House Westminister London 2016 (02).JPG|thumb|200px|[[Church House, Westminster|Church House]] in [[London]] where the first Security Council Meeting took place on 17 January 1946]]

=== Cold War ===
The Security Council was largely paralysed in its early decades by the [[Cold War]] between the US and USSR and their allies, and the Council generally was only able to intervene in unrelated conflicts.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|p=35}} (A notable exception was the 1950 Security Council resolution authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the [[Korean War|North Korean invasion of South Korea]], passed in the absence of the USSR.)&lt;ref name=unmilestones /&gt;{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=58–59}} In 1956, the [[United Nations Emergency Force|first UN peacekeeping force]] was established to end the [[Suez Crisis]];&lt;ref name=unmilestones /&gt; however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|that country's revolution]].{{sfn|Meisler|1995|p=114}} Cold War divisions also paralysed the Security Council's [[Military Staff Committee]], which had been formed by Articles 45–47 of the UN Charter to oversee UN forces and create UN military bases. The committee continued to exist on paper but largely abandoned its work in the mid-1950s.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=38, 55–56}}&lt;ref name=Chapter7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter VII: Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the UN deployed the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to restore order to the breakaway [[State of Katanga]], restoring it to the control of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] by 1964.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=115–134}} However, the Security Council found itself bypassed in favour of direct negotiations between the superpowers in some of the decade's larger conflicts, such as the [[Cuban missile crisis]] or the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=61–62}} Focusing instead on smaller conflicts without an immediate Cold War connection, the Security Council deployed the [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] in [[West New Guinea]] in 1962 and the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] in 1964, the latter of which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=156–157}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=59}}

On 25 October 1971, over US opposition but with the support of many [[Third World]] nations, the mainland, communist [[China|People's Republic of China]] was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=195–197}} With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the [[Six-Day War|Middle East]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Kashmir]], the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its budget for peacekeeping.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=167–168, 224–225}}

=== Post-Cold War ===
[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|[[US Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] holds a model vial of [[anthrax]] while giving a presentation to the Security Council in February 2003.]]
After the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions in ten years' time than it had in its previous four decades.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|p=286}} Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasulo|2004|p=43}}; {{harvnb|Meisler|1995|p=334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN negotiated an end to the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], launched a successful [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group|peacekeeping mission in Namibia]], and oversaw democratic elections in post-[[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] South Africa and post-[[Khmer Rouge]] Cambodia.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=252–256}}{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=252–256}} In 1991, the Security Council demonstrated its renewed vigor by condemning the Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] on the same day of the attack, and later authorizing a [[Gulf War|US-led coalition]] that successfully repulsed the Iraqis.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=264–277}} Undersecretary-General [[Brian Urquhart]] later described the hopes raised by these successes as a &quot;false renaissance&quot; for the organization, given the more troubled missions that followed.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|p=334}}

Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another, in the early 1990s, the UN faced a number of simultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=66–67}} The [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|UN mission in Somalia]] was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]], and the [[United Nations Protection Force|UN mission to Bosnia]] faced &quot;worldwide ridicule&quot; for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;For quotation &quot;worldwide ridicule&quot;, see {{harvnb|Meisler|1995|p=293}}; for description of UN missions in Somalia and Bosnia, see {{harvnb|Meisler|1995|pp=312–329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] failed to intervene in the [[Rwandan Genocide]] in the face of Security Council indecision.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=104}}

In the late 1990s, UN-authorised international interventions took a wider variety of forms. The [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UN mission]] in the 1991–2002 [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] was supplemented by British [[Royal Marines]], and the UN-authorised [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] was overseen by [[NATO]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=110–111}} In 2003, the US [[Iraq War|invaded Iraq]] despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization's effectiveness.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=111}} In the same decade, the Security Council intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the [[War in Darfur]] in Sudan and the [[Kivu conflict]] in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2013, [[Secretary-General's Internal Review Panel on United Nations Action in Sri Lanka|an internal review]] of UN actions in [[Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War|the final battles]] of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered &quot;systemic failure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/un-failed-during-final-days-of-lankan-ethnic-war-ban-ki-moon-1133061.html |title=UN failed during final days of Lankan ethnic war: Ban Ki-moon |agency=Press Trust of India |date=25 September 2013 |work=FirstPost |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November/December 2014, [[Egypt]] presented a motion proposing an expansion of the NPT ([[non-Proliferation Treaty]]), to include [[Israel]] and [[Iran]]; this proposal was due to increasing hostilities and destruction in the Middle-East connected to the Syrian Conflict as well as others. All members of the Security Council are signatory to the NPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPTtext.shtml|title=UNODA - Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role ==
{{UNSCR}}
The UN's role in international [[collective security]] is defined by the UN Charter, which authorizes the Security Council to investigate any situation threatening international peace; recommend procedures for peaceful resolution of a dispute; call upon other member nations to completely or partially interrupt economic relations as well as sea, air, postal, and radio communications, or to sever diplomatic relations; and enforce its decisions militarily, or by any means necessary. The Security Council also recommends the new Secretary-General to the General Assembly and recommends new states for admission as [[member states of the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter II: Membership |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter5.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter V: The Security Council |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council has traditionally interpreted its mandate as covering only military security, though US Ambassador [[Richard Holbrooke]] controversially persuaded the body to pass a resolution on [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]] in 2000.{{sfn|Fasulo|2004|p=46}}

Under [[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VI]] of the Charter, &quot;Pacific Settlement of Disputes&quot;, the Security Council &quot;may investigate any dispute, or any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute&quot;. The Council may &quot;recommend appropriate procedures or methods of adjustment&quot; if it determines that the situation might endanger international peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter6.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter VI: Pacific Settlement of Disputes |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations are generally considered to not be binding, as they lack an enforcement mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Fomerand|2009|p=287}}; {{harvnb|Hillier|1998|p=568}}; {{harvnb|Köchler|2001|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Matthews|1993|p=130}}; {{harvnb|Neuhold|2001|p=66}}. For lack of enforcement mechanism, see {{harvnb|Magliveras|1999|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of scholars, such as [[Stephen Zunes]], have argued that resolutions made under Chapter VI are &quot;still directives by the Security Council and differ only in that they do not have the same stringent enforcement options, such as the use of military force&quot;.{{sfn|Zunes|2004|p=291}}

Under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]], the Council has broader power to decide what measures are to be taken in situations involving &quot;threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, or acts of aggression&quot;.&lt;ref name=Chapter7/&gt; In such situations, the Council is not limited to recommendations but may take action, including the use of armed force &quot;to maintain or restore international peace and security&quot;.&lt;ref name=Chapter7/&gt; This was the legal basis for UN armed action in Korea in 1950 during the Korean War and the use of coalition forces in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991 and Libya in 2011.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=56–57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm |title=Security Council Approves 'No-Fly Zone' Over Libya, Authorizing 'All Necessary Measures' to Protect Civilians, by Vote of 10 in Favour with 5 Abasentions |date=17 March 2011 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions taken under Chapter VII, such as [[economic sanctions]], are binding on UN members; the Security Council is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions.{{sfn|Fomerand|2009|p=287}}{{sfn|Fasulo|2004|p=39}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]] recognizes that the Security Council has authority to refer cases to the Court in which the Court could not otherwise exercise jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Article 13] of the Rome Statute.

However, as discussed in the section below on criticism, there is a large and growing gap between the general declarations made in the UN Security Council and the inaction in the realm of conflict prevention and resolution. The conflicts in Sri Lanka, the Congo, Syria, Iraq, and Libya are examples of costly failures, while the highly disproportionate emphasis on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which reflects the power of the Arab and Islamic blocs adds to the problematic nature of the organization. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tower of Babble: How the United Nations Has Fueled Global Chaos|last=Gold|first=Dore|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the UN's founding in 1945, the five permanent members of the Security Council were the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], the [[French Fourth Republic|French Republic]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. There have been two major seat changes since then. [[China and the United Nations|China's seat]] was originally held by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Nationalist Government]], the Republic of China. However, the Nationalists were forced to retreat to the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] in 1949, during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The Communist government assumed control of [[mainland China]], henceforth known as the People's Republic of China. In 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]] recognized the People's Republic as the rightful representative of China in the UN and gave it the seat on the Security Council that had been held by the Republic of China, which was expelled from the UN altogether with no opportunity of membership as a separate nation.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=195–197}} After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Russian Federation was recognized as the [[succession of states|legal successor state]] of the Soviet Union and maintained the latter's position on the Security Council.{{sfn|Blum|1992}} Additionally, France reformed its government into the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958, under the leadership of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. France maintained its seat as there was no change in its international status or recognition, although many of its [[French Community|overseas possessions]] eventually became independent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The five permanent members of the Security Council were the victorious powers in World War II{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=70}} and have maintained the world's most powerful military forces ever since. They annually topped the [[List of countries by military expenditures|list of countries with the highest military expenditures]].&lt;ref name=SIPRI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex |title= SIPRI Military Expenditure Database|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, they spent over US$1 trillion combined on defence, accounting for over 55% of global military expenditures (the US alone accounting for over 35%).&lt;ref name=SIPRI /&gt; They are also among the world's [[Arms industry#World's largest arms exporters|largest arms exporters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/27/us-arms-treaty-idUSBRE86Q1MW20120727 | title= United Nations fails to agree landmark arms-trade treaty| first=Michelle |last=Nichols | date=27 July 2012 | agency= Reuters |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are the only nations officially recognized as &quot;[[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear-weapon states]]&quot; under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), though there are other states known or believed to be in possession of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/crs/92-099.htm |title=92099: Nuclear Weapons Testing and Negotiation of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty |date=14 November 1996 |publisher=Global Security |author=Medalia, Jonathan |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 25 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main article|United Nations Security Council veto power}}

Under [[United Nations Security Council veto power#Article 27|Article 27]] of the UN Charter, Security Council decisions on all substantive matters require the affirmative votes of nine members. A negative vote or &quot;veto&quot; by a permanent member prevents adoption of a proposal, even if it has received the required votes.{{sfn|Fasulo|2004|pp=40–41}} Abstention is not regarded as a veto in most cases, though all five permanent members must actively concur to amend the UN Charter or to recommend the admission of a new UN member state.{{sfn|Fomerand|2009|p=287}} Procedural matters are not subject to a veto, so the veto cannot be used to avoid discussion of an issue. The same holds for certain decisions that directly regard permanent members.{{sfn|Fasulo|2004|pp=40–41}} A majority of vetoes are used not in critical international security situations, but for purposes such as blocking a candidate for Secretary-General or the admission of a member state.&lt;ref name=Veto /&gt;

In the negotiations building up to the creation of the UN, the veto power was resented by many small countries, and in fact was forced on them by the veto nations –  US, UK, China, France and the Soviet Union – through a threat that without the veto there will be no UN. Here is a description by Francis O. Wilcox, an adviser to US delegation to the 1945 conference: &quot;At San Francisco, the issue was made crystal clear by the leaders of the Big Five: it was either the Charter with the veto or no Charter at all. Senator Connally [from the US delegation] dramatically tore up a copy of the Charter during one of his speeches and reminded the small states that they would be guilty of that same act if they opposed the unanimity principle. &quot;You may, if you wish,&quot; he said, &quot;go home from this Conference and say that you have defeated the veto. But what will be your answer when you are asked: 'Where is the Charter'?&quot;{{sfn|Wilcox|1945}}

As of 2012, 269 vetoes had been cast since the Security Council's inception.{{efn|This figure and the figures that follow exclude vetoes cast to block candidates for Secretary-General, as these occur in closed session; 43 such vetoes have occurred.&lt;ref name=Veto /&gt;}} In this period, China (ROC/PRC) used the veto 9 times, France 18, USSR/Russia 128, the UK 32, and the US 89. Roughly two-thirds of Soviet/Russian vetoes were in the first ten years of the Security Council's existence. Between 1996 and 2012, China vetoed 5 resolutions, Russia 7, and the US 13, while France and the UK did not use the veto.&lt;ref name=Veto&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/Changing_Patterns_in_the_Use_of_the_Veto_as_of_August_2012.pdf |format=PDF|title=Changing Patterns in the Use of the Veto in The Security Council |publisher=Global Policy Forum |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early veto by Soviet Commissar [[Andrei Vishinsky]] blocked a resolution on the withdrawal of French forces from the then-colonies of Syria and Lebanon in February 1946; this veto established the precedent that permanent members could use the veto on matters outside of immediate concerns of war and peace. The USSR went on to veto matters including the admission of Austria, Cambodia, Ceylon, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Laos, Libya, Portugal, South Vietnam, and Transjordan as UN member states, delaying their joining by several years. Britain and France used the veto to avoid Security Council condemnation of their actions in the 1956 Suez Crisis. The first veto by the US came in 1970, blocking General Assembly action in [[Southern Rhodesia]]. From 1985–90, the US vetoed 27 resolutions, primarily to block resolutions it perceived as anti-Israel but also to protect its interests in Panama and Korea. The USSR, US, and China have all vetoed candidates for Secretary-General, with the US using the veto to block the re-election of [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] in 1996.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=52–54}}

=== Non-permanent members ===
{{See also|List of members of the United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council election, 2014|United Nations Security Council election, 2015}}
Along with the five permanent members, the Security Council has temporary members that hold their seats on a rotating basis by geographic region. In its first two decades, the Security Council had six non-permanent members, the first of which were Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Poland. In 1965, the number of non-permanent members was expanded to ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The UN Security Council | url = http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|publisher=United Nations Foundation | accessdate = 15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ten non-permanent members are elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] for two-year terms starting on 1 January, with five replaced each year.&lt;ref name=Current&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/sc/members/ |title=Current Members |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be approved, a candidate must receive at least two-thirds of all votes cast for that seat, which can result in deadlock if there are two roughly evenly matched candidates. In 1979, a standoff between Cuba and Colombia only ended after three months and a record 154 rounds of voting; both eventually withdrew in favour of Mexico as a compromise candidate.&lt;ref name=SCR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/site/c.glKWLeMTIsG/b.7741609/k.778/Special_Research_Report_No_4brSecurity_Council_Elections_2011br21_September_2011.htm |title=Special Research Report No. 4Security Council Elections 201121 September 2011 |publisher=Security Council Report |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retiring member is not eligible for immediate re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter5.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter V: The Security Council |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Group is represented by three members; the [[Latin America and the Caribbean]], Asia-Pacific, and [[Western European and Others Group|Western European and Others]] groups by two apiece; and the [[Eastern European Group]] by one. Traditionally, one of the seats assigned to either the Asia-Pacific Group or the African Group is filled by a nation from the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=David|date = 25 October 2003|accessdate = 3 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]|location = Beirut|url=http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/1694.cfm|title=Reforming the Security Council: Where Are the Arabs?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, elections for terms beginning in even-numbered years select two African members, and one each within Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Terms beginning in odd-numbered years consist of two Western European and Other members, and one each from Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=SCR /&gt;

== Meeting locations ==
[[File:Barack Obama chairs a United Nations Security Council meeting.jpg|thumbnail|US President [[Barack Obama]] chairs a United Nations Security Council meeting]]
Unlike the General Assembly, the Security Council meets year-round. Each Security Council member must have a representative available at UN Headquarters at all times in case an emergency meeting becomes necessary.&lt;ref name=Whatis /&gt;

The Security Council generally meets in a designated chamber in the [[United Nations Headquarters|United Nations Conference Building]] in New York City, U.S. The chamber was designed by the Norwegian architect [[Arnstein Arneberg]] and was a gift from Norway. The mural painted by the Norwegian artist [[Per Krohg]] depicts a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] rising from its ashes, symbolic of the world's rebirth after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/untour/subsec.htm &quot;The Security Council&quot;]. ''United Nations Cyberschoolbus''. United Nations. Retrieved 14 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Security Council has also held meetings in cities including [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia; [[Panama City]], Panama; and [[Geneva]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=Whatis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/sc/about/ |title=What is the Security Council? |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the Security Council moved into a temporary facility in the General Assembly Building as its chamber underwent renovations as part of the UN Capital Master Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Capital Master Plan Timeline|url=http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/cmp/home/about/pid/22303 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The renovations were funded by Norway, the chamber's original donor, for a total cost of US$5million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An unrecognizable Security Council Chamber|url=http://www.norway-un.org/NorwayandUN/UNBodies/The-Security-Council/An-unrecognizable-Security-Council-Chamber/|publisher=Norway Mission to the UN| date=28 August 2012|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chamber reopened on 16 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=16 April 2013|title=Secretary-General, at inauguaration of renovated Security Council Chamber, says room speaks 'language of dignity and seriousness'|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=26 November 2013|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sgsm14951.doc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consultation room ===

Because meetings in the Security Council Chamber are covered by the international press, proceedings are highly theatrical in nature. Delegates deliver propaganda speeches to justify their positions and attack their opponents, playing to the cameras and the audience at home. Delegations also stage walkouts to express their disagreement with actions of the Security Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;haidar2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haidar|first1=Suhasini|title=India’s walkout from UNSC was a turning point: Natwar|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-walkout-from-unsc-was-a-turning-point-natwar/article7601027.ece|work=The Hindu|date=1 September 2015|language=en-IN|quote=According to Mr. Singh, posted at India’s permanent mission at the U.N. then, 1965 was a “turning point” for the U.N. on Kashmir, and a well-planned “walkout” from the U.N.

Closed meetings are not open to the public and no verbatim record of statements is kept, instead the Security Council issues a Communiqué in line with Rule 55 of its Provisional Rules of Procedure.

In 1978, the West German government funded the construction of a conference room next to the Security Council Chamber. Only members of the Security Council are permitted in the conference room for consultations. The press is not admitted, and other members of the United Nations cannot be invited into the consultations.&lt;ref name=&quot;unsc_glossary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Council Handbook Glossary|url=http://www.un.org/en/sc/about/methods/glossary.shtml|website=United Nations Security Council|quote=&quot;Consultations of the whole&quot; are consultations held in private with all 15 Council members present. Such consultations are held in the Consultations Room, are announced in the UN Journal, have an agreed agenda and interpretation, and may involve one or more briefers. The consultations are closed to non-Council Member States. &quot;Informal consultations&quot; mostly refer to &quot;consultations of the whole&quot;, but in different contexts may also refer to consultations among the 15 Council members or only some of them held without a Journal announcement and interpretation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the delegations can negotiate with each other in secret, striking deals and compromises without having their every word transcribed into the permanent record. The privacy of the conference room also makes it possible for the delegates to deal with each other in a friendly manner. In one early consultation, a new delegate from a Communist nation began a propaganda attack on the United States, only to be told by the Soviet delegate, &quot;We don't talk that way in here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bosco2009&quot;/&gt;

The informal consultations have grown into a quasi-formal institution, to the point where there are twice as many consultations as formal meetings. By the time a resolution reaches the Security Council Chamber, it has already been discussed, debated, and amended in the consultations. The open meeting of the Security Council has become a public ratification of a decision that has already been reached in private.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid1999&quot;/&gt; A permanent member can cast a &quot;pocket veto&quot; during the informal consultation by declaring its opposition to a measure. Since a veto would prevent the resolution from being passed, the sponsor will usually refrain from [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabling]] the resolution formally.

Article 29 of the Charter provides that the Security Council can establish subsidiary bodies in order to perform its functions. This authority is also reflected in Rule 28 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure. The subsidiary bodies established by the Security Council are extremely heterogenous. On the one hand, they include bodies such as the Security Council Committee on Admission of New Members. On the other hand, both the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] were also created as subsidiary bodies of the Security Council. The by now numerous Sanctions Committees (see [[:Category:United Nations Security Council sanctions regimes]]) established in order to oversee implementation of the various sanctions regimes are also subsidiary bodies of the Council.

== United Nations peacekeepers ==
{{Main article|United Nations peacekeeping|List of United Nations peacekeeping missions}}
After approval by the Security Council, the UN may send [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed &quot;Blue Helmets&quot; for their distinctive gear.{{sfn|Fasulo|2004|p=52}}{{sfn|Coulon|1998|p=ix}} The peacekeeping force as a whole received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1988/|author=Nobel Prize|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1988|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the UN had 116,837 peacekeeping soldiers and other personnel deployed on 15 missions. The largest was the [[United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (MONUSCO), which included 20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. Peacekeepers with the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.&lt;ref name=UNPO/&gt;

UN peacekeepers have also drawn criticism in several postings. Peacekeepers have been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, or sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3145-2004Dec15.html|title=U.N.&amp;nbsp;Sexual Abuse Alleged in Congo|work=The Washington Post |first=Colum |last=Lynch|date=16 December 2004|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6195830.stm|title=UN troops face child abuse claims|publisher=BBC News |date=30 November 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/08/world/africa/08iht-abuse.html|title=Aid workers in Liberia accused of sex abuse|work=The New York Times |date=8 May 2006|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan and what is now South Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1538476/UN-staff-accused-of-raping-children-in-Sudan.html|title= UN staff accused of raping children in Sudan|work=The Telegraph|date=4 January 2007| first=Kate | last=Holt |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burundi and Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7420798.stm|title= Peacekeepers 'abusing children' |publisher=BBC |date=28 May 2007|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the [[2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak]], which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/09/world/americas/haiti-un-cholera-lawsuit/ |title=U.N. sued for 'bringing cholera to Haiti,' causing outbreak that killed thousands |author=Watson, Ivan and Joe Vaccarello |date=10 October 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The budget for peacekeeping is assessed separately from the main UN organisational budget; in the 2013–2014 fiscal year, peacekeeping expenditures totalled $7.54&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=UNPO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/factsheet.shtml |title=United Nations Peacekeeping Operations |accessdate=9 November 2013 |date=30 September 2013 |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fasulo|2004|p=115}} UN peace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula derived from the regular funding scale, but including a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries. In 2013, the top 10 providers of assessed financial contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations were the US (28.38%), Japan (10.83%), France (7.22%), Germany (7.14%), the United Kingdom (6.68%), China (6.64%), Italy (4.45%), Russian Federation (3.15%), Canada (2.98%), and Spain (2.97%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/contributors/financing.html |title=Financing of UN Peacekeeping Operations |publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and evaluations ==
{{Main article|Criticism of the United Nations}}
In examining the first sixty years of the Security Council's existence, British historian [[Paul Kennedy]] concludes that &quot;glaring failures had not only accompanied the UN's many achievements, they overshadowed them&quot;, identifying the lack of will to prevent ethnic massacres in Bosnia and Rwanda as particular failures.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|pp=101–103, 110}} Kennedy attributes the failures to the UN's lack of reliable military resources, writing that &quot;above all, one can conclude that the practice of announcing (through a Security Council resolution) a new peacekeeping mission without ensuring that sufficient armed forces will be available has usually proven to be a recipe for humiliation and disaster.&quot;{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=110}}

A 2005 RAND Corporation study found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared UN nation-building efforts to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2005/RAND_MG304.sum.pdf|author=RAND Corporation|title=The UN's Role in Nation Building: From the Congo to Iraq|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, the [[Human Security Report 2005|Human Security Report]] documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humansecurityreport.info/|author=Human Security Centre|title=The Human Security Report 2005|accessdate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Sudhir Chella Rajan argued in 2006 that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, who are all nuclear powers, have created an exclusive [[nuclear club]] that predominately addresses the strategic interests and political motives of the permanent members—for example, protecting the oil-rich Kuwaitis in 1991 but poorly protecting resource-poor Rwandans in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rajan |first=Sudhir Chella |title=Global Politics and Institutions |url=http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/PDFFINALS/3Politics.pdf |format=PDF |journal=GTI Paper Series: Frontiers of a Great Transition |volume=3 |publisher=Tellus Institute |year=2006 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since three of the five permanent members are also European, and three or four are predominantly white Western nations, the Security Council has been described as a pillar of [[global apartheid]] by [[Titus Alexander]], former Chair of Westminster United Nations Association.{{sfn|Alexander|1996|pp=158–160}}

The Security Council's effectiveness and relevance is questioned by some because, in most high-profile cases, there are essentially no consequences for violating a Security Council resolution. During the [[Darfur crisis]], [[Janjaweed]] militias, allowed by elements of the Sudanese government, committed violence against an indigenous population, killing thousands of civilians. In the [[Srebrenica massacre]], Serbian troops committed genocide against [[Bosniaks]], although [[Srebrenica]] had been declared a UN [[safe area (Bosnian War)|safe area]], protected by 400 armed Dutch peacekeepers.{{sfn|Deni|2007|p=71|ps=: &quot;As Serbian forces attacked Srebrenica in July 1995, the [400] Dutch soldiers escorted women and children out of the city, leaving behind roughly 7,500 Muslim men who were subsequently massacred by the attacking Serbs.&quot;}}

The [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]] gives all three powers of the [[legislative]], executive, and [[judiciary]] branches to the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Creery |first=Janet |title=Read the fine print first |year=2004 |url=http://peacemagazine.org/archive/v10n1p20.htm |magazine=[[Peace Magazine]] |issue=Jan–Feb 1994 |page=20 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his inaugural speech at the [[16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement]] in August 2012, [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]] criticized the United Nations Security Council as having an &quot;illogical, unjust and completely undemocratic structure and mechanism&quot; and called for a complete reform of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://namna.ir/en/homeen/28-english-latest-news/1128-supreme-leader-s-inaugural-speech-at-16th-nam-summit.html &quot;Supreme Leader’s Inaugural Speech at 16th NAM Summit&quot;].

The Security Council has been criticized for failure in resolving many conflicts, including Cyprus, Sri Lanka, Kosovo and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], reflecting the wider short-comings of the UN. The amount of time devoted to the Israeli–Arab conflict in the UNSC has been described as excessive by [[UN Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unwatch.org/site/c.bdKKISNqEmG/b.1359197/k.6748/UN_Israel__AntiSemitism.htm |title=UN, Israel &amp; Anti-Semitism |publisher=UN Watch |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Anti-Defamation League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/international/Israel-UN-1-introduction.asp |title=Israel at the UN: Progress Amid A History of Bias |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League |date=September 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academics such as [[Alan Dershowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/the-united-nations-kangar_b_223424.html |title=The United Nations Kangaroo &quot;Investigation&quot; of Israeli War Crimes |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kramer]], and [[Mitchell Bard]]. This “excessiveness” reflects the power of the Arab League and the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as well as the cooperation of the European countries, in elevating this conflict and UN-led criticism of Israel to the highest priority for discussion. This emphasis was expressed in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1322|Security Council Resolution 1322 (2000)]], that created a monthly &quot;discussion&quot; on this conflict, usually criticizing Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/site/c.glKWLeMTIsG/b.2400795/ |title=Publications on the Middle East (including Israel/Palestine) |publisher=Securitycouncilreport.org |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/22F8A95E5C0579AF052569720007921E |title=Security Council resolution 1322 (2000) |publisher=United Nations |date=7 October 2000 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paragraph 7 “invites the Secretary-General to continue to follow the situation and to keep the Council informed.” In accordance with its general practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrweb.org/legal/unchartr.html |title=Charter of the United Nations |publisher=Hrweb.org |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered that this issue has to be dealt on a regular basis (i.e. every month).

At the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly, New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] heavily criticized the UN's inaction on [[Syria]], more than two years after the [[Syrian civil war]] began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-compromises-on-UN-Syria-deal/tabid/1607/articleID/315021/Default.aspx Key compromises on UN Syria deal]. ''3 News NZ''. 28 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent failures to act and the rising level of death and destruction in the fighting in Syria have furthered tarnished the UN's image and reputation, in general, and that of Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon.

Proposals to reform the Security Council began with the conference that wrote the UN Charter and have continued to the present day. As British historian Paul Kennedy writes, &quot;Everyone agrees that the present structure is flawed. But consensus on how to fix it remains out of reach.&quot;{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=76}}

There has been discussion of increasing the number of permanent members. The countries who have made the strongest demands for permanent seats are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. Japan and Germany, the main defeated powers in WWII, are now the UN's second- and third-largest funders respectively, while Brazil and India are two of the largest contributors of troops to UN-mandated peace-keeping missions.

Italy, the third main defeated power in WWII and now the UN's sixth-largest funder, leads a movement known as the [[Uniting for Consensus]] in opposition to the possible expansion of permanent seats. Core members of the group include Canada, South Korea, Spain, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey, Argentina and Colombia. Their proposal is to create a new category of seats, still non-permanent, but elected for an extended duration (semi-permanent seats). As far as traditional categories of seats are concerned, the UfC proposal does not imply any change, but only the introduction of small and medium size states among groups eligible for regular seats. This proposal includes even the question of veto, giving a range of options that goes from abolition to limitation of the application of the veto only to Chapter VII matters.

Former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] asked a team of advisers to come up with recommendations for reforming the United Nations by the end of 2004. One proposed measure is to increase the number of permanent members by five, which, in most proposals, would include Brazil, Germany, India, Japan (known as the [[G4 nations]]), one seat from Africa (most likely between Egypt, Nigeria or South Africa) and/or one seat from the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2006-11-01-voa46.html |title=UN Security Council Reform May Shadow Annan's Legacy |date=1 November 2006 |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 21 September 2004, the G4 nations issued a joint statement mutually backing each other's claim to permanent status, together with two African countries. Currently the proposal has to be accepted by two-thirds of the General Assembly (128 votes).

The permanent members, each holding the right of veto, announced their positions on Security Council reform reluctantly. The United States has unequivocally supported the permanent membership of Japan and lent its support to India and a small number of additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan to permanent member status, as well as an increase in the presence by African countries on the Council. China has supported the stronger representation of developing countries and firmly opposed Japan's membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/204917 |title=US embassy cables: China reiterates 'red lines' |work=The Guardian  |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |quote=[I]t would be difficult for the Chinese public to accept Japan as a permanent member of the UNSC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
