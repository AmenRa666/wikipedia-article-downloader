'''Patrick Murphy''' (January 15, 1823 – December 1, 1896) was a [[Union Navy]] sailor in the [[American Civil War]] and a recipient of the U.S. military's highest decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his actions at the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]]. A native of Ireland, Murphy began his seafaring career as a teenager aboard merchant ships in the [[North Atlantic]] and served for two years in the [[Royal Navy]]. He joined the U.S. Navy after settling in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and sailed the [[Great Lakes]] as a [[petty officer]] on the {{USS|Michigan|1843|6}}. During the American Civil War, he served aboard the {{USS|Metacomet|1863|6}} and distinguished himself in the action at Mobile Bay. He returned to Erie and the USS ''Michigan'' after the war, continuing on that ship for twenty more years until retiring as a [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]].

== Early years ==
Murphy was born on January 15, 1823, in [[Waterford]], Ireland, the son of produce dealer James Murphy (1786–1861) and his wife Ellen Murphy (née Mansfield). He had four siblings: James, Mary, John, and William. At age 14 he began a three-year term as a [[boy seaman]] aboard merchant ships sailing to North America. He then joined the [[Royal Navy]], serving two years on the {{HMS|Montreal|1839|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelsons&quot;/&gt;

== U.S. Navy service ==
In 1842, Murphy settled in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], where he helped outfit the newly built ship ''Michigan''. When the ship was commissioned into the U.S. Navy as the {{USS|Michigan|1843|6}} on September 26, 1844, Murphy followed it into the service. He sailed aboard ''Michigan'' as a [[quartermaster]] for three years, then two years as a [[captain of the hold]], and was subsequently promoted to [[quarter gunner]], [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|boatswain's mate]], and, in 1861, acting [[master's mate]]. Later in 1861 he left ''Michigan'' and joined Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]]'s fleet as an acting [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]], serving for eight months until illness forced him to return home to Erie for three months of recuperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelsons&quot;/&gt;

Upon regaining his health, Murphy traveled to New York City and joined the {{USS|Metacomet|1863|6}} as a [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|boatswain's mate]], for service in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nelsons&quot;/&gt; At the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] on August 5, 1864, he &quot;performed his duties with skill and courage&quot; despite heavy fire. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor three years later, on October 3, 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;hallofvalor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citation&quot;/&gt; He later achieved the rank of [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|chief]] boatswain's mate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelsons&quot;/&gt;

Murphy's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Served as boatswain's mate on board the U.S.S. ''Metacomet'', during action against rebel forts and gunboats and with the ram ''[[CSS Tennessee (1863)|Tennessee]]'' in Mobile Bay, 5 August 1864. Despite damage to his ship and the loss of several men on board as enemy fire raked her decks, Murphy performed his duties with skill and courage throughout a furious 2-hour battle which resulted in the surrender of the rebel ram ''Tennessee'' and in the damaging and destruction of batteries at [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the end of the war, Murphy returned to Erie and rejoined the USS ''Michigan'' in 1865, serving as quartermaster and [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]. He was appointed to the [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]] rank of boatswain on January 28, 1882, which he held until his retirement in 1885.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelsons&quot;/&gt;

== Personal life ==
On December 26, 1845, Murphy married Bridget Calligee of Erie. The couple had two sons: James, who became an actor, and William P., who died in infancy. From 1853 to 1857, Murphy owned and commanded the [[schooner]] ''William Adair'' in the freight trade. He was a member of the [[Catholic Church]] and the Union veterans' organization the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. In addition to his home on East Sixth Street, he owned several other properties in Erie.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelsons&quot;/&gt; He died on December 1, 1896, at age 73.&lt;ref name=&quot;hallofvalor&quot;/&gt;
