'''Lord Airey's Shelter''' is a [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] military [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It is located near the southern end of the [[Upper Rock Nature Reserve]], adjacent to [[Lord Airey's Battery]]. It was named after the [[Governor of Gibraltar]], General Sir [[Richard Airey, 1st Baron Airey|Richard Airey]]. The tunnel system for the shelter was chosen as the site for the highly classified, [[Second World War]] military operation known as [[Operation Tracer, Gibraltar|Operation Tracer]].

Lord Airey's Shelter is in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the southern end of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Crown Dependencies &amp; Overseas Territories|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/publications-and-documents/treaties/uk-overseas-territories/list-crown-dependencies-overseas|work=fco.gov.uk|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neandertals' Last Stand was in Gibraltar, Study Suggests|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060913-neanderthals.html|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=National Geographic News|agency=[[National Geographic Society]]|date=10 October 2006|author=Roach, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shelter is located underground, near the southern end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, just north of Lord Airey's Battery, and adjacent to the [[Mediterranean Steps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Lord Airey's Shelter|url=https://maps.google.com/?q=36.125119,-5.343553&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=20|work=maps.google.com|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Tracer|url=http://jproc.ca/radiostor/tracer.html|work=jproc.ca|publisher=Radio Reading Room|accessdate=18 November 2012|author=Jones, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is positioned on Ministry of Defence property.&lt;ref name=shelter/&gt;

The shelter was named after General Sir [[Richard Airey]] (1803 &amp;ndash; 1881), who served as Governor of Gibraltar from 1865 to 1870.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Airey, Richard|volume=1|pages=202-203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=panorama/&gt; The tunnels for Lord's Airey's Shelter were chosen as the site for the highly classified underground complex of Operation Tracer.&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracer - Naval Intelligence Division document #ADM 223/464|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|publisher=[[Naval Intelligence Division]], [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] (Click Operation Tracer - Stay Behind Cave, then Click here for general information about Operation Tracer)|accessdate=14 November 2012|author=[[Charles Langbridge Morgan|Morgan, Charles Langbridge]]|pages=268â€“270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary room of Lord Airey's Shelter measured {{convert|112|ft|m}} in length and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in width. Little is known about its function. However, due to the similarities between Lord Airey's Shelter and Operation Tracer's Stay Behind Cave, it is believed that the shelter may have served as a training site for the members of Operation Tracer. In addition, it may have stored provisions in advance of the military operation. Near the south end of the room, on the east wall, a stove was positioned. Adjacent to this, an exit to the Mediterranean Steps was constructed. On the west side of the south end of the shelter, a passage communicated with the tunnel system.&lt;ref name=shelter/&gt;&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;

At the north end of the main room, two smaller chambers were built, one of which contained a wash pit. That pit was built to the same dimensions as the one discovered in Operation Tracer's Stay Behind Cave. A ventilation conduit was installed in that chamber, with an appearance similar to that of the one for Operation Tracer. At the north end of the complex, a second passage led to the main tunnel system, as well as a steep tunnel. That steep tunnel to a lower level may have functioned as a &quot;spoil chute.&quot; During the Second World War, it is generally thought that German spies observed the amount of garbage and construction debris removed from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] at a variety of sites. It allowed German authorities to assess the amount of ongoing tunneling in the Rock.&lt;ref name=shelter&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord Airey's Shelter|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|work=discovergibraltar.com|publisher=DiscoverGibraltar.com (Click Operation Tracer - Stay Behind Cave, Click here for details of Stay Behind Cave discovered in 1996, Click to see the main room, then Click here for further information about Lord Airey's Shelter)|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the amount of tunneling in the area of Lord Airey's Shelter during the Second World War may have served as cover while Operation Tracer's Stay Behind Cave was built.&lt;ref name=discover&gt;{{cite web|title=Stay Behind Cave - Main Room|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|work=discovergibraltar.com|publisher=DiscoverGibraltar.com (Click Operation Tracer - Stay Behind Cave, Click here for details of Stay Behind Cave discovered in 1996, then Click to see the main room)|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another operation was codenamed ''Monkey'' and its intention was to create decoy caves that could be discovered by an invading army. The chosen locations were [[Beefsteak Cave]] and [[Coptic Cave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;under&quot;&gt;[http://underground-gibraltar.com/#/coptic-cave/4571405430 Coptic Cave], Underground-Gibraltar.com, [[Gibraltar Museum]], accessed January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent history ==
As Lord Airey's Shelter is on Ministry of Defence property, it is closed to the public. Unauthorised entry is considered a criminal offence.&lt;ref name=shelter/&gt; However, the adjacent Lord Airey's Battery was opened to the public in May 2010.&lt;ref name=panorama&gt;{{cite news|title=O'Hara's Battery becomes visitor attraction|url=http://www.panorama.gi/localnews/headlines.php?action=view_article&amp;article=5975|accessdate=19 November 2012|newspaper=Gibraltar news from Panorama|date=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
