{{Campaignbox Japan}}

The '''Japan Campaign''' was a series of battles and engagements in and around the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], between [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces and the forces of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] during the last stages of the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The Japan Campaign lasted from around June 1944 to August 1945.

==Air war==
Periodic [[air raids on Japan]] were the first attacks undertaken by Allied forces. In late 1944, these raids were followed by a major [[strategic bombing]] of cities, factories, and other war infrastructure throughout [[Japan]], most notably:
* [[Bombing of Tokyo|Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo]] (9-10 March 1945): 100,000 Japanese civilians were killed, including the [[conflagration]] that followed the [[firebombing]].
* [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] (6 August 1945): Of approximately 70,000 deaths, 20,000 were Japanese [[combatant]]s and 20,000 were Korean [[Unfree labour|slave laborers]].
* [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic bombing of Nagasaki]] (9 August 1945): Of approximately 35,000 deaths, 27,778 were Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 were Korean slave laborers, and 150 were Japanese combatants.

The air raids resulted in heavy damage to Japanese infrastructure and the deaths of 500,000 Japanese citizens (mostly civilians), as well as the loss thousands of aircraft and flak guns. The Allies, in turn, only lost a few hundred aircraft (mostly bombers) to Japanese anti-air defenses and fighters.

==Land and sea battles==
In early 1945, there were two major island battles:
* The [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] (16 February to 26 March): Of approximately 21,000 Japanese defenders, only 216 survived.
* The [[Battle of Okinawa]] (1 April to 21 June): Of approximately 100,000 Japanese defenders, only 24,455 survived.

There were also two naval battles:
* [[Operation Ten-Go]] (7 April): Most of the Japanese vessels committed were lost.
* The [[Battle of Tokyo Bay]] (22 and 23 July 1945): Most of the Japanese vessels committed were heavily damaged or lost.

Allied warships also [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombarded several Japanese cities]] during July and August 1945. 

The battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa foretold what was to be expected when the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]] were attacked. [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Okinawa]] were lost only after extremely fierce resistance was overcome. In both cases, the Japanese refused to surrender and there were few survivors. While Japanese losses were extremely high, Allied forces paid dearly to take both islands.

Naval operations included a [[Suicide attack|suicidal]] Japanese counteroffensive on 7 April 1945 (Operation Ten-Go), to relieve Okinawa and an Allied campaign to place [[Operation Starvation|air and submarine-delivered mines]] in Japanese shipping lanes. This was illustrated by the naval surface interdiction of Tokyo Bay in July 1945.

==The end==
[[File:1945-3-10-2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Tokyo]] from the air after the firebombing of Tokyo, 1945.]]
[[World War II]] ended with the [[surrender of Japan]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Before those two attacks, Japan was unwilling to surrender. The firebombing of Japanese cities resulted in 350,000 civilian deaths but did not move the government towards surrender. The Japanese government was clearly prepared to fight an [[Operation Downfall|Allied invasion of the home islands]] as fiercely as [[Battle of Iwo Jima|they had defended Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|fought on the Japanese home island of Okinawa]].

The Japan Campaign was intended to provide staging areas and preparation for a possible Allied invasion of Japan and to support Allied air and naval campaigns against the Japanese mainland. Japan still had a homeland army of about two million soldiers and sufficient resources to cripple an Allied invasion. Consequently, had that invasion been necessary, it most likely would have resulted in a much higher death toll for both sides.

The use of [[nuclear weapon]]s on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] may have saved many lives on both sides by causing the surrender of Japan before conventional tactics, including the prolonged incendiary attacks and the invasion of the Japanese mainland, were carried out. Estimates made at the time ran as high as 7,000,000 Japanese casualties (mostly civilians) and as many as 500,000 American casualties if the Japanese home islands were to be invaded. To this day, there is an ongoing [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|debate over the necessity of the atomic bombings and their results]].
