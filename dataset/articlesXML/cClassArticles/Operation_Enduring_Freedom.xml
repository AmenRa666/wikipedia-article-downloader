==Etymology==
The U.S. government used the term &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan&quot; to officially describe the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], from the period between October 2001 and December 2014.&lt;ref name=OEFover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/article/140565/Operation_Enduring_Freedom_comes_to_an_end/ |title=Operation Enduring Freedom comes to an end |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=29 December 2014 |publisher=United States Army |access-date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued operations in Afghanistan by the United States' military forces, both non-combat and combat, now occur under the name [[Operation Freedom's Sentinel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tilghman |first=Andrew |date=19 February 2015 |title=Despite war's end, Pentagon extends Afghanistan campaign medal |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/02/19/afghanistan-campaign-medal-extended-pentagon/23674869/ |newspaper=MilitaryTimes |publisher=Gannett |access-date=28 February 2015 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |last=Sisk |first=Richard |date=29 December 2014 |title=Amid Confusion, DoD Names New Mission 'Operation Freedom's Sentinel' |url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/29/amid-confusion-dod-names-new-mission-operation-freedoms.html |newspaper=Military.com |access-date=28 February 2015 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |last=Tomei |first=Lizzy |date=6 January 2015 |title=It’s 2015.

The operation was originally called &quot;Operation Infinite Justice&quot;, but as similar phrases have been used by adherents of several religions as an exclusive description of God, it is believed to have been changed to avoid offense to Muslims, who are the majority religion in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name =&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1563722.stm |title=Infinite Justice, out – Enduring Freedom | work = BBC News |date= 25 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s remark that &quot;this [[crusade]], this war on terrorism, is going to take a while&quot;, which prompted widespread criticism from the Islamic world, may also have contributed to the renaming of the operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot; /&gt;

The term &quot;OEF-A&quot; typically refers to the phase of the War in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. Other operations, such as the [[Georgia Train and Equip Program]], are only loosely or nominally connected, such as through government funding vehicles.&lt;ref name = HELPING-GEORGIA&gt;{{cite web |title=Helping Georgia? |url=http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol12/areshidze.html |publisher = [[Boston University]] Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology and Policy |date=March–April 2002 |accessdate= 14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the operations, however, have a focus on [[counterterrorism]] activities.

Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan, which was a joint U.S., U.K., and Afghan operation, was separate from the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), which was an operation of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] nations including the U.S. and the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Defence Committee|title=The UK Deployment to Afghanistan: Fifth Report of Session 2005-06; Report, Together with Formal Minutes, Oral and Written Evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7-OVQvYUOUC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2006|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-02828-0|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two operations ran in parallel, although it had been suggested that they merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David T. Zabecki Ph.D.|title=Germany at War: 400 Years of Military History &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCWMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|date=28 October 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-981-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In response to the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 11 September]], the early combat operations that took place on 7 October 2001 to include a mix of strikes from land-based [[B-1 Lancer]], [[B-2 Spirit]] and [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers, carrier-based [[F-14 Tomcat]] and [[F/A-18 Hornet]] fighters, and [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] launched from both U.S. and British ships and submarines signaled the start of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan (OEF-A).

The initial military objectives of OEF-A, as articulated by President [[George W. Bush]] in his 20 September Address to a Joint Session of Congress and his 7 October address to the country, included the destruction of terrorist training camps and [[infrastructure]] within Afghanistan, the capture of [[al-Qaeda]] leaders, and the cessation of terrorist activities in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2001/09/mil-010920-usia01.htm |title= Bush Announces Start of a &quot;War on Terror&quot; |publisher= Global security |date= 20 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2001/10/mil-011007-usia01.htm |title= President Bush Announces Military Strikes in Afghanistan |publisher= Global security | date= 7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/enduring-freedom.htm |title = Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan |publisher= Global security}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, over 1,200 soldiers from the [[United States Special Operations Command|United States Special Operations Command Pacific]] (SOCPAC) deployed to the Philippines to support the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) in their push to uproot terrorist forces on the island of [[Basilan]]. Of those groups included are [[Abu Sayyaf| Abu Sayyaf Group]] (ASG), [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Jemaah Islamiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://131.84.1.218/speeches/sst2003/030210pasoc.shtml |title=PASOC 2003 Conference – Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort |first=ADM Tom |last=Fargo |publisher=U.S. Pacific Command |work=Speeches and Transcripts |date=10 February 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513094615/http://131.84.1.218/speeches/sst2003/030210pasoc.shtml |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation consisted of training the AFP in counter-terrorist operations as well as supporting the local people with humanitarian aid in [[Operation Smiles]].&lt;ref name=Smiles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://131.84.1.218/piupdates/smiles.pdf |title=Operation Smiles |format=PDF |publisher=U.S. Pacific Command |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326131527/http://131.84.1.218/piupdates/smiles.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, the [[Combined Task Force 150]] and United States military Special Forces established themselves in Djibouti at [[Camp Lemonnier]].  The stated goals of the operation were to provide humanitarian aid and patrol the [[Horn of Africa]] to reduce the abilities of terrorist organizations in the region. Similar to OEF-P, the goal of humanitarian aid was emphasised, ostensibly to prevent militant organizations from being able to take hold amongst the population as well as reemerge after being removed.

The military aspect involves coalition forces searching and boarding ships entering the region for illegal cargo as well as providing training and equipment to the armed forces in the region. The humanitarian aspect involves building schools, clinics and water wells to enforce the confidence of the local people.

Since 2001, the cumulative expenditure by the U.S. government on Operation Enduring Freedom has exceeded $150&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = FAS | url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation continues, with military direction mostly coming from [[United States Central Command]].

==Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan (OEF-A)==

===The Taliban===
Seizing upon a [[power vacuum]] after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan after their [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|invasion]], the [[Taliban]] assumed the role of government from 1996–2001. Their extreme interpretation of Islamic law prompted them to ban music, television, sports, and dancing, and enforce harsh judicial penalties (See [[Human rights in Afghanistan]]). Amputation was an accepted form of punishment for stealing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rawa.org/execute4.htm | title= Taliban publicly execute murderer, amputate two robbers | publisher = Rawa | date = 14 August 1998 |accessdate= 27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0498/9804047.html |title=The Afghan Taliban: Like It or Not, It Occupies Two-Thirds of Afghanistan and Shows No Sign of Weakening |publisher=Washington report |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105114837/http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0498/9804047.html |archivedate=5 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and public executions could often be seen at the Kabul football stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rawa.org/murder-w.htm |title=Filmed by RAWA: Taliban publicly execute an Afghan woman |publisher=Rawa |accessdate= 27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Asia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/70585.stm |publisher=BBC |place=[[United Kingdom|UK]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040124024022/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/70585.stm |archivedate=24 January 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's rights groups around the world were frequently critical as the Taliban banned women from appearing in public or holding many jobs outside the home. They drew further criticism when they destroyed the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], historical statues nearly 1500 years old, because the Buddhas were considered idols.

In 1996, Saudi [[dissident]] [[Osama bin Laden]] moved to Afghanistan upon the invitation of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] leader Abdur Rabb ur Rasool Sayyaf. When the Taliban came to power, bin Laden was able to forge an alliance between the Taliban and his [[al-Qaeda]] organization.  It is understood that al-Qaeda-trained fighters known as the [[055 Brigade]] were integrated with the Taliban army between 1997 and 2001.  It has been suggested that the Taliban and bin Laden had very close connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = 9/11 commission | place = US | title = Report | chapter = 5 | contribution-url = http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.pdf | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===US-led coalition action===
{{Main|War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)}}

On 20 September 2001, the U.S. stated that Osama bin Laden was behind the [[11 September attacks]] in 2001.  The US made a five-point ultimatum to the Taliban:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/ |title=Transcript of President Bush's address – CNN |publisher=CNN  |date=21 September 2001 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Deliver to the U.S. all of the leaders of al-Qaeda
:* Release all imprisoned foreign nationals
:* Close immediately every terrorist training camp
:* Hand over every terrorist and their supporters to appropriate authorities
:* Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection

On 21 September 2001, the Taliban rejected this ultimatum, stating there was no evidence in their possession linking bin Laden to the 11 September attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/11/world/main310852.shtml |title=Taliban Won't Turn Over Bin Laden |publisher=CBS News |date=21 September 2001 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2001 the United Arab Emirates and later Saudi Arabia withdrew their recognition of the Taliban as the legal government of Afghanistan, leaving neighboring Pakistan as the only remaining country with diplomatic ties.

On 4 October 2001, it was reported that the Taliban covertly offered to turn bin Laden over to Pakistan for trial in an international tribunal that operated according to Islamic [[Sharia law|shar'ia law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.j-n-v.org/AW_briefings/ARROW_briefing005.htm |title=Briefing 05: The Smoking Gun |publisher=J-n-v.org |date=8 October 2001 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2001, the Taliban proposed to try bin Laden in Afghanistan in an Islamic court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415073508/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-10-07/us/ret.us.taliban_1_abdul-salam-zaeef-surrender-bin-taliban-offer?_s=PM:US|archivedate=15 April 2011|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/ret.us.taliban/ |title=U.S. rejects Taliban offer to try bin Laden |publisher=CNN  |date=7 October 2001 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition was immediately rejected by the US.  Later on the same day, United States and British forces initiated military action against the Taliban, bombing Taliban forces and al-Qaeda terrorist training camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/gen.america.under.attack/ |title=Bush to Taliban: 'Time is running out' |publisher=CNN |date=7 October 2001 |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916091256/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/gen.america.under.attack/ |archivedate=16 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2001, the Taliban proposed to hand bin Laden over to a third country for trial, but only if they were given evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the events of 11 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,1361,573975,00.html |title=Bush rejects Taliban offer to hand Bin Laden over |work=Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=27 March 2011 |date=14 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US rejected this proposal and military operations ensued.

The [[UN Security Council]], on 16 January 2002, unanimously established an arms embargo and the freezing of identifiable assets belonging to bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and the remaining Taliban.

===Combat operations start===

On Sunday 7 October 2001, American and British forces began an [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] campaign targeting Taliban forces and al-Qaeda.

The [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]], aided by [[Joint Special Operations Command|Joint Special Operations]] teams consisting of Green Berets from the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th Special Forces Group]], aircrew members from the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] (SOAR), and [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Air Force Combat Controllers]], fought against the Taliban. Aided by U.S. bombing and massive defections, they captured [[Mazari Sharif]] on 9 November. They then rapidly gained control of most of northern Afghanistan, and took control of Kabul on 13 November after the Taliban unexpectedly fled the city. The Taliban were restricted to a smaller and smaller region, with [[Kunduz]], the last Taliban-held city in the north, captured on 26 November. Most of the Taliban fled to Pakistan.

The war continued in the south of the country, where the Taliban retreated to [[Kandahar]]. After Kandahar fell in December, remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda continued to [[Taliban insurgency|mount resistance]]. Meanwhile, in November 2001 the U.S. military and its allied forces established their first ground base in Afghanistan to the south west of [[Kandahar]], known as [[Camp Rhino|FOB Rhino]].

The [[Battle of Tora Bora]], involving U.S., British and Northern Alliance forces took place in December 2001 to further destroy the Taliban and suspected al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. In early March 2002 the United States military, along with allied Afghan military forces, conducted a large operation to destroy al-Qaeda in an operation code-named [[Operation Anaconda]].

The operation was carried out by elements of the United States [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], [[101st Airborne Division]], the [[U.S. special forces]] groups TF 11, TF Bowie, TF Dagger, TF K-Bar, British [[Royal Marines]], the Norwegian ''[[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]]'' (FSK), ''[[Hærens Jegerkommando]]'' and ''[[Marinejegerkommandoen]]'', Canada's 3rd Battalion [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]], Canada's [[Joint Task Force 2]], the German [[Kommando Spezialkräfte|KSK]], and elements of the [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] and of the [[Special Air Service of New Zealand|New Zealand Special Air Service]] and the [[Afghan National Army]].

After managing to evade U.S. forces throughout the summer of 2002, the remnants of the Taliban gradually began to regain their confidence. A U.S. and Canadian led operation (supported by British and Dutch forces), [[Operation Mountain Thrust]] was launched in May 2006 to counter renewed Taliban insurgency.

Since January 2006, the [[NATO]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] undertook combat duties from Operation Enduring Freedom in southern Afghanistan, the NATO force chiefly made up of British, Canadian and Dutch forces (and some smaller contributions from Denmark, Romania and Estonia and air support from Norway as well as air and artillery support from the U.S.) (''see the article [[Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2006]]''). The United States military also conducts military operations separate from NATO as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in other parts of Afghanistan, in areas such as Kandahar, Bagram, and Kabul (including [[Camp Eggers]] and [[Camp Phoenix]].)

===International support===
{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan: Allies}}
The United States was supported by [[Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan: Allies|several nations]] during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan in 2001–2003 and in subsequent coalition operations directly or indirectly in support of OEF. See the article [[Afghanistan War order of battle]] for the current disposition of coalition forces in Afghanistan.

===Result===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
The U.S.-led coalition initially removed the [[Taliban]] from power and seriously crippled [[al-Qaeda]] and associated militants in Afghanistan.  However, success in quelling the Taliban insurgency since the 2001 invasion has been mixed.  Many believe{{Who|date=March 2015}} the Taliban cannot be defeated as long as it has sanctuary in neighboring Pakistan&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte L Nacos, 'Terrorism and Counterterrorism': Chapter 11, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; and that Operation Enduring Freedom has transformed into a continuing full-fledged war with no end in sight.

On 9 October 2004, Afghanistan elected [[Hamid Karzai]] president in its first direct elections. The following year, Afghans conducted the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005]] on 18 September. Since the invasion, hundreds of schools and mosques have been constructed, millions of dollars in aid have been distributed, and the occurrence of violence has been reduced.

While military forces interdict [[Insurgency|insurgents]] and assure security, [[Provincial reconstruction team]]s are tasked with infrastructure building, such as constructing roads and bridges, assisting during floods, and providing food and water to [[Afghan refugees|refugees]].  Many warlords have participated in an allegiance program, recognizing the legitimacy of the government of Afghanistan, and surrendering their soldiers and weapons; however, subsequent actions have led to questions about their true loyalties.

The [[Afghan National Army]], [[Afghan National Police]], and [[Afghan Border Police]] are being trained to assume the task of securing their nation.

On 31 December 2014, Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan concluded, and was succeeded by [[Operation Freedom's Sentinel]] on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=19 February 2015|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=128207|title=

===Criticism===
{{Main|Criticism of the War on Terror{{!}}Criticism of the Global War on Terrorism}}
AFP, reporting on a news story in the Sunday, 3 April 2004, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = South Asia | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/southasia/view/78653/1/.html | publisher = Channel news Asia}}.{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that retired Army Colonel Hy Rothstein, &quot;who served in the [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] for more than 20 years, ...commissioned by [[The Pentagon]] to examine the war in Afghanistan concluded the conflict created conditions that have given 'warlordism, banditry and opium production a new lease on life'...&quot;

The conduct of U.S. forces was criticised in a report entitled [[Enduring Freedom – Abuses by U.S. Forces in Afghanistan]] by U.S.-based human rights group [[Human Rights Watch]] in 2004.  Some Pakistani scholars, such as [[Masood Ashraf Raja]], editor of [[Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies|Pakistaniaat]], have also provided a more specific form of criticism that relates to the consequences of the Global War on Terrorism on the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year =2009|title= The Rhetoric of Democracy and War on Terror: The Case of Pakistan | journal= Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies |volume=1|issue=2|pages=60–65| accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines (OEF-P)==
{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines}}

===Abu Sayyaf Group===
{{Main|Abu Sayyaf}}
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) Al Harakat Al Islamiyya, is deemed a &quot;foreign terrorist organization&quot; by the United States government. Specifically, it is an [[Islamist]] separatist group based in and around the southern islands of the Republic of the Philippines, primarily [[Jolo]], [[Basilan]], and [[Mindanao]].

Since inception in the early 1990s, the group has carried out [[bombing]]s, assassinations, [[kidnapping]]s, and [[extortion]] in their fight for an independent Islamic state in western [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. Its claimed overarching goal is to create a Pan-Islamic superstate across the ''Malay'' portions of Southeast Asia, spanning, from east to west, the large island of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago (Basilan and Jolo islands), the large island of [[Borneo]] (Malaysia and Indonesia), the [[South China Sea]], and the [[Malay Peninsula]] ([[Peninsular Malaysia]], Thailand and [[Myanmar]]).

===Jemaah Islamiyah===
{{Main|Jemaah Islamiyah}}
Jemaah Islamiyah is a [[militant Islam]]ic terrorist organization dedicated to the establishment of a fundamentalist Islamic [[theocracy]] in Southeast Asia, in particular Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, the south of Thailand and the Philippines.

Financial links between Jemaah Islamiyah and other terrorist groups, such as [[Abu Sayyaf]] and [[al-Qaeda]], have been found to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf |title=Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah |publisher=Nbr.org |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jemaah Islamiyah means &quot;Islamic Group&quot; or &quot;Islamic Community&quot; and is often abbreviated JI.

Jemaah Islamiyah is thought to have killed hundreds of civilians. Also, it is suspected of carrying out the [[2002 Bali terrorist bombing|Bali car bombing]] on 12 October 2002, in which suicide bombers attacked a nightclub killing 202 people and wounding many more. Most of the casualties were Australian tourists. After this attack, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] designated Jemaah Islamiyah as a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organization]]. Jemaah Islamiyah is also suspected of carrying out the [[Zamboanga bombings]], the [[Metro Manila]] bombings, the [[2004 Australian embassy bombing]] and the [[2005 Bali bombings|2005 Bali terrorist bombing]].

===U.S. actions===
In January 2002, 1,200 members of [[United States Special Operations Command|United States Special Operations Command, Pacific]] (SOCPAC) were deployed to the Philippines to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in uprooting al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf.  The members of SOCPAC were assigned to assist in military operations against the terrorist forces as well as humanitarian operations for the island of Basilan, where most of the conflict was expected to take place.

The United States Special Forces (SF) unit trained and equipped special forces and scout rangers of the AFP, creating the [[Light Reaction Battalion|Light Reaction Company (LRC)]]. The LRC and elements of SOCPAC deployed to Basilan on completion of their training. The stated goals of the deployment were denying the ASG sanctuary, surveiling, controlling, and denying ASG routes, surveiling supporting villages and key personnel, conducting local training to overcome AFP weaknesses and sustain AFP strengths, supporting operations by the AFP &quot;strike force&quot; (LRC) in the area of responsibility (AOR), conducting and supporting civil affairs operations in the AOR.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Colonel David S |last=Maxwell |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalwriting/volumes/volume2/june_2004/6_04_3.html |title=The U.S. Army Professional Writing Collection |publisher=Army |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412201517/http://www.army.mil/professionalwriting/volumes/volume2/june_2004/6_04_3.html |archivedate=12 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result===
The desired result was for the AFP to gain sufficient capability to locate and destroy the ASG, to recover hostages and to enhance the legitimacy of the Philippine government. Much of the operation was a success: the ASG was driven from Basilan and one U.S. hostage was recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;/&gt; The Abu Sayyaf Group's ranks, which once counted more than 800 members, was reduced to less than 100. The humanitarian portion of the operation, Operation Smiles, created 14 schools, 7 clinics, 3 hospitals and provided medical care to over 18,000 residents of Basilan. Humanitarian groups were able to continue their work without fear of further kidnappings and terrorists attacks by the Abu Sayyaf Group.&lt;ref name = Smiles /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Organisations |url=http://www.ict.org.il/organizations/orgdet.cfm?orgid=3 |publisher=ICT |place=[[Israel|IL]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525184544/http://www.ict.org.il/organizations/orgdet.cfm?orgid=3 |archivedate=25 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA)==
{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa}}
Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF-HOA does not have a specific terrorist organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect terrorist activities in the region and to work with host nations to deny the reemergence of terrorist cells and activities. Operations began in mid-2002 at [[Camp Lemonier]] by a Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) augmented by support forces from [[Fort Stewart]], [[Fort Hood]], and [[Fort Story]].  In October 2002, the Combined Joint Task Force, Horn of Africa ([[CJTF-HOA]]) was established at Djibouti at [[Camp Lemonier]], taking over responsibilities from the CJSOTF.  CJTF-HOA comprised approximately 2,000 personnel including U.S. military and Special Operations Forces (SOF), and coalition force members, [[Combined Task Force 150]] (CTF-150). The coalition force consists of ships from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Pakistan, New Zealand, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region. Since 2003, the U.S. Military also conducts operations targeting Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Somalia, these operations had reportedly killed between 113 and 136 militants by early 2016. On 7 March 2016, a further 150 were killed in U.S. airstrikes on an al Shabaab training camp north of Mogadishu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/more-150-shebab-fighters-killed-us-drone-strike-171223047.html|title=US strike kills at least 150 al Shebab fighters in Somalia|publisher=Yahoo news|date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CJTF-HOA has devoted the majority of its efforts to train selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, Kenya and Ethiopia in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency tactics.  Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include the rebuilding of schools and medical clinics, as well as providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained. The program expands as part of the Trans-Saharan Counter Terrorism Initiative as CJTF personnel also assist in training the forces of Chad, Niger, Mauritania and Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Terrorism |url=http://www.senate.gov/member/al/shelby/general/legislation/Terrorism.pdf |publisher=Senate |place=Washington, DC |format=[[Portable document format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011050803/http://www.senate.gov/member/al/shelby/general/legislation/Terrorism.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, during the [[War in Somalia (2006–present)|war in Somalia]], an [[AC-130]] airstrike was conducted against [[al-Qaeda]] members embedded with forces of the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) operating in southern Somalia near [[Battle of Ras Kamboni|Ras Kamboni]].  US naval forces, including the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Dwight D. Eisenhower|USS ''Dwight D. Eisenhower'']], were positioned off the coast of Somalia to provide support and to prevent any al-Qaeda forces escaping by sea.  Actions against pirates also occurred in June and October 2007 with varying amounts of success.
