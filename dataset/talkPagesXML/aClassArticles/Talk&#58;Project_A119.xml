==Context==

It might be useful to revise the article at some point. Firstly the US was not the only country to consider this concept. The [[Soviet Union]] had something called [http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/E3/E3orig.htm Project E-4] which actually got to the mock-up stage before it was canceled.

Secondly the idea of having the first (unmanned) spacecraft to the moon leave an obvious sign of its arrival appears in early science fiction, the versions I have seen feature impact probes loaded with white paint or [[Flash powder|magnesium flash powder]].[[User:Graham1973|Graham1973]] ([[User talk:Graham1973|talk]]) 01:57, 6 August 2010 (UTC)

:Rumors of soviets bombing the moon began as early as 1957, as confirmed by [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5kUqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Bk4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5584,131807 this article] (that also contains many details now related to Project A119, such as the explosion on the dark side). --[[User:Viniciusmc|viniciusmc]] 18:21, 7 October 2010 (UTC)

==The Gary Latham Proposal==

The Post-Apollo 11 proposal to detonate a nuclear device on the moon looks to be a further area for research. For one thing, this is clearly the inspiration for [[Barry N. Malzberg|Malzbergs]], ''The Falling Astronauts'' which features an Apollo mission to carry out just this experiment.[[User:Graham1973|Graham1973]] ([[User talk:Graham1973|talk]]) 08:12, 22 October 2011 (UTC) 
:The proposal was pretty widely reported at the time (Google News is full of the stuff) but there's nothing really in the reports beyond what's mentioned here. Latham has a few books on lunar seismology though, which might provide something. [[User:Grapple X|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#556655&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''GRAPPLE'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Grapple X|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#556655&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''X'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 17:40, 22 October 2011 (UTC)
:: I found something, but it's in a very dubious source, ''Secrets of our spaceship Moon'' ([http://www.google.com.au/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=%22gary+latham%22&amp;btnG=#q=%22gary+latham%22,+lunar+seismology,+nuclear&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=82qjTpvQFsnRmAWonemUCQ&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=33eb2e667cd5e7a4&amp;biw=1338&amp;bih=889 Found on Google Books]) by a certain Don Wilson mentions the Latham proposal and states that it was for a farside blast. The problem is I cannot look inside to get a proper cite or even to find the authors sources.[[User:Graham1973|Graham1973]] ([[User talk:Graham1973|talk]]) 01:18, 23 October 2011 (UTC)

[[File:LCROSS Centaur.jpg|left|thumb|An illustration of the LCROSS Centaur(spent rocket third stage) and shepherding spacecraft as they approach impact with the lunar south pole on October 9, 2009. The Centaur impact was expected to excavate more than {{convert|350|MT|ST||lk=on}} of lunar material and create a crater about 20&amp;nbsp;m (65&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter to a depth of about {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}}. The Shepherding Spacecraft impact was projected to excavate an estimated {{convert|150|MT|ST}} and create a crater {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} in diameter to a depth of about 2&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;ft). Most of the material in the Centaur debris plume was expected to remain at (lunar) altitudes below {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;PressKit&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/360020main_LRO_LCROSS_presskit2.pdf | title = LRO/LCROSS Press Kit v2 | accessdate=2009-08-04 | publisher = NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the excavation plume was not visible.]]
[[Image:LCROSS Centaur Impact Flash.jpg|thumb|The faint flash from the [[Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite|LCROSS Centaur]] impact. It was hoped that [[spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] of the resulting impact [[plume]] would help to confirm preliminary findings by the [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] and [[Lunar Prospector]] which hinted that there may be [[lunar ice|water ice]] in the permanently shadowed regions on the moon. Mission scientists expected that the Centaur impact plume would be visible through amateur-class telescopes with apertures as small as 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm (10 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref name=&quot;observation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/observation.htm| title = LCROSS Observation Campaign | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But no plume was observed by such amateur telescopes.
Both impacts were also monitored by Earth-based observatories and by orbital assets, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].
]]
A vacuum stable [[Hexanitrostilbene|Chemical explosive]] filled the ''[[Vibroseis|thumper]]'' [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar ammunition]] canisters used as part of the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments]]. These explosive experiments investigated the composition of the [[Lunar]] [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] during the [[Apollo Program]], analogous to the [[exploration geophysics]] practice of mineral [[prospecting]] with chemical explosives in &quot;[[Vibroseis|deep seismic sounding]]&quot; [[reflection seismology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/documents/NASA%20RP-1036.pdf NASA reference publication]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific objectives of Project A119, which as Apollo scientist Gary Latham explained, would have been the detonating of a &quot;smallish&quot; nuclear device(1700+ tons of [[TNT]]) on the Moon in order to facilitate research into its geologic make-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Moon madness |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZJApAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5506,6803546 |date=December 21, 1969 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |page=19 |accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Were attempted to be found by using the comparatively, much lower yield, explosion created by the water [[prospecting]] (LCROSS)[[Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite]] mission, which launched in 2009 and released the &quot;Centaur&quot; [[kinetic energy]] impactor, an impactor with a mass of 2,305&amp;nbsp;kg (5,081&amp;nbsp;lb), and an impact velocity of about {{convert|9000|km/h|mph|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/features/2009/LCROSS_new_crater.html|title=NASA's LCROSS Mission Changes Impact Crater|publisher=NASA|date=2009-09-29|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; releasing the kinetic [[TNT equivalent|energy equivalent]] of detonating approximately 2 tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (8.86 [[Gigajoule|GJ]]). Whether or not LCROSS would find water had been stated to be influential in whether or not the United States government pursues creating a [[Colonization of the Moon|Moon base]].&lt;ref name=Chosun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/10/09/2009100900348.html|accessdate=09-10-2009|date=October 9, 2009|publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|title=NASA's Rocket Crash Might Boost Plans for Moon Colonies}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 13, 2009, NASA confirmed that water was detected after the Centaur impacted the crater.&lt;ref name=spectralResult &gt;{{cite news|first=Jonas|last=Dino|coauthors=Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite Team|authorlink=|title=LCROSS Impact Data Indicates Water on Moon|date=November 13, 2009|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/prelim_water_results.html|accessdate=2009-11-14|language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCROSS &quot;Centaur&quot; [[kinetic energy]] impactor was however underpowered and therefore only partially successful, having not produced the plume height that was predicted. Leaving the true composition of the lunar [[subsoil]], as an unknown.


I've moved this section to the talk page. Section needs re-writing as I do not think it was first written in English. Also the description of A119 in the section contradicts the description in the article.[[User:Graham1973|Graham1973]] ([[User talk:Graham1973|talk]]) 08:40, 16 June 2013 (UTC)

::::(1) If you feel unable to read this section, then by all means, take a stab at writing it yourself.
::::(2)What contradiction are you talking about? You mean, Gary Latham's explanation? He is correct, science was one of the objectives of the project. Indeed, if you read the primary sources, Sagan worked, in 1958, on the paper ''Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy''.

== Edit request ==
A see also section to [[Aristarchus (crater)]] should be included, as a natural source of radioactive decay gas products on the moon already exists.
Also, a see also to [[Giordano Bruno (crater)]], [[Transient lunar phenomenon]] and in the last section on explosions in lunar science, well some info on natural meteor impacts being visible from the earth wouldn't go amiss. like the earth visible ~ 15 tons of TNT energy impact last year, september 2013, linked below and the less energetic event in March 2013 ~ 5 tons of TNT. See more [[lunar craters]].
*http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/02/19/mnras.stu083.full
*2 videos &amp; quote &quot;This is the largest, brightest impact we have ever observed on the Moon,&quot; Professor Jose Madiedo, of the University of Huelva in south-western Spain&quot; -&gt;
*March 2013 event http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/350370 
*Sept 11 2013 event http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/bright-explosion-on-the-moon-2/ &amp;  http://rt.com/news/biggest-meteor-impact-moon-549/
*No doubt there will be plenty more!
*All these events makes one wonder how - under a scenario that a nation secretly flew a nuclear warhead into the moon and didn't declare it, how would the rest of the world be able to tell for sure it was a deliberate event and not just a typical meteoroid impact? As far as I know, there'd be no [[bhangmeter|double flash]] of light that we use on earth as the identifying characteristic of a nuclear explosion in our atmosphere, as there is practically zero atmosphere on the moon for the double flash mechanism to form. 
*So how would we discriminate from the two events? There's also no system of seismic stations([[CTBTO]]) on the moon like we have on earth to detect underground nuclear detonations either.
