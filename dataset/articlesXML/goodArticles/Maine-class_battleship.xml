The three '''''Maine''-class''' [[battleship]]s—{{USS|Maine|BB-10|2}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-11|2}}, and {{USS|Ohio|BB-12|2}}—were built at the turn of the 20th century for the [[United States Navy]]. Based on the preceding {{sclass-|Illinois|battleship|4}}, they incorporated several significant technological advances over the earlier ships. They were the first American battleships to incorporate [[Krupp cemented armor]], which was stronger than [[Harvey armor]], [[smokeless powder]], which allowed for higher-velocity guns and [[water-tube boiler]]s, which were more efficient and lighter. The ''Maine''s were armed with four {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} guns and sixteen {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} guns, and they could steam at a speed of {{convert|18|kn}}, a significant increase over the ''Illinois'' class.

The three ''Maine''-class battleships served in a variety of roles throughout their careers. ''Maine'' and ''Missouri'' remained in the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]] for their careers, though ''Ohio'' initially served with the [[Asiatic Fleet]] from 1904 to 1907. All three ships took part in the cruise of the [[Great White Fleet]] in 1907–1909, though ''Maine''{{'}}s excessive coal consumption forced her to proceed independently for most of the voyage. ''Missouri'' was used as a [[training ship]] for much of the rest of her career, and ''Ohio'' took part in the American intervention in the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1914. All three ships were employed as training ships during [[World War I]]. After the war, all three ships were withdrawn from service between 1919 and 1920 before being sold for scrap in 1922 and 1923 and [[ship breaking|broken up]].

== Design ==
By 1897, the [[US Navy]] had five battleships under construction, and no plans to request additional units for 1898. With the destruction of the [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}} in [[Havana harbor]] and the subsequent declaration of war on Spain on 25 April 1898, however, a large naval expansion program was passed through [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The program called for three new battleships, the first one which would be named for the destroyed ''Maine''. Design work began immediately, though the broad parameters for the new battleships proved to be contentious. The [[Board on Construction]] advocated a design based on {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|2}}, to be armed with 13-, 8-, and 6-inch (330, 203, and 152&amp;nbsp;mm) guns, though others on the board argued that repeating the {{sclass-|Illinois|battleship|4}}, which was armed with {{convert|12|in|abbr=on}} and 6&amp;nbsp;in guns and had a speed of {{convert|16|kn|lk=in}}, would save construction time. Additionally, they pointed out that 8&amp;nbsp;in guns could not be incorporated within the displacement limit.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=38}}

Several important technological advances had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several changes to the design. The advent of [[smokeless powder]] permitted smaller guns with greater [[muzzle velocity|muzzle velocities]]; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] high-velocity gun. In addition, [[Krupp cemented armor]] had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older [[Harvey armor|Harvey process]]. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve the same level of protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. [[Water-tube boiler]]s were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older [[fire-tube boiler]]s.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=38}}

Shortly after the three ships had been authorized, the Navy learned that the Russian battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Retvizan||2}}, recently ordered from [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]] in Philadelphia, would be capable of steaming at {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}, a margin of {{convert|2|kn}} over the ''Maine'' design. The Navy requested that the shipyards submitting designs for the contract increase the speed of their proposed ships to match the Russian vessel. Cramp &amp; Sons responded by lengthening the hull by {{convert|15|ft}} to increase its fineness (and thus reduce drag) and incorporate new [[Niclausse boiler]]s, while the [[Newport News Shipbuilding|Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company]] lengthened the hull by {{convert|20|ft}} and increased the [[horsepower]] of the propulsion system by sixty percent, to {{convert|16000|ihp|lk=in}}. Ultimately, the Newport design was chosen for the new ships.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=38–41}}

===General characteristics and machinery===
[[File:USS Maine Battleship BB10 LOC 22465.jpg|thumb|upright|''Maine'' in 1916]]
The ships of the ''Maine'' class were {{convert|388|ft}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and  {{convert|393|ft|11|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|72|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|23|ft|9|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|24|ft|4|in|abbr=on}}. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|12362|to|12846|LT}} as designed and up to {{convert|13700|LT}} at full load. The ships had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|2.36|ft|abbr=on}}. They had a [[forecastle]] deck that extended to the [[main mast]]. As built, they were fitted with heavy [[military mast]]s with [[fighting top]]s, but these were replaced by [[cage mast]]s in 1909. They had a crew of 40&amp;nbsp;officers and 521&amp;nbsp;enlisted men, which increased to 779–813&amp;nbsp;officers and men.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=142}}{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=428}}

The ships were powered by two-shaft [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s rated at {{convert|16000|ihp|lk=in}}. Steam was provided by twelve coal-fired [[Thornycroft boiler]]s for ''Missouri'' and ''Ohio'', and twenty-four [[Niclausse boiler]]s for ''Maine'', which were trunked into three tall [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] amidships. The ships' engines generated a top speed of {{convert|18|kn}}, though ''Ohio'' only made {{convert|17.82|kn}} on her speed trials. Normal coal capacity was {{convert|1000|LT}}, though ''Maine'' could carry up to {{convert|1867|LT}}, ''Missouri'' had capacity for {{convert|1837|LT}}, and ''Ohio'' could store {{convert|2150|LT}} of coal. At a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}, the ships had a designed endurance of {{convert|4900|nmi|lk=in}}, though they could steam for {{convert|5660|nmi|abbr=on}} at that speed. ''Ohio''{{'}}s significantly greater coal capacity allowed her to cruise for {{convert|6560|nmi|abbr=on}} at that speed. Steering was controlled by a single [[rudder]], and the ships had a turning radius of {{convert|350|yd}} at 10&amp;nbsp;knots.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=142}}{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=428}}

===Armament===
The ships were armed with a [[main battery]] of four [[12&quot;/40 caliber gun|12-inch/40 caliber]] Mark 3 guns in two twin [[gun turret]]s on the centerline, one forward and aft.{{refn|group=notes|/40 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. A /40 gun is 40 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} The guns fired a {{convert|870|lb|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2400|ft/s}}. The turrets were Mark IV mounts, which required the guns to be horizontal to be reloaded. These mounts could elevate to 15&amp;nbsp;degrees and depress to -5&amp;nbsp;degrees, and they were electrically operated, and the guns could be operated independently.{{sfn|Friedman 2011|pp=168–169}}

The secondary battery consisted of sixteen [[6&quot;/50 caliber gun|6-inch/50 caliber]] Mark 6 guns, which were placed in [[casemates]] in the hull. Ten were mounted in a battery on the upper deck, four more were located in another battery directly above on the forecastle deck, and the last two were placed in [[sponson]]ed casemates in the bow.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=142}} They fired a {{convert|105|lb|abbr=on}} shell at {{convert|2800|ft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman 2011|pp=180–181}} For close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, they carried six [[3″/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}/50 caliber]] guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull, eight 3-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for [[capital ship]]s of the period, the ''Maine''-class battleships carried two {{convert|18|in|abbr=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, submerged in her hull on the broadside.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=142}} They were initially equipped with the Mark II Whitehead design, which carried a {{convert|140|lb|adj=on}} [[warhead]] and had a range of {{convert|800|yd}} at a speed of {{convert|27|kn}}.{{sfn|Friedman 2011|p=341}}

===Armor===
The ships' armor consisted of both Krupp cemented and Harvey steel. Their main [[armored belt]] was {{convert|11|in|abbr=on|0}} thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and tapered down to {{convert|5.5|in|abbr=on|0}} on the lower edge. The belt was {{convert|8|in|abbr=on|0}} elsewhere and reduced to {{convert|4|in|abbr=on|0}} on the bottom edge. The belt extended from {{convert|3|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} above the [[waterline]] to {{convert|4|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} below. The main deck was {{convert|2.5|in|abbr=on|0}} thick and was increased slightly to {{convert|2.75|in|abbr=on|0}} on the sloped sides that connected it to the belt. The deck was increased to 4&amp;nbsp;in at the stern. The main battery gun turrets had 12&amp;nbsp;in thick faces, and the supporting [[barbette]]s had the same thickness of armor plating on their exposed sides. {{convert|9|in|abbr=on|0}} thick [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] connected the belt with the barbettes; behind these, the barbettes were protected with 8&amp;nbsp;in of steel. Armor that was 6&amp;nbsp;in thick protected the secondary battery. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|10|in|abbr=on|0}} thick sides with a {{convert|2|in|abbr=on|0}} thick roof.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=142}}{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=428}}

==Service history==

After ''Maine'' and ''Missouri'' entered service, they were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Squadron|North Atlantic Fleet]], while ''Ohio'', built on the [[West Coast of the United States]], was instead sent to serve as the [[flagship]] of the [[Asiatic Fleet]] based in the Philippines. In April 1904, a turret fire killed 36 men aboard ''Missouri'', but the quick action of three men prevented the fire from reaching the magazines and destroying the ship, for which they were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. In 1907, ''Ohio'' returned from the western Pacific and joined her [[sister ship|sisters]] in what was now the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]].{{refn|group=notes|name=bundle|See the [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]] entries for ''Maine'',{{sfn|DANFS Maine}} ''Missouri'',{{sfn|DANFS Missouri}} and ''Ohio'',{{sfn|DANFS Ohio}}}} During this period, ''Maine'' served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907.{{sfn|Albertson|p=36}}

[[File:USS Ohio in the Panama Canal.tiff|thumb|left|''Ohio'' transiting the [[Panama Canal]] on 16 July 1916 during a midshipmen training cruise]]
In December 1907, the three ships and the other battleships in the Atlantic Fleet steamed out of [[Hampton Roads]], Virginia, at the start of the cruise of the [[Great White Fleet]].{{refn|group=notes|name=bundle}} The fleet steamed south, around South America and back north to the US west coast. ''Maine'' was detached owing to her excessive use of coal along with the battleship {{USS|Alabama|BB-8|2}}; the two ships continued the journey independently and on a greatly shortened itinerary. The rest of the ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the [[Suez Canal]] and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a [[naval review]] with President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Albertson|pp=41–66}}

Over the following six years, the ships had fairly uneventful careers. ''Missouri'' spent most of the time out of active service, only recommissioning for summer training cruises with [[midshipmen]] from the [[US Naval Academy]]. In 1914, ''Ohio'' was sent to Mexican waters to protect American interests in the country during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. After the United States entered [[World War I]] by declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917, all three ships were used to train naval recruits for the expanding wartime fleet. Following the German surrender in November 1918, ''Missouri'' was used to ferry American soldiers back from France,{{refn|group=notes|name=bundle}} though the other two vessels were not so employed, since their short range and lack of sufficient accommodations would have made them inefficient transports.{{sfn|Jones|p=121}} The three ships remained in active service only very briefly after the war. ''Ohio'' was decommissioned in January 1919 and ''Missouri'' and ''Maine'' followed in September 1919 and May 1920, respectively. All three ships were sold for scrap, with ''Maine'' and ''Missouri'' going to the [[ship breaking|breakers']] yard in January 1922 and ''Ohio'' joining them in March 1923.{{refn|group=notes|name=bundle}}
