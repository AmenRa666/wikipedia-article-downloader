'''HMS ''Lord Clyde''''' was the [[name ship]] of the wooden-hulled {{sclass-|Lord Clyde|ironclad|4}} of [[armoured frigate]]s&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Ironclad is the all-encompassing term for armored warships of this period. Armoured frigates were basically designed for the same role as traditional wooden frigates, but this later changed as the size and expense of these ships forced them to be used in the line of battle.&lt;/ref&gt; built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the 1860s. She and her [[sister ship]], {{HMS|Lord Warden||2}}, were the [[displacement (ship)|heaviest]] wooden ships ever built and were also the fastest steaming wooden ships.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; ''Lord Clyde'' was initially assigned to the [[Channel Fleet]] in 1866, but was transferred to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in 1868. The ship suffered engine problems throughout her career and it needed to be replaced after only two years of service. She rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet in 1871, but was badly damaged when she [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] the next year. When ''Lord Clyde'' was under repair, her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was found to be rotten and she was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1875

==Design and description==
HMS ''Lord Clyde'' was {{convert|280|ft|m|1}} [[Length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|58|ft|11|in|m|1}}. The ship had a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|23|ft|9|in|m|1}} forward and {{convert|27|ft|2|in|m|1}} aft. She displaced {{convert|7842|LT|t}} and had a [[tonnage]] of 4,067 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]].&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Ballard, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lord Clyde'' had a very low [[centre of gravity]] which meant that she rolled very badly; she was said to be the worst roller in the Victorian fleet. This characteristic was so dramatic that when the rolling propensities of ships were compared, it was usual to say &quot;as bad a roller as the ''Prince Consort''&quot;, the ''Lord Clyde''s being beyond compare. ''Lord Clyde'' generally performed worse than did her sister ship, ''Lord Warden''.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, pp. 57, 97&lt;/ref&gt; In sea trials in 1867 with {{HMS|Bellerophon|1865|2}}, ''Lord Clyde'' was rolling her gun ports under, while ''Bellerophon'' could have fought her main armament in safety.  She was, however, very handy and sailed well in all weathers under sail or steam; her first captain reported that she was &quot;as handy as a [[frigate]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballard, p. 82&quot;&gt;Ballard, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew consisted of 605 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=p4&gt;Parkes, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
The ship had a single two-cylinder [[Trunk engine|trunk steam engine]], made by [[Ravenhill and Hodgson]], that drove a single propeller&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; using steam provided by nine rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=ck7&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The engine, the largest and most powerful yet built,&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; produced {{convert|6064|ihp|lk=in}} which gave ''Lord Clyde'' a speed of {{convert|13.4|kn|lk=in}} under steam.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; The severe vibration of the engine, coupled with the flexibility of the wooden hull, caused major problems during the ship's career. After only two years, the engine was worn out and everything but the [[Surface condenser|condenser]]s and shafting had to be replaced. She carried a maximum of {{convert|600|LT|t}} of coal.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 81, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lord Clyde'' was [[ship rig|ship-rig]]ged with three masts and had a sail area of {{convert|31000|sqft|sqm|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=p7&gt;Parkes, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce drag, the [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] were telescopic and could be lowered. Her best speed under sail alone was {{convert|10.5|kn}}, nearly the slowest of any British ironclad. The ship holds &quot;the double record of being the largest ship of any type or of any nationality ever to enter [[Plymouth Sound]] or [[Spithead]] on sail alone&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballard, p. 82&quot;/&gt;

===Armament===
The ship was initially armed with 24 [[RML 7 inch 6.5 ton gun|seven-inch]] [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns]]. Four pairs of guns were positioned as fore and aft [[chase gun]]s on the upper and main decks. The remaining 16 guns were mounted on the [[broadside]] [[amidships]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|7|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} gun weighed {{convert|6.5|LT|t}} and fired a {{convert|112|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} shell that was able penetrate {{convert|7.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} of armour.&lt;ref name=ck6&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lord Clyde''{{'}}s original armament was replaced during her 1870 refit with a pair of [[RML 9 inch 12 ton gun|RML nine-inch guns]] and 14 [[RML 8 inch 9 ton gun|RML eight-inch guns]]; she only retained a pair of her original seven-inch guns. The latter guns remained in position as forward chase guns on the main deck; one of the {{convert|9|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} guns became the chase gun on the upper deck and the other replaced the pair of seven-inch aft chase guns on the main deck. Also on the upper deck were a pair of {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} guns on the broadside and the remaining 12 eight-inch guns were mounted on the main deck on the broadside amidships.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, pp. 93–96&lt;/ref&gt;

The shell of the nine-inch gun weighed {{convert|254|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|12|LT|t}}. It had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1420|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was rated with the ability to penetrate {{convert|11.3|in|mm|0}} of [[wrought iron|wrought-iron]] armour.&lt;ref name=ck6/&gt; The eight-inch gun weighed {{convert|9|LT|t|spell=in}}; it fired a {{convert|175|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1410|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate {{convert|9.6|in|mm|0}} of armour.&lt;ref name=ck6/&gt;

===Armour===
The entire side of ''Lord Clyde''{{'}}s hull, except for the side of the upper deck, was protected by wrought-iron armour that tapered from {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} at the ends to {{convert|5.5|in|mm|0}} amidships. It extended {{convert|6|ft|1}} below the [[waterline]]. The forward chase guns on the upper deck were protected by 4.5-inch armour plates on the sides of the hull and a 4.5-inch transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] to their rear protected them from [[raking fire]]. The armour was backed by {{convert|30|in|0}} of [[oak]] and the {{convert|1.5|in|0}} iron skin of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service ==
''Lord Clyde'', named after the recently deceased [[Field Marshal]] [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; was ordered on 3 July 1863 from [[Pembroke Dock|Pembroke Naval Dockyard]]. She was [[Keel|laid down]] on 29 September 1863 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 13 October 1864. The ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in June 1866 to run her [[sea trial]]s and completed on 15 September,&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; for the cost of £285,750&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; or £294,481, exclusive of armament.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Commanded by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Roderick Dew, the ship was initially assigned to the Channel Fleet where she spent three months as temporary [[flagship]] before she was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1868. ''Lord Clyde'' made one cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet during which she fractured her steel [[mainyard]] in a [[squall]]. Her engines continued to deteriorate and they were condemned as no longer safe to use by the fleet engineer when she arrived in [[Naples]]. The ship was sent to the [[Malta Dockyard]] under sail for repair, but they could only make temporary repairs that would enable her to reach home.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arrival at [[Plymouth]], ''Lord Clyde'' was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] and a new engine was built for her at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]]. In addition, her four-bladed propeller was replaced by a lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain [[John Bythesea]], an officer who had won the [[Victoria Cross]] during the [[Crimean War]] of 1854–55. ''Lord Clyde'' rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British [[steamship]] that had gone aground off the island of [[Pantellaria]]. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her [[sternpost]], [[rudder post]] and rudder. ''Lord Warden'' was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his [[navigator]] were convicted during their [[court-martial]] and neither ever served at sea again.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Ballard, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Admiralty Board|Admiralty]] ordered that ''Lord Clyde'' be only repaired enough to allow for a passage home; that required six months of work and the ship was escorted back to Plymouth by the ironclad {{HMS|Defence|1861|2}}. She was again paid off upon arrival and her engines and boilers were removed to allow for her hull to be thoroughly inspected. The dockworkers found that her entire hull was colonized by a fungus, partly because unseasoned wood had been used in the ship's construction, and they spent the next three years attempting to kill the fungus and stop the continuing deterioration. All efforts failed and ''Lord Clyde'' was sold for scrap before she lost all value&lt;ref name=b4/&gt; in 1875 for £3,730.&lt;ref name=p7/&gt;
