== wreck ==

Shouldn't the news this ship has been found 77 meters below the sea be included on the page? [[Special:Contributions/85.227.226.243|85.227.226.243]] ([[User talk:85.227.226.243|talk]]) 19:05, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

== Survivors ? ==

Luftwaffe MajorGeneral [[Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke|Hermann Bernhard Ramcke]] served aboard the Prinz Adalbert as an enlisted sailor prior to leaving the crew while the ship was laid-up to join the German Marine Infantry in the trenches in Flanders Belgium prior to her loss. He relates on page 58 of his autobiography &quot;From Ship's Boy to Paratrooper General&quot; that &quot;on 23 October 1915, at Libau, the SMS Prinz Adelbert was torpedoed and sunk with the entire crew by English U-boat E6 while under the command of her former First Officer&quot; according to the notice he received at the front.

E8 ?    3 survivors ? (OK, the former Captain and Ramcke if one views it liberally, but 3 ?)

This article needs proper references to source material. Lacking any, it is my intent to remove the 3 survivors text in the near future as it conflicts with the reference above. Someone please source this article !--[[User:Rwberndt|Rwberndt]] ([[User talk:Rwberndt|talk]]) 02:50, 25 January 2011 (UTC)

:Here's a source: Paul Halpern's ''A Naval History of World War I'', which states &quot;One of [Prinz Adalbert's] magazines exploded, and there were only three survivors&quot; (Page 203). 
:Eventually, [[User:Parsecboy/Sandbox/MT|when I'm done with the last few German battleships]], I'll move on to the cruisers, [[User:Parsecboy/Sandbox/cruisers|of which I've already done a few]]. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 13:26, 25 January 2011 (UTC)

::Thanks for the source. It appears to be a conflict with another, but solid. I am only surprised because Ramcke felt as close a bond with those with which he served as he felt with his family (his men called him Papa Ramcke, his paratroopers broke him out of French prisons and got him to safety in Germany after the war, and he remained in close contact with them his entire life including becoming a travelling salesman just for an excuse). Had there been survivors, it would seem reasonable he would have sought them out and made not when relating the ship's loss in his autobiography rather than just relating the content of the military cable - but that's supposition I admit.--[[User:Rwberndt|Rwberndt]] ([[User talk:Rwberndt|talk]]) 16:02, 25 January 2011 (UTC)
:::It could very well be that he just wasn't aware that the men survived. These things are easy to mix up in wartime. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 17:34, 25 January 2011 (UTC)
::::Surprising, but apparently true. Also - WOW what big change. This article is really well done now. --[[Special:Contributions/129.9.72.11|129.9.72.11]] ([[User talk:129.9.72.11|talk]]) 17:36, 26 January 2011 (UTC)
:::::Something else to consider: it's also possible that these men went on to other ships or served in the Army and were killed later during the war. And thanks! [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 18:38, 26 January 2011 (UTC)

== Ship named for a different Prince Adalbert ==

The ship was not named after Kaiser Wilhelm II´s son [[Prince Adalbert of Prussia (1884-1948)]], who was a mere 16 years old at the time of the christening. It was named for his distant relative [[Prince Adalbert of Prussia (1811-1873)]], an admiral who founded the first unified German fleet. 

Quote from The Times 24 June 1901, the day after the christening ceremony:
´The new cruiser Prince Adalbert was launched yesterday at Kiel in the presence of the German Emperor and Empress, the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Prince Henry, and the young sailor Prince Adalbert of Prussia. The ceremony of christening the ship was performed by Princess Henry, and Prince Henry delivered a speech in which he referred to the services of that Prince Adalbert of Prussia who was formerly commander-in-chief of the navy and after whom the vessel is named.´
:Cheers, thanks for clearing that up. [[User:BB-PB|Parsecboy]] ([[User_talk:BB-PB|talk]]) 23:35, 10 May 2013 (UTC)</text>
