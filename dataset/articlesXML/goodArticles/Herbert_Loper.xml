'''Herbert Bernard  Loper''' (22 October 1896 – 25 August 1989) was a United States Army major general who helped plan the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]] and the [[Okinawa campaign]] during [[World War II]]. He was chief of the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] from 1952 to 1953, and Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1954 to 1961.

A graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, he was commissioned in the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1919. He graduated from the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]] in 1940, and became Assistant Chief, and later Chief, of the Intelligence Division at the Office of the [[Chief of Engineers]] in Washington, DC. In May 1942, he negotiated the Loper-Hotline Agreement, under which responsibility for military mapping and survey of the globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1944, he was appointed Chief Engineer of US Army Forces, [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]]. In this role he was involved with the planning of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]] and the [[Okinawa campaign]]. After the fighting ended, he participated in the [[Occupation of Japan]].

Loper returned to the United States to become Chief of the Joint Photo and Survey Section of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]'s Joint Intelligence Group in 1948. The next year he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. He wrote a report which became known as the Loper Memorandum, which was influential in the decision to develop thermonuclear weapons. He was Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force 3, which was responsible for the conduct the [[Operation Greenhouse]] nuclear tests in the Pacific. In 1951 became Chief of the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]], but was forced to retire after he suffered a heart attack in 1953. He subsequently served as Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee from 2 August 1954 to 14 July 1961.

==Early life==
Herbert Bernard Loper was born in [[Norcatur, Kansas]] on 22 October 1896,{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=193}} the son of Gilford(Gilbert) Lafayette Loper and Hulda Belle Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://records.ancestry.com/Herbert_Bernard_Loper_records.ashx?pid=56588538 |accessdate=25 August 2011 |title=Herbert Bernard Loper (1896 - 1989) |publisher=Ancestry.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Washburn College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1916.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=302}}

Loper was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point from Nebraska and entered on 14 June 1917. However, due to [[World War I]], the course was truncated and his class was graduated early on 1 November 1918. He was ranked sixth in the class, two places behind [[Alfred Gruenther]], and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]].{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=2064}}

After the [[Armistice with Germany]] ended the fighting in November 1918, it was decided to have the 1918 class complete their studies. Loper therefore remained at West Point as a student officer until 11 June 1919, when he again graduated, and was assigned to the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]], as was normal for highly placed graduates. At this time, officers who had not served overseas were sent to Europe to tour the battlefields, and Loper visited battlefields in France, Belgium and Italy, as well as the [[Military occupation|Army of Occupation]] in Germany.{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=2064}}

==Between the wars==
Loper returned to the United States in September and was initially posted to [[Camp A.A. Humphreys]], Virginia.{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=2064}} He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on 16 October 1919.  In October, he was sent to 8th Engineers at [[Fort Bliss]], Texas. He was stationed at [[Camp Travis]], Texas until June 1920, when he commenced studies at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], from which he graduated in August 1921,{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=1423}} with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in engineering.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=302}}

Loper then became Military Assistant to the District Engineer at [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. He reverted to the rank of second lieutenant on 15 December 1922, a common enough occurrence in the wake of the demobilization after World War I, but was again promoted to the rank of first lieutenant on 22 April 1923.{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=1423}} He married Eleanor Cameron Opie in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=30 August 1989 |page=METRO d.07 |title=Gen. Herbert B. Loper Dies; Atomic Energy Liaison Chief }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1923, Loper was posted to the 11th Engineers in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. He returned to the United States in December 1926 and was with the Engineer Reproduction Plant at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] until 31 August 1929. He then went back to Camp A. A. Humphreys, first as a student, and then, 1 September 1930, as an instructor.{{sfn|Cullum|1930|p=1423}} In December 1933, he became Assistant to the District Engineer at Omaha, Nebraska, where he was promoted to [[captain (land)|captain]] on 25 May 1935. In February 1938, he was posted to the 6th Engineers at [[Fort Lawton]], Washington.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=415}}

==World War II==
Loper attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]] from August 1939 to February 1940. On graduation, he was posted to the 7th Engineer Battalion at [[Fort McClellan]], Alabama.{{sfn|Cullum|1940|p=415}} He was Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, and then Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, of the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]]. In June 1940, he became Assistant Chief of the Intelligence Division at the Office of the [[Chief of Engineers]] in Washington, DC, and then chief. Here, he was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on 1 July 1940, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 18 September 1941, and [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on 8 June 1942.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=302}} In May 1942, he negotiated the Loper-Hotline Agreement, under which responsibility for military mapping and survey of the globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom. The agreement also specified technical features such as grids, scales and formats, so Allied servicemen everywhere would have common maps.{{sfn|Casey|1948|p=23}} For his services in this post, he was awarded the [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]] on 28 May 1944.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=302}}

On 28 May 1944, Loper was appointed Chief Engineer of US Army Forces, [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] (USAFPOA),{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=302}} on the specific request of the commander of USAFPOA, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Robert C. Richardson, Jr.]]{{sfn|Dod|1966|p=491}} Loper immediately became involved in planning for the  [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]]. He discovered that the US Navy and Marine Corps did not have adequate map making units, so the task had to be undertaken by the Army. The 64th Topographic Battalion was assigned to the task of mapping the [[Caroline Islands]] and [[Palau]]. However, until [[B-29]] photographic aircraft could be based in the [[Mariana Islands]], much of the aerial survey had to be carried out by aircraft carrier-based naval aircraft.{{sfn|Dod|1966|p=510}} Later Loper, who was promoted to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] on 11 November 1944,{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=302}} was involved in gathering engineer intelligence for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], the [[Okinawa campaign]], and [[Operation Olympic]]. When USAFPOA was merged with [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] in 1945, Loper became Chief of Engineer Intelligence under [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Hugh J. Casey]]. After the fighting ended, Loper became Deputy Engineer of [[United States Far East Command]] during the [[Occupation of Japan]].{{sfn|Dod|1966|p=668}} For his services in the Pacific, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] on 22 September 1945. He was awarded a second [[Legion of Merit]] for his services during the Occupation of Japan on 11 September 1948.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=302}}

==Cold War==
Loper returned to the United States in October 1948, to become Chief of the Joint Photo and Survey Section of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]'s Joint Intelligence Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; On 1 November 1949, he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC).{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=666}} Following the revelation of the espionage activities of [[Klaus Fuchs]] in 1950, Loper and the Chief of the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]], Major General [[Kenneth D. Nichols]], were asked to write a report on the impact of Klaus' activities.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=415}} Their pessimistic report pessimistically concluded that [[Soviet Union]]'s nuclear stockpile and production capacity could well be &quot;equal or actually superior to our own, both as to yields and numbers.&quot; They added that the Soviets might develop, or had already developed, [[thermonuclear weapon]]. The Loper Memorandum, as it became known, was influential in persuading the Joint Chiefs, the [[Secretary of Defense]], and ultimately the [[President of the United States|President]] to authorize a crash program to develop thermonuclear weapons.{{sfn|Brahmstedt|2002|p=76}}

In 1951, Loper was Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force 3, which was responsible for the conduct the [[Operation Greenhouse]] nuclear tests in the Pacific.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=320}} In 1951, he succeeded Nichols as Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project. Nichols considered that Loper was &quot;a very capable engineer, easygoing but firm, and well liked by his associates.&quot;{{sfn|Brahmstedt|2002|p=79}} However, his term in the post was cut short in 1953 when he suffered a heart attack,{{sfn|Brahmstedt|2002|p=99}} and he was ultimately forced to retire from the Army in 1955.{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=193}} However, he served as Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee from 2 August 1954 to 14 July 1961.{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|p=573}} He was also a consultant to the AEC and the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
In the early 1960s, Loper worked for Washington Associates, a Washington, DC, consulting firm. He had lived in [[Bozman, Maryland]], for 28 years. His wife died in 1979, and he entered a nursing home in [[Palm Bay, Florida]] September 1988, and died there of cardiac arrest on 25 August 1989. He was survived by his two sons, Herbert Bernard Loper II and Thomas C. Loper, a retired Army colonel.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;
