== Very hard to understand ==

There seems to be something &quot;missing&quot; in this article.   I find it very hard to understand.   Where are these &quot;pirates&quot; in submarines supposed to be from ?    Colombian drug lords ?   Barbary pirates ?  It makes no sense.

If this is really about forces from a government ( which ? )  covertly sabotaging the maritime trade of some other government,   then really,  that should be clearly stated.  Is that &quot;piracy&quot; ?  [[User:Eregli bob|Eregli bob]] ([[User talk:Eregli bob|talk]]) 02:19, 10 September 2011 (UTC)
:I've added one small sentence to make it clear that the conference was called because of the Italian attacks: except the Italians said that they weren't behind  the submarine attacks. The agreement just says &quot;Pirates&quot; which includes both your Colombian drug lord and those actually acting on behalf of Italy but pretending not to be. 08:38, 10 September 2011 (UTC)

== Notes ==

*&quot;disputed by the lesser nations&quot;: less populous?
*&quot;Proceedings took two forms: discussions between the British and French, and formal situations.&quot;: I don't know what a formal situation is. A meeting of all the parties? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 05:02, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
:Hopefully addressed. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#3A3A3A&quot;&gt;'''Grandiose''' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;([[User:Grandiose|me]], [[User_talk:Grandiose|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Grandiose|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt; 16:53, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::Three minutes on your tweak, Dank? Something more important come up? ;) &lt;span style=&quot;color:#3A3A3A&quot;&gt;'''Grandiose''' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;([[User:Grandiose|me]], [[User_talk:Grandiose|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Grandiose|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt; 17:06, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
*Still reading :)  I'm concerned the images may not be enough to make FAC reviewers wildly happy, even if you have arguments that there aren't particularly relevant images available. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 17:09, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
*&quot;The British and French knew that Italian &quot;pirate&quot; submarine operations had already been paused&quot;: I'm in agreement with the commenter above, I think this topic isn't clear enough.  I think something like the answer you give above should be in the lead, that this was in part directed at Italy.  And ... I don't think it will be clear to the general reader what &quot;Italian &quot;pirate&quot; submarine operations&quot; means; spell it out. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 17:12, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
*An apology ... I'm asking for clarification, and then making changes to your edits, which might prompt the question ... if I knew what I wanted in the first place, why didn't I just make the edit myself? :) Actually, your responses are very helpful, so we're converging quickly on solutions. You have the two qualities copyeditors want most in a writer ... honesty and dedication to the process. Familiarity with style guidelines is really not that important. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 19:46, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
*&quot;perhaps surprisingly&quot;: Who was surprised or dubious? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 21:20, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::Only the author's (Gretton), he doesn't attribute surprise to any particular party at the time. Should I remove the clause? &lt;small&gt;(Grandiose)&lt;/small&gt;
:::What does the sentence say that conveys surprise? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 23:59, 23 December 2011 (UTC)
*&quot;The possibility of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] coming under Italian patrols was agreed.&quot;: Not sure what that means ... was it agreed that it would be discussed later, or were they specifically allowed to patrol by the agreement?
::They were allowed to specifically, but since they weren't there, Italian agreement had not yet been secured. &lt;small&gt;(Grandiose)&lt;/small&gt;
*&quot;Another, on surface ships ... was eventually hardened at the request of the French, so text stating aggressors would be attacked was added.&quot;: Not sure what this means. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 21:46, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::I've had another go at formulating it. &lt;small&gt;(Grandiose)&lt;/small&gt;
*&quot;A Soviet proposal strengthening the agreement was made.&quot;: Not sure what this means. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 21:48, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::That's all the source says, but I feel like I understand better than the reader might, so I've tried again. I wonder if it the concept of &quot;hardening&quot; or &quot;strengthening&quot; an approach that is unclear? If so, I'll find another way. &lt;small&gt;(Grandiose)&lt;/small&gt;
*&quot;Delbos mentioned that similar proposals about surface craft would be prepared.&quot;: Mentioned?  Like, in a footnote, or not in the agreement at all? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 22:59, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::Changed to &quot;announced&quot;. &lt;small&gt;(Grandiose)&lt;/small&gt;
*I don't understand the first paragraph of ''Aftermath''.
::Completely reorganised. Does this help? If not, could be you be more specific? &lt;small&gt;(Grandiose)&lt;/small&gt;
*&quot;The Nationalists made several complaints, none of which were accepted.&quot;: By whom? In what way? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 23:10, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::Changed. &lt;small&gt;(Grandiose)&lt;/small&gt;
*&quot;However, the Nationalists and Italians switched to using air power against shipping.&quot;: This needs a little more ... at least a date, and probably some clue as to how successful the air assaults were. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 23:15, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::There was only one thing I found to add, but it's something. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#3A3A3A&quot;&gt;'''Grandiose''' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;([[User:Grandiose|me]], [[User_talk:Grandiose|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Grandiose|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt; 19:28, 23 December 2011 (UTC)
*Okay that all looks good, and I moved the sentences around a bit in the last section, see if that works.  I just added one question above (What does the sentence say that conveys surprise?) - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 00:21, 24 December 2011 (UTC)
::To answer here rather than above, he says &quot;Surprisingly, [the Soviets agreed]&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#3A3A3A&quot;&gt;'''Grandiose''' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;([[User:Grandiose|me]], [[User_talk:Grandiose|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Grandiose|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt; 16:20, 25 December 2011 (UTC)</text>
