== Comment ==
This article is about a very obscure battle, which is why I like it. I corrected a number of typos and tried to avoid repeating the ship names. I also added the names of the government officers to the text, since they were only in the infobox. It was rated no for Coverage (Accuracy is OK). The article could be improved by doing the following.  
* If possible, tell how the battle influenced the course of the war, if at all. 
* Since the war is fairly obscure, tell us the outcome. 
* Shooting the crew of a sinking ship is usually considered atrocious. Was there any comment about this in the sources? 
* Is there a campaignbox for this war? If so, please add it. 
* Add full casualties to the text. If there is data in the infobox, it should be put in the text also and cited. 
You can reply to my talk page if you like. Thanks. [[User:Djmaschek|Djmaschek]] ([[User talk:Djmaschek|talk]]) 04:27, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

== Some more suggestions ==
I agree with Djmaschek's assessment of the article as Start class and the suggestions they have made are excellent. I also have some suggestions that might help to improve it to B class:
*you might consider adding an &quot;Aftermath&quot; section, this is the suggested format at [[WP:MILMOS/C]] and would allow a discussion of the wider implications of the battle;
*are there any more sources that could be used? Currently there are just two web sites, but there might be some books that could be used to expand the reference base;
*the web citations could be expanded to include publisher and accessdate information;
*the article should be placed in some Categories (at the bottom of the page). 

Anyway, good work so far. Regards, [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 06:05, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

== Yet more ==
I had a look at it, some more suggestions:

* Aftermath section discusses the effect of the sinking on torpedo warfare, but I am missing its effect on the Chilean civil war. Did they also sink the transports? Did the loss of this battle affect congressional strategy? How did the war end? What happened to the ships? (This is the only reason it still fails B-class)
* Be clear what exactly happened. As I understand it this was the first time a warship was sunk by a ''self-propelled'' torpedo, but the article says &quot;the first ironclad to be sunk with a torpedo&quot; and &quot;the first ever successful attack by a torpedo boat against an enemy warship&quot;, which are different claims. Several warship were sunk by &quot;torpedoes&quot; during the American civil war (for example [[Sinking of USS Housatonic]] or [[CSS Albemarle]]).
* Expand the lead to include the aftermath. '''Yoenit''' ([[user talk:Yoenit|talk]]) 12:50, 7 September 2011 (UTC)

== First sunk by torpedo boat ==
&lt;s&gt;I believe this is the first instance of a vessel sunk by a self-propelled torpedo&lt;/s&gt;. Earlier actions involving the American Civil War and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] saw the use of torpedo boats that operated [[spar-torpedo]]s.[[User:XavierGreen|XavierGreen]] ([[User talk:XavierGreen|talk]]) 15:18, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
:It appears this wasnt the first sinking of a vessel by selfpropelled torpedo after all. The Ottoman gunboat ''Intibah'' was attacked and sunk by two Russian torpedoboats using whitehead torpedos during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]].[[User:XavierGreen|XavierGreen]] ([[User talk:XavierGreen|talk]]) 15:28, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
::Umm, by sources say the Intibah was a merchant ship. [[User:Buggie111|Buggie111]] ([[User talk:Buggie111|talk]]) 19:01, 7 September 2011 (UTC)
:::This source [[http://books.google.com/books?id=4Joqn8mzOXwC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=Intibah+gunboat&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Intibah%20gunboat&amp;f=false]] states she was a gunboat, this one [[http://books.google.com/books?id=lPiBMLWfoKEC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Intibah+armed+steamer&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Intibah%20armed%20steamer&amp;f=false]] states she was an armed steamer. I cant seem to find much about her, but likely she was some type of auxiliary cruiser and not a purpose built warship. The book ''The Ottoman Steam Navy, 1828-1923'' may have more information but i do not have access to it at this time.[[User:XavierGreen|XavierGreen]] ([[User talk:XavierGreen|talk]]) 20:47, 7 September 2011 (UTC)

== B-class ==
B-class. Good job. I'm impressed that you added material to address the claim noted above. To be honest, I would probably have put, &quot;it was ''one'' of the first sinkings by a self-propelled torpedo&quot;, and left it at that.
