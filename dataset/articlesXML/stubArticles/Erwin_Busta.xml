      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''Erwin Julius Busta''' (April 12, 1905 – 1982) was an [[Austrian SS|Austrian SS-]]''[[Hauptscharführer]]'' and [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] functionary. During [[World War II]] Busta was also closely associated with the [[V-weapons|German V-weapons program]]; serving on the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] staff at the [[Peenemunde Army Research Center]] and the [[V-2 rocket]] production facility at [[Mittelwerk]]. He was convicted of [[war crimes]] by a [[West German]] court in 1970.

==Early life and Nazi involvement==
Erwin Busta was born in the city of [[Leoben]], [[Austria]] (then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) on April 12, 1905 and originally worked as a [[stone mason|mason]] and [[carpenter]]. He joined both the [[Austrian Nazi Party]] and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) in 1928 and became a member of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS)  in 1930. In July, 1933 the Nazi Party was officially banned in Austria by the government of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]. Busta moved to [[Augsburg]], [[Germany]] shortly afterward where he became a member of the [[:de:Austrian Legion|Austrian Legion]], a [[paramilitary]] group composed of pro-Nazi Austrian expatriates. He underwent [[Basic training|military]] and  [[Police academy|police-training]] and, in 1934, was recruited into the newly established ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]''.&lt;ref&gt;André Sellier: Forced labor in rocket tunnel - History of the Dora camp, Lüneburg 2000, pp. 173f&lt;/ref&gt;

Busta initially served as a guard at the [[Esterwegen]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] and would later go on to work in various capacities at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SellierAndre&quot;&gt;Sellier, Andre. ''A History of the Dora Camp''. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1943 Busta was transferred to the [[Peenemunde Army Research Center]], the main research and testing site for Germany’s [[V-weapons]] program. This location was also home to a small concentration camp whose inmates (mostly [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet]] and [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Polish POWs]]) were employed as [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave-laborers]]. During his time at [[Peenemunde]], Busta worked as a ''[[Lagerführer]]'' (camp leader) of the camp’s central warehouse; supervising the prisoner-laborers as they performed various tasks ranging from construction work to the actual production of [[V-2 rocket|V-2 ballistic missiles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SellierAndre&quot; /&gt;

==Mittelbau-Dora==
Following the [[Bombing of Peenemunde in World War II|bombing of Peenemunde]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in August, 1943 the entire [[V-weapons]] program was relocated by the German government to the [[Nordhausen (district)|Nordhausen-area]] of central Germany. This transition included much of the former staff of [[Peenemunde]], Busta among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;JensChristianWagner&quot;&gt;Jens-Christian Wagner, ''Production of Death: The Mittelbau-Dora'', Göttingen, 2001 S. 666th.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the V-2’s was reestablished at [[Mittelwerk]], a massive armaments facility housed in an elaborate [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean tunnel]] system in the [[Kohnstein]]. Here again, slave-labor was utilized to assemble the rockets. The tunnels at Mittelwerk were staffed by thousands of prisoner-laborers drawn from the inmate population of the nearby [[Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp|Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp. Their work was overseen by both German [[Private military company|civilian contractors]] and the SS.&lt;ref name=&quot;SellierAndre&quot; /&gt;

Beginning in the autumn of 1943 Busta was employed in both areas of the camp; working as a ''[[Blockführer]]'' (block leader) in Dora while also serving as the chief SS warden at [[Mittelwerk]]. Busta was a much-feared figure among the [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|prisoner-laborers]] in the tunnels and developed a reputation for harshness and brutality.&lt;ref name=&quot;SellierAndre&quot; /&gt; Busta was known to have inmates suspected of [[sabotage]] shot or hanged by the SS on a regular basis. In March, 1945 Busta oversaw the [[Mass execution|mass-hanging]] of several dozen [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs |Russian prisoners]] who had attempted to escape. When Dora and Mittelwerk were evacuated in April, 1945 Busta commanded a transport of hundreds of prisoners to the [[Ebensee concentration camp|Ebensee]] concentration camp in his native Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;JensChristianWagner&quot; /&gt;

==Post-war==
After the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of World War II]] in May, 1945 Busta lived under an alias and moved regularly between Germany and Austria. He was thus able to avoid appearing as a defendant at the 1947 [[Dora Trial|Dora war crimes trial]]. He settled permanently in [[West Germany]] in 1952 and resumed using his real name. In November, 1967 he was one of three former SS staff members of [[Mittelbau-Dora]] indicted for [[war crimes]] by the [[Amtsgericht|district court]] of [[Essen]]. Busta entered a [[Plea|plea of not guilty]] to the charges that he had mistreated and murdered prisoners during his time at [[Mittelwerk]]. Busta was found guilty and sentenced to 8 years and a half years in prison on May 8, 1970. However, he never served his sentence owing to [[Compassionate release|reasons of ill-health]]. Busta died in West Germany in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;SellierAndre&quot; /&gt;
