'''USS ''McDougal'' (Destroyer No. 54/DD-54)''' was an {{sclass-|O'Brien|destroyer}} built for the [[United States Navy]] prior to the American entry into [[World War I]]. The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of [[David McDougal|David Stockton McDougal]], a U.S. Navy officer notable for his leadership during an 1863 battle off Japan while in command of {{USS|Wyoming|1859|2}}.

''McDougal'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] by [[Bath Iron Works]] of [[Bath, Maine]], in July 1913 and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in April 1914. The ship was a little more than {{convert|305|ft|m}} in length, just over {{convert|31|ft|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], and had a standard [[displace (ship)|displacement]] of {{convert|1020|LT|MT}}. She was armed with four {{convert|4|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns and had eight {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. ''McDougal'' was powered by a pair of [[steam turbine]]s that propelled her at up to {{convert|29|knots|km/h}}.

After her June 1914 [[commission (ship)|commission]]ing, ''McDougal'' sailed off the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] and in the [[Caribbean]]. She was one of seventeen destroyers sent out to rescue survivors from five victims of German submarine {{SMU|U-53||2}} off the [[Lightship Nantucket]] in October 1916, and carried 6 crewmen from a sunken Dutch [[cargo ship]] to [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, ''McDougal'' was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the [[Irish Sea]] out of [[Queenstown, Ireland]], ''McDougal'' made several unsuccessful attacks on U-boats, and rescued survivors of ships sunk by the German craft. After a collision with a British cargo ship in February 1918, ''McDougal'' was under repair until mid-July, and afterwards, operated out of [[Brest, France]].

Upon returning to the United States after the war, ''McDougal'' conducted operations with the destroyers of the [[United States Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]] until August 1919, when she was placed in reserve, still in commission. After a brief stint of operations in mid 1921, she was placed in reserve until she was [[decommission (ship)|decommission]]ed at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in May 1922. In June 1924, ''Ericsson'' was transferred to the [[United States Coast Guard]] to help enforce [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] as a part of the &quot;[[Rum Patrol]]&quot;. She operated under the name '''USCGC ''McDougal'' (CG-6)''' until May 1933, when she was returned to the Navy. In November she dropped her name to free it for [[USS McDougal (DD-358)|a new destroyer of the same name]], becoming known only as '''''DD-54'''''. She was struck for the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in July 1934 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] in August.

== Design and construction ==
''McDougal'' was authorized in March 1913 as the fourth of six ships of the {{sclass|O'Brien|destroyer|4}}, which was an improved version of the {{sclass|Cassin|destroyer|1}}s authorized in 1911. Construction of the vessel was awarded to [[Bath Iron Works]] of [[Bath, Maine]], which [[keel laying|laid down her keel]] on 29 July 1913. On 22 April 1914, ''McDougal'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed by sponsor Miss Marguerite S. LeBreton,&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; granddaughter of the [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[David McDougal|David Stockton McDougal]], the ship's namesake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Destroyer's sponsor named | work = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date = 19 April 1913 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was the first U.S. Navy ship named for McDougal, notable for his leadership during an 1863 battle off Japan while in command of {{USS|Wyoming|1859|2}}.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; As built, the destroyer was {{convert|305|ft|6|in|m}} in length, {{convert|31|ft|1|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], and [[draft (ship)|drew]] {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; The ship had a standard [[displace (ship)|displace]]ment of {{convert|1020|LT|MT}} and displaced {{convert|1171|LT|MT}} when fully loaded.&lt;!-- full displacement --&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bauer-171 /&gt;&lt;!-- std displacement --&gt;

''McDougal'' had two Zoelly [[steam turbine]]s that drove her two [[screw propeller]]s, and an additional [[triple-expansion steam engine]] connected to one of the [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]]s for cruising purposes. Four oil-burning [[White-Forster boiler]]s powered the engines, which could generate {{convert|17000|shp}}, moving the ship at the design speed of {{convert|29|knots|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt; During her acceptance trials in May 1914, ''McDougal'' averaged {{convert|31.02|knots|km/h}} in a 15-minute run, but topped out at {{convert|33.7|knots|km/h}} for a {{convert|4|nmi|km|adj=on}}, top-speed run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New destroyer does 33.7 knots | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 15 May 1914 | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''McDougal''{{'}}s main [[artillery battery|battery]] consisted of 4 × [[4&quot;/50 caliber gun|{{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}}/50]] [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mark 9 guns,&lt;!-- number, size --&gt;&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=NavWeaps-4in&gt;{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = United States of America: 4&quot;/50 (10.2 cm) Marks 7, 8, 9 and 10 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_4-50_mk9.htm | work = Naval Weapons of the World | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 15 August 2008 | accessdate =22 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- calibers --&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The ''50'' denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 [[calibers#Caliber as measurement of length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as its bore, or {{convert|200|in|m}} in this case. The Mark number is the version of the gun; in this case, the ninth U.S. Navy design of the 4-inch/50 gun.&lt;/ref&gt; with each gun weighing in excess of {{convert|6100|lbs|kg}}.&lt;ref name=NavWeaps-4in /&gt; The guns fired {{convert|33|lbs|kg|adj=on}} [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectile]]s at {{convert|2900|ft/s|m/s}}. At an [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] of 20°, the guns had a range of {{convert|15920|yards|m}}.&lt;ref name=NavWeaps-4in /&gt;

''McDougal'' was also equipped with eight {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The [[General Board of the United States Navy]] had called for two [[anti-aircraft gun]]s for the ''O'Brien''-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating [[mine (naval)|mine]]s.&lt;ref name=Con-123 /&gt; From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for ''McDougal'' or any of the other ships of the class.

== Early career ==
USS ''McDougal'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the United States Navy on 16 June 1914 at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] under the temporary command of [[Lieutenant, junior grade]], [[John H. Hoover]]; [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Leigh C. Palmer]] assumed command on 27 July. After a [[shakedown cruise (ship)|shakedown cruise]], ''McDougal'' began duty with the Torpedo Flotilla, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. Prior to America’s entry into [[World War I]], she operated out of [[New York City|New York]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and carried out maneuvers and tactical exercises along the east coast.

In early April 1915, ''McDougal'' and destroyer {{USS|Parker|DD-48|2}} were temporarily assigned to patrol near the [[New York Quarantine Station]]. There were concerns by [[Dudley Field Malone]], the local port collector, that some of the interned German steamships at New York might try to slip out during a heavy snowstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Eitel still in port in early evening | work = The New York Times | date = 4 April 1915 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While onboard on ''McDougal'' during one of these patrols, Malone discovered what ''[[The New York Times]]'' termed a &quot;widespread conspiracy&quot; intended to supply British warships outside U.S. territorial waters, in violation of the American neutrality in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Finds plot to aid Allies' warships | work = The New York Times | date = 6 April 1915 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She cruised to the [[Caribbean]] and took part in fleet war games between January and May 1916, and in addition served intermittently with the [[Neutrality patrol]]. In May, she was declared the &quot;champion smokeless vessel&quot; of the U.S. Navy by ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' after she was able to steam at {{convert|30|knots|km/h}} for four hours without betraying her position by smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fastest smokeless vessel of navy | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 20 May 1916 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that she was damaged during maneuvers off [[Cape Ann]], and had to put in to the [[Boston Navy Yard]] for leak repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Destroyer is damaged | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 18 June 1916 | page = ES2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 05:30 on Sunday, 8 October 1916, [[radio|wireless]] reports came in of a German submarine stopping ships near the [[Lightship Nantucket]], off the eastern end of [[Long Island]]. After an [[SOS]] from the British steamer {{SS|West Point||2}} was received at about 12:30, Rear Admiral [[Albert Gleaves]] ordered ''McDougal'' and other destroyers at Newport to attend to survivors.&lt;ref name=NYT-U53&gt;{{cite news | title = Newport aroused by U-boat's raid | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E06E3DA1730E733A0575AC0A9669D946796D6CF | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 9 October 1916 | page = 2 | accessdate =20 May 2009 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to a report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 9 October the other ships, in addition to ''McDougal'', were the flotilla's [[destroyer tender]], {{USS|Melville|AD-2|2}}, and sixteen other destroyers: {{USS|Aylwin|DD-47|2}}, {{USS|Balch|DD-50|2}}, {{USS|Benham|DD-49|2}}, {{USS|Cassin|DD-43|2}}, {{USS|Conyngham|DD-58|2}}, {{USS|Cummings|DD-44|2}}, {{USS|Cushing|DD-55|2}}, {{USS|Drayton|DD-23|2}}, {{USS|Ericsson|DD-56|2}}, {{USS|Fanning|DD-37|2}}, {{USS|Jarvis|DD-38|2}}, {{USS|McCall|DD-28|2}}, {{USS|O'Brien|DD-51|2}}, {{USS|Paulding|DD-22|2}}, {{USS|Porter|DD-59|2}}, {{USS|Winslow|DD-53|2}}.

== World War I ==
Soon after the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, ''McDougal'' departed for Europe as a part of the first U.S. destroyer division sent overseas during the war. Steaming with {{USS|Wadsworth|DD-60|2}}, the division's flagship, under the command of [[Joseph K. Taussig]], ''McDougal'', ''Porter'', {{USS|Davis|DD-65|2}}, ''Conyngham'', and {{USS|Wainwright|DD-62|2}} departed New York on 24 April and arrived at [[Queenstown, Ireland]], on 4 May and began patrolling the southern approaches to the [[Irish Sea]] the next day.&lt;ref name=DANFS-Wadsworth&gt;{{cite DANFS | author = [[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w1/wadsworth-i.htm | title = Wadsworth | short = on | link = off | accessdate =22 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''McDougal'' patrolled off the Irish coast, escorting convoys of merchant ships and troop transports, searching for German submarines, and performing rescue operations for ships sunk. When British ship {{SS|Manchester Miller||2}} was torpedoed and sunk by {{SMU|U-66||2}} on 5 June 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Uboat.net | name = Manchester Miller | id = 3864 | type = 1ship | accessdate =20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''McDougal'' sped to her assistance and rescued 33 survivors.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 8 September, as ''McDougal'' escorted a convoy off the southwest coast of England, she detected a surfaced submarine in the early morning hours and gave chase at full speed. The U-boat submerged about {{convert|500|yards|m}} ahead of the closing destroyer, and ''McDougal'' dropped two depth charges which brought an oil slick to the surface. According to the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', ''McDougal''{{'}}s actions prevented an attack on the convoy and resulted in &quot;probable damage&quot; to the submarine.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 4 February 1918, ''McDougal'' and the British cargo ship ''Glenmorag'' collided in the Irish Sea. The destroyer made her way to [[Liverpool]] and underwent repairs that lasted until mid-July. Upon reentering service, ''McDougal'' was transferred to [[Brest, France|Brest]] to serve as an escort for convoys approaching the French port.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Following the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] on 11 November 1918, which ended all fighting, ''McDougal'' remained in French waters for a time. Crewmen aboard ''McDougal'' helped raise money to provide a [[Thanksgiving dinner]] for 150 &quot;poor children&quot; of Brest on 28 November, [[Thanksgiving Day (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tells life on destroyer | work = The New York Times | date = 22 December 1918 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When President [[Woodrow Wilson]] arrived at Brest on {{USS|George Washington|ID-3018|2}} just over two weeks later, the destroyer served as part of that [[transport]]'s escort into the harbor. On 21 December, ''McDougal'' departed Brest 21 December with Destroyer Division 7 and reached New York 8 January 1919.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''McDougal'' resumed duty along the east coast and, during May, provided part of the comprehensive at-sea support as U.S. Navy [[seaplane]]s undertook the historic [[NC-4|first aerial crossing of the Atlantic]]. After completing exercises in the Caribbean, she was placed in commission, in reserve at New York on 7 August. She was laid up in reduced commission at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in the years that followed. She was reactivated for training in [[New England]] waters during the summer of 1921, but returned to Philadelphia, where she was [[decommission (ship)|decommission]]ed on 26 May 1922.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

== United States Coast Guard career ==
On 17 January 1920, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was instituted by law in the United States. Soon, the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury Department]] eventually determined that the [[United States Coast Guard]] simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission.&lt;ref name=DANFS-Tucker&gt;{{cite DANFS | author = Naval History &amp; Heritage Command | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t9/tucker-i.htm | title = Tucker | accessdate =20 May 2009 | short = on | link = off }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''McDougal'' was activated and acquired by the Coast Guard on 7 June 1924.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; Designated ''CG-6'', ''McDougal'' was commissioned on 28 May 1925, and joined the &quot;[[Rum Patrol]]&quot; to aid in the attempt to enforce prohibition laws.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

In August 1929, ''McDougal'' and {{USCGC|Tampa|WPG-48|2}} were dispatched to locate and sink the steamer ''Quimistan'', which had been reported as abandoned and on fire in the Atlantic {{convert|1100|nmi|km}} east of Norfolk, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Old ship afire at sea; no sign of crew seen | work = The New York Times | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = 22 August 1929 | page = 47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1933, ''McDougal'' was one of the Coast Guard ships deployed to search for the U.S. Navy airship {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|2}} when it crashed into the Atlantic on the night of 3/4 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hull | first = Harris B. | authorlink = Harris B. Hull | title = Post's aviation editor sees Navy blimp crash into sea and aids rescue work | work = The Washington Post | date = 5 April 1933 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same month, ''McDougal'' was dispatched to help the Italian steamer ''Voluntas'' when she had requested assistance on the 23rd, but was recalled when ''Voluntas'' rescinded the call for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Rescinds call for help | work = The New York Times | date = 24 April 1933 | page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly eight years of Coast Guard service, ''McDougal'' was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 26 May 1933 and returned to the custody of the U.S. Navy on 30 June.&lt;ref name=USCG /&gt; On 1 November 1933, she dropped the name ''McDougal'' to free it for [[USS McDougal (DD-358)|a new destroyer of the same name]], becoming known only as ''DD-54''. The ship was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 5 July 1934,&lt;ref name=Bauer-171 /&gt; and, on 22 August, was sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] in accordance with the [[London Naval Treaty]] for the limitation of naval armaments.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;
