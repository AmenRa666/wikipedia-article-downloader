The '''Republic F-84 Thunderjet''' was an American [[turbojet]] [[fighter-bomber]] aircraft. Originating as a 1944 [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) proposal for a &quot;day fighter&quot;, the F-84 first flew in 1946. Although it entered service in 1947, the Thunderjet was plagued by so many structural and engine problems that a 1948 U.S. Air Force review declared it unable to execute any aspect of its intended mission and considered canceling the program. The aircraft was not considered fully operational until the 1949 F-84D model and the design matured only with the definitive F-84G introduced in 1951. In 1954, the straight-wing Thunderjet was joined by the swept-wing [[F-84F Thunderstreak]] fighter and RF-84F Thunderflash photo [[reconnaissance aircraft]].

The Thunderjet became the USAF's primary strike aircraft during the [[Korean War]], flying 86,408 sorties and destroying 60% of all ground targets in the war as well as eight Soviet-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG fighters]]. Over half of the 7,524 F-84s produced served with [[NATO]] nations, and it was the first aircraft to fly with the [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds]] demonstration team. The [[USAF]] [[Strategic Air Command]] had F-84 Thunderjets in service from 1948 through 1957.

The F-84 was the first production fighter aircraft to utilize [[inflight refueling]] and the first fighter capable of carrying a [[nuclear weapon]], the [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb]]. Modified F-84s were used in several unusual projects, including the [[FICON project|FICON and Tom-Tom]] dockings to the [[B-29 Superfortress]] and [[B-36]] bomber motherships, and the experimental [[XF-84H Thunderscreech]] [[turboprop]].

The F-84 nomenclature can be somewhat confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The [[F-84F Thunderstreak]] and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop version of the F-84F. The F-84F swept wing version was intended to be a small variation of the normal Thunderjet with only a few different parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.

==Design and development==
[[File:F-84g-51-1231-48fbg-chm-0853.jpg|thumb|An F-84G at [[Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base]], France, in 1953]]

In 1944, [[Republic Aviation]]'s chief designer, [[Alexander Kartveli]], began working on a [[turbojet]]-powered replacement for the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]] piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early [[centrifugal compressor]] turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an [[axial compressor]] turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;

On 11 September 1944, the USAAF released General Operational Requirements for a day fighter with a top speed of 600&amp;nbsp;mph (521&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|kn]], 966&amp;nbsp;km/h), combat radius of 705&amp;nbsp;miles (612&amp;nbsp;[[nautical mile|nmi]], 1,135&amp;nbsp;km), and armament of either six 0.50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) or four 0.60&amp;nbsp;in (15.2&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns. In addition, the new aircraft had to use the [[General Electric]] TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as the [[Allison J35]].

On 11 November 1944, Republic received an order for three prototypes of the new ''XP-84''—Model AP-23.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; Since the design promised superior performance to the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]-built [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|P-80 Shooting Star]] and Republic had extensive experience in building single-seat fighters, no competition was held for the contract. The name ''Thunderjet'' was chosen to continue the Republic Aviation tradition started with the P-47 Thunderbolt while emphasizing the new method of propulsion. On 4 January 1945, even before the aircraft took to the air, the USAAF expanded its order to 25 service test ''YP-84A''s and 75 production ''P-84B''s (later modified to 15 YP-84A and 85 P-84B).

Meanwhile, [[wind tunnel]] testing by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] revealed longitudinal instability and stabilizer skin buckling at high speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; The weight of the aircraft, a great concern given the low thrust of early turbojets, was growing so quickly that the USAAF had to set a gross weight limit of 13,400&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (6,080&amp;nbsp;kg). The results of this preliminary testing were incorporated into the third prototype, designated ''XP-84A'', which was also fitted with a more powerful J35-GE-15 engine with {{convert|4000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|2}} of thrust.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;

The first prototype XP-84 was transferred to Muroc Army Air Field (present-day [[Edwards Air Force Base]]) where it flew for the first time on 28 February 1946 with Major Wallace A. &quot;Wally&quot; Lien at the controls. It was joined by the second prototype in August, both aircraft flying with J35-GE-7 engines producing {{convert|3,745|lbf|kN|abbr=on|2}}. The 15 YP-84As delivered to Patterson Field (present-day [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]]) for service tests differed from XP-84s by having an upgraded J35-A-15 engine, carrying six 0.50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s (four in the nose and one in each wing root), and having the provision for wingtip fuel tanks holding 226&amp;nbsp;U.S. [[gallon|gal]] (856&amp;nbsp;L) each.

Due to delays with delivery of jet engines and production of the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not thoroughly studied. This proved problematic later.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;

After the creation of the [[United States Air Force]] by the [[National Security Act of 1947]], the ''Pursuit'' designation was replaced with ''Fighter'', and the P-84 became the ''F-84''.

F-84s were assigned to the [[27th Fighter Wing]], 27th Fighter Escort Wing, 27th Strategic Fighter Wing, 31st Fighter Escort Wing, 127th Fighter Day Wing, 127th Fighter Escort Wing, 127th Strategic Fighter Wing, 407th Strategic Fighter Wing and the 506th Strategic Fighter Wing of the [[Strategic Air Command]] from 1947 through 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren&quot;&gt;McLaren 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The F-84B, which differed from YP-84A only in having faster-firing M3 machine guns, became operational with [[14th Fighter Group]] at [[Dow Field]], [[Bangor, Maine]] in December 1947. Flight restrictions followed immediately, limiting maximum speed to [[Mach number|Mach 0.8]] due to [[control reversal]], and limiting maximum acceleration to 5.5&amp;nbsp;[[g force|''g'']] (54&amp;nbsp;m/s²) due to wrinkling of the fuselage skin. To compound the problem, parts shortages and maintenance difficulties earned the aircraft the nickname, &quot;Mechanic's Nightmare&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; On 24 May 1948, the entire F-84B fleet was grounded due to structural failures.

[[File:14fw-f-84-1948.jpg|thumb|P-84Bs of the 48th Fighter Squadron, 14th Fighter Group, 1948.]]

A 1948 review of the entire F-84 program discovered that none of the F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8 million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;

The ''F-84C'' featured a somewhat more reliable J35-A-13 engine and had some engineering refinements. Being virtually identical to the F-84B, the C model suffered from all of the same defects and underwent a similar structural upgrade program in 1949. All F-84Cs were withdrawn from active service by 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;

The structural improvements were factory-implemented in the ''F-84D'', which entered service in 1949. Wings were covered with thicker aluminum skin, the fuel system was winterized and capable of using [[JP-4]] fuel, and a more powerful J35-A-17D engine with {{convert|5000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|2}} was fitted. It was discovered that the untested wingtip fuel tanks contributed to wing structural failures by inducing excessive twisting during high-&quot;g&quot; maneuvers.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; To correct this, small triangular fins were added to the outside of the tanks. The F-84D was phased out of USAF service in 1952 and left [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) service in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;

The first effective and fully capable Thunderjet was the ''F-84E'' model which entered service in 1949. The aircraft featured the J35-A-17 engine, further wing reinforcement, a 12&amp;nbsp;in (305&amp;nbsp;mm) fuselage extension in front of the wings and 3&amp;nbsp;in (76&amp;nbsp;mm) extension aft of the wings to enlarge the cockpit and the avionics bay, an A-1C gunsight with APG-30 radar, and provision for an additional pair of 230&amp;nbsp;gal (870&amp;nbsp;L) fuel tanks to be carried on underwing pylons.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; The latter increased the combat radius from {{convert|850|to|1000|mi|nmi km}}.

One improvement to the original F-84 design was rocket racks that folded flush with the wing after the 5-inch HVAR rockets were fired, which reduced drag over the older fixed mounting racks. This innovation was adopted by other U.S. jet fighter-bombers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Rocket Racks Fold into Wing.&quot;] ''August 1948'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Js-municiamento f-84.jpg|thumb|A Portuguese F-84 being loaded with ordnance in the 1960s, at Luanda Air Base, during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]].]]

Despite the improvements, the in-service rates for the F-84E remained poor with less than half of the aircraft operational at any given time.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.

The definitive straight-wing F-84 was the ''F-84G'' which entered service in 1951. The aircraft introduced a refueling boom receptacle in the left wing,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=49gDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wPfY03bHQE&amp;sig=cm-xWdo-VtOnlEK9x6gfUnNseoc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4cADUIjMAeKS2QXnp82wCw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6wEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Mid-Air Refueling Increases Range of F-84 Thunderjet Fighters.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1951, p. 98, bottom page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[autopilot]], [[Instrument Landing System]], J35-A-29 engine with {{convert|5560|lbf|kN|abbr=on|2}} of thrust, a distinctive framed canopy (also retrofitted to earlier types), and the ability to carry a single [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; The F-84G was retired from USAF in the mid-1960s.

Starting in the early 1960s, the aircraft was deployed by the [[Força Aérea Portuguesa]] (FAP) during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in Africa. By 1972, all four operating F-84 aircraft were supplementing the FAP in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/specific/guerra_colonial/uploaded/graficos/dispositivos/fapdispositivo.swf |title=Força Aérea Portuguesa Dispositivo

===Flying the Thunderjet===
Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet's takeoff performance left much to be desired. In hot Korean summers with a full combat load, the aircraft routinely required 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft (3,000&amp;nbsp;m) of runway for takeoff even with the help of [[JATO|RATO]] bottles (two or four of these were carried, each producing 1,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (4.4&amp;nbsp;kN) of thrust for 14 seconds).&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; All but the lead aircraft had their visibility obscured by the thick smoke from the rockets. Early F-84s had to be pulled off the ground at 160&amp;nbsp;mph (140&amp;nbsp;kn, 260&amp;nbsp;km/h) with the control stick held all the way back. Landings were made at a similar speed, for comparison the [[North American P-51 Mustang]] landed at approximately 120&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;kn, 190&amp;nbsp;km/h). Despite the &quot;hot&quot; landing speeds, the Thunderjet was easy to fly on instruments and crosswinds did not present much of a problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham&quot;&gt;Higham, R. and C. Williams. ''Flying Combat Aircraft of USAAF-USAF (Vol.1)''. Rockville, Maryland: Air Force Historical Foundation, 1975. ISBN 0-8138-0325-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F-84E launchs rockets.jpg|thumb|An F-84E launching rockets.]]

Thanks to the thick straight wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes resulted in a violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham&quot;/&gt; Above 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft (4,600&amp;nbsp;m), the F-84 could be flown faster but at the expense of severe buffeting. Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft (3,000&amp;nbsp;m) possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham&quot;/&gt; The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]]s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3&amp;nbsp;Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham&quot;/&gt; The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the [[Gyro gunsight|computing gunsight]] aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary ruggedness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham&quot;/&gt;

Pilots nicknamed the Thunderjet &quot;The Lead Sled&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren&quot;/&gt; It was also called &quot;The Iron Crowbar&quot;, &quot;a hole sucking air&quot;, &quot;The Hog&quot; (&quot;The Groundhog&quot;), and &quot;The World's Fastest Tricycle&quot;, &quot;Ground Loving Whore&quot; as a testament to its long takeoff rolls.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren&quot;/&gt; F-84 lore stated that all aircraft were equipped with a &quot;sniffer&quot; device that, upon passing [[V speeds|''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], would look for the dirt at the end of the runway. As soon as the device could smell the dirt, the controls would turn on and let the pilot fly off the ground. In the same vein, it was suggested a bag of dirt should be carried in the front landing gear well. Upon reaching ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the pilot would dump the dirt under the wheels, fooling the sniffer device.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren&quot;/&gt;

===Korean War===
The Thunderjet had a distinguished record during the [[Korean War]]. Although the F-84B and F-84C could not be deployed because their J35 engines had a service life of only 40 hours, the F-84D and F-84E entered combat with [[27th Special Operations Wing|27th Fighter Escort Group]] on 7 December 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt; The aircraft were initially tasked with escorting the B-29 Superfortress bombers. The first Thunderjet air-to-air victory was scored on 21 January 1951 at the cost of two F-84s.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren&quot;/&gt; The F-84 was a generation behind the swept-wing Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] and outmatched, especially when the MiGs were flown by more-experienced pilots, and the MiG counter-air mission was soon given to the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]]. Like its famous predecessor, the P-47, the F-84 switched to the low-level interdiction role at which it excelled.

[[File:Republic F-84G-26-RE Thunderjet 51-16719.jpg|thumb|F-84G-26-RE Thunderjet 51-16719 while assigned to the 3600th Air Demonstration Team (USAF Thunderbirds), 1954.]]
The F-84 flew a total of 86,408 missions, dropping 55,586&amp;nbsp;tons (50,427&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s) of bombs and 6,129&amp;nbsp;tons (5,560&amp;nbsp;metric tons) of [[napalm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren&quot;/&gt; The USAF claimed F-84s were responsible for 60% of all ground targets destroyed in the war. Notable F-84 operations included the 1952 [[attack on the Sui-ho Dam]]. During the war, the F-84 became the first USAF fighter to utilize [[aerial refueling]]. In aerial combat, F-84 pilots were credited with eight MiG-15 kills against a Soviet-claimed loss of 64&amp;nbsp;aircraft. The total losses were 335 F-84D, E and G models.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren&quot;/&gt;

===Portuguese Overseas War===
In 1961, the [[Portuguese Air Force]] sent 25 of their remaining F-84G to [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]]. There they formed the ''Esquadra 91'' (91st Squadron), based at Luanda Air Base. From then on, the F-84s were engaged in the [[Angolan War of Independence|Angolan Theater]] of the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Portuguese Overseas War]], being mainly employed in [[air strike]] missions against the separatist guerrillas.

The last F-84 were kept operational in Angola until 1974.

===Notable achievements===
* The F-84 was the first aircraft flown by the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds]], which operated F-84G Thunderjets from 1953 to 1955 and F-84F Thunderstreaks from 1955 to 1956. The F-84E was also flown by the [[Skyblazers]] team of [[United States Air Forces Europe]] (USAFE) from 1950 to 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;
* On 7 September 1946, the second XP-84 prototype set a national speed record of 607.2&amp;nbsp;mph (527.6&amp;nbsp;kn, 977.2&amp;nbsp;km/h), slightly slower than the world record 612.2&amp;nbsp;mph (532.0&amp;nbsp;kn, 985.2&amp;nbsp;km/h) held by the British [[Gloster Meteor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;
* On 22 September 1950, two EF-84Es, flown by [[David C. Schilling]] and Col. William Ritchie, flew across the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] from Great Britain to the United States. Ritchie's aircraft ran out of fuel over [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] but the other successfully made the crossing which took ten hours two minutes and three aerial refuelings. The flight demonstrated that large numbers of fighters could be rapidly moved across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;
* F-84G was the first fighter with built-in aerial refueling capability and the first single-seat aircraft capable of carrying a nuclear bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;
* On 20 August 1953, 17 F-84Gs using aerial refueling flew from the United States to the United Kingdom. The 4,485-mile (3,900&amp;nbsp;nmi, 7,220&amp;nbsp;km) journey was the longest-ever nonstop flight by jet fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;/&gt;
* In 1955, an F-84G became the first aircraft to be [[zero-length launch]]ed from a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R9ZJT9CsO4WcgQeiuL2lDg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=1954%20Popular%20Mechanics%20January&amp;f=true &quot;Fighter Plane Launched Like Missile From Truck Platform.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1955, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, the F-84/F-84F was replaced by the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100 Super Sabre]] and the RF-84F by the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo|RF-101 Voodoo]] in USAF units, being relegated to duty in the Air National Guard. The last F-84F Thunderflash retired from the ANG in 1971. Three [[Hellenic Air Force]] RF-84Fs that were retired in 1991 were the last operational F-84s.

==Variants==

===Straight-wing variants===
[[File:Republic XP-84A and YP-84As.jpg|thumb|right|The XP-84A (foreground) and YP-84As]]

;XP-84: The first two prototypes.
;XP-84A: The third prototype with a more powerful J35-GE-15 engine. This airframe was subsequently modified with a pointed fairing over the intake and lateral NACA intakes were installed into the intake trunks. &lt;!---Other than two photographs, no other information has been found about this project.---this needs a ref----&gt;
;YP-84A: Service test aircraft; 15 built.
;P-84B (F-84B):First production version, J35-A-15 engine; 226 built.
;F-84C: Reverted to the more reliable J35-A-13 engine, improved fuel, hydraulic and electrical systems; 191 built.
;F-84D: J35-A-17 engine, various structural improvements. The [[pitot tube]] was moved from the tail fin to the splitter in the air intake with fins added to the wingtip fuel tanks; 154 built.
[[File:F84E&amp;G-frenchweb.jpg|thumb|F84 E&amp;G Thunderjet French Air Force 1951-1955]]
;EF-84D: Two F-84Ds, EF-84D 48-641 and EF-84D 48-661 were modified with coupling devices; 641 starboard wing, 661 port wing for &quot;[[FICON project|Tip-Tow Project]] MX106 Wing Coupling Experiments.&quot; An EB-29A 44-62093 was modified with coupling devices on both wings. Because of the difference in landing gear lengths, the three aircraft took off separately and couple/uncoupled in flight. The pilot of 641 was Major John M. Davis and the pilot of 661 was Major C.E. &quot;Bud&quot; Anderson.
: &quot;One of the more interesting experiments undertaken to extend the range of the early jets in order to give fighter protection to the piston-engine bombers, was the provision for inflight attachment/detachment of fighter to bomber via wingtip connections. One of the several programs during these experiments was done with a B-29 mother ship and two F-84D 'children', and was code named 'Tip Tow'. A number of flights were undertaken, with several successful cycles of attachment and detachment, using, first one, and then two F-84s. The pilots of the F-84s maintained manual control when attached, with roll axis maintained by elevator movement rather than aileron movement. Engines on the F-84s were shut down in order to save fuel during the 'tow' by the mother ship, and inflight engine restarts were successfully accomplished. The experiment ended in disaster during the first attempt to provide automatic flight control of the F-84s, when the electronics apparently malfunctioned. The left hand F-84 rolled onto the wing of the B-29, and the connected aircraft both crashed with loss of all on board personnel (Anderson had uncoupled so did not crash with the other two aircraft).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Major Clarence E. &quot;Bud&quot;. &quot;Aircraft Wingtip Coupling Experiments.&quot; ''Society of Experimental Test Pilots.''&lt;/ref&gt;

;F-84E: J35-A-17D engine, [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] [[AN/APG-30]] radar-ranging gunsight, retractable attachments for [[JATO|RATO]] bottles, inboard wing hardpoints made &quot;wet&quot; to permit carrying an additional pair of 230&amp;nbsp;U.S. gal (870&amp;nbsp;L) fuel tanks. Most aircraft were retrofitted with F-84G-style reinforced canopies. The fuselage was stretched 15&quot;; the canopy was lengthened 8&quot;, the canopy frame was lengthened 12&quot; (accounting for another 4&quot;), and a 3&quot; splice panel was added aft of the canopy. The stretch was not done to enlarge the cockpit but rather to enable a larger fuel tank, provide additional space for equipment under the canopy behind the pilot's seat, and to improve aerodynamics. This can be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of two fuel vents on ventral rear fuselage, the added radar in the nose splitter, and the pitot tube was moved downward from mid-height in the splitter (as on the F-84D) to clear the radar installation. 843 built. F-84E 49-2031 was a test aircraft for air-to-air missiles. F-84E 50-1115 was a test aircraft for the FICON project.
;EF-84E: Two F-84Es were converted into test prototypes, to test various methods of air-to-air refueling. EF-84E 49-2091 was used as a probe-and-drogue test aircraft. The probe was mid-span on the port wing. Production aircraft with probes (removable) had the probe fitted to the auxiliary wing tanks. EF-84E 49-2115 was used as a FICON test aircraft with a B-36 host. EF-84E 49-1225 and EF-84E 51-634 were test aircraft for the ZELMAL (Zero-length launch, Mat landing) experiments version for point defense, used the booster rocket from [[MGM-1 Matador]] cruise missile.
;F-84G: Single-seat fighter-bomber capable of delivering the [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb]] using the LABS, J35-A-29 engine, autopilot, capable of inflight refueling using both the boom (receptacle in left wing leading edge) and drogue (probe fitted to wingtip fuel tanks), introduced the multi-framed canopy which was later retrofitted to earlier straight-winged F-84s. A total of 3,025 were built (1,936 for [[NATO]] under MDAP). The larger engine required more air to the face of the engine than the intake could provide at taxiing speeds. Commencing with block 20, auxiliary &quot;suck-in&quot; doors were added laterally to the intake runners ahead of the wing roots. When the engine was deficient of air, the spring-loaded doors were sucked open by the vacuum created by the engine to allow additional air to the engine. When the aircraft reached sufficient airspeed to supply adequate air through the nose intake, the auxiliary doors would close. F-84G 51-1343 was modified with a periscope system to test the periscope installation proposed for the [[Republic XF-103]].
;F-84KX: Eighty ex-USAF F-84Bs converted into target drones for the [[United States Navy]].
;RF-84G: F-84G Thunderjets converted by France and Yugoslavia for recon duty with cameras in the ventral fuselage and modified auxiliary wing tanks.
;YF-96A aka YF-84F aka YRF-84K: F-84E 49-2430 converted to swept wing configuration. The &quot;first prototype&quot; for the F-84F Thunderstreak. Canopy and ventral speed brake carried over from Thunderjet. Originally with a V-windscreen, later reverted to the standard Thunderjet flat windscreen. Modified by adding a fixed hook at the weapons bay and anhedral horizontal tailplane to enable FICON tests (trapeze capture) with GRB-36D mother ship. The airframe was capable of higher speeds than the Thunderjet engine could deliver. The YF-84F was a follow on with a larger engine and deepened fuselage.
;YF-84F: F-84G 51-1344 converted to swept wing configuration. The &quot;second prototype&quot; for the F-84F Thunderstreak. Fuselage deepened by {{convert|7|in|mm}} to accommodate larger engine. Canopy and ventral speed brake carried over from Thunderjet, tail configuration same as YF-96A.
;YF-84F aka YRF-84F: F-84G 51-1345 converted to swept wing configuration with a pointed nose and lateral intakes. This was a test airframe to evaluate the effects of moving the intakes to the wing roots. Like 1344, the fuselage was deepened by {{convert|7|in|mm}} to accommodate larger engine. Canopy and ventral speed brake carried over from Thunderjet, tail configuration same as YF-96A. For the swept wing versions of the F-84 series, see [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]]
;Tip-Tow: See EF-84D above, did not become operational. See [[FICON project]]
;Tom-Tom: Two RF-84K and B-36 wingtip coupling experiment, did not become operational. See [[FICON project]]
;FICON: F-84E and GRB-36D trapeze system, became operational. See [[FICON project]]

===Swept-wing variants===
{{main article|Republic F-84F Thunderstreak|Republic XF-84H}}

;YF-84F: Two swept-wing prototypes of the F-84F, initially designated ''YF-96A''.
;F-84F Thunderstreak: [[Swept wing]] version with [[Wright J65]] engine.
;RF-84F Thunderflash: Reconnaissance version of the F-84F, 715 built.
;RF-84K [[FICON project]]: Reconnaissance version of the F model, 25 built to hang from the Consolidated [[Convair B-36|B-36 Peacemaker]].
;[[Republic XF-84H|XF-84H Thunderscreech]]: Experimental supersonic-turboprop version.
;YF-84J: Two conversions with the [[General Electric J73]] engine.
