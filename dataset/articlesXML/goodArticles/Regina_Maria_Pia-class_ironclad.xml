The '''''Regina Maria Pia'' class''' was a group of four [[ironclad warship]]s built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) in the 1860s. The class comprised four ships, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|San Martino||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ancona||2}}. They were built by French shipyards, since Italian yards were unable to meet the demand of the rapidly expanding Italian fleet. The ships were [[broadside ironclad]]s and mounted a [[artillery_battery#Naval_usage|battery]] of twenty-six [[muzzle loading]] guns.

All four ships saw action at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866. ''Regina Maria Pia'' was badly burned in the battle, but the other three vessels were not seriously damaged. The ships served in a variety of roles for the remainder of their long careers; they were modernized in the late 1880s and thereafter used as a [[training ship]]s. ''Regina Maria Pia'', ''San Martino'', and ''Ancona'' were discarded in 1903&amp;ndash;04, and ''Castelfidardo'' joined them in the [[ship breaking|breaker's yard]] in 1910.

==Design==
Following the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]] in 1861, the new ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) began a construction program to prepare a fleet of [[ironclad warship]]s capable of defeating the [[Austrian Navy]]. Italy considered the [[Austrian Empire]] to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including [[Venice]]. The nascent Italian shipyards were incapable of building the number of ships the new fleet would require, so most of this first generation of ironclads were built by foreign ship builders. In 1862, the four ships of the ''Regina Maria Pia'' class were ordered from French shipyards, under the direction of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], then the Italian Navy Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; These ships were designed by the French builders.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;

===General characteristics and machinery===
[[File:Regina Maria Pia (1863) Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''Regina Maria Pia'' in her 1888 configuration]]

The ships of the ''Regina Maria Pia'' class varied in their dimensions. ''Regina Maria Pia'' and ''San Martino'', built by the same shipyard, were identical in size, while ''Castelfidardo'' and ''Ancona'', though each built by different shipyards, also were identical. The first two ships were {{convert|75.48|m|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|81.2|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]], and they had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|15.24|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.35|m|abbr=on}}. ''Castelfidardo'' and ''Ancona'' were {{convert|76|m|abbr=on}} between perpendiculars and {{convert|81.8|m|abbr=on}} overall, with a beam of {{convert|15.16|m|abbr=on}} and a draft of 6.35&amp;nbsp;m. The first two ships displaced {{convert|4201|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|4527|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load, while ''Castelfidardo'' displaced {{convert|4191|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} normally and {{convert|4527|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} at full load. Curiously, ''Ancona'' was the lightest ship normally, at {{convert|4157|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}}, but the heaviest at full load, at {{convert|4619|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;&lt;ref name=O342&gt;Ordovini et al., p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships were constructed with iron [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]]. They were protected by iron [[belt armor]] that was {{convert|4.75|in|0}} thick and extended for the entire length of the hull at the [[waterline]]. The battery deck was protected by {{convert|4.3|in|abbr=on|0}} of iron plate. Each vessel had a crew of 480&amp;ndash;485&amp;nbsp;officers and men. The ships were initially [[schooner]]-rigged to supplement the steam engine, though their masts were later reduced to a [[barque]] rig. Ultimately, they lost their sailing rig completely, having it replaced with a pair of [[military mast]]s with [[fighting top]]s.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;&lt;ref name=O342/&gt;

The ships' propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion, two-cylinder [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by six coal-fired, rectangular [[boiler]]s. The boilers were trunked into a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] placed [[amidships]]. Her engine produced a top speed of {{convert|12.96|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|2924|ihp|lk=in}}. Each ship had a capacity of {{convert|485|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} of coal, which allowed them to steam for {{convert|2600|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;&lt;ref name=O342/&gt;

===Armament===
The ''Regina Maria Pia'' class were [[broadside ironclad]]s, and they were initially armed with a [[main battery]] of four 72-pounder smooth-bore {{convert|8|in|abbr=on|0}} [[muzzle-loading]] guns and twenty-two 32-pounder rifled {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} muzzle loaders, though their armament changed throughout her career. Most of these guns were placed on the broadside, but two of the 164&amp;nbsp;mm guns were mounted in an armored [[bunker]] forward and a third was placed in a similar mount at the stern, as [[chase gun]]s. The ships were also fitted with a [[naval ram|ram bow]] that was {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;&lt;ref name=O342/&gt;

In 1871, all four ships were re-armed with two {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} muzzle-loading guns and eight 8&amp;nbsp;in muzzle-loading guns, with a ninth 8&amp;nbsp;in gun added in 1880. ''Regina Maria Pia'' and ''San Martino'' were later re-equipped with eight {{convert|6|in|abbr=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] (QF) guns, five {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on}} QF guns, four {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} QF guns, and eight {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss revolver cannon]]. In 1884, ''Castelfidardo'' received the same battery of light guns, though she had a sixth 4.7&amp;nbsp;in gun. When ''Ancona'' was similarly re-armed, she only had two of the 37&amp;nbsp;mm revolver cannon. All four ships were also equipped with three [[torpedo tube]]s, with the exception of ''Castelfidardo'', which received two tubes.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;&lt;ref name=O342/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Castelfidardo frigate 1864 01.jpg|thumb|''Castelfidardo'' in Naples in late 1866]]

All four ships of the class entered service in time to see action during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] against the Austrian Navy in 1866. Persano, now the commander of the Italian fleet, adopted a cautious strategy and conducted only one major offensive operation, which was directed at the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 217–222&lt;/ref&gt; There, the Austrian fleet under [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] attacked the Italians. The four ''Regina Maria Pia''s all took part in the ensuing [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Regina Maria Pia'' had been set on fire and badly burned in the battle, and minor fires were started by Austrian shells aboard ''San Martino'' and ''Castelfidardo'', but neither were seriously damaged. ''Ancona'' emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor damage to her iron plates.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Italian naval budget was slashed; the cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of [[Civitavecchia]] in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors [[conscript]]ed to man them were sent home.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; As the Italian fleet began to rebuild in the 1870s, the ''Regina Maria Pia''s returned to active service in a variety of roles, both in the main fleet and in Italy's overseas empire.&lt;ref&gt;Ordovini et al., pp. 343–344&lt;/ref&gt; All four ships were modernized in the late 1880s, and were thereafter used as [[training ship]]s. ''Regina Maria Pia'', ''Ancona'', and ''San Martino'' were stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1903&amp;ndash;04, while ''Castelfidardo'' lingered on as a torpedo training ship until 1910, when she too was sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]].&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;
