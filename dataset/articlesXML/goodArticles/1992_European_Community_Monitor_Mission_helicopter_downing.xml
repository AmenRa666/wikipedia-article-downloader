{{Campaignbox Croatian War of Independence}}
The '''1992 European Community Monitor Mission helicopter downing''' was an incident that occurred on 7 January 1992, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]], in which a [[European Community Monitor Mission]] (ECMM) helicopter carrying five [[European Community]] (EC) [[military observer|observers]] was downed by a [[Yugoslav Air Force]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], in the air space above the village of [[Podrute]], near [[Novi Marof]], [[Croatia]]. An Italian and a French officer and three Italian [[non-commissioned officer]]s were killed. Another ECMM helicopter flying in formation with the attacked helicopter made an emergency landing. The second helicopter carried a crew and a visiting diplomat, all of whom survived. The incident was condemned by the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the EC. As a result of the incident, the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] authorities suspended the head of the air force, and the Yugoslav defense minister, [[General]] [[Veljko Kadijević]], resigned his post. The events followed the end of the first stage of the war in Croatia and closely preceded the country's international recognition.

The MiG-21 pilot, [[Lieutenant]] Emir Šišić, disappeared after the incident. He was [[trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] together with his superiors by Croatian authorities, convicted, and sentenced to extended imprisonment. Šišić was subsequently arrested in Hungary in 2001 and extradited to Italy, where he was tried, convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In 2006, he was turned over to Serbia for the remainder of the sentence, but released in 2008. Two other Yugoslav officers were tried ''in absentia'' in Italy and convicted in 2013, while Serbia was ordered to pay monetary damages to the victims' families. The victims were posthumously decorated by Italy and France, respectively.

==Background==
{{further information|1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia}}
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions worsened. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' – JNA) confiscated [[Croatia]]'s [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] (''Teritorijalna obrana'' - TO) weapons to minimize resistance.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=117}} On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] by [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]],{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=118}} centered on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around Knin,{{sfn|''The New York Times''|19 August 1990}} parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[eastern Croatia]].{{sfn|ICTY|12 June 2007}}

Following the [[Pakrac clash]] between Serb insurgents and [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991–95|Croatian special police]] in March 1991,{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=384–385}} the conflict had escalated into the [[Croatian War of Independence]].{{sfn|''The New York Times''|3 March 1991}} The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=119}} In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as [[SAO Krajina]], with Serbia.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|2 April 1991}}

In May, the [[Croatian government]] responded by forming the [[Croatian National Guard]] (''Zbor narodne garde'' - ZNG),{{sfn|EECIS|1999|pp=272–278}} but its development was hampered by a [[United Nations]] (UN) [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 713|arms embargo]] introduced in September.{{sfn|''The Independent''|10 October 1992}}

The [[Brioni Agreement]] established an observer mission which was eventually called the [[European Community Monitor Mission]] (ECMM). The mission was tasked with monitoring the disengagement of belligerents in the [[Ten-Day War]] in neighbouring [[Slovenia]],{{sfn|Ahrens|2007|p=43}} and the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia.{{sfn|O'Shea|2005|p=16}} However, on 16 August, an ECMM helicopter was hit by Croatian Serb gunfire in western [[Slavonia]], injuring one of the pilots.{{sfn|Mesić|2004|p=236}} This caused the ECMM's scope of work to be formally expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.{{sfn|Miškulin|2010|p=310}}

On 8 October, [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia]],{{sfn|''Narodne novine''|8 October 1991}} and a month later the ZNG was renamed the [[Croatian Army]] (''Hrvatska vojska'' - HV).{{sfn|EECIS|1999|pp=272–278}} The fiercest fighting of the war occurred around this time, when the [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia]] culminated in the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]],{{sfn|Bjelajac|Žunec|2009|pp=249–250}} and the [[Battle of Vukovar]].{{sfn|''The New York Times''|18 November 1991}} In November, Croatia, Serbia and the JNA agreed upon the [[Vance plan]] entailing a ceasefire, protection of civilians in specific areas designated as [[United Nations Protected Area (UNPROFOR)|United Nations Protected Areas]], and the presence of UN peacekeepers in Croatia.{{sfn|Armatta|2010|pp=194–196}} The ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1992.{{sfn|Marijan|2012|p=103}} In December 1991, the [[European Community]] (EC) announced its decision to grant formal [[diplomatic recognition]] to Croatia as of 15 January 1992.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|24 December 1991}}

==Incident==
[[File:Austria Radar plot&amp;nbsp;07 Jan. 1992.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Austrian Armed Forces]] radar plot of the incident]]
On 7 January 1992, a pair of [[Italian Army]] [[Agusta]]-Bell [[AB-206]]L LongRanger helicopters operated by ECMM observers entered Croatian [[air space]] from [[Hungary]].{{sfn|''Nacional''|14 November 2006}} The helicopters were white-painted and unarmed.{{sfn|Ripley|2013|p=9}} They were flying from the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] capital of [[Belgrade]] to [[Zagreb]] via [[Kaposvár]], Hungary.{{sfn|''Los Angeles Times''|12 January 1992}} Authorities in Belgrade claim the helicopters were authorised to fly to Hungary, but that the pilots were warned they were not allowed to fly to Zagreb because no flights in Croatian airspace were permitted.{{sfn|''Politika''|23 November 2006}} The EC dismissed those claims, saying that the flight was approved in advance by Yugoslav air controllers.{{sfn|''Los Angeles Times''|12 January 1992}} The approval was forwarded to the [[Yugoslav Air Force]] operations centre, but the order was never forwarded to the 5th Aviation Corps in [[Bihać]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{sfn|''Nacional''|14 November 2006}}

After the two helicopters were spotted by a Yugoslav Air Force tracking radar near Bihać, a pair of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, which were on standby at the [[Željava Air Base]] near Bihać, were ordered to take off and intercept the aircraft.{{sfn|''Politika''|23 November 2006}} The MiG-21s, assigned to the 125th Squadron of the [[117th Fighter Aviation Regiment]],{{sfn|''Jutarnji list''|7 January 2012}} were piloted by [[Lieutenant]] Emir Šišić and [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Danijel Borović.{{sfn|European Parliament|1992|loc=H-0278/92}} However, Borović declared that his aircraft had a problem with its engine, and Šišić took off alone. Šišić was guided to the incoming helicopters at an altitude of {{convert|3000|m|abbr=off}}, and then ordered to make a full circle with his jet. As he turned around, he spotted the helicopters flying below his plane, at an altitude of {{convert|600|m|abbr=off}}. Šišić requested further orders and was told to shoot the helicopters down.{{sfn|''Politika''|23 November 2006}} The order was issued by the duty officer at the Željava Air Base, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Dobrivoje Opačić.{{sfn|''Novi list''|27 May 2013}}

Šišić pursued the helicopters, firing aircraft gun in front of the helicopters, but his aircraft was not armed with [[tracer ammunition]] and the helicopter pilots were not able to observe that they were fired upon. Flying at a speed of {{convert|1000|kph|knots|abbr=off}}, he switched to missiles and registered that the missile seekers had acquired the targets.{{sfn|''Politika''|23 November 2006}} Šišić fired two [[infrared homing]] [[R-60 (missile)|R-60 missiles]].{{sfn|''Nacional''|14 November 2006}} One of the missiles flew between the two helicopters, while the other struck the engine of the lead helicopter.{{sfn|''Politika''|23 November 2006}} The helicopter was shot down near the village of [[Podrute]], located in an area administered by the city of [[Novi Marof]], north of Zagreb.{{sfn|''Novi list''|27 May 2013}} The second helicopter had to crash-land to evade the attack.{{sfn|''Los Angeles Times''|12 January 1992}}

==Aftermath==
Five ECMM observers were killed in the attack, including four Italians and one Frenchman.{{sfn|''Los Angeles Times''|12 January 1992}} The victims were [[Tenente colonnello|Lieutenant Colonel]] Enzo Venturini, helicopter pilot, [[Italian Army ranks|Staff Sergeant]] Marco Matta, co-pilot, Sergeant Major Fiorenzo Ramacci, Sergeant Major Silvano Natale, and [[Lieutenant de vaisseau|Ship-of-the-line Lieutenant]] [[Jean-Loup Eychenne]].{{sfn|EUROMIL|2012}} The Italian personnel were drawn from the [[List of active units of the Italian Army|5th Army Aviation Regiment Rigel]]. The second helicopter carried a diplomat and three Italian ECMM observers, none of whom were harmed.{{sfn|''Novi list''|27 May 2013}} The crash site was toured by the police, ECMM staff and journalists,{{sfn|RFE|14 May 2008}} and EC representatives visited Belgrade to receive a report on the incident from Yugoslav authorities. The action of the Yugoslav Air Force was condemned by the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]],{{sfn|''Politika''|23 November 2006}} the [[United Nations Security Council]],{{sfn|Bethlehem|Weller|1997|p=3}} and the [[Council of the European Union|EC Council of Ministers]]. The Italian ambassador to Yugoslavia was recalled to [[Rome]] for consultations. Subsequently, Italy cancelled an air traffic agreement with Yugoslavia, causing [[Jat Airways]] to cancel Belgrade–Rome flights.{{sfn|Bellucci|Isernia|2003|p=215}} In addition, ECMM operations were suspended for several days.{{sfn|Lucarelli|RSC|1995|p=20}}

[[Yugoslav Ministry of Defence]] announced that it had initiated criminal proceedings against an officer, with four other officers facing military disciplinary action.{{sfn|''Los Angeles Times''|12 January 1992}} The commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, [[Colonel General]] [[Zvonko Jurjević]] was suspended.{{sfn|Bethlehem|Weller|1997|p=xxxiii}} The federal defense minister, [[General]] [[Veljko Kadijević]] officially apologized for the incident and resigned his post.{{sfn|Glaurdić|2011|p=280}} Šišić was [[court-martial]]led in Belgrade in 1992, and acquitted based on claims that he shot at a ZNG helicopter illegally escorting the two ECMM helicopters.{{sfn|''Nacional''|14 November 2006}} In a 2008 interview, Šišić claimed that the ECMM helicopter crashed after being hit by a fireball caused by the exploding third helicopter.{{sfn|''Politika''|13 May 2008}} His account is contradicted by crash scene eyewitnesses,{{sfn|RFE|14 May 2008}} as well as Željava Air Base radar data, both of which indicate that only two aircraft were flying to Zagreb.{{sfn|''Politika''|23 November 2006}}

Šišić and Opačić were [[Trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] in Croatia, and both were convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Borović, who defected to Croatia a month after the attack, testified against Šišić.{{sfn|''Nacional''|14 November 2006}} Šišić was arrested by Hungarian police at the [[Horgoš]]–[[Röszke]] border crossing on 9 May 2001.{{sfn|''Politika''|13 May 2008}} His [[extradition]] was requested by both Croatia and Italy. He was ultimately extradited to Italy in June 2002, where he was subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in prison for five counts of homicide and causing an aircraft disaster. In 2006, he was transferred to Serbia for the remainder of the prison term.{{sfn|''Nacional''|14 November 2006}} He was released by Serbian authorities in 2008.

In 2013, the Appeals Court in Rome tried Opačić, General Ljubomir Bajić, commander of the 5th Aviation Corps, and [[Colonel]] Božidar Martinović, head of the Yugoslav Air Defence operational centre in Belgrade ''in absentia'' for the attack. Opačić and Bajić were convicted and each sentenced to 28 years in prison, while Martinović was acquitted. The court also ordered Serbia to pay compensation to families of those killed in the attack, in the provisional amount of 950,000 [[Euro]]s.{{sfn|''Novi list''|27 May 2013}} In a 2008 interview, Šišić said he regretted the deaths of the crew but felt no remorse for his actions.{{sfn|''Politika''|13 May 2008}}

On 25 May 1993, Italy [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] decorated the four Italian ECMM observers killed in the attack with the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]], and the surviving three Italians aboard the second helicopter with the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]].{{sfn|''Gazzetta Ufficiale''|25 May 1993}} Eychenne was posthumously promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] effective 7 January 1992, and attributed ''[[Mort pour la France]]'' on 14 April of the same year. He was decorated as the ''Chevalier'' of the [[Legion of Honour]].{{sfn|Marine nationale (French Navy)|13 January 2012}} The incident is commemorated annually in Podrute and the ceremonies held there are regularly attended by representatives of the Croatian government and military, representatives of [[Italian Armed Forces|Italian]] and [[French Armed Forces]], along with [[European Union]], French and Italian diplomats.{{sfn|''Dubrovački vjesnik''|7 January 2010}}
