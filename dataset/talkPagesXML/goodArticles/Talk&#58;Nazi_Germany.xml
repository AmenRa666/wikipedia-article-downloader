== Germany under the Nazi Party ==

Proposal for a new name. &quot;Germany Under the Nazi Party&quot;.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚Äî&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Oranjin6|Oranjin6]] ([[User talk:Oranjin6#top|talk]] ‚Ä¢ [[Special:Contributions/Oranjin6|contribs]]) 01:19, 2 October 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== title inaccurate ==

shouldnt this be called third Reich? because it wasn't officially called Nazi germany.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚Äî&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/95.112.207.86|95.112.207.86]] ([[User talk:95.112.207.86#top|talk]]) 13:35, 3 October 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
: In response to this post and the one directly above: The policy on article titles as detailed at [[WP:COMMONNAME]] calls for article titles to be the name most commonly used in reliable English-language sources. Therefore &quot;Nazi Germany&quot; is the title. You may wish to review previous talk page discussions at [[Talk:Nazi Germany/Archive 4#Change of the article's name]] (2012), [[Talk:Nazi Germany/Archive 3#Nazi Germany is the wrong title]] (2007), and [[Talk:Nazi Germany/Archive 1#Article title]] (2005). ‚Äî [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;üçÅ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 13:41, 4 October 2016 (UTC)

== citation ==

Measuring Mennonitism: Racial Categorization in Nazi Germany and Beyond.
This article is a great addition to the Wikipedia source because it derives from a scholarly source (Harvard University) which specifies on the racial categorization in Nazi Germany. The article covers the gaps found in the Wikipedia source; therefore reinforces the source to be far more credible.


&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Goossen, B. W. (2016). Measuring Mennonitism: Racial Categorization in Nazi Germany and Beyond. Journal Of Mennonite Studies, 34225-246.[[User:Jgallaga|Jgallaga]] ([[User talk:Jgallaga|talk]]) 06:54, 10 October 2016 (UTC)

{{ping|Jgallaga}} - Actually the referenced article is a little &quot;in the weeds&quot; for a the general Nazi Germany article. A good place to include this material might be the [[Nazism and race]] Wiki-article instead.--[[User:Obenritter|Obenritter]] ([[User talk:Obenritter|talk]]) 16:17, 10 October 2016 (UTC)

== Intro paragraph ==

A section of introduction paragraph originally read: {{xt|&quot;Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist totalitarian state which controlled nearly all aspects of life.&quot;}} I changed this section to remove the word &quot;fascist&quot; as Fascism and Nazism are not completely one and the same. However, the edits were reverted and the structure of the sentence has been altered to: {{xt|&quot;Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state. The Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life.&quot;}} In my attempts to restore the original sentence structure, I unintentionally re-removed the word &quot;fascist&quot;, which caused my edit to be reverted again.

The current sentence structure of two separate short sentences does not flow as well as the old structure and I propose returning to the original structure. I would also like to propose a vote on removing the word &quot;facist&quot; as it is apparent that certain people disagree with my perspective (even though the intro is the only time that the word &quot;fascist&quot; appears in the entire article). ‚Äì [[User:Nick Mitchell 98|Nick Mitchell 98]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Nick Mitchell 98|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:04, 23 October 2016 (UTC)

:I would certainly vote for leaving the word &quot;fascist&quot; in and would suggest that anyone should read Robert O. Paxton's &quot;The Five Stages of Fascism&quot; in The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 70, No. 1. (Mar., 1998), pp. 1-23 before voting.  [[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]] ([[User talk:Joel Mc|talk]]) 08:01, 23 October 2016 (UTC) For example: &quot;What characteristics distinguished Germany and Italy, where fascism took power, from countries such as France and Britain where fascist movements were highly visible but remained marginal?&quot; Paxton, p. 16--[[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]] ([[User talk:Joel Mc|talk]]) 09:48, 23 October 2016 (UTC)

::I agree. I don't really see a problem with the current grammar but if it can be improved further then that is fine. The substantive content should not be altered when doing so, and the mention of fascism should stay. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal|talk]]) 10:21, 23 October 2016 (UTC)

== Today part of ==

Currently, there are mentions of [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] (seemingly arbitrarily chosen occupied territories), and no mention of Ukraine ([[Western Ukraine]]/Eastern Galicia; in the [[General Government]]) and Belarus (eastern raions of the [[Bezirk Bialystok]]). Any ideas on how to treat them?--[[User:Ad√ªn√¢i|Ad√ªn√¢i]] ([[User talk:Ad√ªn√¢i|talk]]) 05:48, 17 November 2016 (UTC)</text>
