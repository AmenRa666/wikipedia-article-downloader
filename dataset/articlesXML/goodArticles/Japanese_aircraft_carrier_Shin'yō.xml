{{nihongo|'''''Shin'yō'''''|神鷹|}} &quot;Divine Hawk&quot;) was an [[escort carrier]] operated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], converted from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ocean liner {{SS|Scharnhorst|1934|2}}. The liner had been trapped in [[Kure, Japan]] following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe, which prevented any attempt for the ship to return to Germany. The Japanese Navy then purchased the ship, and after the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier. Conversion work lasted from 1942 to late 1943, and ''Shin'yō'' was commissioned into the Japanese Navy in December 1943. After entering service, ''Shin'yō'' was employed as a convoy escort in the western Pacific. She served in this capacity for less than a year; in November 1944, the US submarine {{USS|Spadefish|SS-411|2}} torpedoed ''Shin'yō'' while she was en route to [[Singapore]]. As many as four torpedoes hit the ship and detonated her aviation fuel tanks. The resulting explosion destroyed the ship and killed most of her crew.

==Characteristics==
As rebuilt, ''Shin'yō'' was {{convert|606|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}} long [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|621|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|overall]]. She had a beam of {{convert|84|ft|m|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|26|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}. A {{convert|590.5|by|80.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} flight deck was installed,&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt; along with a pair of elevators and a single large hangar. This arrangement allowed for 27 combat aircraft and six spare airframes, for a total of 33 aircraft.&lt;ref name=S42/&gt;

The ship was powered by a pair of geared turbines that were supplied with steam by four boilers. The propulsion system produced {{convert|26000|shp|link=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|22|kn|link=on}}.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt; At a speed of {{convert|19|kn|abbr=on}}, the ship could steam for approximately {{convert|9000|nmi|lk=in}}. The original high-pressure, high-temperature, oil-fired boilers proved to be highly problematic and so the Japanese replaced them shortly after ''Shin'yō'' was completed. Steering was controlled by a single rudder.&lt;ref name=PG262&gt;Polmar, Genda, et al., p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gröner, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shin'yō'' was armed with eight {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} Type 89 [[dual-purpose gun]]s in four twin mounts. She also carried thirty {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s in 10 triple mounts. Later, twelve additional {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} in single mounts were added. When ''Shin'yō'' was refitted in July 1944, eight more 25&amp;nbsp;mm guns were added, bringing the total to 50.&lt;ref name=S43&gt;Stille, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
''Scharnhorst'' was a passenger ship operated by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in the 1930s. She was trapped in Japan after the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe in September 1939. The Japanese Navy purchased the ship on 7 February 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Jentschura, Jung &amp; Mickel, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; under the agreement they would pay Norddeutscher Lloyd twice the value of the ship after the end of the war.&lt;ref name=PG262/&gt; The ship was intended for use as a [[troop ship]], but after the Japanese defeat at the [[Battle of Midway]], the Navy decided to convert her into an escort carrier.&lt;ref name=S42&gt;Stille, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion work on ''Scharnhorst'' began in September 1942 in the Kure Navy Dockyard. Steel from the uncompleted hull of the canceled fourth {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship}} was used in the conversion process. Work lasted until December 1943, and the rebuilt ship was commissioned into the Japanese Navy on 15 December 1943.&lt;ref name=Conways&gt;Gardiner, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scharnhorst''{{'}}s design was similar to the Japanese passenger liners of the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Chūyō|''Nitta Maru'' class]], which were also converted into the {{sclass-|Taiyō|escort carrier|2}}s, so her conversion followed a similar plan. The main differences were retention of the original propulsion machinery, and addition of external bulges which helped increase stability.&lt;ref name=S42/&gt;

On 1 November 1943, ''Shin'yō'' was readied for [[sea trial]]s and ran a [[shake-down cruise]].&lt;ref name=Tully&gt;Tully&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the fleet on 15 November 1943,&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt; and was subsequently assigned to the Grand Escort Command on 20 December. For the first six months of 1944, the ship conducted training maneuvers in the [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]]. On 13 July 1944, she escorted the [[Hi convoys|convoy Hi-69]], including the escort carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taiyō||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaiyō||2}}, which were carrying additional aircraft for the Philippines. ''Shin'yō'' was tasked with providing aerial cover for the convoy. The convoy arrived on 20 July; on 25 July, ''Shin'yō'' left with another convoy, bound for Singapore. The ship arrived on 31 July, and departed again four days later with the [[Hi convoys|convoy Hi-70]]. The convoy consisted of eight transports, headed for [[Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū|Moji]]; ''Shin'yō'' was joined by a pair of [[light cruiser]]s and several smaller craft. The convoy arrived on 15 August, while ''Shin'yō'' put in at Kure the following day.&lt;ref name=Tully/&gt;

On 8 September, ''Shin'yō'' escorted the [[Hi convoys|convoy Hi-75]], consisting of nine transports and several [[destroyer]]s and smaller craft, bound for Singapore. On 13 September, the convoy stopped briefly in [[Kaohsiung|Takao]], [[Formosa]], before departing later that day. The convoy arrived on 22 September. Another convoy, [[Hi convoys|Hi-76]], left Singapore for Moji on 3 October, with ''Shin'yō'' and several destroyers escorting it. The convoy temporarily stopped in [[Mihara, Hiroshima|Mihara]] on 19–20 October; on 22 October, ''Shin'yō'' departed from the convoy and proceeded to the [[Saiki, Ōita|Saiki]] airbase, arriving on 24 October. The following day, she left for Kure. While there, she replenished fuel and supplies. On 7 November, she was ordered to cover the return of the carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}}.&lt;ref name=Tully/&gt;

On 9 November, she was assigned to [[convoy Hi-81]], carrying aircraft for the Philippines. Fourteen [[Nakajima B5N|B5N &quot;Kate&quot;]] [[torpedo bomber]]s were assigned to the ship for the operation. The convoy left Japan on 14 November.&lt;ref name=Tully/&gt; The escort consisted of six [[destroyer]]s, protecting seven troopships carrying an army division and a [[oil tanker|tanker]]. On 15 November, while in the [[East China Sea]], a US [[submarine]] sank one of the transports; two days later, another transport was sunk and the tanker was damaged. Later that night, ''Shin'yō'' was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine {{USS|Spadefish|SS-411|6}}.&lt;ref name=PG454&gt;Polmar, Genda, et al., p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine hit her with as many as four torpedoes in quick succession. The carrier's unarmored fuel tanks exploded and started a massive fire that destroyed the ship and killed most of her crew.&lt;ref name=S43/&gt; Only 70 men from her crew of 1,200 officers and men survived.&lt;ref name=Tully/&gt; ''Shin'yō'' quickly sank stern first. ''Spadefish'' attempted to attack the convoy again, but was driven off by the escorts.&lt;ref name=PG454/&gt; ''Shin'yō'' was formally stricken from the [[naval register]] on 10 January 1945.&lt;ref name=Tully/&gt;
