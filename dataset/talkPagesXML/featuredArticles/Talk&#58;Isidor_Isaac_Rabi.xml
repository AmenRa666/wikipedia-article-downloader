I found this quote on Slashdot:

&quot;We gave you an atomic bomb, what do you want, mermaids?&quot; -- I. I. Rabi to the Atomic Energy Commission

Does anyone have some info on it's background, context time of utterance, etc.? [[User:Brutulf|Brutulf]] 09:44, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)

It looks like the quote may have become a little distorted.  The context is basically Rabi defending Oppenheimer against charges of leaking classified information.

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bomb/filmmore/reference/interview/rhodes12.html


The Bates College reference probably should be removed, since Rabi neither studied nor taught there.  The degree Rabi received from Bates was honorary and was just one of dozens of honorary doctorates he received. There is no reason to feature this one and not the others.

:Since there are no objections, I have removed the reference.


==Pronounciation==
Does anyone know how to pronounce his last name? Is it Rah-bye or Rah-bee? [[User:198.20.40.50|198.20.40.50]] 23:09, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

:It's &quot;RAH-bee&quot;. [[Special:Contributions/4.131.159.107|4.131.159.107]] ([[User talk:4.131.159.107|talk]]) 00:00, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

==&quot;Who ordered this?&quot;==
This famous question may be taken in at least two ways:  mystically (&quot;What God set this in order?&quot;) or wryly, in imitation of a table of diners at a restaurant (&quot;Which physicist wanted this?&quot;).  I'm thinking, from personal experience, of a large party of diners at a Chinese restaurant with many dishes on the menu, and a plate of unrecognized food shows up.  What exactly did Rabi mean when he asked this question?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Larrykoen|Larrykoen]] ([[User talk:Larrykoen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Larrykoen|contribs]]) 15:05, 21 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Proton,Deuteron,Neutron Magnetic Moments ==

I've been looking into the history of the measurement of the [[neutron magnetic moment]].  I believe this article rather misrepresents the situation; see the neutron magnetic moment article.  Rabi was first to measure the p,d magnetic moments fairly accurately, yes, but these had been measured earlier in 1933-4.  The more accurate measurements from the late 1930's were a result of the magnetic resonance techniques developed by Rabi.  I would suggest a slight rewrite to suggest that Rabi made accurate indirect determinations of the magnetic moment of the neutron, which was one of the aims of the p and d measurements.  The article as it reads now suggests Rabi discovered the p and d magnetic moments, but that is not true.  p was by [[Otto Stern]], while d was likely a simultaneous discovery by Stern and Rabi groups.  Both groups were after the n magnetic moment with these measurements, I believe.

While I am here, I note that the electric quadrupole moment discovery for the d was actually rather stunning.  People were struggling with understanding the nature of the nuclear force at the time, and this discovery was a real breakthrough in that regard.  The Rigden book notes this (p. 113, bottom).   The nuclear force was not a central force, for one.  This article leaves the discovery hanging, without stating why it was so important.  [[User:Bdushaw|Bdushaw]] ([[User talk:Bdushaw|talk]]) 10:07, 31 January 2015 (UTC)

:I have revised the article in line with your suggestions. If you can fix up the [[neutron magnetic moment]] article, that would be good. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 22:17, 31 January 2015 (UTC)

::Looks good now; I couldn't have written it better myself... :)  I've been working on the [[neutron magnetic moment]] article over the past few weeks.  I'm about done with it.  Happy to have an objective review of it if you (or anyone) finds themselves with a dull moment.  Meanwhile, the [[proton magnetic moment]] article needs quite a lot of work.  (And one wonders if there should not be a [[deuteron magnetic moment]] article.)  [[User:Bdushaw|Bdushaw]] ([[User talk:Bdushaw|talk]]) 05:26, 1 February 2015 (UTC)

== external link? ==

Would an interview with transcript with Isidor Isaac Rabi from 1986 be useful here as an external link? Focus of conversation is nuclear weapons policy. http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_7E62DED261394CEDBB3A79E9260DB791 (I have a conflict of interest; otherwise I would add it myself.) [[User:Mccallucc|Mccallucc]] ([[User talk:Mccallucc|talk]]) 18:20, 23 March 2016 (UTC)
:{{tick}} Added. I like external links where the reader can actually see and hear the subject. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 21:56, 23 March 2016 (UTC)</text>
