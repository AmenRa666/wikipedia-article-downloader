'''HMCS ''Buctouche''''' was a {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. She served primarily in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] as a convoy escort. She was named for [[Bouctouche, New Brunswick]].

==Background==
{{main|Flower-class corvette}}
Flower-class corvettes like ''Buctouche'' serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ossian |first=Robert |url=http://www.thepirateking.com/ships/ship_types.htm |title=Complete List of Sailing Vessels |website=The Pirate King |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Fitzsimons |editor-first=Bernard |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons &amp; Warfare |location=London |publisher=Phoebus |year=1978 |volume=11 |pages=1137–1142 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jane&gt;{{cite book |title=Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II |location=New Jersey |publisher=Random House |year=1996 |isbn=0-517-67963-9 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;corvette&quot; designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Nicholas |last2=Lawrence |first2=Richard |title=The Illustrated Companion to Nelson's Navy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I59v6rkg8egC&amp;pg=PA39 |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2005 |pages=39–63 |isbn=0-8117-3275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, [[Winston Churchill]] reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a [[whaling ship]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesneau |first=Roger |last2=Gardiner |first2=Robert |title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships (1922-1946) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJBMBvyQ83EC&amp;pg=PA62 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date=June 1980 |page=62 |isbn=0-87021-913-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generic name &quot;flower&quot; was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;{{cite book |title=North Atlantic Run |last=Milner |first=Marc |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1985 |pages=117–119, 142–145, 158, 175–176, 226, 235, 285–291 |isbn=0-87021-450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral [[Percy W. Nelles]]. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Milner |first2=Marc |year=1993 |title=Corvettes of the Royal Canadian Navy 1939-1945|publisher=Vanwell Publishing |location=St. Catherines |pages=117|isbn=1-55125-052-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Originally named ''Bathurst'', but due to conflict with a [[Royal Navy]] vessel her named was changed to ''Buctouche''.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; She was ordered on 22 January 1940 from [[Davie Shipbuilding|Davie Shipbuilding &amp; Repairing Co. Ltd.]], [[Lauzon, Quebec|Lauzon]], [[Quebec]] as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class building program. She was [[laid down]] on 14 August 1940 and was launched on 20 November that year. ''Buctouche'' was commissioned into the RCN on 5 June 1941. In October 1943, ''Buctouche'' was sent for a four-month refit where her [[forecastle]] was extended at [[Saint John Shipbuilding|Saint John Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Ltd.]] on 29 January 1944.&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web|title= HMCS ''Buctouche'' (K179) | url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/806.html|work=Uboat.net|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910-1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages=72 |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
After working up, ''Buctouche'' joined the [[Newfoundland Escort Force]] in July 1941. She escorted convoys from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] to [[Iceland]] from August 1941 to January 1942.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; During that time under Lt. W.W. Hackney, RCNR she rescued 43 survivors from the British merchant ship ''Empire Gemsbuck'' that was torpedoed and sunk on 3 November 1941 by {{GS|U-203||2}} northeast of [[Cape Charles (headland)|Cape Charles]], [[Labrador]] at 52-18N, 53-05W.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt;

In June 1942 ''Buctouche'' transferred to the [[Western Local Escort Force]] (WLEF). This posting was permanent until the end of the war with the exception of two months in the summer of 1944 where she was assigned to Quebec Force.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; On 7 July 1942, ''Buctouche'' under Skr. Lt. G.N. Downey, RCNR, rescued 15 survivors from the Norwegian merchant ship ''Moldanger'' that was torpedoed and sunk by {{GS|U-404||2}} on 27 June at 30-03N, 70-52W.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; In June 1943 she was assigned to WLEF escort group W-1.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

Following the war, ''Buctouche'' was [[paid off]] on 23 October 1945. She was sold for scrap and [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1949 at [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Trivia==
[[File:HMCS Buctouche K179 badge O-893-288.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Unofficial badge of HMCS Buctouche.|Gunshield art showing HMCS ''Buctouche''{{'}}s unofficial badge.]]
While under the command of Skr. Lt. G.N. Downey, RCNR, ''Buctouche'' appeared in a feature length Hollywood war movie titled ''CORVETTE K225'', starring Randolph Scott as the Commanding Officer. She was only filmed from her starboard side which carried the K225 pennant number for the movie. Her port side carried her actual number K179 as she was still an active duty warship.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The ship's badge depicted [[Adolf Hitler]] being tossed off a bucking [[bronco]], a play being made both on the name &quot;Buctouche&quot; and the rolling pitching motion which Flower-class corvettes were renowned for.
