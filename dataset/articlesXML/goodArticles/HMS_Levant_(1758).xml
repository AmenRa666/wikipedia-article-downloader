'''HMS ''Levant''''' was a 28-gun [[Coventry class frigate|''Coventry''-class]] [[sixth-rate]] [[Sailing frigate|frigate]] of the [[Royal Navy]], which saw active service in both the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]]. [[Ceremonial ship launching|Launched]] in 1758 during a period of war with France, ''Levant'' was assigned to the Royal Navy's [[Jamaica Station (Royal Navy)|Jamaica station]] and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the fleet for the [[British expedition against Martinique]] in 1762 but played no role in the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at [[Fort Royal]].

She was [[ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] following Britain's declaration of peace with France in 1763, but returned to active service during the American Revolutionary War. For this conflict she was assigned to the Mediterranean as part of a small British squadron based at [[Gibraltar]]. Over the next three years she captured or sank a total of fourteen enemy craft including an 18-gun American [[privateer]]. In 1779 she brought home news of an impending Spanish assault on Gibraltar, ahead of Spain's declaration of war on Great Britain. The ageing frigate was again decommissioned later that year and her crew discharged to other vessels. She was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] at [[Deptford Dockyard]] in 1780, having secured a total of 24 victories over 21 years at sea.

== Construction ==
''Levant'' was an oak-built 28-gun sixth-rate, one of 18 vessels forming part of the ''Coventry''-class of frigates. As with others in her class she was loosely modelled on the design and dimensions of {{HMS|Tartar|1756|6}}, launched in 1756 and responsible for capturing five French privateers in her first twelve months at sea.&lt;ref name=Winfield227&gt;Winfield 2007, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; [[Admiralty]] contracts for ''Levant''{{'}}s construction were issued on 20 May 1757 to a commercial [[shipwright]], [[Henry Adams (shipbuilder)|Henry Adams]] of [[Buckler's Hard]]. The contracts stipulated that work should be completed within ten months, for a vessel measuring approximately 586 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]] at a fee of £9.5s a ton. The [[keel]] was laid down in June 1757 but work proceeded slowly and the vessel was not ready for launch until July 1758. In final construction her hull was also larger than contracted, at 595&lt;small&gt;{{fraction|34|94}}&lt;/small&gt; tons.&lt;ref name=Winfield229&gt;Winfield 2007, pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating independently of the Royal Dockyards, Adams made several changes to the ''Tartar'' design. In ''Levant'' the ship's wheel was moved from behind the [[mizzen mast]] to before it, and the [[tiller]] shifted from the quarterdeck to an internal location in the hold.&lt;ref name=Gardiner76&gt;Gardiner 1992, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hawsehole]]s were shifted from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner 1992, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in recognition of the vessels' likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow to form a battery of [[chase gun]]s.&lt;ref name=Gardiner76/&gt;

As built, ''Levant'' was {{convert|118|ft|5|in|m|1|abbr=on}} long with a {{convert|97|ft|4|in|m|1|abbr=on}} keel, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, and a [[Hold (ship)|hold]] depth of {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt; Her armament comprised 24 [[Naval long gun|nine-pounder cannons]] located along her gun deck, supported by four three-pounder cannons on the [[quarterdeck]] and twelve {{fraction|1|2}}-pounder [[swivel guns]] ranged along her sides. Her complement was 200 officers and [[Naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=Winfield227/&gt;

==Seven Years' War==
[[File:Guadeloupe Banat 1.1.png|thumb|left|Guadeloupe, where ''Levant'' was stationed in 1759.]]

===1758–1760===
''Levant'' was launched on 6 July 1758 and sailed to [[Portsmouth Dockyard]] for fitout and to take on armament and crew. She was formally commissioned in October under the command of Captain William Tucker, entering Royal Navy service during the early stages of the Seven Years' War against France and Spain. There were delays in mustering sufficient crew, and the frigate was not finally ready to put to sea until June 1759. On 14 June Captain Tucker received orders to take position off [[Guadaloupe]] and the [[Leeward Islands]],&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt; there to join a squadron commanded by Commodore John Moore.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite news|title =London | work =The Caledonian Mercury | page =1 | publisher =Walter Ruddiman, John Richardson and Company|location=Edinburgh | date =19 July 1760| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17600719/003/0001|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Levant'' set sail for this assignment on 23 July.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =London | work =The Newcastle Courant | page =1 | publisher =John White|location=Newcastle, United Kingdom | date =23 June 1759| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000085/17590623/002/0001|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =17 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British squadron of which ''Levant'' was part was tasked with disrupting French trade through the Caribbean, and with hunting privateers. However the frigate saw little action in her first six months in the region; French trade had virtually ceased since the outbreak of war with Britain, while a smallpox outbreak killed many of ''Levant''{{'}}s crew. It was not until early 1760 when ''Levant'' encountered her first opponent, a 14-gun French privateer which was swiftly defeated and sunk with the loss of 120 of her crew.&lt;ref name=Manchester/&gt; Thereafter combat was more frequent. Two small privateers were captured in early 1760 - the 8-gun ''Poissan Volante'' and the 12-gun ''St Pierre'' - and these vessels and their crews delivered into British custody on the Leeward Islands.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt; In June ''Pickering'', a British merchantman previously captured by the French, was retaken and sailed to Antigua as ''Levant''{{'}}s prize.&lt;ref name=Pickering&gt;{{cite news|title =London| work =The Caledonian Mercury | page =2 | publisher =Walter Ruddiman, John Richardson and Company|location=Edinburgh | date =6 September 1760| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17600906/004/0002|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further victory followed on 29 June with the capture of French privateer ''Le Scipio'',&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Admiralty Office, February 28| work =The Derby Mercury | page =3 | publisher =S.

British military successes in European waters in 1760 offered freedom for the Navy to support offensive operations in the Caribbean in the following year. In January General Jeffrey Amherst set sail from North America to the Caribbean with 2,000 men and four ships of the line, for a planned invasion of [[Dominica|French Dominica]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson 2016, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; ''Levant'' saw little action in advance of Amherst's arrival and captured only one vessel, the privateer ''La Catherine'', on 15 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Extract of a Letter from St Christopher's| work =The Caledonian Mercury | page =2 | publisher =Walter Ruddiman, John Richardson &amp; Company|location=Edinburgh | date =27 April 1761| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17610427/007/0002|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =19 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amherst arrived in Antigua shortly after this capture; Captain Tucker was then deputised to carry the general aboard ''Levant'' for a visit to the various Leeward Island settlements while the invasion force assembled at Guadeloupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Extract of a Letter from St John's, Antigua, March 11 | work =The Caledonian Mercury | page =2 | publisher =Walter Ruddiman, John Richardson and Company|location=Edinburgh | date =9 May 1761| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17610509/008/0002|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amherst departed the Leeward Islands in April and ''Levant'' resumed her hunt for privateers, capturing ''La Dulcinée'' on 13 July and ''L'Aventurier'' six days later.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;

Dominica having fallen to Amherst's forces in June, the British then set their sights on the French stronghold of [[Martinique]]. Britain's [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]], Sir [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], considered that Martinique's capture would be the decisive battle for control of the Caribbean, and instructed that all available resources be committed to its invasion. An army of 13,000 troops was assembled, supported by a fleet under Admiral [[George Rodney]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson 2016, pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; ''Levant'' was added to Rodney's sizeable command in late 1761 and sailed as part of the expedition in January 1762.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Extract of a Letter from Guadeloupe, December 7| work =The Derby Mercury | page =1 | publisher =S.

''Levant'' then returned to her station off the Leeward Islands, arriving there on 10 February. Ten days later, Tucker received orders from Admiral Rodney transferring ''Levant'' to the command of Captain [[John Laforey]], previously of the [[fifth-rate]] {{HMS|Echo|1758|6}}.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winfield 2007, p.276&lt;/ref&gt; Under Laforey's command the vessel made one final capture, seizing the French privateer ''La Fier'' on 13 May.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Letter from Charlestown, South-Carolina, July '14 | work =The Caledonian Mercury | page =3 | publisher =Walter Ruddiman, John Richardson and Company|location=Edinburgh | date =23 August 1762| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17620823/012/0003|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =23 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace with France]] was established in March 1763 and ''Levant'' was declared surplus to the Navy's needs. Captain Laforey departed the vessel and command transferred to a Captain Shouldham for the voyage back to England. ''Levant'' reached [[Portsmouth Dockyard]] in August 1763, where she was decommissioned and most of her crew discharged or reassigned.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Extract of a Letter from Portsmouth, August 14 | work =The Caledonian Mercury | page =2 | publisher =Walter Ruddiman, John Richardson and Company|location=Edinburgh | date =20 August 1763| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17630820/003/0002|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =23 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peacetime service ==
Despite the declaration of peace there were rumours that ''Levant'' would swiftly return to active service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =London| work =The Derby Mercury | page =3 | publisher =S. Drewry|location=Derby, United Kingdom | date =19 August 1763| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000189/17630819/017/0003|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =23 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However these proved unfounded and she remained tied up at Portsmouth. Her hull and fittings were surveyed in late 1763 to determine maintenance requirements, but no repairs were made.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt; In September 1763 a member of her [[skeleton crew]] was robbed and murdered at [[Liphook]], a village some distance from Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Conditions| work =The Derby Mercury | page =2 | publisher =S.

''Levant'' returned to Navy service in 1766 under the command of Captain Basil Keith, and was assigned to patrol and convoy duties on the Navy's [[Jamaica Station (Royal Navy)|Jamaica Station]]. In August she was relocated to [[Deptford Dockyard|Deptford]] to take on crew and supplies, setting sail for the Caribbean on 28 November.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Edinburgh | work =The Caledonian Mercury | page =3 | publisher =Walter Ruddiman, John Richardson and Company|location=Edinburgh | date =1 September 1766| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000045/17660901/006/0003|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =30 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She held her Jamaica post for three years, but this extensive service in tropical waters had left her in poor condition. In 1770 she returned to Deptford Dockyard where she was decommissioned and hauled out of the water for rebuilding. The work was granted to shipwright John Dudman and took six months from November 1770 to April 1771. Repair and rebuilding expenses were £5,869 with an additional £3,059 for fitout, amounting to considerably more than the vessel's original construction cost of £5,423.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;

The rebuilt frigate was recommissioned in August 1771 under Captain Samuel Thompson. After four months in home waters she was assigned to the Navy's Mediterranean squadron and took up position off Gibraltar in January 1772. ''Levant'' remained at this station for three years, her uneventful service broken only by a 1773 transfer of command from Captain Thompson to Captain [[George Murray (Royal Navy officer, born 1741)|George Murray]], the son of former [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] commander [[Lord George Murray (general)|Lord Murray]].&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt;

''Levant'' was returned to Portsmouth in early 1775 but put to sea again at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt; Captain Murray's orders were to join a Mediterranean squadron under the overall command of Captain [[Robert Mann (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Mann]], there to intercept and capture American merchant shipping.

Further success followed in early 1777 with the capture of the 18-gun American privateer ''General Montgomery''.&lt;ref name=Winfield229/&gt; News had reached England that this vessel was off the island of [[Madeira]] in March, having sailed from Philadelphia in February with a crew of 100 men. ''Levant'' was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the ''General Montgomery'' at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered ''Levant'' to fly [[false colours]], hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew.&lt;ref name=Montgomery/&gt; ''General Montgomery'' had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed ''Levant'' to draw near, but turned to flee when Murray fired a warning shot. A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00{{nbsp}}am the wind strengthened and ''Levant'' was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of ''General Montgomery''{{'}}s crew enlisted aboard ''Levant'', with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Captain George Murray RN to Captain William Hay, HMS ''Alarm'', 14 March 1777.

''Levant'' continued her Mediterranean patrols in 1778 and was rewarded on 24 March with the recapture of a British merchantman which had been bound for Newfoundland when seized by an American privateer off Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=Ipswich&gt;{{cite news|title =Extract of a letter from Gibraltar, March 27| work =The Ipswich Journal | page =2 | publisher =J.

Her captain, Sir Thomas Rich, advised that he was pursuing the [[USS Revenge (1777)|USS ''Revenge'']], a 22-gun American privateer with three captured merchant ships in tow. On 21 March the privateer had surprised and destroyed ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[tender (boat)|tender]] before escaping into the night. Rich had given chase for the next three days; Murray now added ''Levant'' to the hunt and the two British frigates set courses to [[windward and leeward]] of the Americans' likely path. Both sailed through the night without sighting their prey. In the morning of 25 March they encountered one of ''Revenge''{{'}}s prizes - the 16-gun British merchantman ''Hope'' - which promptly surrendered and was returned to Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=Ipswich/&gt; ''Revenge'' herself eluded capture and was later reported as having escaped to the neutral Spanish port of Cadiz.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (ed.) et. al. volume 12, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt;

France entered the War against Britain after signing a formal [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty]] with the United States in March 1778. There was a subsequent reorganization of Royal Navy forces in the Mediterranean, with ''Levant'' joining a squadron of four other vessels based in Gibraltar and under the overall direction of Admiral Robert Duff. Of this squadron, ''Levant'' was the second largest, behind only Duff's 60-gun flagship {{HMS|Panther|1758|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =The Following is a Correct List of the Marine Forces of Great Britain with their present Stations| work =The Hampshire Chronicle | page =4 | publisher =J.

These ongoing victories belied the changing conditions applicable to ''Levant''{{'}}s hunt for enemy vessels off Gibraltar. American vessels had become scarce, especially since Spain had closed her ports to them in the winter of 1777 in retaliation for privateer attacks on Spanish ships.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (ed.) et. al volume 11, p. 860&lt;/ref&gt; French trading vessels remained at sea but were occasionally accompanied by naval escorts large enough to prevent their capture by Gibraltar's small Royal Navy squadron.&lt;ref name=Harrop&gt;{{cite news|title =Extract of a Letter from Gibraltar, January 31| work =The Manchester Mercury | page =1 | publisher =Joseph Harrop|location=Manchester, United Kingdom | date =16 March 1779| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000239/17790316/001/0001|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =6 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Levant'' was [[careening|careened]] on a beach at Gibraltar over Christmas 1778 and then returned to sea, but her next capture was not until 1 April 1779 when, in company with Captain Rich's ''Enterprise'', she seized a French ship carrying wine and [[brandy]] from Marseilles.&lt;ref name=Harrop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Ships taken from the French and Americans| work =The Leeds Intelligencer | page =3 | publisher =Griffith Wright and Son|location=Leeds, United Kingdom | date =11 May 1779| url =http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000236/17790511/006/0003|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes | accessdate =6 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foreign Intelligence|work=Saunders's News Letter|page=1|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001057/17790526/001/0001|date=26 May 1779|publisher=J.

That same month Spain signed the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] with France, setting terms for a military alliance against Britain. Despite the Treaty, Spain delayed the issue of a formal declaration of war.&lt;ref name=Dull&gt;Dull 2009, pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim ''Levant'' engaged and defeated a Spanish privateer whose crew ''Levant'' caught in the act of boarding a British merchant ship. A brief exchange of cannon fire holed the Spanish vessel below the waterline, sinking her; ''Levant'' rescued the majority of her crew and transported them to prison in Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London, June 18|work=Saunders's News Letter|page=1|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001057/17790624/001/0001|date=24 June 1779|publisher=J.

Captain Murray then took ''Levant'' on a cruise to hunt for French or American vessels off Cadiz. While pursuing this task in late June 1779 he ran across the Spanish battle fleet, comprising 32 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and two frigates, heading south towards an unknown destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunday's Post|work=The Ipswich Journal|page=1|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000071/17790731/001/0001|date=31 July 1779|publisher=J.
