'''Frank Woodruff Buckles''' (born '''Wood Buckles''', February 1, 1901{{spaced ndash}}February 27, 2011) was a [[United States Army]] soldier and the last surviving American veteran of [[World War I]]. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1917 at the age of 16 and served with a detachment from [[Fort Riley]], driving ambulances and motorcycles near the front lines in Europe.

During [[World War II]], he was captured by [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]] while working in the shipping business, and spent three years in the [[Philippines]] as a [[Civilian Internee|civilian prisoner]]. After the war, Buckles married in San Francisco and moved to [[Gap View Farm]] near [[Charles Town, West Virginia]]. A widower at age 98, he worked on his farm until the age of 105.

In his last years, he was Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation. As chairman, he advocated the establishment of a World War I memorial similar to other war memorials in Washington, D.C.. Toward this end, Buckles campaigned for the [[District of Columbia War Memorial]] to be renamed the National World War I Memorial. He testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] in support of this cause, and met with President [[George W. Bush]] at the White House.

Buckles was awarded the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]] at the conclusion of that conflict, and the [[Army of Occupation of Germany Medal]] retroactively following the medal's creation in 1941, as well as the [[Legion of Honour|French Legion of Honor]] in 1999. His funeral was on March 15, 2011, at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], with President [[Barack Obama]] paying his respects prior to the ceremony with [[Military funeral|full military honors]].

==Early life and education==
Buckles was born to James Clark Buckles, a farmer, and Theresa J.

For his service during World War I, Buckles received, from the United States government, the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]] and four [[Overseas Service Bar]]s.  He also qualified for the [[Army of Occupation of Germany Medal]] due to his postwar service in Europe during the year 1919, and received that medal after it was created in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iE6NSWH5eo6IBbgxziKjY2LckPjQ|title= Last surviving World War I soldier, 108, storms US Congress |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date= December 3, 2009|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckles did not qualify for the [[Prisoner of War Medal]], because he was a civilian at the time of his imprisonment by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prisoner of War Medal Application|publisher=Archival Reconstruction Service Record of Frank Buckles, [[Military Personnel Records Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a resident of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]], he was involved for many years with the Jefferson County Historical Society (including as President from 1960 to 1964).
