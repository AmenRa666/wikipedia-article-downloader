'''HMS ''Garland''''', also known by her Polish designation '''ORP ''Garland''''', was a [[G and H-class destroyer|G-class]] [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1930s. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Shortly after [[World War II]] began, she was badly damaged by the premature explosion of her own depth charges and required over six months of repairs. Before these were completed, ''Garland'' was loaned to the [[Polish Navy]] in May 1940. The ship was assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] afterwards and escorted convoys there before being assigned to the [[Western Approaches Command]] in September for escort duties. She escorted a convoy from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Malta]] during [[Operation Halberd]] in September 1941 and escorted [[Convoy PQ-16]] from [[Iceland]] to [[Murmansk]] in May 1942. She was badly damaged by a near miss from a German bomber during that operation and required three months of repairs.

''Garland'' was then assigned to the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] in the North Atlantic until December 1943, when she was transferred to [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] to escort convoys off [[West Africa]]. In April 1944, the ship was transferred to back to the Mediterranean Fleet where she escorted convoys. She sank one German submarine in September before returning to the UK for a lengthy refit that lasted until March 1945. ''Garland'' was then assigned to the Western Approaches Command, but carried emergency supplies to coastal towns in Belgium and the Netherlands immediately after the war ended in May. She was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] and reclaimed from the Polish Navy in July 1946. A few months later, the ship was sold to the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] for use as a [[school ship]]. ''Garland'' was refitted as an anti-submarine [[training ship]] in 1948 and renamed HNLMS ''Marnix'' in 1950. Reclassified as a [[frigate]] in 1952, the ship was not decommissioned until 1964 and scrapped afterwards.

==Description==
''Garland'' displaced {{convert|1350|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1883|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|323|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s. ''Garland'' carried a maximum of {{convert|470|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|5530|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ship's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime,&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitley, pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; but in increased to 146 in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Garland'' had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.5&amp;nbsp;inch Vickers Mk III]] [[machine gun]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch]] torpedoes.&lt;ref name=w78/&gt; One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime modifications===
Most ships of ''Garland''{{'}}s class had the rear torpedo tubes replaced by a [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] AA gun after the [[evacuation of Dunkirk]] in 1940, but it is not known exactly when this modification was made. By 1942, the ship's short range AA armament had been augmented by two [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} Oerlikon]] guns on her [[searchlight]] platform and another pair on the wings of the ship's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 237, 242&lt;/ref&gt; The .50-calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons later. The ship's [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]] and [[rangefinder]] above the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] were removed in exchange for a [[Type 271 radar|Type 271]] target indication radar, after 1942, and 'B' gun was replaced by a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine [[spigot mortar]]. A [[Type 286 radar|Type 286]] short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted mid-way through the war. The ship also received a [[HF/DF]] [[radio direction finder]] mounted on a pole [[mainmast]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===HMS ''Garland'', 1936&amp;ndash;1940===
Ordered on 5 March 1934 from [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering]], ''Garland'' was [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Govan]], Scotland, on 22 August 1934. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 October 1935 and completed on 3 March 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £250,664.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; She was assigned to the [[1st Destroyer Flotilla]] of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. ''Garland'' patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the edicts of the [[Non-Intervention Committee]] in 1937 and 1938. The ship was overhauled at [[Sheerness]] between 24 May and 5 July 1937 and 31 May to 28 July 1938 during which her low-pressure turbines were repaired. ''Garland'' patrolled off [[Cyprus]] in July 1939.&lt;ref name=e2&gt;English, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

When World War II began, the ship was en route to [[Alexandria]] from [[Aden]] and arrived there on 6 September. Whilst escorting a convoy to Malta, some of her depth charges detonated prematurely on 17 September and badly damaged the aft end of the ship. ''Garland'' had to be towed back to Alexandria where temporary repairs were made. She was towed to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted from 11 October to 8 May 1940. Shortly before the completion of the repairs, she was loaned to the [[Polish Navy]] on 3 May 1940, the anniversary of the 1791 [[Polish Constitution of 3 May]].&lt;ref name=e3&gt;English, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===ORP ''Garland'', 1940&amp;ndash;1946===
After [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]], the ship escorted a convoy to and from Greece in late June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Hats]], ''Garland'' was lightly damaged by Italian aircraft on 31 August whilst escorting a convoy to [[Malta]]. She was transferred to the Western Approaches Command in mid-September and was assigned to the [[Escort Group (naval)|10th Escort Group]]. On 13 November, ''Garland'' was badly damaged by storm whilst escorting the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}} and required over a month to make repairs. Two men were lost overboard during the storm. In early January 1941, the ship was fitted with a new ASDIC system. She was transferred to the 14th Escort Group in April and was then briefly attached to the Home Fleet, escorting a tanker, during the Allied landing on [[Spitsbergen]] in July. Upon her return, ''Garland'' was assigned to Escort Group B3 for escort duties in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=e3/&gt;

In late September, she joined the Polish-manned destroyer {{Ship|ORP|Piorun||2}} in Operation Halberd, escorting a large convoy to Malta. The two ships escorted the battleship {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} back to Gibraltar after she had been torpedoed during the operation. ''Garland'' then rejoined Escort Group B3. The ship was refitted between 28 February and 5 May 1942 in [[Middlesbrough]] and was assigned to escort Convoy PQ-16 in late May after working up. On 27 May, a bomb was dropped by a [[Junkers Ju 88]] bomber {{convert|10|yd}} off the starboard side of the ship, that decimated the crews of 'A' and 'B' guns and the starboard Oerlikon and .50-calibre machine guns (22 killed and 37 wounded). The ship's [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]] and rangefinder were destroyed and she was ordered to proceed independently to Murmansk for temporary repairs. These took over a month to complete and ''Garland'' sailed on 4 July for [[Troon]],&lt;ref name=e3/&gt; as part of the escort for [[Convoy QP 13]],&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; for permanent repairs that were not completed until 21 September.&lt;ref name=e3/&gt;

The ship rejoined Escort Group B3 until she began a lengthy refit in May 1943 that lasted until 8 September.&lt;ref name=e4&gt;English, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; ''Garland'' was assigned to the 8th Support Group after working up and escorted several small convoys transporting Allied troops to the [[Azores]] to build airbases after the Portuguese gave their consent in late September.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; From November to April 1944, the ship was based in Freetown to escort convoys between Freetown and Gibraltar. In May she was assigned to the [[14th Destroyer Flotilla]] of the Mediterranean Fleet where she escorted convoys and supported Allied operations in the Aegean. On 19 September 1944, together with two other British destroyers, she sank the {{GS|U-407|}} off [[Santorini]]. The following month ''Garland'' supported the Allied liberation of Greece after the German withdrawal.&lt;ref name=e4&gt;English, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November, the ship sailed for the UK to begin a lengthy refit at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] that lasted until 31 March 1945. She was assigned to the [[8th Destroyer Flotilla]] in the [[Western Approaches Command]], but had barely finished working up when the war ended in May. The ship transported emergency supplies to Belgium and the Netherlands immediately afterwards. At the end of 1945, ''Garland'' took part in [[Operation Deadlight]], the [[scuttling]] of captured German U-boats. In early 1946, the ship patrolled Norwegian waters and then was assigned to the Polish Squadron at [[Rosyth]] through June. In late July she was ordered to be paid off and the loan terminated. The ship was disarmed in late August before entering Category C reserve.&lt;ref name=e4/&gt;

===HNLMS ''Marnix'', 1946&amp;ndash;1964===
On 14 November 1946, ''Garland'' was sold &quot;as is&quot; to the Royal Netherlands Navy for £9,000 and was initially used as a school ship. She was refurbished in 1948 as an anti-submarine training ship.&lt;ref name=e4/&gt; This is probably when ''Garland'' was rearmed with two {{convert|105|mm|1|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns in 'A' and 'X' positions, a Hedgehog in 'B' position and six 20-millimetre Oerlikons. She carried four depth charge throwers and two depth charge rails.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was renamed HNLMS ''Marnix'' on 16 January 1950 and made port visits in southern British ports the following March. ''Marnix'' was reclassified as a frigate in 1952 and received a thorough overhaul in 1955–56. She was decommissioned on 31 January 1964 and later scrapped.&lt;ref name=e4/&gt;
