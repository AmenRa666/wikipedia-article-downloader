'''Stephen II''' ({{lang-hu|II István}}; {{lang-hr|Stjepan II}}; {{lang-sk|Štefan II}}; 1101&amp;nbsp;– early 1131), [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]], ruled from 1116 until 1131. His father, [[King Coloman]], had him crowned as a child, thus denying the crown to his uncle [[Álmos, Duke of Croatia|Álmos]]. In the first year of his reign, [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] occupied [[Dalmatia]] and Stephen never restored his rule in that province. His reign was characterized by frequent wars with neighbouring countries.

==Early years (till 1116)==
Stephen and his twin brother, Ladislaus, were sons of the Hungarian king [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman]] by his wife, [[Felicia of Sicily]].{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=149, Appendix 2}}{{sfn|Font|2001|p=78}} According to the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'', they were born &quot;... in the year of our Lord 1101.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 146.104), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=149}} Stephen was named after the [[Stephen I of Hungary|first king of Hungary]], who had been canonized in 1083, implying that he was his father's heir from birth.{{sfn|Font|2001|pp=25, 78–79}} A document written in [[Zadar]] in approximately 1105 AD makes mention of &quot;Stephen, our most renowned king&quot; along with Coloman, proving that the latter had his four-year-old son crowned king.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Font|2001|p=79}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=14}} 
[[File:Álmos herceg.jpg|thumb |right |190px |alt=Álmos and Béla are blinded | [[Álmos, Duke of Croatia|Álmos]] and his son, [[Béla II of Hungary|Béla]] are blinded on Coloman's order (from the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'')]]

By the time of Stephen's coronation, Coloman had demonstrated his intention to secure the succession for his son.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=14}} Coloman's ambitious brother, Álmos {{mdash}} who had already rebelled against the king in 1098 {{mdash}} opposed this plan and left Hungary.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=28}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=14}} He first sought the assistance of [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]], followed by an appeal to Duke [[Boleslaw III of Poland]].{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=28}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|pp=14–15}} When all of his efforts ended in failure, Álmos submitted to Coloman and returned to Hungary, {{sfn|Makk|1989|p=15}} although he made several abortive attempts to dethrone Coloman in the following decade.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=28}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=35}} In order to bring an end to the menace these plots presented to Stephen's succession, Coloman had Álmos and Álmos's little son, [[Béla II of Hungary|Béla]], blinded.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=65–66}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|pp=15–16}}

When he fell gravely ill in early 1116, Coloman also had his brother imprisoned.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=148}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=15-16}} The ''Illuminated Chronicle'' narrates that the dying king &quot;instructed his son and his great men&quot; to invade [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] in order to take vengeance for Coloman's failure in the [[Coloman#Reign#Expansion, internal conflicts and legislation (1096–1105)|1099 siege]] of [[Przemyśl|Peremyshl]] (Przemyśl), Poland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 151.107), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=148}} Coloman died on 3 February 1116.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=28}}

==Reign==

===Wars and internal conflicts (1116–1127)===
[[File:II István koronázása KK.jpg|thumb |upright  |alt=Stephen's coronation | Stephen is crowned king in February 1116 (from the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'')]]
Stephen was crowned king in [[Székesfehérvár]] within thirty days of his father's death.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=18}} His peaceful succession showed the effectiveness of the measures Coloman had implemented to prevent Álmos from usurping the throne. {{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=151}}{{sfn|Font|2001|p=83}} Upon his councilor’s advice, Stephen initiated a meeting with [[Vladislaus I, Duke of Bohemia]], in order to improve the countries' relations, which had deteriorated in the previous decade.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=152}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=19}} The two monarchs met on the river Olšava, which marked the border of their realms.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=19}} However, the lack of mutual confidence hindered the opening of negotiations, leading to armed conflicts which evolved into [[Battle of Olšava|a battle on 13 May]].{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=19}} On the battlefield, the Bohemian army inflicted a serious defeat on Stephen's troops.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=28}} The contemporaneous [[Cosmas of Prague]] blamed the young king's advisors for the fiasco, but later medieval Hungarian chronicles {{mdash}} all completed under kings descending from Stephen's opponent, Álmos {{mdash}} wrote that the king acted without consulting his advisors &quot;... for he was of an impetuous nature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 153.109), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=152–153}}

{{Quote|The Hungarian people are prodigious in energy, mighty in strength, and very powerful in military arms{{mdash}}sufficient to fight with a king of lands anywhere. After the death of their king, Coloman, their princes sent to Duke Vladislav to renew and confirm with the new king, named Stephen, their ancient peace and friendship.&amp;nbsp;... Vladislav came to the River Olšava, which separates the realms of Hungary and Moravia. Immediately, the Hungarian people, innumerable as the sands or drops of rain, covered the whole surface of the land in the field of Lučsko, like locusts.&amp;nbsp;... But, as scripture says, &quot;[[Ecclesiastes|Woe to the land whose king is a child.]]&quot; Their princes, through their inborn pride in themselves, strayed from the duke's peaceful words and sent replies more to stir up strife than to bring the kiss of peace.|Cosmas of Prague: ''The Chronicle of the Czechs''&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmas of Prague: The Chronicle of the Czechs'' (3.42.), pp.&amp;nbsp;230–231.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Ordelafo Faliero]], who had conquered an island in the [[Gulf of Kvarner]] during the last year of Coloman's reign,{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=17}} returned to [[Dalmatia]] at the head of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet in May 1116.{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=203}} On 15 July, he vanquished the Hungarian troops which had arrived to relieve [[Zadar]].{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=203}} Thereafter all towns {{mdash}} including Biograd na Moru, [[Šibenik]], [[Split, Croatia|Split]], and [[Trogir]] {{mdash}} surrendered to Venice, terminating Stephen II's suzerainty along the coastline of the [[Adriatic Sea]].{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=28}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=289}} However, in either 1117 or 1118, the Hungarian troops were able to defeat the Venetians, during which Ordelafo Faliero himself died at a battle near Zadar, enabling Biograd na Moru, Split, and Trogir to rejoin the sovereignty of the Hungarian monarch.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=17}} However, the new Doge, [[Domenico Michele]], invaded and reconquered all Dalmatia.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=19}} A five-year [[truce]], which was concluded in 1117 or 1118, confirmed the ''[[status quo]]'': the seizure of Dalmatia by Venice.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=19}}   
[[File:Borivoj II, Duke of Bohemia nahrobek.jpg|thumb |left |alt=Bořivoj II's tomb |Tomb of [[Bořivoj II, Duke of Bohemia]]{{mdash}}he fought against Hungary, but died in exile in Stephen II's court]]

Stephen's troops launched a plundering raid into [[Margraviate of Austria|Austria]] in 1118, provoking a counter-attack by [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria]], later that same year.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=19}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=153–154}} [[Bořivoj II, Duke of Bohemia]], supported Leopold and pillaged the northwestern regions of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=19}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=153}} Despite this, when [[Vladislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus I]] dethroned his brother Bořivoj in 1120, Bořivoj fled to Hungary and settled at Stephen's court.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=153}}

Stephen married a daughter of [[Robert I of Capua]], in the early 1120s.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=20}} Historian Paul Stephenson wrote that Stephen's marriage alliance with the [[Italo-Norman|Normans of Southern Italy]] &quot;... must have been partly directed against the Venetians.&quot;{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=204}} The [[Principality of Capua#Norman rule|Norman Princes of Capua]] had been the [[Pope]]'s staunch supporters during the [[Investiture Controversy]], suggesting that his marriage also continued his father's pro-Papal foreign policy.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=20}} According to Włodzimierz Dworzaczek, Stephen in 1121 married Adelhaid, daughter of Heinrich, burgrave of Regensburg.&lt;ref&gt;Włodzimierz Dworzaczek: Genealogia. Warszawa 1959. Table 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wincenty Swoboda: Stefan II. In: Słownik Starożytności Słowiańskich. Vol. 8. Part 2. 1996, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen's cousin and the daughter of his uncle Álmos, [[Adelaide of Hungary (d. 1140)|Adelaide]], whose husband [[Soběslav I, Duke of Bohemia|Soběslav]] had been expelled from [[Moravia]], arrived in Hungary in early 1123.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=154}} According to Cosmas of Prague, Stephen &quot;kindly received her&amp;nbsp;... acknowledging her as his relative&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmas of Prague: The Chronicle of the Czechs'' (3.51.), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; which implies that his relations with his uncle were cordial around that time.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=154}} In the same year, the young king launched a military expedition against the [[Principality of Volhynia]] in order to assist its expelled prince, Iaroslav Sviatopolchich, regain his throne.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=20}} Even though Sviatopolchich was assassinated at the beginning of the siege of his former seat, [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]],{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=20}} Stephen decided to continue the war.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=155}} However, according to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', his commanders threatened to dethrone him if he continued the aggression, forcing Stephen to lift the siege and return to Hungary.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=156}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=49}}

{{Quote|Cosma, of the [[Hont-Pázmány|line of Paznan]], stood up before the King and said: &quot;Lord, what is this thing which you are doing? If with the death of a multitude of your soldiers you take the castle, whom will you appoint as its lord? If you choose one among your nobles, he will not remain here. Or do you wish to abandon your kingdom and yourself have the dukedom? We barons will not storm the castle. If you wish to storm it, storm it alone. We are returning to Hungary and we will choose for ourselves a king.&quot; Then by order of the nobles the heralds announced throughout the camp that the Hungarians should return as speedily as possible to Hungary. When the King thus saw himself justly deprived of the help of his people, he returned to Hungary.|''[[Illuminated Chronicle|The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 155.110–111), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Taking advantage of the absence of the Venetian fleet from the Adriatic Sea because of a naval expedition in the [[Levant]], Stephen invaded Dalmatia in the first half of 1124.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=20}} His charter confirming the liberation of Split and Trogir in July 1124 is evidence that the central regions of Dalmatia returned to his rule.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=21}}{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=204}} However, upon the return of the Venetian armada the Dalmatian towns once again surrendered, one after another.{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=204}} According to the ''Historia Ducum Veneticorum'', only the citizens of Biograd na Moru &quot;... dared resist the doge and his army ...&quot;, but &quot;... their city was razed to its foundations.&quot;{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=204}}

According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', the blind Álmos, &quot;... fearing death at the hands of King Stephen ...&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicon_157_112_135&quot;/&gt; fled to the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=156–157}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=23}} Many of his partisans followed him, and Emperor [[John II Komnenos]] settled them in a town in [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]].{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=22}} The Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos]] confirmed that the emperor looked upon Álmos &quot;... favorably and received him with kindness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus by John Kinnamos'' (1.4), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that Stephen &quot;sent his envoys to the emperor and demanded that ...[Álmos]... be expelled from&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus by John Kinnamos'' (1.4), pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; the Byzantine Empire, but his request was rejected.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=22}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=234}} The sources do not specify the date which Álmos's fled, but it likely occurred circa 1125.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=22}} Historian Ferenc Makk wrote that Álmos was forced to flee from Hungary because he had taken advantage of Stephen's failures in Volhynia and Dalmatia, and conspired against Stephen.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=23}}

Stephen met the new Duke of Bohemia, Sobeslav {{mdash}} whose wife was Adelhaid {{mdash}} in October 1126.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=21}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=157}} The meeting of the two monarchs' brought an end to the hostilities between their two countries.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=21}} Around the same year, Stephen also concluded an agreement with Archbishop [[Conrad I of Salzburg]].{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=21}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=157}}

===Last years (1127–1131)===
{{see also|Byzantine–Hungarian War (1127–29)}}
According to the Byzantine chronicler [[Niketas Choniates]], the citizens of the Byzantine town [[Braničevo (Golubac)|Braničevo]] &quot;attacked and plundered the Hungarians who had come to&quot; the Byzantine Empire &quot;to trade, perpetrating the worst crimes against them.&quot;{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=234}}&lt;ref&gt;''O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates'' (1.17) , p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, Stephen decided to wage war against the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=158}} The ''Illuminated Chronicle'' relates that the childless Stephen &quot;... so ordered the succession to the throne that after his death the son of his sister [[Sophia (Coloman of Hungary's daughter)|Sophia]], by name [[Saul of Hungary|Saul]], should reign.&quot;{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 158.112), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle does not specify the date of this event, but Ferenc Makk says that Stephen most probably declared Saul as his heir during the first half of 1127, before storming the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=24}}
[[File:Jean II Comnene.jpg|thumb |left |190px |alt=Emperor John II Komnenos | Mosaic portrait of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] of [[John II Komnenos]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] ([[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]])]]

Stephen broke into the empire in the summer.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=631}} His troops sacked [[Belgrade]], Braničevo and [[Niš]], and plundered the regions around [[Serdica]] (Sofia, [[Bulgaria]]) and [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] (Plovdiv, Bulgaria), before returning to Hungary.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=631}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=234–235}} In response, Emperor John II marched against Hungary in 1128, where he defeated the royal troops in [[Battle of Haram|a battle at Haram]], and &quot;captured [[Fruška Gora|Frangochorion]], the richest land in Hungary&quot; (now in [[Serbia]]).{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=25}} Stephen was unable to participate in the fighting because &quot;he happened to be sickly in body and was recuperating someplace in the midst of his land&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus by John Kinnamos'' (1.4), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; according to John Kinnamos.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=25}} The ''Illuminated Chronicle'' said that his illness was so serious that &quot;all expected his death.&quot;{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=25}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 158.112–113), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle added that &quot;traitors&quot; went so far as to elect two kings, the &quot;Counts Bors and Ivan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 158.113), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=25}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=159}} Upon regaining his health, Stephen had Ivan executed and expelled Bors from his kingdom.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=159}}

John Kinnamos wrote of a second campaign by Stephen against the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Stephenson|2000|p=208}} The Hungarian troops, supported by [[Czechs|Czech]] reinforcements under the command of Duke Vaclav of Olomouc, took Braničevo by storm and destroyed its fortress.{{sfn|Makk|1989|pp=26–27}} Emperor John II Komnenos was forced to retreat and sue for peace.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=27}} Historian Ferenc Makk writes that the resulting peace treaty was signed in October 1129.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=27}}

{{Quote|Going to Branitshevo for a second time,'' [Emperor John] ''made haste to rebuild it. Since some time elapsed in the task, the army, suffering from winter weather and lack of necessities, was in severe distress. When he learned this, the Hungarians' king decided to cross the Danube as quickly as possible and attack them unexpectedly. In the Hungarians' land, however, there was a woman, a Latin by birth, outstanding in wealth and other distinction. Sending to the emperor, she revealed what was being planned. Since he was unable to engage them with an equivalent force, because as stated his army had already been overcome by disease and lack of necessities, he fortified the city where possible and withdrew.''|[[John Kinnamos]]: ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus''&lt;ref&gt;''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus by John Kinnamos'' (1.5), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For many years, Stephen believed that his cousin, Béla, had died after being blinded on the orders of Stephen's father.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=159}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicon_157_112_135&quot;&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 157.112), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Having learnt, around 1129, that Béla was alive, the king &quot;... rejoiced with great joy ...&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicon_157_112_135&quot;/&gt; according to the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=159}} He even granted Béla the town of [[Tolna, Hungary|Tolna]] and arranged Béla's marriage with [[Helena of Rascia]].{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=27}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=50}}

The ''Illuminated Chronicle'' recounts that Stephen showed blatant favoritism towards the &quot;Comans&quot;, identified as [[Pechenegs]] or [[Cumans]] by historians, who had arrived in Hungary in the 1120s.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=253}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=159}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=29}} In his last years, he even tolerated the crimes they committed against his subjects, causing a revolt.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=253}} Before his death, Stephen &quot;... laid aside his royal state and took the habit of a monk ...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 159.113), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=160}} He died of [[dysentery]] in the spring of 1131.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=29}} No source recorded the exact date of his death, but most of his biographies wrote that he died on 1 March.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=135}} He was buried in the [[Oradea#Kings buried|Várad Cathedral]] (Oradea, [[Romania]]).{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=160}}

According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', Stephen had no &quot;wish to marry a lawful wife but took to himself [[concubine]]s and [[harlot]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 154.109–110), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=155}} However, his advisors, &quot;grieving that the kingdom was in a sorry state and the King without a heir&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 154.110), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; persuaded him to marry.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=155}} They chose a daughter of the late [[Robert I of Capua]] as their monarch's wife,{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=155}} although her name was not recorded.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=Appendix 2}} Stephen died childless.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=50}}
