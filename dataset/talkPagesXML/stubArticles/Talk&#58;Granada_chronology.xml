:The edit summaries,  referred to [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]], specifically:
*Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotion
*Wikipedia is not a travel guide
* Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information - merely being true, or even verifiable, does not automatically make something suitable for inclusion in the encyclopedia.
If it can be demonstrated that either of these two events are [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]], and can be verified through a [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that have written about them in non-trivial detail, then I am sure there would be no problem with them them being included in the article. According to [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] &quot;'''the burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with &lt;font color=red&gt;the editor who adds or restores material&lt;/font&gt;'''&quot;. Hopefully, this makes things clearer. Cheers, --[[User:Bye_for_now|Bye for now]]  ([[User_talk:Bye_for_now#top|PTT]]) 23:07, 5 November 2014 (UTC)
::Some events in a city's economic history may not be dramatic, but can be notable nonetheless. See [[Timeline of Paris]] for an example of a city timeline with lots of economic, political, cultural, etc. detail. -- [[User:M2545|M2545]] ([[User talk:M2545|talk]]) 06:06, 6 November 2014 (UTC)

== Possible merge/deletion ==

The more I try to [[WP:FIXIT|FIX]] this article/list or whatever,  the less convinced I become that it should should have been created in the first place.  It can't ever be an article and it's not at all obvious how it could ever really become a reasonable (let alone good) list, even though there is a '''Category:City_timelines'''. 
{{shortcut|WP:LEADFORALIST}}
:''The contents of an article that is a stand-alone list should be clear. If the title does not already clarify what the list includes, then the list's [[Wikipedia:lead section|lead section]] should do so. Don't leave readers confused over the list's inclusion criteria or have editors guessing what may be added to the list.''

:''However short or schematic a list description, [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] applies, including:&lt;blockquote&gt;It should not be asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As it stands,  it doesn't add anything to WP that isn't (or couldn't be) covered within an existing article. If the [[Timeline of Paris]] example is anything to go by,  it will simply act as a magnet for the unsourced and/or trivial. --[[User:Bye_for_now|Bye for now]]  ([[User_talk:Bye_for_now#top|PTT]]) 11:00, 6 November 2014 (UTC)

: [[User:M2545]], please see: [[Talk:Granada#Merger_proposal]] edit: I have also raised the subject of City timelines (in general) [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history#City_timelines|HERE]] --[[User:Bye_for_now|Bye for now]]  ([[User_talk:Bye_for_now#top|PTT]]) 17:25, 6 November 2014 (UTC)

== Picking up after history merge ==

&lt;small&gt;This section is re: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=634385904 WP:AN#Talk:Granada#Merger_proposal] (permalinked)&lt;/small&gt;

{{yo|M2545|Bye for now}} This page is now the result of combining the histories of the former [[Timeline of Granada]] and [[Granada chronology]] articles. B4N, you're right that the merge was undone and your edits mostly removed - that's because M2545 continued to work on the unmerged page after the improper [[WP:COPYPASTE|copy-paste]] move. Had they done that in the original Timeline article, it would look like this. Don't take offense, this is just a starting point.

I propose we move this page to draft space, at [[Draft:Timeline of Granada]]. If we're agreed, I'll move the page and try to clean up the redirects. Moving to [[WP:DRAFTS|Draft:]] means we can leave the mainspace redirects pointing to the History section on [[Granada]] while we work on the timeline article out of public view, can work out the issues, and can restore it to mainspace over the redirect later.

We also need to have criteria for what things can be included in the timeline, and I think that's where the disagreement is going to happen. Have a look at the other articles in [[:Category:Spanish city history timelines]] for some examples. Generally, inclusion criteria for lists are less restrictive than for articles, so items in the list don't necessarily need to pass [[WP:GNG]] on their own. But there should be some bar for importance to be included here. There are some things here that don't belong, per [[WP:NOTTRAVELGUIDE]], in particular anything that's sourced only to [[Lonely Planet]]. Let me know what you think.

:Sounds ok to me. Many thanks for sorting this out. -- [[User:M2545|M2545]] ([[User talk:M2545|talk]]) 21:09, 18 November 2014 (UTC)
:{{yo|Ivanvector}} that worked well, then. --[[User:Bye_for_now|Bye for now]]  ([[User_talk:Bye_for_now#top|PTT]]) 20:49, 26 November 2014 (UTC)</text>
