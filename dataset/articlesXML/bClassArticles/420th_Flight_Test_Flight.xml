The '''420th Flight Test Flight''' (420 FLTF) is an inactive [[United States Air Force Reserve]] squadron.  It was last assigned to the [[413th Flight Test Group]] of [[Air Force Reserve Command]] at [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]], Arizona, where it was inactivated on 31 October 2007.

The squadron was first activated as the '''420th Night Fighter Squadron''', one of the first dedicated Night Fighter Operational Training Squadron of the Air Force.  It trained replacement night fighter pilots who were then deployed overseas into combat until its inactivation in March 1944 due to a re-alignment of training unit designations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night Fighter&quot;&gt;Northrop P-61 Black Widow—The Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reactivated as the  '''420th Air Refueling Squadron''' under [[Tactical Air Command]] in 1954 and moved to England, where it served under the [[United States Air Forces Europe]].  It was inactivated when [[Strategic Air Command]] assumed the role of single manager for USAF [[aerial refueling|air refueling]].  In 1985 the night fighter and refueling squadrons were consolidated into a single unit.

The '''6520th Test Squadron''' was organized in 1989 by [[Air Force Systems Command]].  In 1992, as the USAF eliminated Major Command controlled (MAJCON) units, the 6520th was consolidated with the 420th and re-designated as the '''420th Flight Test Squadron'''.  The squadron was inactivated as an active-duty unit in 1997, but was activated four years later in the Air Force Reserve Command as the '''420th Flight Test Flight'''.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:420th Night Fighter Squadron - Northrop P-61A-10-NO Black Widow 42-39368.jpg|thumb|left|420th Night Fighter Squadron Northrop P-61A Black Widow]]
The squadron was activated on 1 June 1943 at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida as the third night fighter training squadron of the [[481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group]] (481 NFOTG).   Its mission was to be a Replacement Training Unit (RTU) for Night Fighter pilots. It accepted [[Army Air Forces Training Command]]'s twin-engine flying training and B–25 transition school graduates and trained them as night fighter pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night Fighter&quot;/&gt;

The initial squadron personnel were veteran pilots of the 481 NFOTG, with some being transferred from the group's [[348th Night Fighter Squadron|348th]] and [[349th Night Fighter Squadron]]s which performed Operational Training of new squadrons.  It was initially equipped with Douglas DB-7s and Douglas P-70s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night Fighter&quot;/&gt;
  
As 1943 progressed additional aircraft and equipment arrived and the program expanded.   In September, the first American-built dedicated night fighter began to arrive, the Northrup YP-61 Black Widow and a few production P-61As. In January 1944 the entire program moved to [[Hammer Field]], California and was placed under [[IV Fighter Command]].  The move placed the squadron near Northrop manufacturing facility at Hawthorne, California and most programmed P-61 squadrons were planned for operations in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] and [[China Burma India Theater]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night Fighter&quot;/&gt;
  
In March 1944 the 420th was disbanded when the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit during a reorganization of units in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Craven, Wesley F |editor2=Cate, James L |title=The Army Air Forces in World War II|volume=Vol. VI, Men &amp; Planes|year=1955|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|oclc=704158| lccn=48003657|page=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron's personnel and equipment were transferred to Squadron C of the '''450th Army Air Forces Base Unit''' (Night Fighter Replacement Training Unit).&lt;ref name=&quot;Night Fighter&quot;/&gt;

===Cold War===
[[File:420th Air Refueling Squadron Bell-Atlanta KB-29P-45-BA Superfortress 44-83906.jpg|thumb|420th Air Refueling Squadron Boeing KB-29P Superfortress at RAF Sculthorpe 1956]]
[[File:420th Air Refueling Squadron - Boeing KB-50J-125-BO Superfortress 49-376.jpg|thumb|420th Air Refueling Squadron Boeing KB-50 Superfortress, about 1961]]
The '''420th Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated in 1954 by [[Tactical Air Command]] to provide dedicated [[aerial refueling|air refueling]] for TAC [[bomber]]s, [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, and fighter bombers. The 420th was activated at [[Alexandria AFB]], Louisiana and was the first TAC air refueling squadron. The squadron received KB-29Ps fitted with the refueling boom.&lt;ref name=&quot;TT&quot;&gt;[http://www.tactankers.com TacTankers.com - 420th Air Refueling Squadron]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 the unit deployed to [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] and was based at [[RAF Sculthorpe]], Norfolk, England to provide air refueling for USAFE squadrons.  However, the KB-29s were simply too slow to refuel jet fighters.  The increasing performance of operational fighters made it necessary to boost the performance of the tankers, and this was done by re-equipping with the KB-50 Superfortress in 1957 which provided greater speed to refuel jet aircraft.  KB-50s were modified to KB-50J configuration in 1958 which added a J-47 turbojet engine underneath each wing in place of the auxiliary fuel tanks to increase the speed of the aircraft. The KB-29P was phased out in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;TT&quot;/&gt;

Unfortunately, the elderly KB-50Js began to deteriorate almost as soon as they were delivered, and due to a chronic parts shortage TAC was forced to resort to cannibalization to keep the retrofitted tanker aircraft flying. Landing gear malfunctions were frequent, and many parts started to break simply because of old age. More and more maintenance had to be performed in order to keep the aircraft flying.&lt;ref&gt;Knaack, Post-World War II Bombers, Office of Air Force History, United States Air Force; First Edition (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963 the squadron's aircraft began to be phased out, the mission being taken over primarily by [[Air National Guard]] [[Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker]]s. rotating to Europe under Operation Creek Party.  The squadron inactivated in early 1964 and its KB-50Js were sent to the [[Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center]] at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]]. Arizona.&lt;ref name=&quot;TT&quot;/&gt;

===B-2 Spirit Flight Testing===
[[Air Force Systems Command]] activated the '''6520th Test Squadron''' in March 1989 at [[Edwards AFB]], California.  Its mission was the pre-operational testing of the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber.  The B-2 was first revealed to the public on 22 November 1988, when AV-1 (82-1066 &quot;Spirit of America&quot;) was unveiled at [[Air Force Plant 42]] near [[Palmdale]], California. At this time the aircraft was still not ready for its first flight.  Taxi tests began on 10 July 1989. The B-2 finally made its first flight on 17 July 1989 from Palmdale. The flight lasted 112 minutes and ended with a landing at Edwards and delivery to the 6520th.&lt;ref name=&quot;B2&quot;&gt;[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/newb2_1.html Baugher, Northrop B-2A Spirit]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:B-2 Sprirt Rollout - 22 November 1988.jpg|thumb|left|B-2 Spirit Rollout - 22 November 1988.  The 420th Flight Test Squadron performed test flights with the B-2.]]
After carrying out initial tests, AV-1 was used for radar cross section tests. In early 1993, AV-1 was placed in long term storage to await upgrading to full service configuration prior to joining the operational fleet.  The second test aircraft (AV-2, 82-1067 &quot;Spirit of Arizona&quot;) flew for the first time on 19 October 1990 from Palmdale, landing at Edwards AFB. It was heavily instrumented and served as the loads test aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;B2&quot;/&gt;

AV-3 (82-1068 &quot;Spirit of New York&quot;) took to the air for the first time on 18 June 1991. It was the first radar and navigation test aircraft.  AV-4 (82-1069 &quot;Spirit of Indiana&quot;) followed on 17 April 1992, and AV-5 (82-1070 &quot;Spirit of Ohio&quot;) on 5 October 1992. These two planes were used for avionics and weapons testing. The first bomb to be tested with the B-2 was a 2000-lb Mk 84, which was dropped from AV-4 on 12 September 1992. AV-5 was the intended for armament, climactic, and low-observability testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;B2&quot;/&gt;

On 1 October 1992, the '''6520th Test Squadron''' was consolidated with the '''420th Air Refueling Squadron'''.  The next day the consolidated unit was renamed the '''420th Test Squadron'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFHRA&quot;&gt;[http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10742 AFHRA 420th Flight Test Flight Lineage and History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last development aircraft, AV-6 (82-1071 &quot;Spirit of Mississippi&quot;) flew on 2 February 1993. It was used for technical order validation and for further weapons and avionics testing. By January 1995 the six B-2s had logged more than 2300 hours in the air in more than 490 flights. Terrain-following certification flights were undertaken by AV-4 in September 1996. By January 1997, the B-2 had reached limited operational capability and testing at Edwards was phased down.  B-2 flight testing was transferred to the [[419th Flight Test Squadron]] and the squadron was inactivated at the end of 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;B2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgibin.rcn.com/jeremy.k/cgi-bin/gzUsafSearch.pl?target=&amp;content=Northrop+B-2 B-2 Spirit serial number search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===T-38 Talon Flight Testing===
The 420th was reactivated in 2001 at [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]], Arizona (formerly [[Williams AFB]]) as the '''420th Flight Test Flight'''.  The flight acted as a [[T-38 Talon]] functional check flight organization. The 420th replaced Operating Location E of the '''622d Regional Support Group''', which originally stood up in May 2000. After the '''413th Flight Test Group''' was created at [[Robins Air Force Base]], Georgia, transferred to the group in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFHRA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T38&quot;&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Flight+test+unit+closes+its+doors.-a0220424686 Flight test unit closes its doors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit supported the T-38C avionics upgrade program by flying depot-level test sorties and acceptance check flights after the cockpit upgrades were completed. In addition, pilots would pick up aircraft and bring them to Mesa for upgrade at a [[Boeing]] facility and then deliver them after the work was complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;T38&quot;/&gt;  The squadron was inactivated on 30 October 2007 due to budget reductions.&lt;ref name=&quot;T38&quot;/&gt;
