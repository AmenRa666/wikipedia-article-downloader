[[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] '''Sir Alexander Beville Gibbons Stanier, 2nd Baronet of Peplow Hall''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]], [[Military Cross|MC]]  (31 January 1899 – 10 January 1995) was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought in the [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], particularly distinguished for his actions at [[Boulogne]] in 1940, on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] in 1944, and in the Rhineland in 1944.&lt;ref name = Times&gt;Obituary, ''The Times (London)'' 25 January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Stanier was born on 31 January 1899, the eldest son of [[Sir Beville Stanier, 1st Baronet|Beville Stanier]] of [[Peplow Hall]] in Shropshire. His father was elected Member of Parliament for [[Newport (Shropshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport, Shropshire]], in 1908, and was created a [[Baronet]] by [[David Lloyd George]] in 1917 for organising [[Sugar beet]] production during the Great War. In that year, his son Alexander, who had been educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], passed through the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Royal Military College]] at Sandhurst as a wartime cadet and was commissioned into the newly raised [[Welsh Guards]] on 21 December.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Burke&gt;''Burke's Peerage and Baronetage'', 109th Edn, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Who&gt;''Who Was Who 1990–95''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sandhurstcollection.org.uk/view/5773/110450/ Sandhurst Register]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30438|supp=yes|startpage=13335|date=18 December 1917|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==

===First World War===
In his year with the 1st Battalion of the Welsh Guards on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], Stanier displayed aptitude for the mobile warfare that followed the crumbling of the German defences. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) (dated 2 April 1919&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31266|supp=yes|startpage=4332|date=1 April 1919|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for his actions during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Second Battle of Cambrai]], a month before the Armistice. His citation reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31680|supp=yes|startpage=15369|date=9 December 1919|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''For conspicuous gallantry and able leadership at St. Vaast on 11 October 1918. He rallied his platoon under heavy fire, and after personally reconnoiting (''sic'') the ground in front, led his men forward 200 yards to a good fir[ing] position. His good leadership and prompt action prevented casualties and gained valuable ground.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interwar period===
Stanier decided to pursue a military career when the war ended, and he continued in the Army rather than manage the family estates when his father died in 1921 and he succeeded to the [[Stanier baronets|baronetcy]] as '''Sir Alexander Stanier'''.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt; He was promoted to lieutenant on 21 June 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31515|supp=yes|startpage=10620|date=19 August 1919|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the 1st Bn Welsh Guards in Germany, Egypt and Gibraltar, being the battalion [[Adjutant]] in 1923–26, with a promotion to captain on 1 October 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32982|supp=|startpage=7433|date=14 October 1924|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1927 to 1930 he was Military Secretary to the [[Governor of Gibraltar]], successively serving [[Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet|General Sir Charles Monro]] and [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]].&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt;&lt;ref name = Who/&gt; He was promoted to major on 1 October 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33868|supp=|startpage=6175|date=30 September 1932|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to lieutenant-colonel on 18 May 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34636|supp=|startpage=4042|date=16 June 1939|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War and Boulogne===
On the outbreak of the Second World War, Stanier was given the task of raising a second Battalion of the Welsh Guards. In May 1940, when it became clear that the [[Battle of France]] was lost and that the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] would have to be evacuated, 2nd Welsh Guards and 2nd [[Irish Guards]] were hastily sent (as [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Independent Infantry Brigade]]) to [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|Boulogne]] to cover the withdrawal of British troops through that port. This was a hazardous operation and could easily have led to the destruction or capture of the force, but Stanier made his dispositions soundly, and although badly mauled his battalion was successfully evacuated by the [[Royal Navy]] while destroyers engaged German tanks on the quay. Stanier was awarded his first [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] for his bravery and leadership during this two-day operation.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home defence===
Stanier was given the temporary rank of brigadier and assigned command of a new home defence brigade, [[223rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)|223rd Independent Infantry Brigade]], which he commanded and trained from its formation on 18 October 1940 until it was converted into [[3rd Parachute Brigade]] on 7 November 1942. He continued in command during the conversion period until 8 December 1942, when he handed over to Brigadier [[Gerald Lathbury]] of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp 386, 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 1943 he took command of [[183rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|183rd Infantry Brigade]] forming part of [[61st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|61st Infantry Division]], a Second-Line [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] formation also deployed in a home defence role.&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; At one point during these years of training, Stanier lost an eye when a soldier dropped a primed grenade by mistake. Luckily, the doctors did not downgrade him medically, because he was selected for a key role in the forthcoming [[Normandy landings]].&lt;ref name = Times/&gt; He was promoted to colonel on 31 December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36328|supp=|startpage=277|date=11 January 1944|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arromanches===
[[File:Plaque general Stanier Arromanches.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Memorial to Stanier at Arromanches'']]
On 23 February 1944 Stanier transferred from 183 Bde to take command of [[231st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|231st Infantry Brigade]]. The brigade was composed of Regular battalions from Southern England that had formed part of the garrison of Malta all through the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|siege]] of 1940–42. They had then become an independent brigade group for the amphibious operation against Sicily ([[Operation Husky]]). Now they were to use that experience to spearhead the assault landings on D-Day.&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 392–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the command of [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], Stanier and 231 Bde were tasked with capturing 'Jig' Beach, the westernmost section of [[Gold Beach]]. The coast here is low-lying and sandy, but with soft patches of clay on the foreshore, and soggy grassland inland, both of which would bog down heavy vehicles. The beach was defended with beach obstacles and covered by fire from the German strongpoints at [[Asnelles|Asnelles sur Mer and le Hamel]]. Once ashore, 231 Bde was to push westwards along the coast to capture [[Arromanches-les-Bains]], the planned site of the artificial [[Mulberry harbour]] that was crucial to the invasion plan.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Vol I, pp. 171–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan began to break down from the beginning. Bad weather and enemy fire delayed the amphibious [[DD tank]]s and [[Royal Marines Armoured Support Group]] tanks, so the first wave of infantry landed at 07.25 without any support. Two control vessels were hit during the run-in, which meant that the planned artillery shoot on le Hamel did not happen, and an attack by RAF [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoons]] had failed to suppress its garrison. The leading companies of the 1st Bn [[Hampshire Regiment]] lost their senior officers, wireless sets and artillery observers, and were unable to call down supporting fire, but when the rest of the battalion arrived 20 minutes later they organised an infantry attack on the le Hamel position. On their left the 1st Bn [[Dorset Regiment]] had better luck, and with the help of [[Mine flail|flail tanks]] of the [[Westminster Dragoons]] began to clear beach exits and move inland.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Vol I, pp. 174–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 08.15, 231's reserve battalion, 2nd [[Devonshire Regiment|Devons]], began landing, closely followed by [[No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando]] and then Stanier's HQ. The Commandos lost a number of men and vital equipment during the landing, but with a wireless set borrowed from 231 Bde HQ, they set off westwards to make contact with the US troops at [[Omaha Beach]], while Stanier organised an attack against le Hamel, supported by [[147th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery]]. By nightfall, both le Hamel and Arromanches were in British hands: 231 Bde had taken the Arromanches radar station and the German artillery battery was abandoned without firing a shot after being shelled by the cruiser {{HMS|Emerald|D66}}. Stanier had also been able to send the Dorsets to help [[8th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Armoured Brigade]] take [[Loucelles]] from the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]].&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Vol I, pp. 175–6, 209, 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Stanier was treated as a hero by the liberated people of Asnelles and Arromanches, who named a town square after him. He attended the 40th and 50th D-Day anniversary celebrations, and was a leading instigator of the Arromanches museum. In 1988, he was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] for his outstanding services to Anglo-French relations.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;

===North-West Europe===
After D-Day, Stanier led 231 Bde in all of 50th Division's operations for the rest of 1944. On 14 June, the brigade captured la Senaudière during [[Operation Perch]], and after weeks of fighting in the ''bocage'' it headed the division's attack on Caumont on 30 July during the break-out from the Normandy beachhead. By late August the division was supporting the British armoured divisions in their thrust across the [[River Seine]] towards the [[River Somme]] and the Belgian frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Vol I, pp. 255, 388–9, 470.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 231 Brigade, under the command of [[Guards Armoured Division]], helped to liberate [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Vol II, pp 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

50th Division had a minor role in [[Operation Market Garden]]: on 17 September Stanier's 2nd Dorsets actually supported the Irish Guards Group at the beginning of Guards Armoured's attack up the road towards the airborne troops' drop zones on the way to [[Arnhem]], but as the operation progressed the division was left to protect the narrow corridor behind the advancing tanks. After the failure of Market Garden, 50th Division was left to defend the captured area beyond the [[River Waal]] against determined German counter-attacks in early October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Vol II, pp. 32, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanier was later awarded a Bar to his DSO for his actions during the autumn of bitter fighting in the Rhine valley.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;

By now the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] was suffering an acute manpower shortage, and as the junior English formation in the theatre, 50th Division was chosen to be broken to provide drafts to other divisions. On 29 October it moved back into Belgium, from which the headquarters and cadres of the skeleton division returned to the United Kingdom to reform as a training division.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Vol II, pp 158–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 231 became a Reserve Brigade. Stanier left on 14 February 1945 to take command of another Reserve Brigade (69th) briefly, before reverting to the rank of lieutenant-colonel to command the Welsh Guards with the remit to prepare for demobilisation and postwar reorganisation.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 299, 392–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
Stanier was awarded a number of foreign decorations for his wartime service, including the Belgian [[Order of Leopold II]] and Belgian [[Croix de guerre (Belgium)|Croix de Guerre]] (with palms), and the US [[Silver Star]]. After commanding the Welsh Guards in the early postwar years, Stanier retired from the Army on 2 May 1948 with the honorary rank of brigadier.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt;&lt;ref name = Who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38278|supp=yes|startpage=2741|date=30 April 1948|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peplow Hall had been sold in the 1920s, Stanier returned in retirement to the family tradition of farming and local politics in Shropshire. He became a county councillor in 1950, serving for eight years, and was [[High Sheriff of Shropshire]] and [[Deputy Lieutenant]] for the county in 1951. Stanier was county president of [[St John Ambulance (England and the Islands)|St John Ambulance]] from 1950 to 1960.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt;&lt;ref name = Who/&gt; He was also Chairman of the governors for [[Thomas Adams School|Adams Grammar School]] in [[Wem]] for a number of years.

==Social and family life==
His father's career gave Stanier contacts with leading politicians of the day and with the [[British Royal Family]]. He was a close friend of the [[Edward VIII|Duke of Windsor]], and also with the [[Romanian royal family|Romanian]] and [[Greek Royal Family|Greek]] Royal families. [[George II of Greece|King George II of Greece]] became godfather to Stanier's son.&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;

On 21 July 1927 Stanier married Dorothy Gladys, daughter of Brigadier-General Douglas Miller of [[Shotover|Shotover Park]], Wheatley, Oxfordshire. They had two children:&lt;ref name = Times/&gt;&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt;&lt;ref name = Who/&gt;
