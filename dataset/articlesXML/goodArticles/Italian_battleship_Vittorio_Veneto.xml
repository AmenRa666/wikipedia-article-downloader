'''''Vittorio Veneto''''' was the second member of the {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|4}} of [[battleship]]s that served in the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) during [[World War II]]. Her keel was laid down in October 1934, she was launched in July 1937, and she was readied for service with the Italian fleet by August 1940. She was named after the Italian victory at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]] during [[World War I]], and she had three sister ships: {{ship|Italian battleship|Littorio||2}}, {{ship|Italian battleship|Roma|1940|2}}, and {{ship|Italian battleship|Impero||2}}, though only ''Littorio'' and ''Roma'' were completed during the war. She was armed with a main battery of nine {{convert|381|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} guns in three triple turrets, and could steam at a speed of {{convert|30|kn}}.

''Vittorio Veneto'' saw extensive service during the war and participated in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] in November 1940 and the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941. She was damaged by torpedoes several times, including in the engagement off Cape Matapan and by the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|Urge}} in December 1941, though she escaped undamaged during the British [[Battle of Taranto|raid on Taranto]] in November 1940. She spent 1941 and early 1942 attempting to attack British convoys to [[Malta]], but crippling fuel shortages in the Italian fleet curtailed activity thereafter. ''Vittorio Veneto'' was among the Italian ships that were surrendered to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in September 1943 after Italy withdrew from the war, and she spent the following three years under British control in Egypt. After the war, she was allocated as a [[war prize]] to Britain and subsequently broken up for scrap.

==Description==
{{main|Littorio-class battleship}}
[[File:Littorio class battleship.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing of the ''Littorio'' class]]

''Vittorio Veneto'' was {{convert|237.76|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|32.82|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.6|m|abbr=on}}. She was designed with a [[standard displacement]] of {{convert|40724|LT}}, a violation of the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} restriction of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]; at full combat loading, she displaced {{convert|45236|LT}}. The ship was powered by four Belluzo geared [[steam turbine]]s rated at {{convert|128000|shp|lk=in}}. Steam was provided by eight oil-fired [[Yarrow boiler]]s. The engines provided a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}} and a range of {{convert|3920|mi|km nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|20|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}. ''Vittorio Veneto'' had a crew of 1,830 to 1,950 over the course of her career.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D435&quot;&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GC289&gt;Gardiner &amp; Chesneau, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vittorio Veneto''{{'}}s main armament consisted of nine [[381mm / 50 Model 1934 naval gun|{{convert|381|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} 50-caliber Model 1934 guns]] in three triple turrets; two turrets were placed forward in a [[superfire|superfiring arrangement]] and the third was located aft. Her secondary anti-surface armament consisted of twelve {{convert|152|mm|abbr=on}} /55 Model 1934/35 guns in four triple turrets [[amidships]]. These were supplemented by four {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} /40 Model 1891/92 guns in single mounts; these guns were old weapons and were primarily intended to fire [[star shell]]s. ''Vittorio Veneto'' was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery that comprised twelve [[Cannone da 90/53|{{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} /53 Model 1939 guns]] in single mounts, twenty {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} /54 guns in eight twin and four single mounts, and sixteen {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} /65 guns in eight twin mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Chesneau, pp. 289&amp;ndash;290&lt;/ref&gt; EC 3 ter Gufo [[radar]], which could detect surface targets at a range of {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} and aircraft at {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}, was installed in July 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; De Toro, pp. 100&amp;ndash;102&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was protected by a main [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on}} with a second layer of steel that was {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The main deck was {{convert|162|mm|abbr=on}} thick in the central area of the ship and reduced to {{convert|45|mm|abbr=on}} in less critical areas. The main battery turrets were {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on}} thick and the lower turret structure was housed in barbettes that were also 350&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The secondary turrets had 280&amp;nbsp;mm thick faces and the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|260|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.&lt;ref name=GC289/&gt; ''Vittorio Veneto'' was fitted with a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] on her stern and equipped with three [[IMAM Ro.43]] reconnaissance [[float plane]]s or [[Reggiane Re.2000]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; de Toro, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==

===Construction===
''Vittorio Veneto'' was ordered under the 1934 construction program, and was named for the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], a decisive Italian victory over the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in October&amp;ndash;November 1918 during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[keel]] was laid on 28 October 1934 at ''Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico'' in [[Trieste]], the same day as her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Italian battleship|Littorio||2}}. ''Vittorio Veneto'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 July 1937, and major construction was completed by October 1939. The [[fitting-out]] process was greatly delayed due to repeated changes to the design and shortages of heavy armor plate. Before she could begin [[sea trials]], ''Vittorio Veneto'' was moved to [[Venice]] on 4 October to have her bottom cleaned of the [[fouling]] that had accumulated during the long fitting-out period, since the [[Venice Arsenal]] had the only drydock in Italy long enough to accommodate a ship the size of the ''Littorio'' class.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; De Toro, pp. 118&amp;ndash;119&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October, with the cleaning completed, the dockyard personnel flooded the drydock to conduct stability tests. The new battleship moved to [[Trieste]] on 19 October, and her trials began on 23 October. The trials, which also included tests for the ship's weaponry, lasted until March 1940, after which some additional fitting-out work was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; De Toro, pp. 119&amp;ndash;120&lt;/ref&gt; She was delivered on 28 April, though she was not yet complete. On 1 May, ''Vittorio Veneto'' was sent to [[La Spezia]] for final fitting-out work, escorted by the [[destroyer]]s {{ship|Italian destroyer|Leone Pancaldo||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Emanuele Pessagno||2}}. On 6 May, she was loaded with shells for her main battery; the loading work for the main and secondary guns lasted until 20 May. Later that day, she was transferred to [[Taranto]], escorted by the destroyers {{ship|Italian destroyer|Ascari||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Carabiniere||2}}, where she joined the 9th Division of the Italian fleet. The following month, Italy joined the war against Britain and France, though it wasn't until 2 August that ''Vittorio Veneto'' and ''Littorio'' were formally declared operational.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 169, 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagnaso &amp; De Toto, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
On 31 August &amp;ndash; 2 September 1940, ''Vittorio Veneto'' sortied as part of an Italian force of five battleships, ten [[cruiser]]s, and thirty-four destroyers to intercept British naval forces taking part in [[Operation Hats]] and Convoy MB.3, but contact was not made with either group due to poor aerial reconnaissance and no action occurred.&lt;ref name=W172&gt;Whitley, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; de Toro, pp. 167&amp;ndash;169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, British aerial reconnaissance detected the oncoming Italian fleet and was able to escape. On 6 September, the fleet sortied again to attack a British force that had been reported leaving [[Gibraltar]], but the British ships instead steamed south into the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; A similar outcome resulted from the movement against British Operation &quot;MB.5&quot; on 29 September - 1 October; ''Vittorio Veneto'', four other battleships, eleven cruisers, and twenty-three destroyers had attempted to intercept the convoy carrying troops to [[Malta]].&lt;ref name=W172/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagnasco &amp; de Toro, pp. 170&amp;ndash;172&lt;/ref&gt; In this operation, the Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Royal Air Force) did locate the convoy, but the British were able to evade the Italian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 10&amp;ndash;11 November, the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] launched an air raid on the harbor in Taranto. Twenty-one [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish torpedo bombers]] launched from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}} attacked the Italian fleet in two waves.&lt;ref name=R47/&gt; The Italian base was defended by twenty-one 90&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns and dozens of smaller 37&amp;nbsp;mm and 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns, along with twenty-seven [[barrage balloon]]s. The defenders did not possess radar, however, and so were caught by surprise when the Swordfish arrived. The first wave struck at 20:35, followed by the second about an hour later.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vittorio Veneto'' was undamaged in the attack, but three other battleships were hit, two of which were severely damaged.&lt;ref name=R47&gt;Rohwer, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The morning after the Taranto raid, ''Vittorio Veneto'' led the Italian fleet to [[Naples]]. There, she took over the role of fleet [[flagship]], under the command of Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]].&lt;ref name=W172/&gt;

====Battle of Cape Spartivento====
{{main|Battle of Cape Spartivento}}
[[File:RNVittorio Veneto-Battle of Cape Spartivento.jpg|thumb|left|''Vittorio Veneto'' at the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]]; {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}} is directly astern]]

On 17 November, ''Vittorio Veneto'' and {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}}&amp;mdash;the only operational Italian battleships&amp;mdash;participated in an attempt to intercept the British [[Operation White]] convoy to Malta, though the forces made no contact.&lt;ref&gt;De La Sierra, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November, the Italian fleet made another attempt to attack a British convoy, [[Operation Collar (convoy)|Operation Collar]], which resulted in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] (known as the Battle of Cape Teulada to the Italians). ''Vittorio Veneto'', ''Giulio Cesare'', six cruiser, and fourteen destroyers attempted to catch a convoy steaming to Malta. The British escort included the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}}, the battleship {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}}, and the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}; Italian aerial reconnaissance detected the escorts but exaggerated their strength and Campioni, under orders to not risk his two operational battleships against equal or stronger opponents, broke off the engagement shortly after it began. ''Vittorio Veneto'' briefly engaged several British cruisers and slightly damaged the [[light cruiser]] ''[[HMS Manchester (15)|Manchester]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, pp. 383&amp;ndash;384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; During the engagement, ''Ark Royal'' launched torpedo bombers against ''Vittorio Veneto'', but the latter successfully evaded the torpedoes.&lt;ref name=W172/&gt;

Repeated British air attacks on Naples, one of which damaged the cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Pola||2}}, prompted the high command to move ''Vittorio Veneto'' and the rest of the major warships of the fleet to [[Sardinia]] on 14 December. They were returned to Naples six days later, however, after the high command concluded that removing the fleet to Sardinia would allow British convoys from Alexandria to reach Malta with relative ease.&lt;ref name=GD384&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 8&amp;ndash;9 January 1941, the British launched an air raid with [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers on the Italian fleet in Naples, but the aircraft again failed to hit ''Vittorio Veneto''; ''Giulio Cesare'' was slightly damaged by several near misses. Both ships were moved to La Spezia the next day, with ''Vittorio Veneto'' providing cover for ''Giulio Cesare''. ''Vittorio Veneto'' was now the only operational battleship in the fleet.&lt;ref name=W172/&gt;&lt;ref name=GD384/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Giulio Cesare'' was back in service by early February, as was {{ship|Italian battleship|Andrea Doria||2}}. The three battleships, along with eight destroyers, attempted to intercept [[Force H]] on 8 February, which was en route to bombard [[Genoa]]. The two forces did not encounter each other, and the Italian fleet returned to La Spezia.&lt;ref name=W172/&gt;

====Battle of Cape Matapan====
[[File:Veneto guns at Gaudos.jpg|thumb|left|''Vittorio Veneto'' firing upon Allied cruisers during the daytime phase of the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] near the Island of [[Gavdos]]]]
{{main|Battle of Cape Matapan}}

''Vittorio Veneto'' returned to Naples on 22 March, and four days later led an attempt to attack British shipping off Greece, in company with eight cruisers and nine destroyers.&lt;ref name=W172/&gt; The fleet would be supported by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' and the German ''[[Fliegerkorps X]]'' (10th Air Corps).&lt;ref name=GD384/&gt; This operation resulted in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]; the engagement began when the Italian 3rd Division&amp;mdash;comprising the two {{sclass-|Trento|cruiser|0}} heavy cruisers and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Bolzano||2}} and commanded by Vice Admiral [[Luigi Sansonetti]]&amp;mdash;encountered the British 15th Cruiser Squadron. Iachino attempted to maneuver ''Vittorio Veneto'' to the east of the British cruisers while they were distracted with Sansonetti's cruisers, but {{HMS|Orion|85|6}} spotted the battleship before she could close the trap. ''Vittorio Veneto'' immediately opened fire and quickly found the range, but only inflicted splinter damage on ''Orion'', which fled to the south, back toward the main British fleet. Misfires in ''Vittorio Veneto''{{'}}s forward-most turret forced her to cease firing temporarily. The Italian gunners quickly returned the guns to action, however, and resumed their bombardment of the British cruisers. Poor visibility and smokescreens hampered the accuracy of ''Vittorio Veneto''{{'}}s gunners and they scored no hits, though they [[:wikt:straddle|straddled]] the cruisers several times. In the course of this phase of the battle, she had fired 92 rounds from her main battery.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, pp. 86&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veneto sailing out of the battle area.jpg|thumb|''Vittorio Veneto'' withdraws from Cape Matapan after being torpedoed by RN aircraft.]]
During this period of the battle, torpedo bombers from the carrier {{HMS|Formidable|67|6}} arrived on the scene, and their attack forced ''Vittorio Veneto'' to break off the engagement with the British cruisers to take evasive action. She evaded the torpedoes, but the attack convinced Iachino that the Mediterranean Fleet was at sea, which prompted him to end the operation and return to port. The British launched several air attacks against the Italian fleet in an attempt to slow down ''Vittorio Veneto'', including land-based [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] bombers from Greece and Crete. Later in the afternoon ''Formidable'' launched a second strike, and at 15:10 one of her Swordfish hit ''Vittorio Veneto'' on her port side, aft.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, pp. 90&amp;ndash;91&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian anti-aircraft gunners shot the plane down after it launched its torpedo. The hit sheared off the port side propeller, damaged the shaft, jammed the port rudder, and disabled the aft port pumps. It also caused severe flooding&amp;mdash;some {{convert|4000|LT}} of water entered the ship&amp;mdash;which gave her a 4&amp;ndash;4.5&amp;nbsp;degree list to port, and forced her to stop for about ten minutes. While she was immobilized, a Blenheim bomber dropped a bomb that landed near her stern; the blast caused further, minor damage to stern.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 172&amp;ndash;174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, pp. 387&amp;ndash;388&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage control parties had great difficulty in controlling and reducing the flooding, since they could only use emergency hand pumps. Some forward and starboard voids were counter-flooded to reduce the list. In the meantime, engine room personnel were able to restart the starboard shafts and steering could be effected with the backup hand-steering gear.&lt;ref name=GD388/&gt; After she got back underway, she was able to slowly increase her speed to {{convert|20|kn}} using only her starboard shafts. While the Italian fleet was withdrawing, ''Formidable'' launched another air strike of nine Swordfish in an attempt to slow ''Vittorio Veneto'' down. But instead of hitting the Italian battleship, they struck the cruiser ''Pola'', leaving her dead in the water. ''Vittorio Veneto'' returned to port while two cruisers and several destroyers were detached to protect ''Pola''; all three cruisers and two destroyers were sunk in a furious night action at very close range with the battleships {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}, {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}}, and {{HMS|Barham|04|2}}.&lt;ref name=GD388&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vittorio Veneto'' meanwhile reached Taranto on 29 March, where repairs lasted until July.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; She was not fully operational again until August.&lt;ref name=GD389&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later operations====
[[File:Линкор Витторио Венето.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Vittorio Veneto'' at sea]]
''Vittorio Veneto'' and ''Littorio'' participated in an unsuccessful sortie to intercept British forces on 22&amp;ndash;25 August. The British had intended to mine [[Livorno]] and launch an air raid on northern Sardinia, but Italian agents in Spain warned the ''Regia Marina'' of the British operation when it departed Gibraltar. The Italian fleet positioned itself too far to the south, however, and aerial reconnaissance failed to locate the British.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, ''Vittorio Veneto'' led the attack on the Allied convoy in [[Operation Halberd]] on 27 September 1941, in company with ''Littorio'', five cruisers, and fourteen destroyers. The British had hoped to lure out the Italian fleet and attack it with a powerful convoy escort centered on the battleships {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}, {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}}, and {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}. It too ended without contact with the British fleet; neither side located the other, but Italian torpedo bombers hit ''Nelson''. At 14:00, Iachino cancelled the operation and ordered the fleet to return to port.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, pp. 389&amp;ndash;390&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December, she participated in another operation to escort a convoy to North Africa, but the attempt was broken off after a British radio deception effort convinced the Italians that the British fleet was in the area. While returning to port the following day, ''Vittorio Veneto'' was torpedoed by the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|Urge}} in the [[Straits of Messina]]. ''Urge'' fired a spread of three torpedoes, but only one hit on her port side. The torpedo tore a hole {{convert|13|m|abbr=on}} long and caused over {{convert|2000|MT|sp=us}} of water to flood the ship, though the ship's [[Pugliese torpedo defense system]] successfully contained the explosion. ''Vittorio Veneto'' took on a 3.5&amp;nbsp;degree list to port and was down by {{convert|2.2|m|abbr=on}} by the stern. Some counter flooding of a compartment on the starboard side abreast of the forward-most turret reduced the list by a degree, and she was able to steam under her own power back to port.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Taranto for repairs, which lasted until early 1942.&lt;ref name=W175/&gt;

On 14 June, ''Littorio'' participated in the interception of the [[Operation Vigorous]] convoy to Malta from Alexandria. ''Littorio'', ''Vittorio Veneto'', four cruisers and twelve destroyers were sent to attack the convoy.&lt;ref name=S40&gt;Stille, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The British quickly located the approaching Italian fleet and launched several air strikes early on 15 June with Wellington and [[Bristol Beaufort]] bombers in an attempt to prevent them from reaching the convoy. The aircraft scored no hits on the battleships, but they did disable the cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Trento||2}}, which was later sunk by a British submarine. Later that morning another air attack, this time [[B-24 Liberator]]s from the [[USAAF]], occurred. The high-level bombers scored one hit on ''Littorio'' and several near misses around her and ''Vittorio Veneto'', but neither ship was seriously damaged. Another British strike with Beauforts arrived shortly thereafter, but Italian and German fighters had since arrived and they shot down two Beauforts and damaged five others. By the afternoon, Iachino had concluded that he would not reach the convoy before dark, and so he broke off the operation. On the return voyage, another British air attack succeeded in torpedoing ''Littoiro''.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November, ''Vittorio Veneto'' was moved to Naples from Taranto in response to the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of North Africa]].&lt;ref name=W175/&gt; While en route, the British submarine {{HMS|Umbra}} unsuccessfully attacked ''Vittorio Veneto''.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; An American air raid on the harbor on 4 December prompted the Italians to withdraw the fleet to La Spezia, where it remained for the rest of Italy's active participation in the war.&lt;ref name=W175&gt;Whitley, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June 1943, ''Vittorio Veneto'' was badly damaged by an American air raid on La Spezia; she was hit by two large bombs toward the bow, though only one detonated. That bomb passed through the ship and exploded under the hull, causing serious structural damage. The damage forced her to be transferred to Genoa for repair work, since the dockyard in La Spezia had also been damaged by the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September, Italy [[Armistice of Cassibile|signed an armistice]] with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, ''Vittorio Veneto'' and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be taken into internment for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using [[Dornier Do 217]]s armed with [[Fritz X]] radio-controlled bombs. ''Vittorio Veneto'' was undamaged but ''Littorio''&amp;mdash;by now renamed ''Italia''&amp;mdash;was hit and damaged and her sister {{ship|Italian battleship|Roma|1940|2}} was sunk in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 175&amp;ndash;176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vittorio Veneto'' remained in Malta until 14 September, when she and ''Italia'' were moved to [[Alexandria]], Egypt and then to the [[Great Bitter Lake]] in the [[Suez Canal]] on 17 October. The two battleships remained there until 6 October 1946, when they were permitted to return to Italy. ''Vittorio Veneto'' went to [[Augusta, Sicily]] before moving to La Spezia on 14 October. In the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]], signed on 10 February 1947, ''Vittorio Veneto'' was allocated as a [[war prize]] to Britain. She was paid off on 3 January 1948, stricken from the [[naval register]] on 1 February, and subsequently broken up for scrap.&lt;ref name=W175/&gt; ''Vittorio Veneto'' had been the most active Italian battleship of the war, having participated in eleven offensive operations.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve 90&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns taken from ''Vittorio Veneto'' were reused by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) as armament of its [[Žirje, Croatia|Žirje Island]] [[coastal artillery]] battery.&lt;ref name=HV297&gt;Čutura&lt;/ref&gt; The battery surrendered without resistance to the [[Croatian National Guard]] on 14 September 1991, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]],&lt;ref&gt;Reljanović&lt;/ref&gt; and played a pivotal role in 16&amp;ndash;22 September [[Battle of Šibenik]], helping defend the city of [[Šibenik]] against the JNA.&lt;ref name=HV297/&gt;
