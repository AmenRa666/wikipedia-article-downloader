'''George VI''' (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895&amp;nbsp;– 6 February 1952) was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Commonwealth]] from 11 December 1936 until his death. He was the last [[Emperor of India]] and the first [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

Known as Albert until his accession, George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]], and was named after his great-grandfather [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As the second son of King [[George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He attended naval college as a teenager, and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In 1920, he was made [[Duke of York]]. He married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923 and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. In the mid-1920s, he had [[speech therapy]] for a stammer, which he never fully overcame.

George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry the divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]] in order to marry, and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].

During George's reign the break-up of the [[British Empire]] and its transition into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] accelerated. The parliament of the [[Irish Free State]] [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed]] direct mention of the monarch from [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|the country's constitution]] on the day of his accession. The following year, a [[Constitution of Ireland|new Irish constitution]] changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of [[President of Ireland|President]]. From 1939, the Empire and Commonwealth&amp;nbsp;– except Ireland&amp;nbsp;– was at [[World War II|war]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. War with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. Though [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] rose as pre-eminent [[superpower|world powers]] and the British Empire declined. After the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, George remained king of both countries, but abandoned the title of ''Emperor of India'' in June 1948. Ireland [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formally declared itself a republic]] and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II.

==Early life==
[[File:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Four kings: Edward VII (far right), his son George, Prince of Wales, later George V (far left), and grandsons Edward, later Edward VIII (rear), and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908]]
George VI was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Prince George, [[Duke of York]] (later [[King George V]]), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]). His mother was the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), the eldest child and only daughter of [[Francis, Duke of Teck|the Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp. 322–323, 329&lt;/ref&gt;

His birthday (14 December 1895) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, [[Albert, Prince Consort]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 3; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been &quot;rather distressed&quot;. Two days later, he wrote again: &quot;I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name ''Albert'' to her&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 4–5; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: &quot;I am all impatience to see the ''new'' one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he was [[baptism|baptised]] &quot;Albert Frederick Arthur George&quot; at [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham|St. Mary Magdalene's Church]] near Sandringham three months later.{{efn|His godparents were: [[Queen Victoria]] (his great-grandmother, for whom his grandmother the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick William, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg|Grand Duke]] and [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge|Grand Duchess]] of Mecklenburg (his maternal great-aunt and great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke of Teck]] and his paternal aunt [[Maud of Wales|Princess Maud of Wales]] stood proxy); [[Empress Frederick]] (his paternal great-aunt, for whom his paternal aunt [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (his great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] (his great-uncle); the [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Duchess of Fife]] (his paternal aunt); and [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] (his maternal uncle).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday 18 February 1896, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}} Within the family, he was known informally as &quot;Bertie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 6; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Windsor, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name &quot;may supplant the less favoured one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]].

He often suffered from ill health and was described as &quot;easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a [[stutter|stammer]] that lasted for many years, and was forced to write with his right hand although he was naturally [[Left-handedness|left-handed]]. He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[genu valgum|knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=H. C. G.|last=Matthew|authorlink=Colin Matthew|title=George VI (1895–1952)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.

==Military career and education==
From 1909, Albert attended the [[Osborne House|Royal Naval College, Osborne]], as a naval [[cadet]]. In 1911, he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 41–45; Judd, pp. 21–24; Rhodes James, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; When his grandfather, Edward VII, died in 1910, Albert's father became King George V. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales, and Albert was second in line to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship {{HMS|Cumberland|1902|6}} in the [[West Indies]] and on the east coast of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He was rated as a [[midshipman]] aboard {{HMS|Collingwood|1908|6}} on 15 September 1913, and spent three months in the [[Mediterranean]]. His fellow officers gave him the nickname &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; One year after his commission, he began service in the First World War. He was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his action as a turret officer aboard ''Collingwood'' in the [[Battle of Jutland]] (31 May – 1 June 1916), an indecisive engagement with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Imperial German Navy|navy]] that was the largest naval action of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a [[peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcer]], for which he had an operation in November 1917.&lt;ref name=Bradford55&gt;Bradford, pp. 55–76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Albert in RAF uniform.png|thumb|upright|Prince Albert at an RAF dinner in 1919]]
In February 1918, he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]'s training establishment at [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]].&lt;ref name=Bradford72&gt;Bradford, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; With the establishment of the [[Royal Air Force]] two months later and the reassignment of Cranwell from [[Admiralty]] to [[Air Ministry]] responsibility, Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref name=Bradford72/&gt; He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] where he completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 45; Rhodes James, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert was greatly desirous of serving on the Continent while the war was still in progress and was very pleased to be posted to [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|General Trenchard's]] staff.  On 23 October he flew across the Channel to [[Autigny, Seine-Maritime|Autigny]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; For the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's [[Independent Air Force]] at its headquarters in [[Nancy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Boyle |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Boyle |title=Trenchard Man of Vision |year=1962 |publisher=Collins |location= St. James's Place London |page=360|chapter=Chapter 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  He accompanied the Belgian monarch [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] on his triumphal reentry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and gained a promotion to [[squadron leader]] on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heathcote |first=Tony |date=2012 |title=The British Field Marshals: 1736–1997: A Biographical Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KAkkUN7s4TIC&amp;pg=PT226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Casemate Publisher |page= |isbn=9781783461417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1919, Albert went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied history, economics and civics for a year,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 47; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 128–131&lt;/ref&gt; with the historian [[Reginald Vere Laurence|R. V. Laurence]] as his &quot;official mentor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 1920, he was created [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]] and [[Baron Killarney]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the &quot;Industrial Prince&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1942'', p. 280; Judd, p. 72; Townsend, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in the Men's Doubles with [[Louis Greig]] in 1926, losing in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in working conditions, and was President of the [[The Work Foundation|Industrial Welfare Society]]. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 77–86; Rhodes James, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{see also|Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon}}
In a time when royalty were expected to marry fellow royalty, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite [[Sheila Chisholm|Sheila, Lady Loughborough]], came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/457107/Sheila-The-Australian-Ingenue-Who-Bewitched-British-Society-review| last=Henderson| first=Gerard| title=Sheila: The Australian Ingenue Who Bewitched British Society – review| date=31 January 2014| newspaper=Daily Express| accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/28/sheila-who-captured-londons-heart| author=Australian Associated Press| title=A Sheila who captured London's heart| date=28 February 2014| publisher=Special Broadcasting Service| accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he met for the first time since childhood [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the youngest daughter of the [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl]] and [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. He became determined to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 94–96; Vickers, pp. 31, 44&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be &quot;made or marred&quot; by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 77; Judd, pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

They were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Albert's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Roberts |first=Andrew |editor=Antonia Fraser |title=The House of Windsor|publisher=Cassell &amp; Co. |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=0-304-35406-6 |pages=57–58|editorlink=Antonia Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed [[British Broadcasting Company]] wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] vetoed the idea (although the [[List of Deans of Westminster|Dean]], [[Herbert Edward Ryle]], was in favour).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Reith |first=John |authorlink=John Reith, 1st Baron Reith |title=Into the Wind |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |year=1949 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StateLibQld 1 110084 Duke and Duchess of York at Eagle Farm Racecourse, Brisbane, 1927.jpg|thumb|The Duke and Duchess (centre, reading programmes) at [[Eagle Farm Racecourse]], [[Brisbane]], 1927]]

From December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], travelling via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Aden]]. During the trip, they both went [[big game hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; After his closing speech at the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]] on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 93–97; Rhodes James, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; he began to see [[Lionel Logue]], an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 98; Rhodes James, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 294–295; Judd, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 106; Rhodes James, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark,&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Clark http://www.db4tennis.com/players/male/bertrand-clark
&lt;/ref&gt; which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (called &quot;Lilibet&quot; by the family), and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence, 145 [[Piccadilly]]. They were a close and loving family.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 111, 225, 231&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few stirs arose when the [[Canadian Prime Minister]], [[R. B. Bennett]], considered the Duke for [[Governor General of Canada]] in 1931—a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], [[J. H. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reluctant king==

{{Main article|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}
King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying, &quot;I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[Lying in state|lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]].

As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He wrote in his diary, &quot;When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the abdication, the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of the [[Irish Free State]], [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed all direct mention of the monarch]] from the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish constitution]]. The next day, it passed the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]], which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtier and journalist Dermot Morrah alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], in favour of their younger brother [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|a son]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 63; Judd, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
[[File:Darlington God save the king..JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three-storey Victorian building festooned with garlands with the words &quot;God Save the King&quot; mounted on the pitched roof|[[Darlington]] Town Hall decorated for the Coronation, 1937]]
Albert assumed the [[regnal name]] &quot;George VI&quot; to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 66; Judd, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Edward&quot; for the abdication broadcast,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 144; Sinclair, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title &quot;[[Duke of Windsor]]&quot; with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, but the [[letters patent]] creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was also forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]], as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI automatically.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new [[queen consort]], with the [[Order of the Garter]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George VI's coronation]] took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; There was no [[durbar (court)|Durbar]] held in [[Delhi]] for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the [[British Raj|government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Rising [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalism]] made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 269, 281&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement of Hitler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot; /&gt; While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as &quot;the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens|Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002), [http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 &quot;Mourning will be brief&quot;], ''The Guardian'', retrieved 1 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May and June 1939, the [[1939 royal tour of Canada|King and Queen toured Canada]] and the United States. From [[Ottawa]], they were accompanied throughout by Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html| last=Library and Archives Canada| authorlink=Library and Archives Canada| title=Biography and People &gt; A Real Companion and Friend &gt; Behind the Diary &gt; Politics, Themes, and Events from King's Life &gt; The Royal Tour of 1939| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to present themselves in North America as [[Monarchy of Canada|King and Queen of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Bousfield| first=Arthur| author2=Toffoli, Garry| title=Royal Spring: The Royal Tour of 1939 and the Queen Mother in Canada| publisher=Dundurn Press| year=1989| location=Toronto| pages=60, 66| url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Go5p_CN8UQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=| isbn=1-55002-065-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Lanctot| first=Gustave| authorlink=Gustave Lanctot| title=Royal Tour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Canada and the United States of America 1939| publisher=E.P.

Both Governor General of Canada [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]] and Mackenzie King hoped that the King's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which gave full sovereignty to the [[British Dominions]]. On 19 May, George VI personally accepted and approved the [[Letter of Credence]] of the new U.S. Ambassador to Canada, [[Daniel Calhoun Roper]]; gave [[Royal Assent]] to nine parliamentary bills; and ratified two international treaties with the [[Great Seal of Canada]]. The official royal tour historian, [[Gustave Lanctot]], wrote &quot;the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality&quot; and George gave a speech emphasising &quot;the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Galbraith| first=William| title=Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=12| issue=3| pages=7–9| publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association| location=Ottawa| year=1989| url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=820&amp;param=130| accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trip was intended to soften the strong [[isolationist]] tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 163–166; Rhodes James, pp. 154–168; Vickers, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; They visited the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and stayed with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the [[White House]] and at [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|his private estate]] at [[Hyde Park, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' Monday, 12 June 1939 p. 12 col. A&lt;/ref&gt; A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Swift |first=Will |title=The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 189; Rhodes James, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions, but not Ireland, declared war on [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 171–172; Townsend, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German [[The Blitz|bombing raids]]. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 183; Rhodes James, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The first night of the Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the [[East End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Arnold-Forster|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Arnold-Forster|year=1983|origyear=1973|title=The World at War|location=London|publisher=Thames Methuen|isbn=0-423-00680-0|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |title=The Second World War |publisher=Cassell and Co. Ltd |year=1949 |volume=II |page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defiance, the Queen famously declared: &quot;I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 184; Rhodes James, pp. 211–212; Townsend, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country. They were subject to [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing restrictions]], and [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Goodwin|first=Doris Kearns|authorlink=Doris Kearns Goodwin|title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1994|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1942, the King's brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], was killed on active service.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 187; Weir, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:King George VI with Sir Bernard Montgomery.jpg|thumb|left|George VI (left) with [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] (right), Holland, October 1944]]
In 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] replaced [[Neville Chamberlain]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], though personally George would have preferred to appoint [[Lord Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of [[Lord Beaverbrook]] to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed &quot;the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 202–210&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and [[Malta]] in June 1943, [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]] in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 176, 201–203, 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; At a social function in 1944, [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] Sir [[Alan Brooke]], revealed that every time he met [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] he thought he was after his job. The King replied: &quot;You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Reagan, Geoffrey|year=1992|title=Military Anecdotes|page=25|publisher=Guinness|isbn=0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, crowds shouted &quot;We want the King!&quot; in front of Buckingham Palace during the [[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1946, George addressed the United Nations at their first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed &quot;our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire to Commonwealth==
[[File:Attlee with GeorgeVI HU 59486.jpg|thumb|left|George VI (right) with British prime minister [[Clement Attlee]], July 1945]]

George VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] had already acknowledged the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s into separate [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], gathered pace after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; During the ministry of [[Clement Attlee]], [[British India]] became the two independent dominions of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 229–232, 247–265&lt;/ref&gt; George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]], and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, but he remained King of Pakistan until his death and India recognised his new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as [[Burma]] in January 1948, [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] (divided between [[Israel]] and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 267–270&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the King and his family toured Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister of the [[Union of South Africa]], [[Jan Smuts]], was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites,&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to his South African bodyguards as &quot;the [[Gestapo]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 294; Shawcross, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the tour, Smuts lost [[South African general election, 1948|the election the following year]], and the new government instituted a [[apartheid|strict policy of racial segregation]].

==Illness and death==
[[File:George VI Farthing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Profile portrait by [[Humphrey Paget]] on a 1951 [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]]]

The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King's health,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|title=King George VI|url=https://www.royal.uk/george-vi-r1936-1952|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 225; Townsend, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; exacerbated by his heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments, including [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[thromboangiitis obliterans]]. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right [[lumbar sympathectomy]] in March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 314–317&lt;/ref&gt; His elder daughter Elizabeth, the [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]], took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], taking the place of the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the [[Festival of Britain]] in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left [[pneumonectomy|lung was removed]] by [[Clement Price Thomas]] after a malignant tumour was found.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 454; Rhodes James, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the [[State Opening of Parliament]] in November, the King's [[speech from the throne]] was read for him by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|Lord Simonds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas broadcast]] of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, the King went to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]{{efn|Renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/our-history|title=About Heathrow Airport: Heathrow's history|publisher=LHR Airports|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via [[Kenya]]. On the morning of 6 February, George VI was found dead in bed at [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk. He had died from a [[coronary thrombosis]] in his sleep at the age of 56.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Elizabeth flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.

From 9 February for two days his coffin rested in [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]], before [[lying in state]] at [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] from 11 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Repose at Sandringham|work=Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=26 December 2011|date=18 February 1952|publisher=Time Inc|page=38|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral took place at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on the 15th.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St. George's on 26 March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/burial/burials-in-the-chapel-since-1805.html|title=Royal Burials in the Chapel since 1805|publisher=Dean &amp; Canons of Windsor|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], and the ashes of his younger daughter [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him.

In the words of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[George Hardie (Labour politician)|George Hardie]], the abdication crisis of 1936 did &quot;more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hardie in the British House of Commons, 11 December 1936, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed &quot;a rocking throne&quot;, and tried &quot;to make it steady again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from George VI to the Duke of Windsor, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Ashley (writer)|year=1998|title=British Monarchs|publisher=Robinson|location=London|isbn=1-84119-096-9|pages=703–704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George Cross]] and the [[George Medal]] were founded at the King's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 186; Rhodes James, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He bestowed the George Cross on the entire &quot;[[Siege of Malta (World War II)|island fortress of Malta]]&quot; in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously awarded the [[Ordre de la Libération]] by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill) to be awarded the medal after 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_doc/liste_compagnons.pdf|publisher=Ordre de la Libération|accessdate=19 September 2009|format=PDF|title=List of Companions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of geographical features, roads, and institutions named after George VI. These include [[King George Hospital, London|King George Hospital]] in London; [[King George VI Reservoir]] in Surrey, United Kingdom; [[British Columbia Highway 99A|King George VI Highway]] and [[King George Boulevard]] in [[Surrey, British Columbia]]; [[Kingsway (Edmonton)|Kingsway]] in [[Edmonton]]; [[George VI Sound]] in Antarctica; and the [[King George VI Chase]], a horse race in the United Kingdom.

[[Colin Firth]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance as George VI in ''[[The King's Speech]]'', a 2010 film that won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

George held a number of titles throughout his life, as successively great-grandson, grandson and son of the monarch. As sovereign, he was referred to most often as simply ''The King'' or ''His Majesty''. In his position as sovereign, George automatically held the position of [[Commander-in-Chief]].

=== Arms ===
As Duke of York, George bore the [[royal arms of the United Kingdom]] differenced with a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[argent]], the centre point bearing an anchor [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]—a difference earlier awarded to his father George V when he was Duke of York, and then later awarded to his grandson, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]. As king, he bore the royal arms undifferenced.&lt;ref&gt;Velde, François (19 April 2008), ''[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]'', Heraldica, retrieved 22 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
