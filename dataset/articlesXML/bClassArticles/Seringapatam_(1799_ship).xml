'''''Seringapatam''''' was built in 1799, of [[teak]], as a warship for [[Tippu Sultan]], the ruler of [[Mysore]]. However, the British stormed his citadel at [[Srirangapatna|Seringapatam]] that year and he was killed in the action. The vessel was sailed to England in the hopes that the Admiralty would buy it. The Admiralty did not, and British merchants bought her to use as a [[whaler]]. She made several voyages to the Southern Atlantic and the Pacific until 1813, when during the [[War of 1812]], a US [[sailing frigate|frigate]] captured her. She served briefly as a tender to the frigate before mutineers and British prisoners recaptured her and sailed to Australia. After her return to her owners, she continued to trade until 1850, sailing between London and the South Seas and Australia.

==Whaler==

Between 1800 and 1811 or so, ''Seringapatam'' sailed under a sequence of four [[letter of marque|letters of marque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1812privateers.org/Great%20Britain/marque1793-1815.pdf |title=Letters of marque against France 1793-1815 |work=1812privateers.org |year=2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was registered on ''[[Lloyd's Register]]'' in 1801 with sequence number S215, and her age was noted as two years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Register of Shipping'' (1801).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lloyd's List'' reported in January 1801 that she had been at Rio de Janeiro, having sailed in company with a several ships of the [[East India Company]]. She was one of the vessels in the convoy at the [[Action of 4 August 1800]], when {{HMS|Belliqueux|1780|6}} and the [[East Indiaman]] [[Exeter (1792 Indiaman)|''Exeter'']] captured the French frigates [[French frigate Concorde (1793)|''Concorde'']] and [[French frigate Médée (1778)|''Médée'']].&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', 16 January 1801[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1801/01-16-1801.jpg] - accessed 11 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1804, under Captain John Bird, ''Seringapatam'' visited the [[Kerguelen Islands]] as part of a flotilla of eight vessels on a sealing voyage from London.&lt;ref&gt;Headland (1989), p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she was owned by the merchant William Mellish.

Over the years, ''Seringapatam'' was reported to be well at the Galapagos Islands, off Peru, near Cape Horn, etc. In September 1810 she was off the coast of Peru with 420 barrels of whale oil.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'' 22 January 1811[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1811/01-22-1811.jpg] - accessed 11 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1812 ''Seringapatam'', still owned by William Melish and under the command of Captain William Stavers,&lt;ref&gt;''The register of shipping for 1813'', p.1812.&lt;/ref&gt; sailed for the South Atlantic. (Her crew included John Stavers as Mate and Francis Stavers as gunner.) She then sailed towards the Galapagos Islands via Cape Horn. At the time of her capture ''Seringapatam'' did not have a letter of marque in hand as she had left before the outbreak of war with the United States and as she did not expect to encounter any French vessels.{{#tag:ref|One authorizing her to take vessels belonging to the United States was issued in London on 12 December 1812, long after she had left England.&lt;ref&gt;Men of Marque - ''Seringaptam''.[http://www.1812privateers.org/1812IMAGES/170.jpg] Accessed 5 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} She carried 14 guns on her [[spar deck]]; she was pierced to carry guns on her gun deck, but did not carry any there. Although she did not have a letter of marque in hand, she nevertheless, on her way, captured the ''Edward'' of Nantucket, which was carrying 1200 barrels of oil, and sent her in to London as a prize.&lt;ref name=LitPan&gt;''Literary Panorama'' (1815), clmns. 801-4.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Edward'' was an American South Seaman, Woodward, master, and she arrived in [[the Downs]] on 14 June 1813.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', 18 June 1813.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/06-18-1813.jpg] - accessed 11 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture==

In early 1813 Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] entered the Pacific, via [[Cape Horn]], in the thirty-two gun [[frigate]] [[USS Essex (1799)|USS ''Essex'']]. Originally Porter was assigned to rendezvous with two other warships but both encountered British warships and Porter went around the Horn alone. The mission was to harass the British whaling industry off [[South America]] and around the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Around the Galapagos, Porter and his men captured numerous British vessels and recaptured an American ship from the Peruvians. One of the vessels he captured was the letter of marque ''Greenwich'', of 338 tons burthen, armed with 10 guns and having a crew of 25 men under the command of Captain Shuttleworth.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;Clayton (2014), p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; At Tumbes he fitted her up as a storeship, increased her armament to 20 guns, and put her under the command of Lieutenant [[John M. Gamble]], [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]. To assist Gamble, Porter gave him two seaman to act as mates, one of whom was a good navigator.&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;Congress of the United States (1860), Part 6, Vol. 2, pp.97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Greenwich'' captured ''Seringapatam'' off [[Tumbes, Peru]], on 13 July 1813, after an exchange of broadsides, but apparently no casualties on either side. ''Seringapatam'' was somewhat damaged so Porter sent over his gunners and carpenters to work on her and in a few days they had repaired her, and upgraded her armament to 22 guns. Porter placed Master{{'}}s Mate James Terry of ''Essex''on board ''Seringapatam'' as prize master, and she then cruised with Porter{{'}}s squadron.&lt;ref name=Congress/&gt;

{{main|Action off Charles Island}}

Captain Stavers, when asked to surrender his privateer's commission, revealed that though he had applied for a letter of marque, he had not yet received one, but that it was probably waiting for him in Lima. Captain Porter announced that Stavers would be taken to the United States and be tried as a pirate, and ordered him and his crew to be put in irons. They were given more freedom after some liberated American whalers told Porter that the British had treated them well during their time as prisoners aboard ''Seringapatam''.

''Lloyd's List'' reported that ''Essex'' had captured ''Seringapatam'', Stavers, master, ''New Zealander'', Donneman, master, and ''Charlton'', Halcrow, master. ''Porter'' then had put the captured crews aboard ''Charlton''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', 11 January 1814[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1814/01-11-1814.jpg] - accessed 11 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==USS ''Seringapatam''==
In September, Porter found the [[frigate]] [[USS Essex (1799)|''Essex'']] in need of repairs and provisions and set sail for the island of [[Nuka Hiva]], in the [[Marquesas]], nearly 3,000 miles away. He took with him four of his prizes, ''Greenwich'', ''Seringapatam'', ''Sir Andrew Hammond'', and ''[[Essex Junior]]''. When the repairs to the ''Essex'' were completed and provisions taken on board, he set sail for the coast of Chile, accompanied by ''Essex Junior''.

Prior to his departure on 12 December, Porter placed ''Seringapatam'', ''Sir Andrew Hammond'', and ''Greenwich'' under the guns of Fort Madisonville, which Porter had had erected. He further left a small force on the island under the command of Lieutenant Gamble. Many of the prisoners from the captured ships were Americans and they volunteered for service, as did some of the British captives. There were also six British prisoners of war. Soon after Porter sailed away, the local inhabitants became so troublesome that Gamble was forced to land a detachment of men to restore order.

In April 1814, despairing of Porter's return, Gamble began to rig ''Seringapatam'' and ''Sir Andrew Hammond'' with the intention of quitting the island. When signs of mutiny appeared, he had all the arms and ammunition put on board his own ship, ''Greenwich''.{{#tag:ref|By one, clearly erroneous report, ''Greenwich'' was back in London by December 1813.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;|group=Note}} Despite this precaution, the mutineers freed the prisoners of war and together captured ''Seringapatam'' on 7 May, wounding Gamble in the process. They then put him an open boat and sailed ''Seringapatam'' for Australia. Only one of ''Seringapatam{{'}}''s crew had been a member of her original crew; all the rest had been sent off in [[cartel (ship)|cartels]] ''Georgiana'' and ''Charlton''.&lt;ref name=Dunabin/&gt;

==Return to British control==
{{main|Nuku Hiva Campaign}}
The former prisoners of war and the mutineers sailed ''Seringapatam'' to [[New South Wales]], stopping in [[Tahiti|Otahite]] on the way.&lt;ref name=LitPan/&gt; When they arrived at [[Port Jackson]], ''Seringapatam{{'}}''s crew gave an embellished, self-serving account of their exploits.&lt;ref name=LitPan/&gt; It was only much later that a more mundane and less creditable account surfaced, less creditable in that eight of the 14 men had been turncoat British sailors.

[[Joseph Underwood (merchant)|Joseph Underwood]], a local merchant, acted as the crew's agent in claiming salvage from the Court of Vice-Admiralty at [[Sydney]], but the court referred the matter to London.&lt;ref name=Dunabin&gt;Dunabin, T. &quot;A Raider of 1813-14: Retaking of the Seringapatam&quot;, ''The Argus'' (Melbourne , Victoria), 10 July 1920, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October, at Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s request, Captain [[Eber Bunker]] sailed ''Seringapatam'' to England, where she was returned to her owner.

''Lloyd's List'' reported that 14 seamen from ''Greenwich'' and ''Sir Andrew Hammond'' had recaptured her in the [[Marquesas Islands]] and taken her into Port Jackson. From there she had sailed and after 17 weeks had arrived at [[Cowes]] on 11 February 1815 with cargo and passengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'' 14 February 1815[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1815/02-14-1815.jpg] - accessed 11 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
''Seringapatam'' continued to sail under various masters and for different owners at least until 1850, with F. Lowell, master, Crichton, owner, the last year she was listed in ''[[Lloyd's Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Register of Shipping'' (1849); Ship No. S336.&lt;/ref&gt; Her last voyage, per ''Lloyd's Register'' for 1850, was London-Sydney, with same master and owner.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Register of Shipping'' (1850); Ship No. S326.&lt;/ref&gt;
