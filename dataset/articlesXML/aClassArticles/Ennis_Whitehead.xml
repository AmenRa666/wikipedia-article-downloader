'''Ennis Clement Whitehead''' (3 September 1895 – 12 October 1964) was an early [[United States Army]] [[aviator]] and a [[United States Army Air Forces]] general during [[World War II]]. Whitehead joined the U. S. Army after the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917. He trained as an aviator and served in France, where he was posted to the 3d Aviation Instruction Center and became a qualified test pilot. After the war, Whitehead returned to school at the [[University of Kansas]]. After he graduated, he was commissioned as a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in 1920.

Over the following twenty years, Whitehead participated in [[Billy Mitchell (general)|Billy Mitchell]]'s aerial bombing demonstration and served as commander of the [[94th Fighter Squadron|94th]] and [[36th Fighter Squadron|36th Pursuit Squadrons]] among other assignments. After the U.S. entered World War II, Whitehead was promoted to brigadier general and sent to the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]]. In the course of the war, he earned a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and was named an honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] as he rose to command the [[Fifth Air Force]].

After the war, he commanded the [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Forces]], the [[Continental Air Command]], and the [[Aerospace Defense Command|Air Defense Command]]. He retired in 1951 after he was passed over for [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]]. Both his son, Ennis Whitehead, Jr., and his grandson, Ennis Whitehead III, became generals as well, rising to major general and brigadier general respectively.

==Early life==
Whitehead was born on a farm near [[Westphalia, Kansas]], on 3 September 1895, the eldest of three children of J. E. Whitehead, a farmer, and his wife Celia. He was educated at Glenwood District School and [[Burlington High School (Burlington, Kansas)|Burlington High School]]. In 1914, he entered the [[University of Kansas]], intending to obtain a law degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p178&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
His plans were changed by the United States' entry into [[World War I]] during April 1917. Whitehead enlisted on 16 August 1917 as a private in the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps|Aviation Section, Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]]. On 10 February 1918 he became an aviation cadet, training at a wartime Army School of Military Aeronautics at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and at an [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]] flight school at [[Chanute Air Force Base|Chanute Field]], [[Illinois]]. He qualified for a [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings|rating]] of &quot;Reserve Military Aviator&quot; on 19 October 1917 and was commissioned a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]], Signal Officer Reserve Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt;  He sailed for [[France]] on 14 November 1917. There, he was posted to the 3rd Aviation Instruction Center at [[Issoudun]] for more training. He attended gunnery school at [[Bordeaux]] and became a [[test pilot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p178&quot;/&gt; He spent the rest of the war as a test pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p179&quot;/&gt;

==Between the wars==
Whitehead was demobilized from the Army in January 1919, and returned to the University of Kansas, earning a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] degree in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, he took a job with ''[[The Wichita Eagle]]'' as a reporter in order to earn enough money for law school. In the end though, he decided that he preferred flying. He applied for a commission in the [[Regular Army]], and was re-commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Air Service, on 11 September 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt; On 25 September 1920, he married Mary Nicholson, whom he had known while at the University of Kansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children: a daughter, Margaret, born in 1921, who later became a lieutenant in the [[United States Air Force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 November 1946 |newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]] |p=36 |title=In Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.youseemore.com/piqua/contentpages.asp?loc=1970 |title=Obits - Hillard-Hollman |publisher=Piqua Public Library |accessdate=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Ennis C. Whitehead, Jr., who was born in 1926 and graduated from [[West Point]] in 1948.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=1524}}

[[Herbert Dargue]] on the left; Whitehead is second from the left.]]
Whitehead was initially stationed at [[March Joint Air Reserve Base|March Field]], where he served as a flying instructor. In 1921, he was transferred to [[Kelly Field Annex|Kelly Field]] where he assumed command of the [[94th Fighter Squadron|94th Pursuit Squadron]] of the [[1st Operations Group|1st Pursuit Group]]. On 20 July 1921, he participated in Brigadier General [[Billy Mitchell (general)|Billy Mitchell]]'s [[Billy Mitchell (general)#Project B: Anti-ship bombing demonstration|demonstration bombing attack]] of the ex-German [[dreadnought]] [[SMS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st Pursuit Group moved to [[Selfridge Air National Guard Base|Selfridge Field, Michigan]] in July 1922. In 1926, Whitehead attended the Air Service Engineering School at [[McCook Field]], graduating first in his class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith_p85&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|1998|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1926, Whitehead was assigned as the co-pilot for Major [[Herbert Dargue|Herbert A. Dargue]], leading the {{convert|22000|mi|km|adj=on}} Pan American Good Will Flight touring South America. During a landing at [[Buenos Aires]] in March 1927, their aircraft, a [[Loening OA-1|Loening OA-1A]] float plane nicknamed ''New York'', was involved in a mid-air collision with the ''Detroit'', another OA-1A, forcing both Dargue and Whitehead to bail out. Whitehead suffered only a sprained ankle, but the pilot and co-pilot of the ''Detroit'' were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining four planes of the flight completed the tour, for which all ten airmen including Whitehead received the first awards of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afm85&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | quote = | last = Frisbee| first = John L.| year = 1985| title = Valor: The Greatest Gift| journal = AIR FORCE Magazine | volume = 68| issue = September| pages =  | url =http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1985/September%201985/0985valor.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201094837/http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1985/September%201985/0985valor.aspx |archivedate=1 December 2012 |accessdate =25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years as an engineering officer with the Air Corps Materiel Division at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Field]], Ohio, he attended the [[Air Corps Tactical School]] at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley Field]] from September 1930 to June 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt; While there, he was promoted to [[Captain (United States uniformed services)|captain]]. Returning to the 1st Pursuit Group, he took command of the [[36th Fighter Squadron|36th Pursuit Squadron]]. He did staff duty tours at [[Albrook Field]], [[Panama Canal Zone]] with the [[16th Air Expeditionary Wing|16th Pursuit Group]], at [[Barksdale Air Force Base|Barksdale Field]] with the [[20th Fighter Wing|20th Pursuit Group]], and at the headquarters of the [[United States Army Air Corps#GHQ Air Force|General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force]] at Langley Field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p181&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[Major (United States)|major]] in April 1935 and attended the [[Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p181&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
On graduation from the Command and General Staff School, Whitehead was posted to the G-2 ([[Intelligence]]) Division of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 3 December 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p181&quot;/&gt; In February 1941, he was transferred to [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], a new training base,&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p182&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was promoted to [[colonel]] on 5 January 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fogerty|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1942, Lieutenant General [[George Brett (military)|George Brett]], the Allied Air Forces commander in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] (SWPA), lodged a request with [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Henry H. Arnold]], the Commanding General of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], for Whitehead to be sent out in the grade of brigadier general as a replacement for Brigadier General Harold Huston George,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been killed in an air crash near [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] on 29 April 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead was promoted on 16 June 1942 and ordered to the Southwest Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt; He flew there with [[Kenneth Walker]], a [[bomber]] expert, who had also recently been promoted to brigadier general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd_p90&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Byrd|1997|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving in [[Australia]] on 11 July 1942, Whitehead was shocked by the confusion and lack of organization he found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd_p90&quot;/&gt; The next day, he reported to [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] at GHQ SWPA in [[Melbourne]]; the two men would get along well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur later praised Whitehead for his &quot;masterful generalship&amp;nbsp;... brilliant judgement and inexhaustible energy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|1975|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the stocks of the air force in SWPA were low. At the recent [[Battle of Milne Bay]], a [[Japan]]ese invasion force had managed to sail past all but a few [[RAAF]] [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] and [[Lockheed Hudson]] aircraft, suffering only limited damage. Opinion at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was that &quot;the failure of the Air in this situation is deplorable; it will encourage the enemy to attempt further landings, with the assurance of impunity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1950|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to provide MacArthur with what he most needed—more and better aircraft and the crews to man them—Arnold decided to replace Brett with Major General [[George C. Kenney]]. Arnold hoped that Kenney and the two newly minted brigadier generals could make the best use of what was available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|1998|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major General George Kenney arrived in the theater on 28 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd_p93&quot;/&gt; Kenney knew Whitehead well, having served with him at Issoudun, the Air Corps Tactical School and GHQ Air Force,&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith_p85&quot;/&gt; and had also served with Walker at the Air Corps Tactical School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd_p93&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Byrd|1997|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I had known them both for over twenty years,&quot; Kenney later wrote. &quot;They had brains, leadership, loyalty, and liked to work. If Brett had had them about three months earlier his luck might have been a lot better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kenney|1949|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenney assumed command of the Allied Air Forces on 4 August. Three days later, he instituted a sweeping reorganization of the Allied Air Forces. The Australian components were assigned to [[RAAF Command]] under [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[William Bostock]], while the American components were consolidated into the reformed [[Fifth Air Force]] under Kenney's personal command. On paper, the organization followed the orthodox pattern, consisting of V Fighter Command under Brigadier General [[Paul Wurtsmith]], V Bomber Command under Walker, and an Air Services Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln. But Kenney realized that he would have to maintain his headquarters near MacArthur's GHQ, which moved to [[Brisbane]] on 20 July, while the fighting was thousands of miles away in [[New Guinea]], with the Fifth Air Force's principal forward bases around [[Port Moresby]]. Moreover, Walker's headquarters was in [[Townsville]], as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through Port Moresby. Accordingly, Kenney appointed Whitehead as deputy Fifth Air Force commander, and commander of the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) in Port Moresby.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1950|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OG0003Hewitt.jpg|thumb|left|Major General Whitehead, New Guinea, 1943]]
In his first months in New Guinea, Whitehead concentrated on building up the infrastructure there. He obtained additional engineer units and construction equipment. New airfields were developed, along with roads, housing, taxiways and [[revetment]]s to protect his aircraft from the frequent Japanese air raids. He also attempted to build up the morale and leadership of his units. These months coincided with the [[Kokoda Track campaign]]. For a time, despite the efforts of his airmen and the ground troops, the Japanese advanced steadily on Port Moresby, but they ultimately turned back short of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|pp=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in the Papuan campaign, Whitehead was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government made him an honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1572586/|title=Recommendation for Ennis Clement Whitehead to be awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Honorary)|accessdate=29 November 2014 |work=Recommendations: Second World War |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building up Allied air power required ingenuity, improvisation, and innovation. [[Skip bombing]] was a new tactic adopted by the Fifth Air Force that enabled its bombers to attack ships at low level. The parachute fragmentation (parafrag) bomb gave the light bombers increased accuracy for [[close air support]] missions. Although the [[B-25 Mitchell]] was originally designed to bomb from medium altitudes in level flight, Major [[Paul &quot;Pappy&quot; Gunn]] had additional guns installed in the nose of the aircraft to enable it to perform in a low-level strafing role. Whitehead consistently gave his full support to such innovations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein 1988 188–190&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|pp=188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] in March 1943, Whitehead was rewarded with an important victory over the Japanese. The battle caused the Japanese to abandon all further attempts to bring supplies and reinforcements in to [[Lae]] by the direct sea route from [[Rabaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead was promoted to major general on 15 March 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt;

Whitehead's attitude earned him high marks with the Allied land commanders. [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] Sir [[Iven Mackay]], commander of [[New Guinea Force]], reported on 4 February 1943 that &quot;I have found Brigadier General Whitehead of the USAAF extremely cooperative. In fact there is no question of asking for help—he takes the initiative.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gillison|1962|p=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Allied offensive gained steam, Whitehead's main task was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the [[P-38 Lightning]] arrived in the theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese [[A6M Zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1950|pp=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein 1988 188–190&quot;/&gt;

Whitehead assumed command of the Fifth Air Force in June 1944, although he remained subordinate to Kenney.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; In the [[Battle of Leyte]], MacArthur attempted to move forward beyond the range of land-based aircraft. A long battle of attrition then began on the ground and in the air, as the Fifth Air Force struggled to gain the upper hand with inadequate numbers of aircraft that could be based on [[Leyte]]. Gradually, Whitehead gained the upper hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 June 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt;

==Post-war==
Whitehead continued in command of the Fifth Air Force, participating in the [[occupation of Japan]]. He succeeded Kenney as commander of the [[Pacific Air Forces|Far East Air Forces]] in December 1945. He commanded it until March 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt; when he returned to the United States to command the [[Continental Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; Whitehead was instrumental in splitting this organization into the [[Tactical Air Command]] and [[Aerospace Defense Command|Air Defense Command]], commanding the latter from January 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;G_p206&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1988|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was seen by some in the Air Force hierarchy as &quot;too attached to Kenney and MacArthur, too political, too outspoken, and too tactically focused&quot; to be [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]]. Whitehead was dismayed by the appointment of [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] rather than Kenney as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]] in 1948 and lost his mentor when the new chief relieved Kenney as commander of [[Strategic Air Command]] in October 1948. Whitehead was also disappointed at not receiving a fourth star. These feelings, combined with ill health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ennis Whitehead | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/cc/white.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309191240/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/cc/white.html |archivedate=9 March 2013 | accessdate = 6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; caused him to retire on 31 July 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogerty&quot;/&gt;

In retirement, Whitehead testified before the [[United States Senate]]'s Preparedness Subcommittee on the State of the Nation's Air Defenses. He pleaded for the fastest possible creation of an air force with an atomic &quot;strike force&quot; ready to take off on retaliatory raids within a few hours of an attack on the United States, enough transports to service the strike force at overseas bases, fighters to escort the bombers on their missions, and at least 30 wings of all-weather jet fighters to intercept enemy bombers. He urged that, until this was achieved, the Army and Navy should be cut back to &quot;token&quot; appropriations. Whitehead pointed out that the United States mainland was defended against atomic attack by fewer than 100 all-weather fighters, which could not have destroyed more than 10 to 15 percent of a force attacking in daylight. At night, or during [[instrument meteorological conditions]], interceptors would have shot down less than 5 percent. He argued that a well-executed surprise atomic air attack would likely succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=TIME |date=5 May 1952 |title=Inexcusable Risk |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820751,00.html |accessdate= 21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
