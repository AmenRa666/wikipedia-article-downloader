'''Mahmud Pasha Angelović''' ({{lang-sr|Махмуд-паша Анђеловић/Mahmud-paša Anđelović}}; {{lang-tr|Veli Mahmud Paşa}}; 1420–1474) was the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|grand vizier]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1456 to 1466 and again from 1472 to 1474, who also wrote Persian and Turkish poems under the pseudonym '''''Adni''''' (the &quot;Eden-like&quot;).{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=311}}

Born in Kosovo, near Prishtina, he was a descendant of the Byzantine [[Angelos|Angelos family]] that had left Thessaly in 1394. As a child, he was abducted by the Ottomans according to the ''[[devşirme]]'' system and raised as a [[Muslim]] in [[Edirne]]. A capable soldier, he was married to a daughter of Sultan [[Mehmed II]]. After distinguishing himself at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding [[Zagan Pasha]]. Throughout his tenure, he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns.

==Origin and early life==

He was born in 1420, in the town of [[Novo Brdo]], in the [[Serbian Despotate]], at the time a vassal of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Kosovo]]). After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Thessaly in 1394, the ruling [[Angeloi]] [[Philanthropenoi]] family took refuge in Serbia. Mahmud Pasha and his brother [[Mihailo Anđelović]] were grandchildren of either [[Alexios Angelos Philanthropenos|Alexios]] or [[Manuel Angelos Philanthropenos|Manuel]]. He may have also been related to the noblemen [[Alessio Span|Alessio]] and [[Peter Spani (League of Lezhë)|Peter Spani]] through [[Alexios III Angelos]], who was possibly their ancestor.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=228}} Although the contemporary Byzantine sources and Ibn Kemal calls him Serbian, some late Ottoman sources erroneously call him Croatian.{{Cref2|a}}

He was abducted by the Ottomans as part of the ''[[devşirme]]'' practice, in 1427, during an invasion of Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel5960&quot;&gt;Finkel (2006), pp. 59–60, 48&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent together with two other boys to [[Edirne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Enes Duraković|author2=Fehim Nametak|author3=Đenana Buturović|title=Bošnjačka književnost u književnoj kritici|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqViAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Alef|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Laonikos Chalkokondyles]], he was captured by the horsemen of Sultan Murad II, while traveling with his mother from [[Novo Brdo]] to [[Smederevo]].{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=73–74}} He was raised a [[Muslim]] according to the practice.&lt;ref name=Finkel5960/&gt; His brother Michael stayed in Serbia, but he would also quickly rise up in the Ottoman bureaucracy. Their mother moved to Constantinople, while remaining a Christian, she was favored and awarded by land property by the Sultan.&lt;ref name=&quot;babinger&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Babinger|first=Franz|title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPxC6rO7vvsC&amp;&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=26 February 2013|year=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691010781|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Mahmud Pasha was a capable soldier. After distinguishing himself at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding [[Zagan Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his tenure he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel (2006), pp. 78–79, 559, 560&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1458, the Serbian Despot [[Lazar Branković]] died. Mahmud's brother Mihailo became member of a collective regency, but he was soon deposed by the anti-Ottoman and pro-Hungarian faction in the Serbian court. In reaction, Mahmud attacked and seized [[Smederevo Fortress]], although the citadel held out, and seized some additional strongholds in its vicinity. Threatened by a possible Hungarian intervention however he was forced to withdraw south and join the forces of Sultan Mehmed II at [[Skopje]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel60&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1461, he accompanied Mehmed in his campaign against the [[Empire of Trebizond]], the last surviving fragment of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Mahmud negotiated the surrender of the city of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] with the ''[[protovestiarios]]'', the scholar [[George Amiroutzes]], who was also his cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1463, Mahmud led the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina#War with the Bosnian Kingdom|invasion and conquest]] of the Ottoman vassal state of [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]], even though a peace treaty between Bosnia and the Ottomans had just been renewed. He captured the Bosnian king, [[Stephen Tomašević of Bosnia|Stephen Tomašević]], at [[Ključ, Una-Sana Canton|Ključ]], and obtained from him the cession of the country to the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkel60&quot;/&gt;

Angelović accompanied Mehmed II when he attacked [[Albania Veneta]] in the summer of 1467, and ravaged the lands. For 15 days he pursued [[Skanderbeg]], who was a Venetian ally at the time, but failed to find him, as Skanderbeg retreated into the mountains and then succeeded in fleeing to the coast.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=163, 164}} According to [[Tursun Beg]] and [[Ibn Kemal]], Angelović swam over [[Bojana (river)|Bojana]], attacked Venetian-controlled [[Shkodër|Scutari]], and plundered the surrounding area.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=164}}

Mahmud was dismissed in 1468 due to the machinations of his successor, [[Rum Mehmed Pasha]], ostensibly due to irregularities regarding the resettlement of the [[Karamanids]] in [[Constantinople]] following the conquest of Karaman earlier in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel (2006), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated in 1472, but his relations with the Sultan were now strained. He was dismissed and executed in 1474, allegedly because of Mehmed's son, prince Mustafa. Mahmud had been at loggerheads with Mustafa after divorcing his second wife for spending a night in the same house as Mustafa during Mahmud's absence on campaign in 1473. Mustafa's death later in 1474 was even attributed by later accounts to poisoning by Mahmud.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2006|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His married Selçuk Hatun, daughter of [[Zagan Pasha]], by his wife Sitti Nefise Hatun, and had a son named Ali Bey and a daughter named Hatice Hatun.

{{Cnote2|b|Based primarily on one source which says that he was captured as a child while going from Novo Brdo to Smederevo, most modern historians accept the Serbian city of Novo Brdo as his place of origin. The contemporary ''[[Ecthesis Chronica]]'' and ''[[Historia Patriarchia]]'' says he was from Serbia, while Ibn Kemal is the only Ottoman source that explicitly say that he was &quot;from the mines of Serbia&quot; ([[Novo Brdo]]).{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=73–74}} Some Ottoman authors give other information: The 16th-century biographer Aşık Çelebi says that Mahmud was from [[Kruševac]]. Some Ottoman historians like Ata, Sureyya and Osmanzade Taib, claim he was Croat (Hrovati) in origin; a claim reinforced by a letter written by Mahmud Pasha to [[Republic of Ragusa]] in 1467, where he signed himself as 'Abogović Hrvat' (''Abogović the Croat''). As Stavrides concludes, three points make the latter assumption implausible: It is contradicted by all Byzantine sources; it would imply he was born Catholic - strange given his relations to Byzantine Orthodox Christians; and his geographical origin in Serbia - both of his possible birthplaces were in the Serbian/Orthodox world, far from Catholic influence. There was some considerable confusion over the terms &quot;Croat&quot; and &quot;Serb&quot; in these times, which suggest that &quot;Croat&quot; in this case would mean someone from the wider South Slavic area.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=73–74}} It is concluded that Mahmud Pasha was of Serbian origin, descending from the Byzantine (or Byzantine-Serbian&lt;ref name=&quot;RuizPiterberg2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Teofilo F. Ruiz|author2=Gabriel Piterberg|author3=Geoffrey Symcox|title=Braudel Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuiOWqJ7u8YC&amp;pg=PA93|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-4133-4|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Angelos family.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|pp=73–74}} }}
