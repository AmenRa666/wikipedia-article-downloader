The '''Ordnance BLC 15 pounder gun''' (BLC stood for BL Converted) was a modernised version of the obsolete [[Ordnance BL 15 pounder|BL 15 pounder 7 cwt gun]], incorporating a recoil and [[British ordnance terms#Recuperator|recuperator]] mechanism above the barrel and modified quicker-opening breech. It was developed to provide [[Territorial Force]] artillery brigades with a reasonably modern field gun without incurring the expense of equipping them with the newer [[Ordnance QF 18 pounder|18 pounder]]. It is the gun which writers usually mean by &quot;15 pounder gun&quot; in [[World War I]], but can be confused with the earlier [[Ordnance QF 15 pounder|Ordnance QF 15 pounder ''Ehrhardt'']] or [[Ordnance BL 15 pounder]] which both fired the same shell.

==Design==
[[File:BLC 15 pounder gun Mark I, II, IV barrel diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Mks I, II &amp; IV barrel design]]
[[File:BLC 15 pounder Mark II, II*, IV breech mechanism diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Mk II &amp; IV single-motion breech mechanism]]
Many modifications were made to the old [[Ordnance BL 15 pounder |BL 15 pounder]] barrels to adapt them to a new carriage with a [[recoil buffer]] and [[List of British ordnance terms#Recuperator|recuperator]] above the barrel similar to the modern [[Ordnance QF 13 pounder|13 pounder]] design. Previously the barrels had been mounted directly on the carriage by [[trunnion]]s. Now the barrel was suspended from a forged-steel inverted U-shaped cradle which had trunnions to attach it to the carriage. The trunnions, sight brackets and elevating gear attachment lugs were removed from the barrel. The radial T-vent hole on top was plugged, holes in the jacket passing through the trunnion centres were sealed with screwed steel plugs, and the holes in the hood for fitting tangent sights were plugged with white metal alloy.

The 3-motion breech was replaced by a single-motion [[interrupted screw]] breech which had an axial T vent running through it into the chamber, designed to take a T friction tube.

The new firing mechanism involved a new [[:Image:TFrictionPushTubeMkIBLC15pounder.jpg|&quot;push&quot; type T friction tube]] which was inserted into the [[Tubes and primers for ammunition|axial breech vent]]. The crosspiece of the T was positioned pointing upwards. A long layer's guard was added to the left side of the cradle projecting behind the breech. A spring-loaded firing handle was built into the layer's guard. When cocked by pulling back and then released, it sprang forward and struck a firing lever on the breech, which translated the forward motion to a downward motion and propelled a firing plunger into the T of the friction tube which in turn ignited the [[cordite]] propellant charge.

In 1915, Territorial batteries guarding the east coast of England adapted their 15 pounders for use against [[Zeppelin]]s, by simply digging a pit to accommodate the trail of the gun, to allow it to be trained upwards. It is unlikely that this arrangement was ever used operationally.&lt;ref&gt;J D Sainsbury, The hertfordshire Batteries of the Royal Field Artillery, Hart Books, Welwyn, 1996 ISBN 978-0-948527-04-3 (p.43)&lt;/ref&gt; In a more sophisticated adaptation, two 15 pounders were modified for [[Anti aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] use by increasing allowed elevation to more than 60°.&lt;ref name=&quot;samha-ec-49&quot;/&gt; These guns were installed at Ford Wynyard in [[Cape Town]].

==Combat service==
[[File:BLC15pounderCamelBatteryHatum5Jan1918.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Camel Battery of BLC 15 pounders after capture of Hatum, 5 January 1918&lt;/center&gt;]]
The weapon was used by British [[Territorial Force]] and [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]], and Canadian, infantry divisions in all theatres of [[World War I]] until replaced by the 18 pounder from 1916 onwards.

10th Battery of the [[Royal Canadian Artillery|Royal Canadian Field Artillery]] (RCFA), equipped with 4 guns, fought a notable action in the evening of 22 April 1915 north of [[Battle of St Julien|St Julien]] to hold the left of the British line where the German infantry was breaking through following their gas attack on the first day of the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].&lt;ref&gt;Farndale 1986, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; Hence when skillfully utilised in the role it was intended for - against troops in the open - the gun was still effective despite being obsolete. Where infantry avoided being caught in the open the guns were of limited use due to their light shell.

After they became redundant, from late 1916 some were retained in fixed positions on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as [[anti-tank gun]]s, freeing up modern guns for their usual duties.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 2004, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Number 1 15 Pounder Camel Battery [[Royal Garrison Artillery|RGA]] (today's 21 (Air Assault) Battery) served with 6 guns with the [[Indian Expeditionary Force]] in the [[Aden Protectorate|Aden]] hinterland from 1915–1918 during the [[South Arabia during World War I|South Arabia campaign]], to defend the important port at Aden against any Turkish advance. In July 1915 actions were fought in initially losing and then regaining the British advanced post at Sheik Othman controlling the water supply to Aden.&lt;ref&gt;Farndale 1988, Page 357&lt;/ref&gt; Sgt Curtis was awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for saving his gun in these actions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/47regtra/battery/the_batterys/21_air_assault_bat/21_battery_history.htm 21 (Air Assault) Battery - History]&lt;/ref&gt; (presumably the first, in which 2 guns were lost). The Camel Battery was present when the British captured [[Hatum]] in January 1918.

The gun was the standard field artillery for the early South African Union Defence Force and saw action with the [[Cape Field Artillery]] at the [[Battle of Kakamas]] and Battle of Upington during the [[South-West Africa Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;samha-ec-49&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Newsletter No 49|date=October 2008|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/8/p08octne.html|publisher=SOUTH AFRICAN MILITARY HISTORY SOCIETY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
