The '''North American XF-108 Rapier''' was a proposed long-range, high-speed [[interceptor aircraft]] designed by [[North American Aviation]] intended to defend the United States &lt;!---and Canada----sorry, Buttler is referring to a later &quot;selling job&quot; that was never the intention of the original project-&lt;ref&gt;Buttler 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; from supersonic [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[strategic bomber]]s. The aircraft would have cruised at speeds around {{convert|3|Mach|90,000}} with an unrefueled [[combat radius]] over {{convert|1000|nmi}}, and was equipped with radar and missiles offering engagement ranges up to {{convert|100|miles}} against bomber-sized targets.

To limit development costs, the program shared engine development with the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]] [[strategic bomber]] program, and used a number of elements of earlier interceptor projects. The program had progressed only as far as the construction of a single wooden mockup when it was cancelled in 1959, due to a shortage of funds and the Soviets' adoption of [[ballistic missile]]s as their primary means of nuclear attack. Had it flown, the F-108 would have been the heaviest fighter of its era.

Prior to the project cancellation, the [[President of the United States]] Gen. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] noted that raising the F-108 interceptor force would have cost the U.S. taxpayer $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/missilesrockets6196unse#page/n177/mode/2up Juggling funds], ''Missiles and Rockets'', January 25, 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Development==
During the early 1950s, the USAF proposed a very high-performance, long-range interceptor. On 20&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1955, formal development of what became known as the Long-Range Interceptor, Experimental (LRI-X) was approved, planned as a [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102 Delta Dagger]]/[[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106 Delta Dart]] replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 199&quot;/&gt; The specification was laid down on 6&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1955, calling for an interceptor that could fly at {{convert|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} at a speed of [[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;1.7 ({{convert|1122|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|1000|mi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 199&quot;&gt;Jenkins and Landis 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;199.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to have a two-man crew and at least two engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 199&quot;/&gt; A further consideration was that an integrated [[fire-control system]] would be fitted, allowing the interception of a bomber at {{convert|60|nmi|km|abbr=on}} and three targets to be destroyed during a single mission.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Landis 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the eight interested companies, contracts for preliminary studies were issued to [[North American Aviation]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] on 11&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1955, five days after the specification's release.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 199&quot;/&gt; Of the paper designs, the North American proposal, dubbed &quot;NA-236&quot;, seemed the most promising. The NA-236 shared some similarities with the XF-108, although the most obvious differences were the additions of two finlets at the midspan of the horizontal stabilizers, and canards.&lt;ref&gt;Buttler 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; Political and budgetary difficulties led to the cancellation of the program on 9&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1956.

After considerable confusion, the program was reinstated on 11&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1957 with North American awarded a contract for two prototypes. The designation F-108 was issued, also known as &quot;Weapon System 202A&quot; (WS-202A). North American's company designation was &quot;NA-257&quot;, although it was basically identical to the NA-236. At the time, [[Air Defense Command]] anticipated an order for 480 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 200&quot;&gt;Jenkins and Landis 2008, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting design went through considerable evolution, owing to both its cutting-edge technology and continual redefinition of the USAF requirements. Early revisions prominently featured canards, with a span of 19&amp;nbsp;ft 10&amp;nbsp;in (6.04 m), and a wing of 53.5° sweep.&lt;ref name=Buttler_p106/&gt; The aircraft in this configuration would have had a maximum takeoff weight of 99,400&amp;nbsp;lb (45,088&amp;nbsp;kg) with a 72,550 feet (22,113 m) operational ceiling.&lt;ref name=Buttler_p106/&gt; In addition to the F-108's interceptor role, North American proposed it as an [[escort fighter]] for its own [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|B-70 Valkyrie]] supersonic bomber prototype.&lt;ref name=XF-108_fact_sheet/&gt; Commonality between the B-70 bomber and the F-108 included the escape capsule and [[General Electric YJ93]] engines. Another role considered was for the F-108 to be &quot;gap-fillers&quot; for the [[Distant Early Warning Line|Distant Early Warning]] (DEW) system; because of its great speed, the F-108 could have scanned up to {{Convert|278,000|sqmi|km2}} per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 202&quot;&gt;Jenkins and Landis 2008, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

From September&amp;nbsp;1958, substantial engineering and design changes were implemented; however, SAC had lost interest in the escort fighter concept. To accompany the B-70 all the way to its target and back, the F-108 in its initial concept would have, at best, marginal range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler p. 107&quot;&gt;Buttler 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1958, YF-108A preproduction aircraft on order were reduced from 31 to 20 test aircraft and the first test flight was delayed from February to April&amp;nbsp;1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler p. 108&quot;/&gt; The eventual design, which was built as a full-sized XF-108 [[mockup]], was displayed to Air Force officials on 17–20&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler p. 107&quot;/&gt; The project was given the name &quot;Rapier&quot; on 15 May 1959, following a contest by the Air Defense Command asking airmen for suggestions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler p. 108&quot;&gt;Buttler 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
Even as the XF-108 program was progressing well, there were signs that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation. [[bomber gap|Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats]], the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 202&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lyons, Major Robert P. Jr. |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA166724|title=The Search for an Advanced Fighter, A History from the XF-108 to the Advanced Tactical Fighter|work=[[Defense Technical Information Center]]|format=PDF|date=3 April 1986|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation was announced on 23&amp;nbsp;September 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 202&quot;/&gt; North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived.&lt;ref&gt;Pace 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the [[North American A-5 Vigilante]] supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante could be seen as the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hughes Aircraft]] would continue the development of the advanced fire control system and the GAR-9 missile.{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;The Pentagon did, however, continue development of the ASG-18 fire-control system and GAR-9 missile.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 202&quot;/&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;}} Development of the F-108 radar and missiles was continued by the USAF and the system was eventually used in the [[Lockheed YF-12]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=O'Connor, Sean|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-47.html|title=AIM-47: Hughes GAR-9/AIM-47 Falcon|work=Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles|year=2004|accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final configuration for the rear cockpit in the YF-12A looked similar to that of the F-108 since it incorporated the same displays and controls required for the Hughes ASG-18 fire control system.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Landis 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The initial F-108 configuration featured a very large &quot;cranked&quot; [[delta wing]]. There were fixed ventral stabilizers on the wings, mounted at mid-span, and a tall all-moving vertical tailfin, supplemented by two ventral stabilizers that extended when the [[landing gear]] retracted. Although some earlier versions of the design had separate tailplanes or forward [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]], both were abandoned in the final design.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Landis 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; The large fuselage and wing had two and five fuel tanks, respectively, giving an estimated combat radius of some {{convert|1100|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name=Buttler_p106&gt;Buttler 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Top speed was estimated at {{convert|1980|mph|km/h}}, about Mach&amp;nbsp;3, at {{convert|81800|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 200&quot;/&gt; The aircraft was powered by two [[General Electric J93]] [[turbojet]] engines, also used in North American's XB-70 Valkyrie bomber, in the fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=876|title=General Electric YJ93-G-3 Turbojet|work=National Museum of the United States Air Force|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-108 was intended to carry the [[Hughes AN/ASG-18]] radar, the U.S.'s first [[pulse-Doppler radar]] set.&lt;ref&gt;Pace 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to have [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability, but could track only one target at a time. The radar was paired with an [[infra-red search and tracking]] (IRST) system on the wing leading edges. The radar was used to guide the [[AIM-47 Falcon|Hughes GAR-9]] (later redesignated AIM-47) [[air-to-air missile]], three of which would be carried on a rotary launcher in an internal weapons bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;J&amp;L p. 202&quot;/&gt; The GAR-9 was a very large, long-range weapon with its own radar set for terminal homing. It was intended to fly at Mach&amp;nbsp;6, with a range of almost {{convert|112|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.testpilot.ru/usa/hughes/aim/47/gar9_e.htm|title=AIM-47 (GAR-9) Falcon|work=Testpilot.ru|date=29 November 2007|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==XQ-11 target drone==
As part of WS-202A, a design for a high-speed (Mach 3+) [[target drone|aerial target]] for use in testing the F-108's weapons system was proposed. The [[Wright Air Development Center]] requested the designation '''XQ-11''' for the target design; the request was denied due to the early stage of development, and the F-108 program was cancelled before further work was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app1/q-11.html|title=Q-11|last=Parsch|first=Andreas|year=2009|work=Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles Appendix 1: Early Missiles and Drones|publisher=Designation-Systems|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
