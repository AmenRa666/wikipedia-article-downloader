He associated with the [[Rockingham Whigs]] and rose to hold the post of [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]] for a brief period. He was noteworthy for his support for the colonists during the [[American Revolutionary War]], his support for a policy of concession in [[Ireland]] and his advanced views on the issue of parliamentary reform.

==Biography==
The son of [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]] and Sarah Lennox, daughter of [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan]], and brother of the famous [[Lennox sisters]], he was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Leiden University]] and succeeded his father as [[Duke of Richmond]] in August 1750.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16451?docPos=3 |title=Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[Coldstream Guards|2nd Foot Guards]] in March 1752,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=9147|date=7 March 1752|startpage=3|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers|20th Regiment of Foot]] on 18 June 1753&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=9279|date=23 June 1753|startpage=2|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was admitted a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 11 December 1755.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf|title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows|publisher=Royal Society|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richmond became [[lieutenant-colonel]] of the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment of Foot]] on 7 June 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=9590|date=8 June 1756|startpage=2|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second battalion (2nd/33rd) of this regiment was raised and in 1757, and the following year it became an independent regiment, the [[72nd Regiment, Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders|72nd Foot]]; Richmond was appointed its lieutenant colonel, while his younger brother [[Lord George Lennox|George]] took command of the 33rd Regiment (1st/33rd).&lt;ref name=heath199&gt;Heathcote, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1758 he became colonel of the 72nd Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=9789|date=6 May 1758|startpage=2|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richmond took part in the [[Raid on Cherbourg]] in August 1758 and served as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Prince Frederick of Brunswick]] at the [[Battle of Minden]] in August 1759.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Promoted to [[major-general]] on 9 March 1761, he saw the 72nd Regiment disbanded in 1763 at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Brereton &amp; Savoury, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Sussex]] on 18 October 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=10357|date=15 October 1763|startpage=1|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richmond was appointed British ambassador extraordinary in [[Paris]] and made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] in 1765, and in the following year he briefly served as [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]] in the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham Whig]] administration, resigning office on the accession of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt the Elder]] in July 1766.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] on 30 April 1770&lt;ref name=heath200&gt;Heathcote, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; and was briefly leader of the parliamentary [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in opposition in 1771 when Rockingham's wife was ill.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In the debates on the policy that led to the [[American Revolutionary War]] Richmond was a firm supporter of the colonists, and he initiated the debate in 1778 calling for the removal of British troops from America, during which Chatham was seized by his fatal illness.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He also advocated a policy of concession in [[Ireland]], with reference to which he originated the phrase &quot;a union of hearts&quot; which long afterwards became famous when his use of it had been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/PRrichmond.htm |title=Duke of Richmond|publisher= Spartacus Educational|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1779 Richmond brought forward a motion for retrenchment of the civil list, and in 1780 he embodied in a bill his proposals for parliamentary reform, which included manhood suffrage, annual parliaments and equal electoral areas.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Richmond joined the [[Second Rockingham Ministry]] as [[Master-General of the Ordnance]] in March 1782: he was appointed a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] on 17 April 1782&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=12288|date=16 January 1782|startpage=1|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to full [[general]] on 20 November 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=12391|date=23 September 1782|startpage=1|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as Master-General when the [[Fox–North Coalition]] came to power in April 1783.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In January 1784 he joined the [[First Pitt the Younger Ministry]] as Master-General of the Ordnance; in this role he reformed the Department, introducing salaries for office holders, starting a survey of the South Coast (which led to the formation of the [[Ordnance Survey]]) and introducing new artillery (leading to the formation of the [[Royal Horse Artillery]]).&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He now developed strongly [[Tory]] opinions, and his alleged desertion of the cause of reform led to accusations of [[apostasy]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In November 1795, when [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]] and [[John Horne Tooke]] where charged with [[treason]] and cited his publications on reform in their defence, Richmond became a liability to the Government and was dismissed in February 1795.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He became colonel of the [[Royal Horse Guards]] on 18 July 1795&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=13796|date=14 July 1795|startpage=741|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 30 July 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=13918|date=2 August 1796|startpage=743|supp=|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement Richmond built the famous racecourse at the family seat of [[Goodwood House|Goodwood]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He was also a patron of artists such as [[George Stubbs]], [[Pompeo Batoni]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwood.co.uk/goodwood-house/the-collection/painting-collection.aspx|title= Goodwood House painting collection|publisher=Goodwood|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richmond died at Goodwood on 29 December 1806 and was buried in [[Chichester Cathedral]]; he had married Lady Mary Bruce, daughter of the [[Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury|Earl of Ailesbury]], on 1 April 1757 but left no legitimate children, so was succeeded in the peerage by his nephew [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond|Charles]].&lt;ref name=heath200/&gt;  He did have three illegitimate children by his housekeeper.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
