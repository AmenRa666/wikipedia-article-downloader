'''HMCS ''Nipigon''''' was a {{sclass-|Bangor|minesweeper||ship}} that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. She saw action in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] and the [[Battle of the St. Lawrence]]. She was named for [[Nipigon]], [[Ontario]]. After the war she was sold to Turkey and renamed ''Bafra''. She served as such from 1957 until 1972.

==Design and description==
A British design, the ''Bangor''-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding {{sclass-|Halcyon|minesweeper|1}}s in British service, but larger than the {{sclass-|Fundy|minesweeper|4}} in Canadian service.&lt;ref name=chesneau&gt;Chesneau, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mac167&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a [[diesel engine]]s and those with [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam]] engines.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt; ''Nipigon'' was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. ''Nipigon'' was {{convert|180|ft|m|1}} [[Length overall|long overall]], had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|9|ft|9|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;&lt;ref name=mac167/&gt; The minesweeper had a [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] of {{convert|672|LT|t}}. She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted.&lt;ref name=mac167/&gt;

''Nipigon'' had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two [[Admiralty three-drum boiler]]s. The engines produced a total of {{convert|2400|ihp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|16.5|kn|lk=in}}. The minesweeper could carry a maximum of {{convert|150|LT|t|0}} of [[fuel oil]].&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;

''Nipigon'' was armed with a single [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] (QF) [[QF 4 inch naval gun Mk IV, XII, XXII|{{convert|4|in|mm|0|adj=on}}/40 caliber Mk IV gun]] mounted forward.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweeper was equipped with one [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mark VIII]] and two single-mounted [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|QF 20 mm Oerlikon]] guns.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;&lt;ref name=mac167/&gt; As a convoy escort, ''Chedabucto'' was deployed with 40 [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;

==Service history==
''Nipigon'' was ordered as part of the 1939-1940 building programme. The minesweeper's [[keel]] was laid down on 4 July 1940 by [[Dufferin Shipbuilding Company|Dufferin Shipbuilding Co.]] at [[Toronto]] and the ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 1 October later that year. She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Royal Canadian Navy on 11 August 1941 at Toronto with the [[pennant number]] J154.&lt;ref name=m173&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

After commissioning, ''Nipigon'' was assigned to Sydney Force beginning in October 1941. She remained with this unit until 17 January 1942. She then spent periods of service with the [[Western Local Escort Force]] (WLEF), Halifax Force and Newfoundland Force. In June 1943, when WLEF divided its escorts into groups, the ship was assigned to EG W-1 as a convoy escort.&lt;ref name=m173/&gt;

In early 1944, ''Nipigon'' underwent a refit, beginning at [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]] and completed at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]]. After completing workups, she was assigned to Halifax Force again until it was disbanded in 1945. She then performed various duties along the Atlantic coast until paid off at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] on 13 October 1945.&lt;ref name=m173/&gt; She was laid up at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]].

Following the war, ''Nipigon'' was placed in strategic reserve at [[Sorel, Quebec]] in 1946. She was reacquired by the Royal Canadian Navy in 1952 and refitted in preparation for active duty. The minesweeper was given the new pennant number 188, however she was never recommissioned.&lt;ref name=m173/&gt; In 1953, ''Nipigon'' was re-rated as a coastal escort.&lt;ref name=gardiner&gt;Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; She was sold to the [[Turkish Naval Forces]] on 29 November 1957 and renamed ''Bafra''.&lt;ref name=m173/&gt; The vessel sailed to Turkey on 19 May 1958.&lt;ref name=gardiner/&gt; She served until 1972 when her registry was deleted.&lt;ref name=C1&gt;Colledge, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in Turkey in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=6112164|shipname=Nipigon|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
