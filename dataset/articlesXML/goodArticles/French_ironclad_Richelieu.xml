The '''French ironclad ''Richelieu''''' was a wooden-hulled [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclad]] built for the [[French Navy]] in the early 1870s. She was named after the 17th century statesman [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal de Richelieu]]. The ship was the [[flagship]] of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] for most of her career. ''Richelieu'' caught on fire in Toulon in 1880 and was [[scuttling|scuttled]] to prevent her [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s from exploding. She was [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] and, after being repaired, resumed her role as flagship. In 1886, however, the ship was placed in [[Wikt:mothball|reserve]] and was eventually condemned in 1901. While being towed to the [[ship breaking|ship breakers]] in [[Amsterdam]] in 1911, ''Richelieu'' was caught in a storm in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and had to be cast loose from her tugboat. Nevertheless, the ship survived the storm and was recovered near the [[Scilly Isles]] from where she was towed to her final destination.

==Design and description==
''Richelieu'' was designed by [[Henri Dupuy de Lôme]] as an improved version of the {{sclass-|Océan|ironclad}}s. As a central battery ironclad she had her armament concentrated amidships. Like most ironclads of her era she was equipped with a plough-shaped [[Naval ram|ram]] that projected {{convert|10|ft|m|1}} from her hull.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Gardiner, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew numbered around 750 officers and men. The [[metacentric height]] of the ship was very low, a little above {{convert|1.5|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

The ship measured {{convert|101.7|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length overall|overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.4|m|ftin|sp=us}}. ''Richelieu'' had a maximum [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.5|m|ftin|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=s2&gt;Silverstone, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; and displaced {{convert|8984|t|LT|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

===Propulsion===
''Richelieu'' was given two propellers by [[Henri Dupuy de Lôme]] to make her more maneuverable for [[ramming]]. She had two Indret 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engines]], each driving a single [[propeller]]. Her engines were powered by eight oval [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; On [[sea trial]]s the engines produced {{convert|4600|ihp|lk=in}} and ''Richelieu'' reached {{convert|13.2|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=d28&gt;de Balincourt and Vincent-Bréchignac, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; She carried {{convert|640|MT|LT}} of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately {{convert|3300|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; ''Richelieu'' was initially [[square rig]]ged with three masts, then cut down to a [[schooner rig]].&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;

===Armament===
''Richelieu''{{'}}s intermediate armament of four {{convert|240|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns was mounted in [[barbette]]s on the upper deck, one gun at each corner of the [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]], with her six {{convert|274|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us|1}} guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. One 240-millimeter gun was mounted in the forecastle as a [[chase gun]]. The ship's secondary armament consisted of ten {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. These were later replaced by six {{convert|138|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;

The 18-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] 274-millimeter Modéle 1870 gun fired an [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]], {{convert|476.2|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} shell while the gun itself weighed {{convert|22.84|LT|t}}. The gun fired its shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1424|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|14.3|in}} of [[wrought iron]] armour at the muzzle. The armor-piercing shell of the 19-caliber 240-millmeter Modele 1870 gun weighed {{convert|317.5|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|15.41|LT|t}}. It had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1624|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|14.4|in|mm|0}} of [[wrought iron]] armor at the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. The 138-millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed {{convert|2.63|LT|t}}. It fired a {{convert|61.7|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} [[Shell (projectile)|explosive shell]] that had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1529|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The guns could fire both [[Round shot|solid shot]] and explosive shells.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point the ship received eight, and then later ten more, {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]].&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|500|g|lb|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|610|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a range of about {{convert|3200|m|yd|sp=us}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46&quot; (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=22 December 2009|publisher=Navweps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft. However, the guns mounted in the barbettes [[sponson]]ed out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft. Late in the ship's career four above-water {{convert|356|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s were added.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

===Armor===
''Richelieu'' had a complete {{convert|220|mm|in|sp=us|1|adj=on}} [[wrought iron]] waterline [[Belt armor|belt]]. The sides and the transverse bulkheads of the battery itself were armored with {{convert|160|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wrought iron. The barbettes were unarmored, but the [[deck (ship)|deck]] was protected by {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} of armor.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;

==Service==
''Richelieu'' was laid down at [[Toulon]] in 1869 and launched on 3 December 1873.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt; While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known, it was probably due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were not suitable for the Industrial Age.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, pp. 31, 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876. She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;

While in Toulon harbor on 29 December 1880, ''Richelieu'' caught fire and had to be scuttled to prevent her magazines from exploding. The ship [[Capsizing|capsized]] to port in {{convert|10.75|m|ft|1|sp=us}} of water; she lay on her barbettes almost at a 90° angle. In order to salvage her, all accessible guns, ammunition, masts, armor and movable decks were removed and the equivalent weight was placed in the ship's [[hold (ship)|hold]]s to lower her center of gravity. A sheer hulk was moved to her port side and cables were connected to {{ship|French frigate|Sibylle|1847|2}} on the other side of ''Richelieu''. 360 empty casks and {{convert|34|m3|sp=us}} of [[cork (material)|cork]] were attached to the starboard side to prevent the ship from rolling too far the other way. After an hour and a half of lifting, ''Richelieu'' had been righted to a 45° angle; a subsequent effort completed the job.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;

''Richelieu'' was repaired and returned to service as the flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron on 8 October 1881 where she remained until 1886.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt; The squadron made port visits in [[Tangiers]] and [[Lisbon]] in 1884 before sailing to [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Cherbourg]] for exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Saibene, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 ''Richelieu'' tested Bullivant [[torpedo net]]s, but they reduced her speed to a maximum of {{convert|4|kn}} and as a result were not considered successful. The ship was placed back in reserve in 1886 and became flagship of the Reserve Squadron on 8 September 1892,&lt;ref name=d28/&gt; which, despite its name, consisted of ships in commission. The squadron conducted exercises from June to August 1892 in French waters.&lt;ref&gt;Saibene, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; ''Richelieu'' was condemned on 5 March 1900, but was not immediately sold. After having been sold to Dutch ship breakers, ''Richelieu'' departed Toulon on 28 January 1911. She was under tow in the Bay of Biscay, having left the Mediterranean for the first time in her existence, when a storm caused the tugboat to cast her loose. The ship remained afloat, however, and was subsequently recovered near the Scilly Isles and towed to Amsterdam where she was broken up.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;
