'''Dynamite''' is an [[explosive material|explosive]] made of [[nitroglycerin]], [[sorbent]]s (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist and engineer [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Geesthacht]], and [[patented]] in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safer alternative to [[gun powder]] and [[nitroglycerin]].

==Invention, purpose, and use==
[[File:Nobels Extradynamit label.jpg|thumb|&quot;Nobel's ExtraDynamite&quot; manufactured by Nobel's old company, Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget.]]

Dynamite was invented by [[Alfred Nobel]] and was the first safely manageable explosive stronger than [[black powder]]. Nobel obtained [[patent]]s for his invention in England on 7 May 1867, in Sweden on 19 October 1867.&lt;ref name=s&amp;s-101&gt;Schück &amp; Sohlman (1929), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safe alternative to [[black powder]] and [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel tightly controlled the patents, and unlicensed duplicating companies were quickly shut down. However, a few American businessmen got around the patent by using a slightly different formula.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPat 234489&quot;&gt;US Patent 234489 issued to Morse 16 November 1880&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel originally sold dynamite as &quot;Nobel's Blasting Powder&quot; but decided to change the name to dynamite, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word δύναμις ''dýnamis'', meaning &quot;power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;dynamite.&quot; The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2003. Houghton Mifflin Company 19 March 2013 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dynamite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;dynamite.&quot; Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged. 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003. HarperCollins Publishers 19 March 2013 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dynamite&lt;/ref&gt;

An industrialist, engineer, and inventor, Alfred Nobel's father, Immanuel Nobel, built bridges and buildings in Stockholm. His construction work inspired him to research new methods of blasting rock. Immanuel's work with explosives later on inspired Alfred to make explosives safer and more effective. Today dynamite is mainly used in the [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[construction]], and [[demolition]] industries. Dynamite is still the product of choice for trenching applications, and as a cost-effective alternative to [[cast booster]]s. Dynamite is occasionally used as an initiator or booster for [[ANFO|AN and ANFO explosive charges]].

==Manufacture==

===Composition===
Nitroglycerin by itself is a very strong explosive, but is extremely shock-sensitive (that is, physical shock can cause it to explode), and degrades over time to even more unstable forms, which makes it highly dangerous to transport or use. Dynamite combines nitroglycerin with adsorbents and stabilizers, rendering it safe to use, but retaining the powerful explosive properties of nitroglycerin. 

The original composition of dynamite consisted of three parts &quot;Explosive Oil&quot; ([[nitroglycerin]]), one part [[diatomaceous earth]] as the absorbent, and a small admixture of [[sodium carbonate]] antacid as the stabilizer. Ethylene glycol dinitrate was later added to the nitroglycerin to lower its freezing point and keep it from freezing into a slush at low temperatures, which made it unstable, or from sweating out when it thawed. Diatomaceous earth is not usually used today as an absorbent medium and it has been replaced by cheaper media like sawdust, wood pulp, flour, or starch. Other stabilizers like calcium carbonate or zinc oxide can be used in the place of sodium carbonate. Sodium nitrate is added to the medium as an oxidizer that improves the dynamite's [[brisance]].

===Form===
Dynamite is usually sold in the form of cardboard cylinders about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} long and about {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in diameter, with a weight of about {{convert|1/2|lbt|g|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin Blaster Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |title=Austin Powder Guide, Dynamite series page 2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stick of dynamite thus produced contains roughly 1&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Other sizes also exist, rated by either portion (Quarter-Stick or Half-Stick) or by weight. 

Dynamite is usually rated by &quot;weight strength&quot; (the amount of nitroglycerin it contains), usually from 20% to 60%. For example, ''40% dynamite'' is composed of 40% nitroglycerin and 60% &quot;dope&quot; (the absorbent storage medium mixed with the stabilizer and any additives).

===Storage considerations===
The maximum [[shelf life]] of nitroglycerin-based dynamite is recommended as one year from the date of manufacture under good storage conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin Blaster Guide&quot; /&gt;

Over time, regardless of the sorbent used, sticks of dynamite will &quot;weep&quot; or &quot;sweat&quot; nitroglycerin, which can then pool in the bottom of the box or storage area. For that reason, explosive manuals recommend the repeated turning over of boxes of dynamite in storage. Crystals will form on the outside of the sticks causing them to be even more shock, friction, and temperature sensitive. This creates a very dangerous situation. While the risk of an explosion without the use of a [[blasting cap]] is minimal for fresh dynamite, old dynamite is dangerous. Modern packaging helps eliminate this by placing the dynamite into sealed plastic bags, and using wax coated cardboard.

Dynamite is moderately sensitive to shock. Shock resistance tests are usually carried out with a drop-hammer: about 100&amp;nbsp;mg of explosive is placed on an anvil, upon which a weight of between 0.5 and 10&amp;nbsp;kg is dropped from different heights until detonation is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos López Jimeno, Emilio López Jimeno, Francisco Javier Ayala-Carcedo, ''Drilling and Blasting of Rocks'', translated by Yvonne Visser de Ramiro from ''Manual de perforación y voladura de rocas'' (1987), Geomining Technological Institute of Spain (Instituto Tecnológico Geominero de Espan~a), Taylor &amp; Francis, London and New York, 1995, ISBN 90-5410-199-7&lt;/ref&gt; With a hammer of 2&amp;nbsp;kg, [[mercury fulminate]] detonates with a drop distance of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;cm, nitroglycerin with 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm, dynamite with 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and ammoniacal explosives with 40 to 50&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Major manufacturers===

====South Africa====
For several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Union of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases, {{convert|50|lb|kg|order=flip}} each, annually. A rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caia.co.za/index.php?pg=18 AECI: South Africa - History of the Chemical Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were several other explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are safer to manufacture and handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Dynamite was manufactured by the [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company]] until the mid-1970s. Other American dynamite makers of that time period included the [[Hercules Corporation]], Atlas, Trojan US Powder, Austin, and several other smaller firms.

Currently only [[Dyno Nobel]] manufactures dynamite in the US. The only facility producing it is located in [[Carthage, Missouri]], but the material is purchased from Dyno Nobel by other manufacturers, who put their label on the dynamite and boxes.

==Non-dynamite explosives==
Other explosives are often referred to or confused with dynamite:

===TNT===
Though both [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and dynamite are high explosives, there is little similarity between them. Dynamite is a stabilized form of [[nitroglycerin]] while TNT is the chemical compound [[trinitrotoluene]].  The energy density (measured in units of joules per kilogram, symbol J/kg) of dynamite is approximately 125% that of TNT: 5.0 MJ/kg for dynamite vs 4.0 MJ/kg of TNT{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

===&quot;Extra&quot; dynamite===
In the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented &quot;ammonium dynamite&quot;, a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. Ammonium nitrate has only 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin. 

It is rated by either &quot;weight strength&quot; (the amount of ammonium nitrate in the medium) or &quot;cartridge strength&quot; (the [[Strength (explosive)|potential explosive strength]] generated by an amount of explosive of a certain density and grain size used in comparison to the explosive strength generated by an equivalent density and grain size of a standard explosive). For example, high-explosive ''65% Extra Dynamite'' has a weight strength of 65% ammonium nitrate and 35% &quot;dope&quot; (the absorbent medium mixed with the stabilizers and additives). Its &quot;cartridge strength&quot; would be its weight in pounds times its strength in relation to an equal amount of [[ANFO]] (the civilian baseline standard) or [[TNT]] (the military baseline standard). For example, 65% ammonium dynamite with a 20% cartridge strength would mean the stick was equal to an equivalent weight strength of 20% ANFO.

===&quot;Military dynamite&quot;===
&quot;Military dynamite&quot; is a dynamite substitute, formulated without nitroglycerin. It contains 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch, but much safer to store and handle for long periods than Nobel's dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military dynamite achieves greater stability by avoiding the use of nitroglycerin and uses much more stable chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;lpg=PA498&amp;dq=Military+dynamite+TNT|year=2007 |isbn=0-615-14794-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
