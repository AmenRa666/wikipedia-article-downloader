== Promotion to admiral ==

From the gazette records, it doesn't appear that Kane was promtoed rear-admiral until 1897, {{LondonGazette|issue=26924|startpage=7854|date=[[31 December]] [[1897]]}}, so I've deleted mention of this as it doesn't seem likely that this was as a result of his actions on ''Calliope''.  I've also separated out the two references from one footnote, as it seems much clearer that way.  [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 11:06, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
:Thanks for the clarification.  I took the point from page 102 of [http://books.google.com/books?id=xQV02jldbAAC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=calliope+colledge+apia&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QMZduCNMCu&amp;sig=OATAjMcf50fhGFYeIwb7zfrye3c#PPA87,M1 this book].  It does not specifically say that the promotion directly resulted from the incident, so I have modified the text to make a general statement.  The book would be useful for an article on Kane, should anyone wish to add it.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 13:45, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
::That's better.  The book does seem to overstate things somewhat, also saying he was knighted - he was but not until after his retirement in 1911, and you note elsewhere the fact that the book says the ''Calliope'' was barque rigged whilst photos appear ship-rigged.  On a tangent, I see you seem to prefer combining notes, whereas the more common approach seems to be to list separate sources each in their own note.  I did split one such compound note earlier, but perhaps a decision should be made on a conistent style.  [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 15:05, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
:::Sourcing formats are a matter of personal preference, and there is no preferred one.  I have put sources and footnotes in separate sections, which works well for footnotes with text, as here.  It also is better for specific page cites; the practice of multiple uses of a footnote for a single source, when that source may be hundreds of pages long, makes it much more difficult to fact-check the text against the reference.  And finally, it avoids having a string of numbers for multiple footnotes after a proposition.  If it is felt that separate footnotes after each clause is clearer, rather than end-of-sentence citations (as present fn 29), I have no strong objection, but I dislike strings of footnotes for the same proposition.
:::Thank you for your help on this article.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 23:34, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
::::I removed the statement &quot;His career prospered as well;&quot; from the article, regarding Kane.  He spent an average length of time as a Captain before promotion to Flag Rank (15 years), but for five months before his promotion to Rear-Admiral he was unemployed, and he never held another appointment before retiring in 1899. --[[User:Simon Harley|Simon Harley]] ([[User talk:Simon Harley|Talk]] | [[User:Simon Harley/Library|Library]]). 17:00, 19 February 2010 (UTC)
:::::Simon, thank you.  I will be adding some text on commendation from some sort from the Admiralty (I do not have it with me).  Was command of ''Victory'' viewed as an honour?  I had assumed it was.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 17:22, 19 February 2010 (UTC)
::::::Being in command of ''Victory'' meant that he was Flag Captain (essentially Chief of Staff) to the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, in this case, Lord Clanwilliam).  It wasn't a seagoing command.  --[[User:Simon Harley|Simon Harley]] ([[User talk:Simon Harley|Talk]] | [[User:Simon Harley/Library|Library]]). 17:33, 19 February 2010 (UTC)
:::::::Yes, but I had assumed it was an honour. Cf. [[Henry Coey Kane]] (uncited, unfortunately). It seems that the Rousmaniere book (link in my first paragraph above) may have overstated things, as David Underdown mentioned above. (The book is more a popular history than a scholarly work.)  I have since come across a couple of obits, and if they fit in here (as opposed to the separate article on Kane) I may include them.  But no characterization is really needed-- his actions speak for themselves.  Thanks again.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 17:48, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

==Wheel==
The article mentions that ''Calliope's'' wheel was given to Samoa.  According to [http://www.lynx-travel.com/Vacations/NZ2000/Auckland/Maritime_Museum/Maritime/pages/Wheel%20From%20HMS%20Calliope.html this site], it now resides in the [[National Maritime Museum, New Zealand]].  The claim appears to be authentic (and shows a picture of a single wheel, whereas a [http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/calypso_class.htm contemporaneous photograph] shows a doubled wheel) but the website likely would not meet the requirements of a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], and the Museum's website is scanty on the contents of its collections.  If anyone can confirm this with a reliable source it would be appreciated; a PD-photograph from a Wikipedian in Auckland would also be useful.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 13:04, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

:The Maritime Museum has confirmed that they do in fact have the wheel shown in the photograph linked above; it is on loan from the [[Auckland Museum]].  As shown in that photo, it is a single wheel, whereas the photograph shows a double one.  There is also published mention of a wheel at Apia.  Whether it is the other half, or whether the Samoa wheel is the one in New Zealand, is unclear.  [[User:Kablammo|Kablammo]] ([[User talk:Kablammo|talk]]) 15:32, 7 September 2008 (UTC)</text>
