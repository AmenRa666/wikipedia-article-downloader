'''HMS ''Brazen''''' was a {{Sclass2-|B|destroyer}} built for the [[Royal Navy]] around 1930. Initially assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], she was transferred to [[Home Fleet]] in 1936. The ship escorted convoys and conducted [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]] early in [[World War II]] before participating in the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in April–May 1940. ''Brazen'' later began escorting coastal convoys in the [[English Channel]] and was sunk in late July 1940 by German aircraft whilst doing so.

==Description==
''Brazen'' displaced {{convert|1360|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1790|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|323|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|32|ft|3|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|3|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s. ''Brazen'' carried a maximum of {{convert|390|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitley, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's complement was 134 officers and enlisted men, although it increased to 142 during wartime.&lt;ref name=f8&gt;Friedman, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|QF 4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Brazen'' had two {{convert|40|mm|1|adj=on}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk II]] AA guns mounted on a platform between her [[funnel (ship)|funnels]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.&lt;ref name=f8/&gt; One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The ship was ordered on 22 March 1929 from [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]] at [[Hebburn]] under the 1928 [[Glossary of nautical terms#N|Naval Programme]]. She was laid down on 22 July 1929, and launched on 25 July 1930,&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; as the seventh RN ship to carry this name.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brazen'' was completed on 8 April 1931 at a cost of £220,342, excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns, ammunition and communications equipment.&lt;ref&gt;March, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; After her commissioning, she was assigned to the [[4th Destroyer Flotilla]] with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] until the end of 1935. The ship received a refit at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] from August to October 1933 and another at [[Malta]] a few months later. ''Brazen'' was assigned to the Home Fleet in 1936 and participated in the effort to rescue the crew of the submarine {{HMS|Thetis|N25|2}} which had sunk during [[sea trial]]s on 1 June 1939.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was reassigned to the [[19th Destroyer Flotilla]] in August, shortly before World War II began. She spent the next seven months escorting convoys and patrolling in the English Channel and the [[North Sea]]. On 13 October, ''Brazen'' rescued three survivors from {{GS|U-40|1938|6}} which had sunk after striking a [[naval mine|mine]] a few hours earlier. The ship, together with the destroyer {{HMS|Encounter|H10|2}}, assumed the escort of Convoy HN12 after the destroyer {{HMS|Daring|H16|2}} had been sunk by {{GS|U-23|1936|2}}. Later that day she rescued some survivors from the Norwegian merchant ship ''Sangstad''.&lt;ref name=e8&gt;English, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brazen'' escorted the [[capital ship]]s of the Home Fleet as they sortied into the North Sea on 7 April and continued that duty for the next several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Haar (2009), pp. 86, 372&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was detached to escort a troop convoy to ''Namsos'' on 13 April and sank {{GS|U-49|1939|2}} two days later with the destroyer {{HMS|Fearless|H67|2}} near [[Harstad]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Haar (2010), pp. 203–05&lt;/ref&gt; The two destroyers rescued 41 of the submarine's crew. ''Brazen'' escorted several more convoys to and from Norway over the next several weeks.&lt;ref name=e8/&gt;

On 30 May, the ship was en route to [[Harwich Dockyard|Harwich]] when she struck some submerged wreckage and suffered damage that required five weeks to repair. ''Brazen'' was transferred to the [[1st Destroyer Flotilla]], based at [[Dover]], upon their completion, where she began escorting coastal convoys. Whilst escorting Convoy CW7 on 20 July, during the [[Kanalkampf|initial phase]] of the [[Battle of Britain]], the ship was attacked by German [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers belonging to II./''[[Sturzkampfgeschwader 1]]'' (Dive Bomber Wing 1—or StG 1).&lt;ref&gt;Weal, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; The shock effect from several near misses broke her [[keel]] and then she was hit in the engine room. ''Brazen'' sank at position {{coord|51|01|05|N|01|17|15|E}} at 20:40. Only one member of her crew was killed during the attack and her gunners claimed to have shot down three Ju 87s.&lt;ref name=e8/&gt; German records confirm only two losses—both fell to defending British fighter aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;
