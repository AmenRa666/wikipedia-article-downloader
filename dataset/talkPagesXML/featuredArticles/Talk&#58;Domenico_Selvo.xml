==Reworking==

I'm going to be doing some heavy work on this article in the coming week hopefully to lift it to GA or even FA status. The trouble is that it's a pretty tough subject to find a bunch of primary sources on. However, I've been able to find some pretty good stuff out there and anyone who wants to help me is completely welcome to do so. I'm looking at what could be up to 10 references if not more. Jstor will help out along with the WFU library which is particularly good because WFU has a house in Venice. [[User:JHMM13|JHMM13]] ([[User talk:JHMM13|T]] | [[Special:Contributions/JHMM13|C]])

:I like this article and you are to be congratulated.  I did some copyediting recently - it helps to have another set of eyes look at an article.  I will be working on that map, which will be focused on the Adriatic Sea area in 1084.  I also have to admit that I support Atillios' deletion of the template.  The article already has two &quot;Doge&quot; templates.  Improvements could include:
:*Completion of the '''Legacy'''.
:*More information about that battle off Corfu and why that led to the fall of Selvo.  
:All for now, [[User:MapMaster|MapMaster]] 23:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks for your contribution. The reason for adding that template was to give the reader a base from which to understand the recent history. I will take the suggestion and keep it off. The reason it's been stagnant the last week or so is because I've been awfully busy in school. I'll get working on this and possibly finishing it this week. &lt;font style=&quot;background:#b22222;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:JHMM13|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;font-size:105%&quot;&gt;JHMM13&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/font&gt;
:::A truly impressive expansion. But I would recommend cutting down a bit on the footnotes. Most repetitions aren't necessary at all and unless a fact is really controversial, there's no need to cite the same source over and over once it's been established. I also have a somewhat related question: what is the correct name of the Doge's Byzantine wife? Take a look in [[medieval cuisine#Meals]] and you'll find a rather amusing account of how her Byzantine habit of using a fork to eat her food was received by Italian nobles. If the name linked in that article is incorrect, don't hesitate to correct it.
:::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:03, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
::::Thanks for the input. I've been really busy with work recently, so I haven't had much time to write, but that will continue next week. I'll be sure to trim down the refs a bit. I've been having a difficult time finding as many references as there are in other featured articles because the subject is so painfully obscure. I wonder what the FA guidelines are for this considering I literally have searched far and wide online and in the depths of libraries and only found the refs that I have listed. Regarding Selvo's wife, the name that I believe Norwich gives is Teodora Ducas. I believe her middle name was Anna and I believe she took the name Selvo in marriage, but I am not sure. I think I'm going to change around the &quot;spouse&quot; part in the infobox to &quot;Teodora Ducas,&quot; because I've only seen her referred to as Teodora Selvo several times, and never in the major references. While you're here, could you help me out with a problem I'm having regarding the references? I want to use the templates for refs, but many of my references don't have ISBNs due to their age and the only locator I can find for them are Library of Congress numbers. I know I'm being a pain with these sources, but I've really searched and searched and without these sources, the article would fall apart, so I have to keep them in ISBN or not. Is it OK to keep templates out to accomodate the LOC books? Thanks a lot, &lt;font style=&quot;background:#b22222;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:JHMM13|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;font-size:105%&quot;&gt;JHMM13&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/font&gt; 06:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::Too few sources? No way... I count 10+, and that's quite satisfying for a relatively obscure and narrow topic. I mean, the man didn't even have his own article just a few months ago. :-) I am personally quite irked that many of the people who habitually make checklist-type reviews of GACs and FACs think that the ''number'' of footnotes or sources is actually an accurate and fair way of assessing how well-referenced an article is.
:::::As for ref-templates, I personally never liked them. They're not mandatory and have the very real disadvantage of making the article a ''lot'' harder to edit for outsiders because of the huge swaths of code that they generate. The problem of sources without ISBN is new to me, but if you're sure that they don't have one, I can't see that it would be wrong to just state the LOC.
:::::Btw, do you think you could make a separate reference section? That way you can shorten the footnotes. Compare these, for example:
:::::*Skinner, Patricia. (2003). ''Family Power in Southern Italy'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 3-5. ISBN 0521522056
:::::*Skinner pp. 3-5
:::::And it would make it easier to get an overview of the sources.
:::::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:51, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::Thanks a million for that tip, Peter. I've been trying to cut down a bit on the repeated refs and I made a separate notes and refs section. I'll be working on the meat of the article again in a few days. &lt;font style=&quot;background:#b22222;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:JHMM13|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;font-size:105%&quot;&gt;JHMM13&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/font&gt; 06:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

==Featured article==

This article was just promoted to featured status! Woo hoo! &lt;font style=&quot;background:#b22222;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:JHMM13|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;font-size:105%&quot;&gt;JHMM13&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/font&gt; 03:52, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:And a well-deserved one at that. Good work, JH.

An unsourced popular culture section was recently added[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domenico_Selvo&amp;diff=692499323&amp;oldid=668392895], which means the article no longer meets the [[WP:FACR|featured article criteria]]. If the concerns about the section are not addressed, the article may be taken to [[Wikipedia:Featured article review]] for re-assessment.
