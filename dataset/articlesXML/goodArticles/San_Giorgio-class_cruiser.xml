The '''''San Giorgio'' class''' consisted of two [[armored cruiser]]s built for the Royal Italian Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]'') in the first decade of the 20th century. The second ship, {{ship|Italian cruiser|San Marco||2}}, was used to evaluate recently invented [[steam turbine]]s in a large ship and incorporated a number of other technological advances. The ships participated in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911–12, although {{ship|Italian cruiser|San Giorgio||2}} was under repair for most of the war. ''San Marco'' supported ground forces in [[Libya]] with [[Naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]] and helped them to occupy towns in Libya and islands in the [[Dodecanese]]. During World War I, the ships' activities were limited by the threat of [[Austro-Hungarian]] submarines, although they did [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)|bombard Durazzo, Albania]] in 1918.

''San Giorgio'' spent several years in the Far East and Italian Somaliland after the war and became a [[training ship]] in 1931. After a brief deployment to Spain in 1936, she was reconstructed to better serve her role as a training ship. The ship's [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft armament]] was augmented when she was deployed to [[Tobruk]], Libya to reinforce the port's defenses after Italy declared war on Britain in May 1940. ''San Giorgio'' was [[scuttled]] in early 1941 when Allied forces were poised to capture the port. Her wreck was [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] in 1952, but sank while under tow. ''San Marcos'' was converted into a [[target ship]] in the early 1930s and was found sunk at the end of the war. She was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1949.

==Design and description==
[[File:San Giorgio Brasseys 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and deck plan from [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1912]]
The ''San Giorgio'' class was ordered almost immediately after the preceding {{sclass-|Pisa|cruiser|0}} ships, and was an improved version of that design. The [[forecastle]] was extended to improve seaworthiness, [[gun turret|turret]] armor was increased, habitability was improved and the propulsion machinery was redistributed. ''San Marco'' was given the first steam turbines fitted in a large Italian ship for comparative purposes with ''San Giorgio'', which retained the traditional [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] (VTE). ''San Marco'' was a very innovative ship as she was the first turbine-powered ship in any navy to have four [[propeller shaft]]s, the first with a [[gyroscopic compass]], the first with [[antiroll tanks]], and the first not to use wood in any way.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, pp. 252, 261&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''San Giorgio''-class ships had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|131.04|m|ftin|sp=us}} and an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|140.89|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21.03|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.35|-|7.76|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The ships displaced {{convert|10167|-|10969|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load, and {{convert|11300|-|11900|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]]. The ships had a complement of 32 officers and 666 to 673 enlisted men.&lt;ref name=f8&gt;Fraccaroli, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
The machinery installation of this class was changed in comparison to that of the ''Pisa'' class, with the engines [[amidships]] with the 14 mixed-firing [[water-tube boiler]]s fore and aft of the engines. Their exhausts were trunked together into two widely spaced pairs of [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s. Designed for a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}},&lt;ref name=s8&gt;Silverstone, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; the two ships were given different types of propulsion machinery for evaluation. ''San Giorgio''{{'}}s two shafts, pair of {{convert|19500|ihp|lk=in
adj=on}} VTE steam engines and [[Blechynden boiler]]s differed only slightly from those used by the ''Pisa''s. In contrast, ''San Marco''{{'}}s four shafts, each driven by a license-built [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] steam turbine, was a first for the ''Regia Marina''. The turbines used steam provided by [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|210|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}&lt;ref name=a7&gt;Attilio, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; to reach their designed output of {{convert|23000|shp|abbr=on}}. Both ships exceeded their designed speeds, with ''San Giorgio'' reaching {{convert|23.2|kn}} and ''San Marco'' {{convert|23.75|kn}} during their [[sea trial]]s. The biggest difference between the sisters was that the turbines of ''San Marco'' proved to be significantly less economical in service (a range of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}} and {{convert|2480|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|21.25|kn}}) compared to ''San Giorgio''{{'}}s VTE steam engines ({{convert|6270|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}} and {{convert|2640|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|21.25|kn}}.&lt;ref name=g0&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
The main armament of the ''San Giorgio''-class ships consisted of four [[EOC 10-inch /45 naval gun|Cannone da 254/45 A Modello 1907]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The ''/45'' denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 45 [[Calibers#Caliber as measurement of length|caliber]], meaning that the gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter.&lt;/ref&gt; guns in electrically powered, twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]].&lt;ref name=g0/&gt; The turrets had an arc of fire of 260°.&lt;ref name=a7/&gt; The {{convert|254|mm|abbr=on}} gun fired {{convert|450|-|500|lb|kg|adj=on|disp=flip|1}} [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing (AP)]] projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2850|ft/s|m/s|sp=us|disp=flip}}. At maximum elevation of +25°, the guns had a range of about {{convert|25000|m|yd|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 324; Friedman, pp. 68, 238&lt;/ref&gt; The ships mounted eight [[Cannone da 190/45 A Modello 1908]] in four electrically powered twin-gun turrets, two in each side amidships, as their secondary armament. Their arc of fire was 160°.&lt;ref name=a7/&gt; These [[Armstrong Whitworth]] {{convert|190|mm|abbr=on}} guns fired
{{convert|90.9|kg|adj=on}} AP shells at {{convert|2835|-|2927|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip|abbr=on}}. At maximum elevation of +25°, the guns had a range of about {{convert|22000|m|yd|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 329; Friedman, pp. 79, 239&lt;/ref&gt;

For defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, the ''San Giorgio''s mounted 18 [[List of British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing (QF)]] 40-caliber {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} guns. Eight of these were mounted in [[embrasure]]s in the sides of the hull and the rest in the superstructure.&lt;ref name=g0/&gt; The ships were also fitted with a pair of QF 40-caliber {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} guns. The ''San Giorgio''-class ships were equipped with three submerged {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. During World War I, eight of the 76&amp;nbsp;mm guns were replaced by six 76&amp;nbsp;mm [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]]&lt;ref name=g0/&gt; and one torpedo tube was removed.&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;

===Protection===
The ships were protected by an [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick amidships and reduced to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on|1}} at the bow and stern.&lt;ref name=s8/&gt; The belt was {{convert|7|ft|3|in|m|1|disp=flip|abbr=on}} high, of which {{convert|4|ft|11|in|m|1|disp=flip|abbr=on}} was below the [[waterline]].&lt;ref name=a7/&gt; The armored [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick and the [[conning tower]] armor was 254&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The 254&amp;nbsp;mm gun turrets were protected by 200&amp;nbsp;mm of armour while the 190&amp;nbsp;mm turrets had {{convert|160|mm|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref name=g0/&gt;

''San Marco'' supported the occupations of [[Benghazi]] and [[Derna, Libya]] during the war and bombarded the fortifications defending the entrance to the [[Dardanelles]].&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, pp. 30, 49, 84; Stephenson, pp. 217, 262–65&lt;/ref&gt; She also supported the forces occupying the island of [[Rhodes]] in May 1912. In February 1913, ''San Giorgio'' cruised the [[Aegean Sea]] and made a port visit to [[Salonica]], Greece, the next month.&lt;ref&gt;Marchese&lt;/ref&gt; She ran aground again on 21 November in the [[Strait of Messina]], but was only slightly damaged.&lt;ref name=s5/&gt;

During World War I, the activities of the ships were restricted by the threat of submarine attack after the armored cruisers {{ship|Italian cruiser|Giuseppe Garibaldi|1899|2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Amalfi||2}} were sunk by submarines shortly after Italy joined the war in May 1915, although the ships did participate in the bombardment of Durazzo, Albania in late 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 148, 151, 176; Sondhaus, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, ''San Giorgio'' was deployed to the [[Far East]]&lt;ref name=s6/&gt; while ''San Marcos'' played a minor role in the [[Corfu incident]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19230922/295/0009|title=Greek Reparations: Evacuation of Corfu Begun|date=22 September 1923|work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer|page=9|accessdate=1 March 2015| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000320/19231001/040/0002|title=Italy and Greece: Indemnity Paid Over|date=1 October 1923|work=Gloucestershire Echo|page=2|accessdate=1 March 2015| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Giorgio'', escorted by ''San Marco'', ferried [[Crown Prince]] [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto]] to South America in July–September 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Humbert Sails|date=2 July 1924|work=The New York Times|page=31|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Humbert Sails Home from Brazil|date=20 September 1924|work=The New York Times|page=22|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then supported operations in [[Italian Somaliland]] in 1925–26.&lt;ref name=s6/&gt; The ship was disarmed and converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1931–35; her old boilers were replaced by four oil-burning ones which reduced her maximum speed to {{convert|18|kn}}. She was captured by the Germans when they occupied [[La Spezia]] on 9 September 1943; ''San Marcos'' was found at the end of the war half-sunk in the harbor there and was broken up in 1949.&lt;ref name=g2/&gt;

From 1930 to 1935, ''San Giorgio'' was based in [[Pula|Pola]] as a training ship, and was sent to Spain after the [[Spanish Civil War]] began in 1936 to protect Italian interests.&lt;ref name=s6&gt;Sicurezza, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937–38 she was reconstructed to serve as a dedicated training ship for [[naval cadet]]s at the [[Arsenale di La Spezia]]: six boilers were removed and the remaining eight were converted to burn fuel oil which reduced her speed to {{convert|16|-|17|kn}}. Each pair of funnels was trunked together and her 76/40 guns were replaced by 47-caliber {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on|1}} guns in four twin turrets abreast the funnels. Her torpedo tubes were also removed while she received a light AA suite for the first time, with the addition of six 54-caliber Breda {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} guns, a dozen {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} [[Breda Model 35]] autocannon and four {{convert|13.2|mm|abbr=on}} [[Breda Model 31]] machine guns in two twin mounts.&lt;ref name=g2/&gt;&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Brescia, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Italian cruiser San Giorgio scuttled at Tobruk 1941.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of ''San Giorgio'' on fire after being scuttled]] 
Prior to her being sent to reinforce the defenses of Tobruk in early May 1940, a fifth 100/47 gun turret was added on the forecastle and five more twin 13.2&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun mounts were added to better suit her new role as a floating battery.&lt;ref name=b4/&gt; Two days after Italy declared war on Britain on 10 June, the British [[light cruiser]]s {{HMS|Gloucester|62|2}} and {{HMS|Southampton|83|2}} bombarded Tobruk and attacked ''San Giorgio'', which was not hit during the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; A British submarine fired two torpedoes at ''San Giorgio'' on 19 June, but these detonated before reaching the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3400.html &quot;HMS Parthian (N 75)&quot;]. ''uboat.net''. Retrieved 2 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's guns engaged [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft attacking Tobruk many times, destroying several. She was scuttled in shallow water on 22 January 1941 to prevent her capture during the [[Battle of Tobruk (1941)|Battle of Tobruk]].&lt;ref name=b4/&gt; ''San Giorgio'' was awarded the [[Gold Medal of Military Valour]] (''Medaglia d'Oro al Valore Militare'') for her performance at Tobruk.&lt;ref&gt;San Giorgio&lt;/ref&gt; Her wreck was refloated in 1952, but sank under tow en route to Italy.&lt;ref name=b4/&gt;
