The '''First Transjordan attack on Amman''' (known to the British as the '''First Attack on Amman''')&lt;ref name=BNC33&gt;Battles Nomenclature Committee 1922 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and to their enemy as the '''First Battle of the Jordan'''&lt;ref name=Erickson2001_195&gt;Erickson 2001 p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; took place between 21 March and 2 April 1918, as a consequence of the successful [[Battle of Tell 'Asur]] which occurred after the [[Capture of Jericho]] in February and the [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley]] began, during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of World War I. During the First Transjordan attack large incursions into Ottoman territory occurred. Firstly the Passage of the [[Jordan River]], was successfully captured between 21 and 23 March, followed by the first occupation of [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]] in the hills of [[Moab]] between 24 and 25 March. The [[First Battle of Amman]] took place between 27 and 31 March when the [[Anzac Mounted Division]] and the [[Imperial Camel Corps Brigade]] (fighting dismounted as infantry) were reinforced by two battalions of 181st Brigade followed by a second two battalions from the 180th Brigade ([[60th London Division]]) and artillery. The [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth Army]] headquarters located in Amman was strongly garrisoned and during the battle received reinforcements on the [[Hejaz railway]], the strength of which eventually forced the attacking force to retire back to the Jordan Valley between 31 March and 2 April. The [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan Valley]] would [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley|continue to be occupied]] by the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF) through the summer until the middle of September 1918 when the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] began.

During the winter of 1917/1918, the considerable territorial gains by the EEF as a consequence of victories at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]] in November and the [[Battle of Jerusalem]] in December, from the [[Gaza City|Gaza]]–[[Beersheba]] line to the [[Jaffa]]–[[Jerusalem]] line, were consolidated. The front line was adjusted in February 1918 when the right flank of the Jaffa–Jerusalem line was secured by the capture of land to the east of Jerusalem and down into the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] to Jericho and the [[Dead Sea]]. The [[Capture of Jericho (1918)|Capture of Jericho]] was also a necessary precursor, along with the [[Action of Tell 'Asur]], and advances by [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]]'s force across the Jordan River and into the hills of Moab towards [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]] and [[Amman]].

In March, after several unsuccessful attempts by a [[British Empire]] force of Australian, British and New Zealand swimmers, the first Transjordan attack began with the passage of the Jordan River. The swimmers eventually got lines across the fast-flowing river while under fire from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces on the east bank, and pontoon bridges were quickly constructed so that infantry and New Zealand mounted troops could cross the river to attack Ottoman defenders on the east bank where a [[bridgehead]] was eventually established. Subsequently, Shea's force of infantry and mounted troops crossed the river and advanced eastwards across the high country; the central column of infantry moving along the main road quickly captured the Ottoman position at Shunet Nimrin on rising ground from the Jordan Valley and the town of Es Salt high in the hills. 

Meanwhile, the mounted columns continued marching to the north and south of the infantry column on to Amman {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of Jericho on the high plateau. Their objective was to effectively cut the main supply line to the north and south of Amman by destroying long sections of the [[Hejaz Railway]], including tunnels and a [[viaduct]] over which the railway travelled near the town. Amman was strongly defended by the [[Ottoman Army]] and the blown up sections of the railway were quickly replaced to allow reinforcements to continue to arrive and strengthen the defenders. British Empire infantry and artillery reinforcements were also sent forward from Es Salt, both of which took considerable time to cover the difficult and unfriendly terrain. Although the combined force of infantry and mounted troops made a determined attack on Amman, Shea was forced to retreat to the Jordan Valley from both Amman and Es Salt when it became clear the defenders were too strong, making it extremely difficult, if not impossible to achieve the operation's objective. The only territorial gains following the offensive were the establishment of bridgeheads on the eastern side of the river.

==Background==
[[File:CutlackMap6.jpeg|thumb|The Hejaz Railway and country east of the Dead Sea]]

The [[War Office]] promised General [[Edmund Allenby]], Commander in Chief of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF), substantial [[reinforcement]]s after his successful capture of Jerusalem. The [[Imperial War Cabinet]] was keen to know when Allenby would be ready to make further advances; they wished operations against the Ottomans to continue as forcefully as possible within the means at Allenby's disposal and they attached importance to the cutting the [[Hejaz Railway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes134–5&quot;&gt;Robertson to Allenby 7 March 1918 in Hughes 2004 pp. 134–5&lt;/ref&gt; The French, however, imposed an important qualification to Joint Note 12 which gave qualified approval for a decisive offensive against the Ottoman armies; no British troops in France could be deployed to the EEF. It was therefore decided to reinforce the EEF with one or possibly two [[British Indian Army]] cavalry divisions from France and three divisions from the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], which were to be supported by more artillery and aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 2006 p. 161–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wavell_176–7&quot;&gt;Wavell 1968 pp. 176–7&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 1918, the promised reinforcements were reduced to just one Indian division and four batteries of [[BL 6 inch 26 cwt howitzer|6-inch howitzers]] from Mesopotamia due to arrive by the end of May. Further, Indian infantry [[battalion]]s and [[cavalry]] regiments based in France were, during March and April, to be substituted for British [[infantry]] and mounted formations which had had long experience serving in Palestine; they would go to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Four additional [[Squadron (aviation)|aircraft squadrons]] were, however, promised for the coming summer, in addition to squadrons then being formed and a Canadian construction battalion was to be sent from France as soon as its replacement, in the process of formation in Canada, arrived on the Western Front. Also promised were enough [[Track (rail transport)|railway track]] to complete the doubling of the railway to [[Rafah|Rafa]] and a single line beyond [[Haifa]]. By July it was hoped that 152 [[locomotive]]s and 3,245 wagons would be available, with a promise of more if required; railway personnel and labour to run this railway were to come from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes134–5&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Asluj railway bridge destroyed 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Part of {{Convert|15|mi|km}} of railway line blown up in May 1917 by the Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions' and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade's engineers assisted by troopers]]
General [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, had been sent to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in early February to confer with Allenby regarding the implementation of Joint Note No. 12. At that time he encouraged Allenby in the view that if {{convert|10|-|15|mi|km}} of the Hejaz Railway near Amman could be destroyed, the Ottoman Army [[garrison]]s along the railway south from Amman to [[Medina]] would be isolated and weakened, which could result in  further Arab uprisings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wavell_176–7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 2006 p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Allenby had written to General [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|William Robertson]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], in late January regarding his wish to cut the Hejaz Railway at Amman&amp;nbsp;– an important Ottoman [[line of communication]] to the garrisons to the south of Amman, which would considerably weaken their positions. Without reliable supplies and reinforcements [[Bedouin]] and [[Arab world|Arab]] forces in the region could be encouraged to attack and rebel against these weakened Ottoman Empire forces and lengthen Allenby's right.&lt;ref name=Hughes127&gt;Allenby letter to Robertson 25/1/1918 in Hughes 2004 p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugsley 2004 p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;It has been suggested the capture of the town of Amman was the objective of the first Transjordan attack; that it was to be developed into a base from which to mount an attack on the [[Ma'an|Maan]] station to the south as this was considered to be the most important Hejaz railway station between [[Daraa|Deraa]] and Medina. [Bruce 2002, pp. 191–2]&lt;/ref&gt; Allenby continues: &quot;If I could destroy 10 or 15 miles of rail and some bridges and get touch with the Arabs under Feisal&amp;nbsp;– even temporarily&amp;nbsp;– the effect would be great.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hughes127/&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;He may have had in mind a similar attack carried out by the Anzac Mounted Division on 23 May 1917 when {{convert|15|mi|km}} of railway including bridges were destroyed on the Ottoman railway from Beersheba to Auja. [Wavell 1968, p. 90, Powles 1922, pp. 110, 113] For a description of the procedure used to destroy the rails see Powles 1922, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

A necessary prerequisite to the first Transjordan attack was a broadening of the EEF' base to better support the proposed attack on the Hejaz Railway at Amman. During the [[Battle of Tell 'Asur]] between 8 and 12 March 1918, the front line in the Judean Hills was pushed further north giving a substantially stronger base for attacks eastwards.&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsop 1925 p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Part II p. 657&lt;/ref&gt; A general advance on a front of between {{convert|14|-|26|mi|km}} and up to a maximum of depth of between {{convert|5|-|7|mi|km}} by the [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX Corps]] and [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]], pushed Ottoman forces north from the River Auja on the Mediterranean coast, north on both sides of the road from Jerusalem to Nablus, capturing Ras el Ain and Tell 'Asur and from Abu Tellul and Mussallabeh on the edge of the Jordan Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 2002 p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1955 p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Balfour Declaration===
Although it was not published in the Middle East at the time, the [[Balfour Declaration]] was published in London in November 1917 and became widely known. The declaration, which established the idea of a Jewish national homeland in Palestine, contained a proviso that such a homeland would not be at the expense of the rights of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] already living there.&lt;ref name=Bruce192&gt;Bruce 2002 p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Bruce claims the contents of the declaration were soon known to Arab leaders. [Bruce 2002 p. 192]&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine depended on a compliant Palestinian population and the British were eager to conciliate wherever possible. Orders were issued to be &quot;carefully friendly to the Arab tribes&quot; from east of the Jordan River, as they fought with the [[Sharif of Mecca]] against the Ottomans. These Arabs were to be treated with the greatest consideration, all payments to them were made in cash and all friction was to be avoided. Politically, Britain needed [[Faisal I of Iraq|Feisal]]'s support and Feisal needed British military support and the British encouraged the people to look to Feisal and the [[Hashemite]]s as their new rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes 1999 pp. 95–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Military cooperation between the Arabs and the British Empire forces was expected during these Transjordan operations although it was to be fairly limited.&lt;ref name=Bruce192/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kinloch255&gt;Kinloch 2007 p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. E. Lawrence]] and the forces of the [[Arab Revolt]] based on [[Aqaba]] had blown up lengths of rail track, bridges and Ottoman supply trains with explosives. In early March [[Sharif|Sherifian]] Arabs led by the Emir Feisal and guided by Lawrence were raiding Ottoman units south of El Kutrani and were in some force about [[Tafilah|Tafila]] on 11 March but withdrew a week later. In response the Ottoman Army sent a strong force including a German infantry battalion south from Amman to defend the railway and the important town of Ma'an. The Bedouin near [[Madaba]] were inclined to be hostile to the Ottoman Army and it was hoped that the planned attack on Amman might attract their support.&lt;ref name=Kinloch255/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutlack105&gt;Cutlack 1941 p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill143&gt;Hill 1978 p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman soldiers 1917.jpeg|thumb|Ottoman infantry column c 1917. Many are wearing [[Keffiyeh]]s]]

==Prelude==
On 1 March, aircraft of No. 1 Squadron [[Australian Flying Corps|AFC]] reconnoitred El Kutrani and reported a camp of 150 tents, 14 large dumps, 150 rolling stock including three trains and seven gun positions south-west of the station. Nearby a new aerodrome with six hangars and a number of tents had two large two-seat aircraft on the ground. A combined Australian and British air raid on 4 March by Nos 1 and [[No. 142 Squadron RAF|142]] Squadrons dropped 45 bombs on this aerodrome without much success. During the period the whole area on the Jordan front and the Amman position, including all camps and defence positions, was reconnoitred and mapped. At Shunet Nimrina a considerably increased Ottoman presence was noted on 3 March and successfully bombed on 6 March.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack 1941 pp. 106 &amp; 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of a bridgehead on the east bank of the Jordan River and the advance to Es Salt and Amman was to be preceded by diversionary attacks across the entire front and coordinated with an Arab raid led by T. E. Lawrence on the Deraa Hejaz railway station.&lt;ref name=Erickson2001_195/&gt;

Allenby ordered the infantry Major General, [[John Shea (Indian Army officer)|John Shea]] commander of the [[60th (London) Division]], to cross the Jordan River and attack Es Salt and Amman.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Chris|publisher=The Long Long Trail|title=British Divisions of 1914–1918|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/britdivs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 2002 p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these attacks was to destroy or damage a long [[viaduct]] and tunnel near Amman on one of the Ottoman Empire's strategically important [[lines of communication]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[Hejaz Railway]]. This rail line ran from Damascus southwards through eastern Syria {{convert|60|mi|km}} east of Jerusalem all the way to Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsop 1925 pp. 223–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Downes681&gt;Downes 1938 p. 681&lt;/ref&gt; By destroying the tunnel and viaduct which would be difficult to repair, the rail line could be cut for a considerable period of time and the Ottoman forces to the south would be isolated. Ottoman Army pressure on the Arab forces operating in the Ma'an area would be reduced and Allenby hoped Shea's attack would encourage the recall of a large Ottoman force which had occupied Tafila in March. Despite the extended front Shea's force would be operating on far from reinforcements, resistance to the attack was expected to be light.&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1955 p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 2002 pp. 191–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman forces===
The headquarters of the Ottoman [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth]], [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Armies]]' were located at Amman east of the Jordan River, and at Nablus and Tulkarm in the Judean Hills, respectively, while their commander in chief's headquarters was at Nazareth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 1999 p. 73&quot;&gt;Hughes 1999 p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1955 pp. 219, 220–1&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4,000 to 5,000 German and Ottoman soldiers with rifles, a large number of machine guns and 15 guns defended fortified positions covering the railway viaduct and tunnel in the Amman area while another 2,000 Ottoman soldiers defended the region towards Es Salt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce194&quot;&gt;Bruce 2002 p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wavell181-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward 2006 pp. 165–6&quot;&gt;Woodward 2006 pp. 165–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1955 pp. 209–10&lt;/ref&gt; The force defending Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Amman, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Asim, included the 3rd Assault Company with three infantry battalions, the German 703rd Infantry Battalion with some machine gun, cavalry and artillery units.&lt;ref name=Erickson134&gt;Erickson 2007 p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The assault detachment ... was composed of one infantry company (about 100 men), one engineer (pioneer) platoon (one officer, four NCOs and thirty men) and seven light machine-gun teams. The officers assigned to the assault detachments were hand-picked from within the division by divisional staff. The assault detachment was given four week's training in German-style [[stormtrooper]] tactics, to which the division sent an additional officer and five NCOs. Eventually the assault detachment was expanded into an assault battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson 2007 p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These assault battalions which consisted of between 300 and 350 officers and men were well equipped. They were frequently used in counterattacks and as divisional and corps reserves. The 3rd Assault Company was formed from a divisional detachment in late February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson 2007 pp. 134–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Defending Amman on 27 March the Ottoman and German garrison consisted of 2,150 rifles, 70 machine guns and ten guns. Jemal Kuchuk commander of the Fourth Army, arrived on 28 March to take command of the defence of Amman. Up to 30 March, approximately 2,000 reinforcements arrived with more to follow.&lt;ref&gt;German and Ottoman sources in Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; In reserve at the Amman railway station were the 46th Assault Company from the infantry's 46th Division.&lt;ref name=Erickson134/&gt; Part of the 150th Regiment (48th Division) garrisoned Amman and part of the regiment guarded the railway to the north and south of the city. One battalion of this regiment and one battalion of the 159th Regiment with some Circassian irregular cavalry, guarded the region towards the Jordan River between Es Salt and Ghoraniyeh, manning posts guarding the river. The German 703rd Battalion which was &quot;particularly strong in machine guns&quot;, had arrived back from Tafilah and was in the foothills on the Amman road by 21 March. These units amounted to no more than 1,500 rifles deployed between Amman and the Jordan River, when the EEF crossed the river.&lt;ref&gt;Falls pp. 330–1&lt;/ref&gt;

German and Ottoman squadrons of aircraft in the area included single-seater [[Albatros D.V]].a [[scout (aircraft)|scouts]] and [[AEG]] two-seaters, [[Rumpler]]s (260-h.p. Mercedes), [[LVG]]s (260-h.p. Benz) and [[Halberstädter Flugzeugwerke|Halberstadt]]s all with similar flying-speeds to the British [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack 1941, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shea's force===
[[File:60th (London) Infantry Division Jerusalem.jpeg|thumb|Infantry in the 60th (London) Division marching from Jerusalem to the Jordan Valley March 1918]]
Shea's force consisted of the 60th (London) Division, the [[Anzac Mounted Division]] (Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division), the [[Imperial Camel Corps Brigade]] including their assigned [[artillery battery]] the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Battery, with four [[BL 2.75 inch Mountain Gun]]s, (firing 12-pounder shells) the 10th Heavy Battery [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] (RGA),  a Light Armoured Car Brigade, the Army Bridging Train, Desert Mounted Corps Bridging Train and pontoon units.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 2006 p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blenkinsop224&gt;Blenkinsop 1925 p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keogh212&gt;Keogh 1955 p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Powles 1922 p. 202&quot;&gt;Powles 1922 p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Blenkinsop refers to the 60th Indian Division but the Londoners did not leave for the Western Front until after the second Transjordan attack.&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions during the concentration of Shea's force before the attack, German and Ottoman aircraft had bombed their camps while British Empire aircraft had been absent.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack 1941 pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supplies====
The attacking forces lines of communication began at the Jerusalem railway station where supplies were offloaded on to lorries and driven to Jericho and later to the Jordan River {{convert|30|mi|km}} away. The divisional trains of horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons transported to Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt. Three echelons 550 camels of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps were employed to supply the Anzac Mounted Division; one worked between Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt while the other two alternated carried one day's supplies to Amman. Two echelons of 805 camels each alternated to carry one day's supplies for the 60th (London) Division between Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt.&lt;ref&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 331–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Two possible crossing places were identified by the [[Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment|Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment]] during the month they patrolled the Jordan Valley after the capture of Jericho. These were at Ghoraniyeh and at Makhadet Hajlah (also known as Joshua's Crossing and the site of the baptism of Christ); these crossings were thought to be the only places bridges could be constructed at the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;Powles 1922 pp. 193–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore103/&gt; Nevertheless, on 6 and 7 March a company of the London [[179th (2/4th London) Brigade|179th Brigade]] from the 60th (London) Division attempted unsuccessfully to ford the river at El Mandesi {{convert|3|mi|km}} north of the site of the old stone bridge at Ghoraniyeh, which had been blown up by the retiring Ottoman Army.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 2006 pp. 163–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The 179th Brigade is referred to by Woodward as the &quot;London and Scottish 179th Brigade, 60th Division.&quot; [Woodward 2006 p. 163]&lt;/ref&gt;

====21 March====
{{main|Battle of Hijla}}
While the Anzac Mounted Division concentrated in the Talaat ed Dumm area the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade arrived in the area from Bethlehem and the 60th (London) was near the Wadi Nueiame at Ghoraniyeh with one battalion in the Wadi Kelt {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} further south at Makhadet Hijla. The 53rd Division garrisoned the Wadi el Auja. Shea planned to put three bridges across at Ghoraniyeh; a standard pontoon, a barrel pier and a footbridge and at Makhadet Hijla a cavalry steel pontoon bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falls332&quot;/&gt;

They were opposed by an Ottoman force of about 1,000 rifles, some squadrons of cavalry and six guns.&lt;ref&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

The 180th Brigade was to force both crossings before advancing up the road to the foothills. The 179th Brigade was to move up the Wadi Abu Turra track on the left of the 180th Brigade while the 181st Brigade remained in reserve at Ghoraniyeh bridgehead. The mounted troops were to cross at Makhadet Hijla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falls332&quot;/&gt;

At 15:00 hundreds of Ottoman infantry approached Ghoraniyeh while two squadrons of Ottoman cavalry approached Makhadet Hijla. At midnight on 21 March, the day the [[Spring Offensive]] was launched on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], another attempt to cross the Jordan began. Two infantry battalions from the [[180th (2/5th London) Brigade|180th Brigade]], 60th (London) Division; the [[19th London Regiment (St Pancras)|2/19th Battalion London Regiment]] prepared to swim the river and 2/18th Battalion London Regiment was sent to reinforce them as nine swimmers and Australian engineers crossed with a line at 12:30 at Makhadet Hijla and pulled a raft with six men across without opposition. Meanwhile, the 2/17th Battalion,  London Regiment attempted to launch several boats and small rafts at Ghoraniyeh under enemy fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falls333&quot;&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward164–5&quot;&gt;Woodward 2006 pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Powles194–5&quot;&gt;Powles 1922 pp. 194–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce193&quot;&gt;Bruce 2002, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Two swimmers were lost and at Ghoraniyeh and the 2/17th Battalion, London Regiment suffered severe casualties trying to get a line across the river. Later, repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to cross the river in punts and rafts. Many were drowned when Asim's German and Ottoman defenders opened fire on barges made of wood and tarpaulins stretched over framework which became waterlogged after being holed by gunfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward164–5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Powles194–5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce193&quot;/&gt; All attempts to put rafts across at Ghoraniyeh were defeated and Brigadier General Watson, commanding the 180th Brigade decided to concentrate all efforts at Makhadet Hijla ordering the [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|2/20th Battalion]] and the 2/17th Battalion London Regiments to reinforce the bridgehead there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falls333&quot;/&gt; Steel chains were eventually attached to trees and a temporary bridge constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward164–5&quot;/&gt; Working under Ottoman fire, this first bridge was established by sappers from an Australian and New Zealand engineer unit which had been training for three weeks.&lt;ref name=Hill143/&gt; By 01:30 a second pontoon bridge at Makhadet Hajlah had been finished by the Anzac Bridging Train.&lt;ref name=Powles195&gt;Powles 1922 p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridgehead established===
[[File:Bridge across Jordan River at Ghoraniyeh.jpeg|thumb|left|IWM Q12602:Pontoon bridge across the Jordan River at Ghoraniyeh near Jericho]]
By 07:45 the whole of the 2/19th Battalion London Regiment was across the Jordan River. The 2/18th Battalion London Regiment was across the Jordan by 10:00 using the cavalry pontoon bridge which the Anzac Mounted Division's field squadron had completed at 08:10 the remaining battalions of the 180th Brigade reached the right bank at Makhadet Hijla by about 13:30. Chetwode and H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught complimented the brigade on the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 333–4&lt;/ref&gt;

By nightfall on 22 March an infantry battalion had crossed the Jordan River and established a {{convert|1000|yd|m|adj=on}} bridgehead on the eastern bank. Despite being hampered by dense jungle and Ottoman machine gun fire during the day together with artillery which bombarded the slopes, an infantry brigade crossed the river and during the night the bridgehead was pushed out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powles194–5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack108&quot;&gt;Cutlack 1941 p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keogh210&gt;Keogh 1955 p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;On the night of 21/22 March a Company from the London Regiment had forced their way across the Jordan River at Makhadet Hajleh, and by the following night the whole battalion was across and at daybreak on 23 March all was clear to the east and south east for at least {{convert|500|yd|m}}.

The 181st Brigade was ordered to make another attempt to cross the Jordan River at Ghoraniyeh during the night of 22/23 March which failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falls334&quot;&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

At 04:00 on 23 March the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment attached to the 180th Brigade, began to cross the river at Makhadet Hajlah. Two squadrons pushed Ottoman units back out of the country on the eastern bank as far north as Ghoraniyeh while one squadron was sent eastwards.&lt;ref name=Powles195&gt;Powles 1922 p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; This squadron, armed with their .303 rifles and bayonets, charged into the Ottoman cavalry and overran it. Lieutenant K. J. Tait and his lead troop of 20 men intercepted 60 sabre-carrying Ottoman cavalry on a track near Qabr Mujahid. Remaining mounted the New Zealanders galloped and shot as many as 20 Ottoman soldiers capturing 7 prisoners. Tait was killed in a hand to hand duel with the Ottoman cavalry officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falls334&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles196&gt;Powles 1922 p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinloch 2007 pp. 259–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Kinloch quotes from the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment's War Diary which describes these New Zealanders &quot;using their rifles at the gallop&quot; aiming and firing their .303s at the same time as they maintained control of their horses.

Meanwhile, the two squadrons which rode north towards Ghoraniyeh were not stopped by any of the Ottoman posts they attacked, before they reached the main road.

Meanwhile the troop of 11th Squadron sent north had driven in and captured an Ottoman post of 18 soldiers with two machine guns on a position overlooking Kasr el Yehud. An attempt was made by the 4th Squadron to capture Shunet Nimrin while the 3rd Squadron succeeded in capturing the high ground overlooking Ghoraniyeh aided by Lieutenant Collins' troop which attacked mounted and captured two guns and ten prisoners. The remainder of the Squadron routed the Ottoman soldiers allowing the Royal Engineers to start work on a bridge. By nightfall artillery and supplies were crossing the river at Ghoraniyeh while the remainder of the Anzac Mounted Division crossed the river at Makhadet Hajleh. The 3rd Squadron later joined the 4th attacking Shunet Nimrin but the position was too strongly held and they were forced to retire under artillery fire in lines of troop columns at irregular internals.

===Shea's force crosses the Jordan===
At Makhadet Hajlah mounted rifle, light horse and camels crossed by a pontoon bridge; a second was also constructed, while at Ghoraniyeh, a footbridge was constructed by 16:30 on 23 March, by which time the [[1st Surrey Rifles|2/21st Battalion London Regiment]] had crossed by rafts.

The divisional headquarters of the Anzac Mounted Division together with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade marched towards Amman on the number three road, a track well to the south of the main road which passed through the village of Naaur some {{convert|3|mi|km}} to the south of Shunet Nimrin.&lt;ref name=Keogh210/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles197/&gt;&lt;ref name=Downes683/&gt; From the Jordan River at {{convert|1200|ft|m}} below sea level, the road to Naaur {{convert|16|mi|km}} away rises {{convert|4300|ft|m}}; the country was a maze of rocky hills intersected by deep ravines.

This southern route via Naaur was the most difficult with a steep grade and the track was narrow, rocky and slippery being only wide enough for horses to move in single file and many camels, their hoofs better suited to sand, frequently slipped and fell. They continued marching through the night along roads marked on maps which were soon discovered to be little more than the beds of wadis in which the heavy rain quickly made into muddy streams.

As the road to Naaur dwindled away to a track all wheels had to be left behind including most of the reserve small arms ammunition (SAA). Only four small pack mountain guns, a little reserve ammunition (two boxes of SAA to a camel) and the explosives required to demolish the viaduct and tunnels, were put on camels and pack-horses to make the trek forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward 2006 p. 165&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powles 1922 pp. 197–8&lt;/ref&gt;

After a second night's march in the cold and wet conditions moving over both bog and rock, the Anzac Mounted Division concentrated at Ain es Sir on the early morning of 26 March {{convert|6|mi|km}} west of Amman.&lt;ref name=Wavell181-2&gt;Wavell 1968 pp. 181–2&lt;/ref&gt; The weather was atrocious; sleet and heavy rain continued for almost the entire operation making the roads and tracks soft and boggy and all supplies of rations and forage had to be sent up to the advancing troops on camels and pack-horses.&lt;ref name=Cutlack108/&gt;&lt;ref name=Downes686&gt;Downes 1938 p. 686&lt;/ref&gt;

By this stage the advance had been on the march continuously for three days and nights and owing to the exhaustion of the men and horses, Chaytor, commander of the mounted division, postponed the attack on Amman until the next morning.&lt;ref name=Wavell181-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles199&gt;Powles 1922 p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; During the day a patrol of six German infantry was captured, another German approaching the lines was shot and a cavalry patrol of three men were &quot;accounted for.&quot;&lt;ref name=Powles199/&gt; The 2nd Light Horse Brigade advanced to the north of the Es Salt to Amman road capturing prisoners in the village of Suweileh and 30 German lorries were found bogged on the road from Es Salt, 21 of the derelict lorries were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Hughes140&gt;Hughes 2004 p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles200&gt;Powles 1922 p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as it was dark a special patrol of a troop of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment set out to cut the railway line to the south of Amman. They rode {{convert|10|mi|km}} there and back in darkness and pouring rain, successfully blowing up a section of railway line south of Amman. A similar group from the 2nd Light Horse Brigade attempted to wreck the line north of Amman but was unsuccessful although a two-arched bridge on the railway north of Amman was destroyed.&lt;ref name=Cutlack108/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles200/&gt;

==Battle for Amman 27–30 March==
{{main|First Battle of Amman}}
The delay in the advance of Shea's force on 26 March caused by the terrible conditions gave the Ottoman forces ample warning to consolidate their defences. Nevertheless, during the battle small gains were made which began to make an impact on the strongly entrenched German and Ottoman forces.&lt;ref name=Downes684/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruce195&gt;Bruce 2002 p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack on Amman began on 27 March and continued until 30 March while German and Ottoman reinforcements continued to steadily arrive along the unharmed Hejaz Railway from the north.&lt;ref name=Downes686/&gt; About 4,000 to 5,000 German and Ottoman soldiers with rifles and 15 guns were in position covering the railway viaduct and tunnel while another 2,000 Ottoman soldiers moved towards Es Salt from the north.&lt;ref name=Bruce194/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wavell181-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward 2006 pp. 165–6&quot;/&gt; An additional 15,000 German and Ottoman troops with 15 guns reinforced Amman, while at dawn on 27 March two British infantry battalions of the 181st Brigade, left Es Salt to reinforce the two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division (commanded by Chaytor) and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade with three mountain gun batteries, in their attack on Amman. The British infantry reinforcements were delayed near Suweileh by local fighting between Circassians and Arabs, while a [[Royal Horse Artillery]] (RHA) Battery also moved from Es Salt towards Amman with great difficulty, arriving on the last day of battle.&lt;ref name=Wavell181-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruce195/&gt;

===Casualties===
Total casualties of both infantry and mounted divisions were between 1,200 and 1,348. The 60th (London) Division suffered 476 infantry casualties including 347 wounded and the Anzac Mounted Division suffered 724 casualties including 551 wounded.&lt;ref name=Woodward168/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes 1938 p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman counterattack in the Jordan Valley===
During the afternoon of 29 March, 1,800 rifles and sabres of the 145th Regiment (46th Division) from the Ottoman Seventh Army based at Nablus, crossed the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh and attacked the left (northern) flank which was defended by the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments (1st Light Horse Brigade). This counterattack represented a very serious threat to the British lines of communication and supply to Es Salt and Amman and an infantry battalion was sent to reinforce the light horsemen.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;A similar attack took place during the [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918)#Battle on 1 May|second Transjordan operations]] when the 4th Light Horse Brigade had the job of the two regiments of the 1st Light Horse Brigade and was similarly attacked by reinforcements which crossed on 1 May at the Jisr ed Damieh on the main road from the Ottoman Seventh Army at Nablus to the Ottoman Fourth Army at Amman.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman regiment eventually advanced up the road towards Es Salt capturing the heights at Kufr Huda north of Es Salt.&lt;ref name=Keogh212/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falls349&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The counterattack by German and Ottoman forces from the direction of Nahr ez Zerka to the north of Jisr ed Damieh on the eastern side of the Jordan Valley continued to threaten Shea's and Chaytor's northern flank. This flank, held by the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments was reinforced, at the expense of the Amman attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 1999 p. 73&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falls349/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack108–9&quot;&gt;Cutlack 1941 pp. 108–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman counterattack on Es Salt===
By 30 March the 1,800 rifles and sabres of the 145th Regiment (46th Division) from the Ottoman Seventh Army based at Nablus, which had crossed the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh to attack Kufr Huda the day before, were arriving near Es Salt and threatening the occupation of the town by Shea's force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 1999 p. 73&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falls349/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack108–9&quot;&gt;Cutlack 1941 pp. 108–9&lt;/ref&gt; During the night of 30/31 March, these Ottoman reinforcements continued to push in on Es Salt.&lt;ref name=Bruce195/&gt;

===Aerial support===
Bombing raids were carried out on camps on the Jerusalem to [[Nablus]] road between [[Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya|Lubban]] and Nablus, while the Jisr ed Damieh was bombed and machine gunned several times without causing damage to the bridge but the garrison in the area was hit; between 19 and 24 March seven more attempts were made to damage the bridge without success.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack 1941 p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

During this Transjordan operation, aircraft continuously flew over and reported progress; on 22 and 24 March Ottoman units in the Wady Fara region were seen to be active, as was the Nablus base camp, and infantry and transport were seen marching towards Khurbet Ferweh and the Jisr ed Damieh. On 24 March a large troop-train at Lubin station on the [[Hejaz Railway]] south of Amman was attacked by aircraft with machine-guns; 700 rounds were fired into the enemy troops.&lt;ref name=Cutlack109-10&gt;Cutlack 1941 pp. 109–10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical support===
The total time taken to evacuate to Jericho from the front line was about 24 hours and the distance {{convert|45|mi|km}} with a further three hours on to Jerusalem. Wounded were carried on light stretchers or blankets from the front line to regimental aid posts which were established about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} in the rear. Advanced dressing stations were established about {{convert|3|mi|km}} behind these aid posts; sand carts making the journey in three to six hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downes684&quot;/&gt; Between some dressing stations and the nearest clearing station on the Es Salt to Amman road, wounded had to be transported {{convert|10|mi|km}} on cacolet camels or strapped to their horses. A divisional collecting station was established {{convert|6|mi|km}} further back at Birket umm Amud to which wounded were carried in cacolet camels; the journey taking between six and seven hours. Horse-drawn ambulances then took wounded back to the Jordan Valley. In the rear of these divisional collecting stations, the road through Suweileh and Es Salt to El Howeij {{convert|5|mi|km}} was passable by wheeled transport and the remainder of the journey to Jericho was in motor ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;Downes 1938 pp. 684–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles211-2&gt;Powles 1922 pp. 211–2&lt;/ref&gt;

With their equipment carried on pack-horses and pack-camels, the mobile sections of the field ambulances along with 35 cacolet camels for each ambulance, followed the attacking force to Es Salt and Amman. Their motor ambulances, ambulance wagons and sand carts remained near Jericho ready to transport wounded from the receiving station at Ghoraniyeh to the main dressing station west of Jericho. Here the Desert Mounted Corps Operating Unit and consulting surgeon were attached. Wounded were then sent back to the two casualty clearing stations in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Downes 1938 pp. 682–3&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Jordan Valley it was a {{convert|50|mi|km}} ride in a motor ambulance over the mountains of Judea to the hospital railway train, followed by {{convert|200|mi|km}} train ride to hospital in Cairo, though some of the worst cases were accommodated in the hospitals in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Powles211-2/&gt;

===Supplies===
[[File:IWM Q12606.jpeg|thumb|left|Egyptian Camel Transport Corps crossing pontoon bridge at Ghoraniyeh March 1918|alt=Many fully loaded camels crossing bridge built on square end boats; steep sided mountains in background]]
Motor lorries supplied Jericho from Jerusalem but from Jericho to Amman the Anzac Mounted Divisional Train and [[Egyptian Camel Transport Corps]] transported supplies on camels and pack horses, mules or donkeys. They covered {{convert|24|mi|km}} a day from the foot of the mountains to the troops at Amman with the severe weather and slippery mountain tracks causing many casualties to camels and drivers. The total distance covered by lorries, horses and camels, from railhead to Jerusalem and on to the men in the firing line,  was {{convert|86|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Powles 1922 pp. 210–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 2,000 camels used on convoy duties 100 were killed in action and 92 had to be destroyed because of injuries received during the operations. During the retreat from Amman many of the camels had been overloaded.&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsop 1925 p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Retreat 31 March&amp;nbsp;– 2 April===

|quote=It was, in its way, one of the most daring exploits of the war. A weak division, aided by Australian mounted troops, crossed the Jordan and, cut off from the rest of our army, went clean through the Turks for a distance of forty miles, cut the railway and returned with all their wounded and hundreds of prisoners [but their dead had to be left behind]. Their jumping–off point was a thousand feet below sea level, the railway was four thousand feet above them. There were no roads through the mountains and it rained almost the whole time. They got there in forty–eight hours. When they reached Es Salt the inhabitants turned out en bloc to greet them, standing on the roofs of their houses and loosing off rifles into the air. |source=N. C. Sommers Down (Lieutenant/Captain Gordon Highlanders); 15 May 1918 diary entry during convalescence when he shared a tent with another officer wounded in the 'romantic Amman stunt' about which there was 'too little in the papers'.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers Diary 1919 15 May&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

By 30 March Chaytor's force had pushed infantry in the Ottoman 48th Division back into Amman and after desperate fighting the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade had entered the town {{convert|2|mi|km}} west of the station, but German and Ottoman machine guns positioned on the hills beyond were too strong and all efforts to dislodge enemy forces from the Hejaz Railway's Amman station failed.&lt;ref name=Erickson2001_195/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack108–9&quot;/&gt;

It was considered that any further attempts to capture the Amman Railway Station would incur unacceptable losses and the decision to withdraw was therefore made. Allenby reported to the War Office on 31 March that {{convert|5|mi|km}} of railway track and culverts had been destroyed south of Amman Station and a bridge blown up, and that the object of the raid had been achieved by cutting the Hejaz Railway.&lt;ref name=Hughes140/&gt; He took this decision despite the principal objective of destroying the large viaduct at Amman, had not been achieved. But it was increasingly less likely that it could be as Chaytor's force began to have difficulty defending itself from strong German and Ottoman counter-attacks.&lt;ref name=Downes686/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles211&gt;Powles 1922 p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Chaytor's force was therefore ordered to withdraw to Es Salt.&lt;ref name=Hughes140/&gt;

When darkness fell on 30 March, the front line troops received the order to retreat and an infantryman concluded: &quot;none of us sorry to leave behind forever, we hope, a nightmare of a most terrible nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=Woodward168&gt;Infantryman Benbow quoted in Woodward 2006 p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;It has been suggests the reasons why the British units decided to withdraw from Amman on 31 March were unclear; that the reason given, that substantial Ottoman reserves had been brought up was, &quot;not at all true&quot; and that the abandonment of this important objective is &quot;not easily explained.&quot; [Erickson 2001, p. 195 and Erickson 2007, pp. 130–1]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evacuation of wounded====
[[File:Camels crossing the Jordan River.jpg|thumb|left|2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance crossing the Jordan River at Ghoraniyeh on their return|alt=Camels being led across pontoon bridge]]
The retirement from Amman started on 30 March with the wounded beginning to be sent back to the Jordan Valley. The wounded moved along the main road via Es Salt, but Es Salt was under attack from German and Ottoman units from the north west (the direction of the road from Nablus via Jisr ed Damieh) and the only bridge across the Jordan River not destroyed by a {{convert|9|ft|m}} flood was at Ghoraniyeh.&lt;ref name=Downes686/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powles211-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutlack109&gt;Cutlack 1941 p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

By 31 March there were over 240 wounded in the divisional collecting stations such as Birket umm Amud {{convert|10.5|mi|km}} from the front line. All available means including sand carts sent by infantry in the 60th (London) Division, were employed and these wounded were on their way by the evening; about 50 of them walking. The last convoy of wounded which left Amman at 23:00 found 20 camels carrying wounded which had begun their journey six hours earlier, bogged and exhausted at Suweileh. Nine of them were unable to move and ambulance personnel were left to attend to the wounded throughout the night. By daylight, light horse troopers warned them that the Ottoman cavalry was close. Five camels managed to continue but the remaining four were too exhausted. Of the eight wounded, six were placed on horses, but two who appeared to be mortally wounded were left behind when Ottoman cavalry got between the covering party and the ambulance men and began firing on the group. All escaped but the two seriously wounded and three men of the 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance mounted on donkeys who were taken prisoner. Only one of these men survived to the end of the war; the other two dying in captivity.&lt;ref name=Powles211-2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes 1938 pp. 684–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Its not known what happened to the bodies of Australian light horsemen, British infantry and New Zealand riflemen who died during the attack on Amman. During the withdrawal following the 2nd Transjordan attack at the end of April, just a few weeks later, the infantry dead from the 60th (London) Division were removed in wagons for burial.[Woodward 2006 p. 179]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Refugees====
[[File:Bedouin refugees 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Bedouin refugees from Es Salt crossing a pontoon bridge over the Jordan River]]
From Es Salt, thousands of Armenian and Bedouin refugees and others joined the withdrawing columns carrying their belongings on their backs or pushing them in carts, some of the aged and footsore given a lift in the horse-drawn limber wagons.&lt;ref&gt;Berrie 1949 p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1955 p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Withdrawal====
The front lines were still engaged when the withdrawal began. It was necessary, firstly to move the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade back from Hill 3039, across the Wadi Amman. They received their orders at 18:00 to withdraw to the cross road at the western end of the plateau just above the village of Ain es Sir. By 23:00 all wounded had been started on their journey back to the Jordan Valley and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade commenced to recross the Wadi Amman at midnight; reaching the cross roads at 04:00 on 31 March.&lt;ref name=Powles211-2/&gt;

An outpost line was set up across the country between Ain es Sir and Amman and the whole day was spent in concentrating Chaytor's and Shea's force&amp;nbsp;– mounted troops, infantry, camels and camel transport; and in getting all camels, both camel brigade and Egyptian Camel Transport Corps down the mountains. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the Somerset Battery took the Es Salt road while the remainder of the force, including the infantry, withdrew by the Wadi Es Sir track, up which the New Zealand Brigade had advanced.&lt;ref name=Powles211-2/&gt;

All day long and all the next night a long line of weary camels, horses and men slowly stumbled, slipped and fell, down the mountain track which descends some {{convert|4000|ft|m}} in {{convert|8|mi|km}}. It was well after daylight on the morning of 1 April, before the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade; the rearguard was able to start retiring again, while being fully occupied in holding off advanced German and Ottoman troops.&lt;ref name=Powles211-2/&gt;

The Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment had regained its 6th Squadron which had been detached to the infantry division; the 60th (London) Division, and was ordered to cover the rear of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. German and Ottomans attacks on this rearguard were held off until the regiment filed down through the village of Ain es Sir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinloch 2007 p. 277&quot;&gt;Kinloch 2007 p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Powles 1922 pp. 212–3&quot;&gt;Powles 1922 pp. 212–3&lt;/ref&gt;

At 07:45 on 1 April as the rearguard of Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment passed through the village the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron was attacked by Circassians who suddenly opened fire from a mill and adjacent caves, from houses and from behind rocks on the nearby hills. Firing at very close range with a variety of firearms they wounded men and horses; horses rearing up, bolted, screaming joined the numerous riderless horses galloping across the hillsides. Remnants of the 2nd Squadron galloped clear of the village, dismounted and counter-attacked with the other two squadrons attacking from the ridges above the village.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;While fighting on foot, one quarter of the riflemen were holding the horses; a brigade would then be equivalent in rifle strength to an infantry battalion. [Preston 1921 p.168]&lt;/ref&gt; They rushed the mill and its occupants were killed. No prisoners were taken; the 2nd Squadron suffered 18 casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinloch 2007 p. 277&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Powles 1922 pp. 212–3&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|About 13:00 the Jordan Valley came into sight and a halt was made to distribute rations and forage which had been brought forward to meet the New Zealanders. The sun came out and the wind died away and an hour later they were riding down through flowers up to the horses' knees. All was peace and warmth and quiet, making it difficult to think that a few short hours before, the winds were raging, rain falling, and a bitter battle in progress.|C. Guy Powles, Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General, Anzac Mounted Division&lt;ref&gt;Powles 1922 pp. 213–4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Return to the Jordan===
The withdrawal across the Jordan River was completed by the evening of 2 April leaving bridgeheads at Ghoraniye and Makhadet Hajlah.&lt;ref name=Cutlack109/&gt; The infantry and mounted forces had marched and fought almost continuously in the mud and rain for ten days and had suffered almost as much in both the advance and retreat.&lt;ref name=Woodward168/&gt; Shea's force had expended 587,338 rounds of small-arms ammunition (SAA), brought back four field guns, 700 prisoners including 20 officers and 595 other ranks along with 10 machine guns two automatic rifles, 207 rifles and 248,000 rounds of SAA.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;There may have been as many as 1,000 prisoners captured and brought back to the Jordan Valley. [Wavell 1968 p. 182]&lt;/ref&gt; The German and Ottoman forces abandoned two travelling field cookers, 26 motor lorries, five motor cars and many horse-drawn wagons on the Amman road and an Ottoman aircraft was captured on the Hejaz railway.&lt;ref name=Hughes140/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill 1978 p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powles 1922 p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anzac Mounted Division at Talat ed Dumm.jpeg|thumb|Officers' bivouacs, headquarters Anzac Mounted Division at Talat ed Dumm]]

Asim launched a pursuit of the British by the 24th Assault Company with the 8th and 9th Cavalry Regiment (3rd Cavalry Division) and on 4 April German and Ottoman counterattacks by the 24th Assault Company, infantry in the 24th Division's 3rd Battalion and the 145th Infantry Regiment, began.&lt;ref name=Erickson134/&gt; After another unsuccessful counterattack by the Ottoman Army on 11 April they began to consolidate their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson 2007 p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; About this time the Ottoman Seventh Army formed a provisional cavalry regiment by combining the cavalry companies which had previously been attached to several infantry divisions; these were the 11th, 24th, 48th and 53rd Divisions.&lt;ref name=Erickson134/&gt;

Designed to be a surprise raid by mounted troops, the movements of Shea's force in the difficult terrain and weather, had proved to be too slow and restricted and the element of surprise was lost. The attack did, however, force the recall of a German and Ottoman expedition to Tafileh; attempts to maintain a permanent garrison there, were abandoned.&lt;ref name=Wavell_182&gt;Wavell 1968 p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong incursion by Shea's and Chaytor's forces materially helped Feisal's force; the Ottoman 4th Army withdrew part of its garrison from Maan to help defend Amman just as Feisal began his attack there.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 2002 pp. 195–6&lt;/ref&gt; These major troop movements; the recall of the Tafileh expedition and the partial withdrawal from Maan, helped strengthen the operations of Feisal's Arabs and the threat to the Ottoman lines of communication east of the Jordan, compelling the Ottoman army to make a permanent increase to their forces in this area.&lt;ref name=Wavell_182/&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;These increased numbers of troops stationed east of the Jordan were made at the expense of Ottoman forces on the Mediterranean coastal plain. [Bruce 2002 p. 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

Large new Ottoman camps were established to support the growing lower Jordan defences which included a large garrison at Shunet Nimrin. These troops moved from Nablus by the Jenin railway and then by road down the Wady Fara to the Jisr ed Damieh, where the ford was replaced by a pontoon bridge. It remained an important line of communication between the 7th Army at Nablus in the west and the 4th Army in the eastern sector.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack 1941 p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time since the [[Second Battle of Gaza]] in April 1917, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force had been defeated; both Shea and Chetwode had opposed the attack on Amman at that time of year, believing the attacking force to be too small.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 2006 pp. 168–9&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a second unsuccessful assault by one infantry and two mounted divisions, into the hills of Moab to [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918)|Es Salt]] followed just a few weeks later at the end of April. It has been suggested that these two unsuccessful operations convinced the Ottoman Army to expect more attacks to be made in the same area by the same troops, while the breakthrough [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|attack]] in September 1918 occurred on the Mediterranean coast.&lt;ref name=Cutlack105/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis 2008 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The third Transjordan attack by Chaytor's force succeeded in capturing Amman a few days after Allenby launched Megiddo.&lt;/ref&gt;
