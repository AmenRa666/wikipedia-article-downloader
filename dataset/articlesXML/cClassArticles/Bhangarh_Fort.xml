The '''Bhangarh Fort''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]/[[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]]: भानगढ़ दुर्ग) is a 17th-century [[fort]] built in the [[Rajasthan]] state of [[India]].&lt;ref name=haunt&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/slideshow/top-10-most-haunted-places-in-india_39.html|title=Bhangarh Fort, Rajasthan|accessdate=21 July 2013|publisher=Zee News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by [[Man Singh I]] (one of the navratans of Akbar's court) for his younger brother [[Madho Singh I]]. It was named by Madho Singh after his grandfather Man Singh or Bhan Singh.A new village of [[Bhangarh]] with a population of 1,306 in 200 households has developed outside the limits of the fort as there is fear of ghosts haunting the old city. The fort and its precincts are well preserved.{{Sfn|Singh|2010|p=188}}&lt;ref name=Census2001&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/PopulationFinder/View_Village_Population.aspx?pcaid=856194&amp;category=VILLAGE | title=View Population | accessdate=21 July 2013|publisher=Office of the Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Bhangarh Fort is located on the border of the [[Sariska Tiger Reserve|Sariska Reserve]] in the [[Aravali range]] of hills in [[Alwar district]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.holidify.com/blog/bhangarh-fort-haunted/|title=Known As The Most Haunted Place In India, Bhangarh Fort Is Not Just Another Place To Visit|date=2015-05-30|website=Holidify|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Rajasthan.&lt;ref name=Place&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/bhangarh-fort-most-haunted-place-india-080410692.html|title= Bhangarh Fort: The 'most haunted' place in India?|accessdate=21 July 2013|publisher=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest village is Golakabaas.{{Sfn|Singh|2010|p=188}} The fort is situated at the foot of the hills on sloping terrain. The ruins of the King’s palace are located on the lower slopes of the hills; trees surround the pond area and a natural stream falls into the pond within the premises of the palace.{{Sfn|Rajputana|1880|pp=289-90}}

The fort is located {{Convert|235|km}} from [[Delhi]] and the approach to the entrance gate of the fort in the last {{Convert|2|km}} stretch of the road is an unpaved road.&lt;ref name=Place/&gt; The fort is {{Convert|20|mi}} from [[Thana Ghazi]].{{Sfn|Rajputana|1880|pp=289-90}}

==Legends==
[[File:Haunted-bhangarh-fort-rajasthan.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Bhangarh Fort]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Images of Bhangarh Fort&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tripoto.com/trip/Bhangarh-Fort-Story | title=The Bhangarh Fort Story | accessdate=26 February 2016|publisher=Tripoto}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two legends narrated to the history of the fort city, which is reported to be haunted, and no one is allowed to remain in the precincts of the fort at night, per a notice board put up by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] at the entrance.&lt;ref name=haunt/&gt;

One version of the legend is that a [[sadhu]] named ''[[Baba Balak Nath]]'' lived within the fort area. It was his injunction that any houses built in the precincts of the fort should not be taller than his house, and if the shadow of any such house fell on his house, it would result in destruction of the fort town.{{Sfn|Stern|2011|p=7}}

In another version, ''[[N.K. SINHAI]]'', the [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who was adept in [[black magic]] fell in love with ''[[Ratnavati]]'', the princess of Bhangarh who was very beautiful and had suitors to marry her from many royal families of the country. One day the princess, 18 years of age, went shopping with her friends and was buying [[Ittar]] (scent). The wizard saw this and replaced the scent with a love potion in order to ensnare the princess. He offered the potion to her so that she would take a liking to him and marry him.{{Sfn|Stern|2011|p=7}}&lt;ref name=Souls&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hindi.oneindia.in/news/2011/07/26/bhangarh-most-haunted-place-india-aid0154.html|title=किला जहां सूरज ढलते ही जाग जाती हैं आत्‍माएं Ravi|language=Hindi|date=11 May 2013|accessdate=21 July 2013|publisher= Greynium Information Technologies Pvt. Ltd; Oneindia.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the princess saw through the wizard's trickery, and when he offered her the bowl of potion, she threw it onto a big boulder nearby.  As a result, the boulder started rolling down towards the wizard and crushed him. Before he died, he cursed that Bhangarh would be destroyed soon and no one would be able to live within its precincts. Subsequently, Bhangarh Fort was invaded by the [[Mughal Army|Mughals]] from the north and the city was surrounded and sacked; 10,000 people lived in the fort city at that time. All the people in the fort, including the princess, were killed. The present state of the fort is attributed to the curse of the wizard and people believe the ghosts in the fort are that of the princess and the wizard.
{{Sfn|Stern|2011|p=7}}&lt;ref name=Souls/&gt; Since that day, it is believed that paranormal activities take place here during the night. Some deaths have been reported due to these paranormal activities, too. There are sayings that some of the people's spirit surrounds the boundary of the fort as no one can enter the premises. The princess's spirit has been forcefully abducted by the wizard. Since then, it is believed to be one of the real spooky attractions in Rajasthan.&lt;ref name= &quot;Haunted Bhangarh Fort in Rajasthan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fearandyou.in/2016/02/haunted-places-rajasthan.html | title=Haunted Places in Rajasthan | accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=Fear And You}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Entering through the MAIN gate of the completely ruined fort city - now called the &quot;Bhoot Bangla&quot; meaning &quot;House of Ghosts&quot; - gives an eerie feeling that is not proved. Within the fort, at the main entry, one can find temples, palaces and [[haveli]]s. In addition, there are four more gates of entry to the fort – the ''Lahori Gate'', the ''Ajmeri Gate'', the ''Phulbari Gate'' and the ''Delhi Gate''.  At the entrance of the main gate, are many [[Hindu temple]]s such as ''Hanuman Temple'', ''Gopinath Temple'', ''Someshwar Temple'', ''Keshav Rai Temple'', ''Mangla Devi Temple'', ''Ganesh Temple'' and ''Navin Temple''.&lt;ref name=Place/&gt; The Gopinath Temple is built above a 14&amp;nbsp;ft raised plinth and yellow stones are used for the exquisite carvings of the temple.&lt;ref name=Temple&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templenet.com/encwest1.html|title=The Templenet Encyclopedia - Temples of Western India|work=Gopinath Temple|accessdate=21 July 2013|publisher=Temple Net.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residence of the priest called the ''Purohitji Ki Haveli'' is located in the precincts of the temple complex. Next in order is the ''Nachan Ki Haveli'' (dancer's palace) and ''Jauhari Bazar'' (market place) followed by the Gopinath Temple. The Royal Palace is located at the extreme end of the fort’s limits.&lt;ref name=Place/&gt;

The temples dedicated to [[Hanuman]] and [[Shiv Mahadev]] are very elegant but need to be preserved. However, they are built in the style of [[cenotaphs]] rather than temples. [[Jhirri marble]] has been used in their construction but presently covered by white wash. The Muslim tomb found outside the gate of the fort is reported to be that of one of the sons of King [[Hari Singh]].{{Sfn|Rajputana|1880|pp=289-90}}
