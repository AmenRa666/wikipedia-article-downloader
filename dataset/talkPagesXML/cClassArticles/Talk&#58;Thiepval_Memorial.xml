Is Thiepval covered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission? If so it could be added to this category. I was quite surprised not to see it there. 

[[User:Soarhead77|Soarhead77]] 21:16, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

Having done some research I find that it is, so I've added this category.

[[User:Soarhead77|Soarhead77]] 21:01, 18 July 2007 (UTC)

Nothing on the Ulstermen who died in Thiepval Wood? [[Special:Contributions/86.40.211.212|86.40.211.212]] ([[User talk:86.40.211.212|talk]]) 15:13, 22 November 2008 (UTC)

==Correction needed?==
In the paragraph section headed 'Anglo-French memorial', I notice it says ''the British Commonwealth graves are rectangular and made of white stone''.  I suspect this inaccurate as the burials are in earthen graves.  Should this be rephrased as:
*''the British Commonwealth graves are rectangular and'' the headstones ''made of white stone'', OR
*''the British Commonwealth graves are'' marked by headstones that ''are rectangular and made of white stone''?

== During World War II ==

I found some cool anecdotes about this memorial's liberation during World War II: http://greatwarphotos.com/2012/10/25/battlefields-in-ww2-thiepval-memorial-liberated-1944/

Does any of this fall as citable work for Wikipedia? Can any of the pictures be used? I've emailed the author with a link to this page; hopefully he will weigh in as well.

Tidied citations as one had red on.[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 21:00, 27 December 2014 (UTC)

== Names of the sub-battles on the pillars ==
There are only 13 names of battles listed on the 16 pillars. I think the others should be [[Battle of Fromelles|Fromelles]], Gommecourt and Serres (by compare the lists on the [[Battle of the Somme|wikipedia page for the battle]] and [http://www.greatwar.co.uk/somme/memorial-thiepval.htm#1916battles The UK website]. Can anybody comfirm this? [[User:Vauxhall Bridgefoot|Vauxhall Bridgefoot]] ([[User talk:Vauxhall Bridgefoot|talk]]) 10:16, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
:I took photos of all 16 stone wreaths, see [[:commons:category:Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme|this category on Commons]]. I added 16 battles [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thiepval_Memorial&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=385270119&amp;oldid=342452788 here], but someone obviously removed some of them. Comparing my edit back in 2010 with the current list what has been removed is the initial entry of &quot;Somme 1916&quot; (I can understand how that can be confusing) and the final two entries for [[Battle of Miraumont|Miraumont]] and [[Battle of Bapaume|Bapaume]]. OK, I found the edit that removed the last two, it was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thiepval_Memorial&amp;diff=445577115&amp;oldid=445575281 here] in August 2011. And the 'Somme 1916' entry was removed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thiepval_Memorial&amp;diff=440878169&amp;oldid=419676369 here] a bit earlier (July 2011). What would you suggest is best to do here, [[User:Vauxhall Bridgefoot|Vauxhall Bridgefoot]]? [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 16:28, 24 July 2016 (UTC)

For the record:
*[[Battle of the Somme|Somme 1916]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 8.JPG|image]]) [presumably the first day, but this could be covered by 'Battle of Albert', or simply a roundel for the whole campaign from July to November rather than a specific battle?]
*[[Battle of the Ancre Heights|Ancre Heights]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 16.JPG|image]]) [1 October – 11 November 1916]
*[[Battle of the Ancre|Ancre]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 13.JPG|image]]) [13–18 November 1916]
*[[Battle of Albert (1916)|Albert]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 6.JPG|image]]) [1–13 July 1916]
*[[Attacks on High Wood|High Wood]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 11.JPG|image]]) [14 July – 15 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Delville Wood|Delville Wood]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 12.JPG|image]]) [14 July – 3 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Morval|Morval]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 2.JPG|image]]) [25–28 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 1.JPG|image]]) [15–22 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Pozières|Pozieres Wood]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 9.JPG|image]]) [23 July – 3 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Bazentin Ridge|Bazentin Ridge]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 10.JPG|image]]) [14–17 July 1916]
*[[Battle of Thiepval Ridge|Thiepval Ridge]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 14.JPG|image]]) [26–28 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Transloy Ridges|Transloy Ridges]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 15.JPG|image]]) [1–18 October 1916]
*[[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 3.JPG|image]]) [9 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Guillemont|Guillemont]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 4.JPG|image]]) [3–6 September 1916]
*[[Battle of Miraumont|Miraumont]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 5.JPG|image]]) [There is an 'Action of Miraumont', also known as the Battle of Boom Ravine, but that is 17–18 February 1917. There was also an action at Boom Ravine in the closing stages of the Battle of the Ancre. But given that the Thiepval Memorial covers the missing from July 1915 to February 1918, it is possible that the roundels cover more than just the Somme battles. This roundel might refer to [[Operation Alberich]].]
*[[Battle of Bapaume|Bapaume]] ([[:File:Thiepval Memorial battle roundels 7.JPG|image]]) [Again, here, this roundel may refer to either or both of the battles of Bapaume, I've gone and looked up the precise dates given by the CWGC, and it is those missing &quot;who died in the Somme sector before 20 March 1918&quot;, so it is not absolutely clear why Bapaume is one of the roundels.]
I've added dates above and links to the images. I have no idea why [http://www.greatwar.co.uk/somme/memorial-thiepval.htm#battles1916 this section of that website] mentions Gommecourt and Serre. Fromelles was a major offensive, but has its own memorial (see [[V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial]]).  [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 16:35, 24 July 2016 (UTC)

Looking into this a bit more, I've tried to clarify this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thiepval_Memorial&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=731331868&amp;oldid=728635360 here]. It should be possible to confirm this from an authoritative source, and I will try and do that. [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 17:29, 24 July 2016 (UTC)

Looks like you are much better placed to have an opinion on this than me [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]]! Good job on the update, I think that clarifies it nicely. Wouldn't do to have three pillars missing, it would have made the whole monument wonky.
