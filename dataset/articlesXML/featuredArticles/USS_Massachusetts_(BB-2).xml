'''USS ''Massachusetts'' (BB-2)''' was an {{sclass-|Indiana|battleship}} and the second [[United States Navy]] ship comparable to foreign battleships of the time.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=67}} Authorized in 1890 and commissioned six years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship class also pioneered the use of an [[Pre-dreadnought battleship#Armament|intermediate battery]]. She was designed for [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defense]] and as a result her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean.

''Massachusetts'' served in the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898) as part of the [[Flying Squadron (US Navy)|Flying Squadron]] and took part in the blockades of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]]. She missed the decisive [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] after steaming to [[Guantánamo Bay]] the night before to resupply coal. After the war she served with the [[North Atlantic Squadron]], performing training maneuvers and gunnery practice. During this period she suffered an explosion in an 8-inch [[gun turret]], killing nine, and [[ship grounding|ran aground]] twice, requiring several months of repair both times. She was decommissioned in 1906 for modernization.

Although considered obsolete in 1910, the battleship was recommissioned and used for annual cruises for [[midshipmen]] during the summers and otherwise laid up in the [[reserve fleet]] until her decommissioning in 1914. In 1917 she was recommissioned to serve as a training ship for gun crews during [[World War I]]. She was decommissioned for the final time in March 1919 under the name ''Coast Battleship Number 2'' so that her name could be reused for {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-54|0}}. In 1921 she was [[scuttled]] in shallow water off the coast of [[Pensacola, Florida]] and then used as a target for experimental artillery. The ship was never scrapped and in 1956 it was declared the property of the state of Florida. Since 1993 the wreck has been a [[Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve]] and is included in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It serves as an artificial reef and diving spot.

== Design and construction ==

{{Main article|Indiana-class battleship}}
[[File:Engines of USS Massachusetts (BB-2).jpg | thumb|left | upright | One of ''Massachusetts''{{'}} triple-expansion engines]] 
''Massachusetts'' was constructed from a modified version of a design drawn up by a policy board in 1889 for a short-range battleship. The original design was part of an ambitious naval construction plan to build 33 battleships and 167 smaller ships. The [[United States Congress]] saw the plan as an attempt to end the U.S. [[United States non-interventionism|policy of isolationism]] and did not approve it, but a year later approved funding for three coast defense battleships, which would become ''Massachusetts'' and her sister ships {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|2}} and {{USS|Oregon|BB-3|2}}.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=24–25}} The ships were limited to coastal defense due to their moderate endurance, relatively small [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] and low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], or distance from the deck to the water, which limited seagoing capability.{{sfn|Gardiner|Lambert|1992|p=121}} They were however heavily armed and armored; ''Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships'' describes their design as &quot;attempting too much on a very limited displacement.&quot;{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=140}}

Construction of the ships was authorized on 30 June 1890 and the contract for ''Massachusetts''—not including guns and armor—was awarded to [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]] of [[Philadelphia]], who offered to build it for $3,020,000.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1 December 1890}} The total cost of the ship was almost twice as high, approximately $6,000,000.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=69}} The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates and guns caused a delay.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|12 March 1896}} Her [[keel]] was laid down on 25 June 1891{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=69}} and she was launched two years later on 10 June 1893. The launching ceremony was attended by thousands of people, including [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Hilary A. Herbert]] and commander [[George Dewey]].{{sfn|''The New York Times''|10 June 1893}} Her preliminary [[sea trial]] did not take place until March 1896 because of the delays in armor and gun deliveries. At this point ''Massachusetts'' was almost complete,{{sfn|''The New York Times''|12 March 1896}} and her official trial was held a month later.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|26 April 1896}}

== Service history ==

=== Early career ===

''Massachusetts'' was commissioned on 10 June 1896 with [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Frederick Rodgers]] in command. She had her [[shakedown cruise]] between August and November 1896, followed by an overhaul at the [[New York Navy Yard]]. In February 1897 she made a short voyage to [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. The battleship departed New York again in May for [[Boston]], where a celebration in her honor was held. For the next ten months the warship participated in training maneuvers with the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] off the coast of [[Florida]] and visited several major ports on the American [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]]. On 27 March 1898, she was ordered to [[Hampton Roads]] to join the [[Flying Squadron (US Navy)|Flying Squadron]] under [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Winfield Scott Schley]] for the blockade of [[Cuba]].{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}}

=== Spanish–American War ===

[[File:USS Massachusetts (BB-2), Antonio Jacobsen.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of USS ''Massachusetts'']]

After the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]] the Flying Squadron steamed to [[Key West]]. There Schley met with [[Rear Admiral]] [[William T. Sampson|Sampson]], who had just returned from the bombardment of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. They discussed the possible locations of the Spanish squadron under [[Admiral]] [[Pascual Cervera y Topete|Cervera]], and Schley was sent to the harbor of [[Cienfuegos, Cuba]] to look for Cervera.{{sfn|Graham|Schley|1902|p=93–94}} Schley arrived off Cienfuegos on 22 May and took several days to establish that Cervera's ships were not in the harbor. The squadron then proceeded to Santiago de Cuba, the only other port on the southern coast of Cuba large enough for the Spanish ships,{{sfn|Graham|Schley|1902|pp=116, 120}} arriving after several delays on 29 May.{{sfn|Graham|Schley|1902|pp=141–162}} On arrival, the {{Ship|Spanish cruiser|Cristóbal Colón}} was visible from outside the harbor entrance, confirming that the Spanish fleet was in the harbor.{{sfn|Graham|Schley|1902|pp=164–167}} Schley blockaded the harbor and informed Sampson, who arrived with his own squadron on 1 June{{sfn|DANFS Indiana (BB-1)}} and assumed overall command.{{sfn|Graham|Schley|1902|p=203}}

During the next month ''Massachusetts'' took part in the blockade of Santiago, occasionally bombarding the harbor forts.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}} On the night of 2–3 July she and the two [[cruiser]]s {{USS|New Orleans|CL-22|2}} and {{USS|Newark|C-1|2}} left the blockade to load coal in [[Guantanamo Bay]].{{sfn|Graham|Schley|1902|pp=299–300}} This caused her to miss the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] on 3 July, in which the Spanish fleet attempted to break through the blockade and was completely destroyed.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|26 July 1898}} The next day the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and ''Texas'' fired at the disarmed {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Reina Mercedes}}, which was being scuttled by the Spanish in an attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.{{sfn|Graham|Schley|1902|pp=471–472}} ''Massachusetts'' was then sent to Puerto Rico to support the American occupation until she steamed home to New York on 1 August, arriving on 20 August.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}}

=== Post Spanish–American War ===

After a quick overhaul in [[drydock]], ''Massachusetts'' was attempting to leave [[New York Harbor]] on 10 December 1898 when she struck [[Diamond Reef]], flooding five of her forward compartments. She was forced to return to the navy yard, where she was placed in drydock again for repairs which took around three months.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|11 December 1898}}{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1 April 1899}} For a year ''Massachusetts'' served with the North Atlantic Squadron, visiting various cities on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}} In May 1900, she and ''Indiana'' were placed in reserve as the navy had an acute officer shortage and needed to put the new {{sclass-|Kearsarge|battleship|0}} and {{sclass-|Illinois|battleship}}s into commission.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|14 April 1900}} The battleships were reactivated the following month as an experiment in how quickly this could be achieved,{{sfn|''The New York Times''|6 June 1900}} and ''Massachusetts'' returned to service with the North Atlantic Squadron.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}}

In March 1901 the battleship grounded again, this time in the harbor of [[Pensacola, Florida]],{{sfn|''The New York Times''|25 March 1901}} but the ship was able to continue her trip.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|23 March 1901}} A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an 8-inch turret killed nine crew members. They were the first fatalities aboard a United States battleship since the sinking of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|''Maine'']].{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=56}} Another accident happened in August of that year, when ''Massachusetts'' grounded on a rock in [[Frenchman Bay]], Maine. The ship was seriously damaged and had to be repaired in drydock.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|23 August 1903}} In December 1904 yet another lethal accident took place aboard ''Massachusetts'': three men were killed and several others badly burned when a broken [[gasket]] caused steam to fill the boiler room.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|15 December 1904}} On 8 January 1906 the battleship was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to her sister ship ''Indiana'', which had completed a three-year modernization. ''Massachusetts'' now received the same upgrades,{{sfn|''The New York Times''|8 January 1906}} including twelve [[3&quot;/50 caliber gun]] single-purpose guns to replace the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns, new [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler]]s, counterweights to balance her main turrets, a [[lattice mast]] and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=62}}

On 2 May 1910 ''Massachusetts'' was placed in reduced commission so she could be used for the annual [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] [[midshipmen]] summer cruise.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}} Despite her modernizations the battleship was now regarded as &quot;obsolete and worthless, even for the second line of defense&quot; by Secretary of the Navy [[George von Lengerke Meyer]].{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1 December 1911}} She saw little use other than summer cruises and was transferred to the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] when it was formed in 1912.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|4 February 1912}} After a quick trip to New York for a [[Presidential Fleet Review]] in October 1912, the warship returned to Philadelphia and stayed there until she was decommissioned on 23 May 1914.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}}

=== World War I and beyond ===

[[File:USS Massachusetts (BB-2) sinking 1921.jpg|thumb|alt=A sinking stripped battleship seen from a birds eyes view|''Massachusetts'' being scuttled off the coast of [[Pensacola]]]]

After the United States entered World War I ''Massachusetts'' was recommissioned for the final time on 9 June 1917. She was used by [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] gun crews for gunnery training in [[Block Island Sound]] until 27 May 1918. The battleship was then redeployed to serve as a heavy gun target practice ship near [[Chesapeake Bay]] until the end of World War I. ''Massachusetts'' returned to Philadelphia on 16 February 1919. She was decommissioned for the final time on 31 March 1919, after being re-designated “Coast Battleship Number 2” two days earlier so her name could be reused for {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-54|3}}.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}}

She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 22 November 1920 and loaned to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], then used as a target ship for experimental artillery. She was scuttled in shallow water off Pensacola in January 1921 and bombarded by the [[coastal batteries]] of [[Fort Pickens]] and by [[railway artillery]]. She was returned on 20 February 1925 to the navy, which offered her for scrap, but no acceptable bids were received.{{sfn|DANFS Massachusetts (BB-2)}} Another attempt to scrap her was made in 1956, but the state prevented this. Eventually the ship was declared the property of the [[State of Florida]] by the [[Supreme Court of Florida]]. On 10 June 1993—the centennial anniversary of her launching—the site became the fourth [[Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve]]. In 2001 the wreck was also added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it still serves as an artificial reef and diving spot.{{sfn|Museums in the Sea}}
