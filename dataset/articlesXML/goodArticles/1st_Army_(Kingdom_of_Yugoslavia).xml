The '''1st Army''' was a [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] formation commanded by ''Armijski đeneral'' [[Milan Rađenković]] during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941 during [[World War II]]. It consisted of one [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]], one horsed [[cavalry]] division, and two brigade-strength infantry detachments. It formed part of the [[2nd Army Group (Yugoslavia)|2nd Army Group]], and was responsible for the defence of the section of the Yugoslav-[[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungarian]] border between the [[Danube]] and the [[Tisza]] rivers.

The 1st Army was not directly attacked during the first few days after the invasion commenced, but attacks on its flanks resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Danube and then the [[Sava]]. The Hungarians then crossed the border in the sector for which the 1st Army had been responsible, but the Yugoslavs were already withdrawing and the Hungarians faced almost no resistance. This was followed by the German capture of [[Belgrade]] and the rear area units of 1st Army. Remnants of the 1st Army continued to resist along the line of the Sava, within days, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers had been captured. The Germans closed on [[Sarajevo]], and accepted the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April, which came into effect at the following day.

==Composition==
{{see also|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}
The 1st Army was commanded by ''Armijski đeneral''{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''Armijski đeneral'' was equivalent to a [[United States]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2013a}}}} [[Milan Rađenković]], and his [[chief of staff]] was ''Brigadni đeneral''{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''Brigadni đeneral'' was equivalent to a [[United States]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2013a}}}} Todor Milićević.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013b}} It was organised and mobilised on a geographic basis from the 1st Army District, which was divided into divisional districts, each of which was subdivided into regimental regions.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=567}} The 1st Army consisted of:{{sfn|Niehorster|2013b}}
* [[7th Infantry Division Potiska|7th Infantry Division ''Potiska'']]
* [[3rd Cavalry Division (Yugoslavia)|3rd Cavalry Division]]
* Infantry Detachment ''Senta'' (brigade-strength)
* Infantry Detachment ''Sombor'' (brigade-strength)

Its support units included the 56th Army Artillery Regiment, the 1st [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-Aircraft]] Battalion, and the 1st Army Anti-Aircraft [[company (military)|Company]]. The 1st Air Reconnaissance Group comprising fifteen [[Breguet 19]]s was attached from the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] and was based at [[Ruma]] just south of [[Novi Sad]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2013b}}

The 1st Army was part of the [[2nd Army Group (Yugoslavia)|2nd Army Group]], which was responsible for the eastern section of the Yugoslav-Hungarian border, with the 1st Army deployed in the [[Bačka]] region between the Danube and the Tisza, and the [[2nd Army (Yugoslavia)|2nd Army]] in the [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] and [[Slavonia]] regions between Slatina and the Danube. On the right flank of the 1st Army was the [[6th Army (Yugoslavia)|6th Army]], an independent formation that was responsible for the defence of the Yugoslav [[Banat]] region east of the Tisza.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=588}} The boundary with the 2nd Army ran just east of the Danube to [[Vukovar]], then south towards [[Bijeljina]]. The boundary with the 6th Army ran just to the east of the Tisza to the confluence with the Danube, then south across the [[Sava]] through [[Obrenovac]]. The Yugoslav defence plan saw the 1st Army deployed with one division forward with an infantry detachment on each flank, and a cavalry division held in depth.{{sfn|Geografski institut JNA|1952|p = 1}} All of the formations of the 1st Army had only commenced mobilisation.{{sfn|Barefield|1993|p=53}} The deployment of the 1st Army from west to east was:{{sfn|Geografski institut JNA|1952|p = 1}}
* Infantry Detachment ''Sombor'' around [[Sombor]]
* 7th Infantry Division ''Potiska'' centred on [[Bačka Topola]] with its forward elements in [[Subotica]]
* Infantry Detachment ''Senta'' around [[Senta]]
* 3rd Cavalry Division south of the Danube in the [[Fruška Gora]] region between [[Novi Sad]] and [[Sremska Mitrovica]]

The [[44th Infantry Division Unska|44th Infantry Division ''Unska'']], which was under the direct command of the General Headquarters of the VKJ,{{sfn|Niehorster|2013d|}} was deployed in the 1st Army area to the east of the 3rd Cavalry Division, centred on [[Stara Pazova]] on the road between Novi Sad and [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Geografski institut JNA|1952|p = 1}}

==Operations==

===6–10 April===
The 1st Army faced the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungarian]] [[Third Army (Hungary)|3rd Army]], and during the first few days after the commencement of the invasion, there were exchanges of fire with Hungarian border guards, but the 1st Army faced no direct attacks. Neither the 1st Army or the Hungarians were ready for full-scale fighting, as they were still mobilising and deploying their forces.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=588}} On 9 April, due to events in other parts of Yugoslavia, the 6th Army on the right flank of the 1st Army was ordered to withdraw south of the Danube and deploy on a line facing east to defend against an attack from the direction of [[Sofia]], Bulgaria. 2nd Army Group also received orders to withdraw south of the line of the Drava and Danube. 1st Army began to withdraw, and on the same day elements were approaching the Danube crossing.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|pp=588–589}}

The following day, the situation deteriorated significantly when the German [[XXXXI Panzer Corps|XLI Motorised Corps]] crossed the Yugoslav-Romanian border into the Yugoslav Banat and struck the 6th Army, halting its withdrawal and disrupting its ability to organise a coherent defence behind the Danube.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=589}} Also on 10 April, the main thrust of the [[XLVI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVI Motorised Corps]] of the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]], consisting of the [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] leading the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Motorised Infantry Division]] crossed the Drava at [[Barcs]] in the 4th Army sector. The 8th Panzer Division turned southeast between the Drava and Sava rivers, and meeting almost no resistance and with strong air support, had reached Slatina by evening, despite poor roads and bad weather.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=53}}

Later that day, as the situation was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, [[Dušan Simović]], who was both the [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] and [[Chief of the General Staff (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff]], broadcast the following message:{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p = 53}}

{{Quotation|All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means at their disposal. Don't wait for direct orders from above, but act on your own  and be guided by your judgement, initiative, and conscience.|Dušan Simović}}

The bulk of the 1st Army were able to cross the Danube and began to prepare defences. By the evening of 10 April, the 1st Army was ordered to withdraw from this line and form a defensive line behind the Sava from [[Debrc]] to the confluence with the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas river]], for which one or two days would be needed. On the night of 10/11 April, the whole 2nd Army Group continued its withdrawal, but units of the 2nd Army on the left flank of the 1st Army that included significant numbers of [[Croats]] began to dissolve due to the [[fifth column]] activities of the fascist [[Ustaše]] and their sympathisers.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|pp=589–591}}

===11–12 April===
[[File:Me110.jpg|thumb|left|Messerschmitt Bf 110's of ''Zerstörergeschwader'' 26 destroyed the air reconnaissance assets of the 1st Army on their airfields over successive days|alt=a black and white photograph of a two engined monoplane]] 
At dawn on 11 April, Hungarian forces,{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=591}} consisting with the [[Mobile Corps (Hungary)|Mobile]], [[IV Corps (Hungary)|IV]] and [[V Corps (Hungary)|V Corps]] of ''[[Lieutenant General|Altábornagy]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Elemér Gorondy-Novák]]'s 3rd Army,{{sfn|Niehorster|2013c}} crossed the Yugoslav border north of [[Osijek]] and near [[Subotica]],{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=61}} overcame Yugoslav border guards and advanced on Subotica and [[Palić]].{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=592}} The XLVI Motorised Corps continued to push east south of the Drava, with the 8th Panzer Division capturing [[Našice]], Osijek on the Drava, and Vukovar on the Danube, followed by the 16th Motorised Infantry Division which advanced east of Našice, despite bridge demolitions and poor roads.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=591}}{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=53}} The 8th Panzer Division had effectively routed the 2nd Army Group by 11 April.{{sfn|Van Creveld|1973|p=127}} On the same day, [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]'s of I Group of the [[Zerstörergeschwader 26|26th Heavy Fighter Wing]] ({{lang-de|Zerstörergeschwader|links=no}} 26, ZG 26) destroyed several 1st Air Reconnaissance Group Breguet 19s at Ruma. The rest were flown to Bijeljina, but were destroyed the following day when I/ZG 26 swept over the airfield in one of the most effective attacks of the campaign.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=222–223}} On the night of 11/12 April, the 8th Panzer Division captured [[Sremska Mitrovica]] on the Sava at 02:30,{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=53}} destroyed a bridge over the Danube at [[Bogojevo]],{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=590}} and advanced on [[Lazarevac]] about {{convert|32|km|mi}} south of Belgrade.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=53}} These advances delayed the withdrawal of the 2nd Army Group south of the Sava.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=592}}

By 12 April, the withdrawal of the 2nd Army Group was being threatened from the left flank, with 2nd Army having &quot;no combat importance at all&quot;. On the right flank, 6th Army attempted to regroup while being pressed by the [[11th Panzer Division]] as it drove towards Belgrade.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=590}} West of Belgrade, remnants of the 2nd Army Group tried to establish a line along the Sava, but XLVI Motorised Corps had already captured the bridges. When elements of the 8th Panzer Division captured [[Zemun]] without a fight, they captured 1st Army's rear area units. On 12 April, the 1st Army's 3rd Cavalry Division counter-attacked at [[Šabac]] and pushed the Germans back across the Sava.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=592}} The Hungarians pursued the 1st Army south, and occupied the area between the Danube and the Tisza meeting virtually no resistance.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=61}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=169}} [[Serbs in Vojvodina|Serb]] [[Chetnik]] irregulars fought isolated engagements,{{sfn|Thomas|Szábó|2008|p=14}} and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition.{{sfn|Komjáthy|1993|p=134}}{{sfn|Cseres|1991|pp=61–65}} The Hungarian 1st Parachute Battalion captured canal bridges at [[Vrbas (town)|Vrbas]] and [[Srbobran]].{{sfn|Thomas|Szábó|2008|p=14}} This, the first airborne operation in Hungarian history, was not without incident. The battalion's aircraft consisted of five Italian-made [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] transport aircraft formerly with the civilian airline [[MALERT]], but pressed into service with the [[Royal Hungarian Air Force]] ({{lang-hu|Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő}}, MKHL) at the start of the European war.{{sfn|Neulen|2000|pp=122–23}} Shortly after takeoff from the airport at [[Veszprém|Veszprém-Jutas]] on the afternoon of 12 April, the command plane, code E-101, crashed with the loss of 20{{sfn|Szabó|2005|p=196|ps=, citing the obituaries of the &quot;Royal Parachutist Squadron&quot; (13 April) and in the periodical ''Pápa és Vidéke'' (27 April).}} or 23 lives, including 19 paratroopers. This was the heaviest single loss suffered by the Hungarians during the Yugoslav campaign.{{sfn|Neulen|2000|pp=122–23}} Meanwhile, [[Sombor]] was captured against determined Chetnik resistance, and Subotica was also captured.{{sfn|Thomas|Szábó|2008|p=14}}
[[File:Germans troops and animals struggling in mud.jpg|thumb|right|The Germans struggled along poor roads during their drive east towards Belgrade|alt=a black and white photograph of troops and animals pulling vehicles out of the mud]]
On the evening of 12 April, elements of the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|SS Motorised Infantry Division ''Reich'']], under command of XLI Motorised Corps crossed the Danube in pneumatic boats and captured Belgrade without resistance. About the same time, most of the elements of XLVI Motorised Corps that were approaching Belgrade from the west were redirected away from the capital. Elements of the 8th Panzer Division did continue their thrust to capture the Sava bridges to the west of Belgrade, and entered the city during the night. The rest of the 8th Panzer Division turned southeast and drove towards [[Valjevo]] to link up with the left flank of the [[1st Panzer Army|First Panzer Group]] southwest of Belgrade. The 16th Motorised Infantry Division was redirected south across the Sava, and advanced toward [[Zvornik]].{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=54}}

==Fate==
On 13 April, the Hungarians occupied Baranja without resistance, and pushed south through Bačka to reach the line of Novi Sad and the [[Great Bačka Canal]].{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=593}} Early on 14 April, the remnants of 2nd Army Group, including the 1st Army, continued to fight against the 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division along the Sava.{{sfn|Krzak|2006|p=596}} On 14 and 15 April, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers were taken prisoner by the Germans during their drive on [[Sarajevo]] in the centre of the country, including 30,000 around Zvornik and 6,000 around [[Doboj]]. On 15 April, the 8th and 14th Panzer Divisions entered Sarajevo. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|pp=63–64}}
