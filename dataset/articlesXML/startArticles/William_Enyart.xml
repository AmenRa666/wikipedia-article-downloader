===Health care===
Enyart is against repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. Speaking about the health care law, Enyart said &quot;Now are there problems with it? Of course there are problems with it. Let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Let’s change the things that are problems and move on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenbaum|first=Jason|title=Enyart and Plummer compete in high-stakes battle for Illinois' 12th District seat|url=https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/27291/illinois_12th_district_overview|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=St. Louis Beacon|date=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analysis of 2014 campaign websites, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' found that Enyart is among six congressional Democrats whose websites do not mention the Affordable Care Act, noting that &quot;Most Democrats in competitive elections are seeking to avoid the topic, opting not to tout the controversial law on their campaign websites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timmons|first=Sheila|title=Dems don't want to talk O-Care|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/204426-dems-dont-want-to-talk-about-o-care|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enyart co-sponsored the Preserving American Privacy Act, which would have required federal agencies that used drones domestically to minimize the collection of personally identifiable information.

===Veterans' issues===
Enyart introduced the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act, which would provide provisional benefits to veterans who have requested benefits from the VA and been left waiting for more than 125 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enyart introduces veteran claims bill|url=http://carbondaletimes.com/051713veterans|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=Carbondale Times|date=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Enyart was the lone member of Congress to vote against a bill that would have restored chaplain services to military personnel in the wake of the [[government shutdown of 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mariano|first1=Nick|title=Enyart lone no-vote on military bill|url=http://thesouthern.com/news/local/enyart-lone-no-vote-on-military-bill/article_50dea2a6-2f0a-11e3-86ea-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=The Southern|date=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enyart defended his vote, calling the measure &quot;an absolutely phony, feel-good bill that had nothing to do with reality,&quot; further noting that the bill provided no way to pay the chaplains if they resumed their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suhr|first=Jim|title=Thousands of Illinois Military Workers Back on Job|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Most-Furloughed-Workers-Back-on-Job-at-Illinois-Base-226751191.html#ixzz3JZFYgr4W|accessdate=19 November 2014|publisher=NBC Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National security===
Enyart voted in favor of proposed amendments by [[Adam Smith]] (D-WA) that would have eliminated indefinite detention for any individual held in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.Amdt. 152 (Smith) to H.R. 1960: Amendment sought to eliminate indefinite military detention of any person detained under AUMF authority|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h228|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a framework  to close the detention facility at [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]], by December 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.Amdt. 168 (Smith) to H.R. 1960: Amendment sought to provide framework to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h237|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal budget===
Enyart voted for the [[No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013]], which temporarily suspended the [[United States debt ceiling]] and placed temporary restrictions on congressional salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Huston|first=Warner Todd|title=Illinois Congressmen Sign Onto ‘No Budget, No Pay’ Act|url=http://www.prairiestatereport.us/2013/01/24/illinois-congressmen-sign-onto-no-budget-no-pay-act/|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=The Prairie State Report|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
