==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Born in [[Seoul, South Korea]], Peter Rhee lived for several years in [[Uganda]] as his father, also a doctor, worked in the [[Peace Corps]]. The elder Rhee moved the family to the United States when his son was 10 to get a better education. The family was raised in a small [[Pennsylvania]] town, south of [[Pittsburgh]]. His father was an [[anesthesiologist]] at [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown Hospital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBL-20110111&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Pickels|first=Mary|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/dailycourier/s_717557.html|title=Giffords' doctor was standout student at Laurel Highlands|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Rhee graduated in 1979 from [[Laurel Highlands High School]] in [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WTAE-20110110&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wtae.com/news/26412682/detail.html|title=U.S. District Judge, Pitt. Native Killed In Arizona Shooting|publisher=[[WTAE-TV]]|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1983, he received his Bachelor of Science degree in [[Health systems engineering|Health Systems Engineering]] from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HealthMil-20101209&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.mil/dhb/members/101309/Rhee_short%20bio_updated%2010_12_09.pdf|title=Peter Rhee, MD, MPH, FACS, FCCM, DMCC|publisher=Defense Health Board|date=December 9, 2010|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Rhee earned his medical degree from the [[Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences]] F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine.  He also earned a master's degree in [[Public Health]] from the [[University of Washington]] Department of Health Services. In 1999, he earned a diploma in Medical Care of Catastrophes from the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Society of Apothecaries of London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medscape-20110125&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Melville|first=Nancy A.|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/736235|title=Dr. Peter Rhee: Battlefield Background Provides Composure Amid Tucson Shootings|publisher=[[Medscape]]|date=January 25, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoir===
[[File:Cover-Trauma-Red-by-Dr-Peter-Rhee.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the book &quot;TRAUMA RED: The Making of a Surgeon in War and in America’s Cities&quot; by Peter Rhee]]On Saturday, [[2011 Tucson shooting|January 8, 2011]], [[Peter Rhee|Dr. Peter Rhee]] was called into work—on his first day off in weeks—to Tucson’s [[University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona)|University Medical Center]] Trauma Center, where 10 gunshot victims were being rushed after a man opened fire on a crowd of people at a local supermarket. One of the victims was Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]]. It was a day the nation would never forget, but for Dr. Rhee, it was also just another day on the job, saving lives.  In his gripping memoir TRAUMA RED: The Making of a Surgeon in War and in America’s Cities, [[Peter Rhee]] recalls that “challenging, exhausting, exhilarating, frustrating, heartbreaking, satisfying, bloody, bloody, bloody day at the office,” and the path that led him there. From his youth in [[South Korea]] and [[Uganda]]—where he once watched his surgeon father remove a spear from a man’s belly—to frontline surgery in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], to trauma centers on the urban battlefields of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Washington, DC]], Rhee's stories are fascinating.&lt;ref&gt;Scribner, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster; June 3, 2014; 978-1-4767-2729-5&lt;/ref&gt;

“It took a long time to be convinced that I should write this book,” Rhee stated. He felt that the book would be looked upon as being egotistical by his professional peers. He states that he wrote the book to document from the medical provider point of view what actually happened when Congresswoman was shot in the brain and so that others could learn what a trauma surgeon is.

===Personal life===
Rhee met his wife, Emily, as he was completing his residency at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. They have two children.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-20110112&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Medina|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/us/13rhee.html?_r=1|title=Surgeon and Sudden Celebrity, and Trying to Balance the Roles|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
[[File:Fob rhino.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhee was one of the first battlefield surgeons to be deployed at [[Camp Rhino]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMCAZ&quot;/&gt;]]
Rhee is a 24-year veteran of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes=20110110&quot;/&gt; During a trip to [[China]] in 1998, he was selected to accompany U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] as his designated surgeon.&lt;ref name=&quot;UANews-20070927&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uanews.org/node/16147|title=UMC, UA Appoints U.S. Navy Veteran Dr. Peter Rhee Director of Trauma|journal=UA News|publisher=[[University of Arizona]]|date=September 27, 2007|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Rhee became one of the first American military surgeons to be deployed in [[Afghanistan]] at [[Camp Rhino]], the first [[forward operating base]] to be established during ''[[Operation Enduring Freedom]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes=20110110&quot;/&gt; In 2005, Rhee was deployed to [[Iraq]], where he established the first surgical unit in [[Ramadi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes=20110110&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UMCAZ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.umcaz.org/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&amp;id=27&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=799|title=Our Medical Staff: Peter M Rhee, MD|publisher=[[University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona)]]|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His service awards include the [[Defense Meritorious Service Medal]] and the [[Navy Commendation Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMCAZ&quot;/&gt;

[[File:QuikClot.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rhee publicly expressed his preference for [[QuikClot]] as a [[hemostatic agent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PostGazette-20030722&quot;/&gt;]]
As the Director of the Navy Trauma Training Center at [[Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center]], Rhee became involved in an interbranch disagreement between the Army and Navy regarding the adoption of new [[hemostatic agent]]s designed for battlefield treatment of severe bleeding. While the Army had adopted blood-clotting bandage called HemCon, the Navy and Marines instead opted for a different product called [[QuikClot]]. After testing HemCon at the Navy Trauma Training Center, Rhee concluded in December 2005: &quot;I've tried every one of these products, many times, on many different kinds of wounds. For big-time bleeding &amp;ndash; and that's what we're really worrying about here &amp;ndash; HemCon doesn't work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-20051204&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Little|first=Robert|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/04/news/adna-hemcon4/3|title=Army's Costly Battlefield Bandage Raises Questions|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=3|date=December 4, 2005|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Rhee preferred QuikClot, he expressed reservations over its commercialization in 2003 because of the potential for misuse by untrained consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PostGazette-20030722&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Healy|first=Melissa|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/healthscience/20030722hquikclot5.asp|title=Life-saving clotting powder heading to stores|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=July 22, 2003|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhee was appointed as Professor of Surgery and Molecular Cellular Biology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and continues to consult for the [[Office of Naval Research]] and the [[United States Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory|Marine Corps War Fighting Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UANews-20070927&quot;/&gt;

===Civilian medical career===
Rhee worked in the trauma centers at the [[Harborview Medical Center]] in [[Seattle]] and the [[Washington Hospital Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In September 2007, he became the Chief of Trauma and Critical Care and Professor of Surgery at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. By that time, he had published over 200 articles in medical journals.&lt;ref name=&quot;UANews-20070927&quot;/&gt; In July 2009, the [[University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona)|University Medical Center]] was designated a [[trauma center#Level I|Level 1 Trauma Center]] by the [[American College of Surgeons]]. Rhee stated that the center had become ranked among the top 10 in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;UANews-20090715&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley|first=Katie|url=http://uanews.org/node/26424|title=UMC Trauma Center Receives Level 1 Verification|journal=UA News|publisher=[[University of Arizona]]|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She will not die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.com/News/NationandWorld/201101111353|title=Doctor says congresswoman has '101 percent chance of surviving'|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
