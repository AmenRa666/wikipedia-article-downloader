'''''Calatafimi''''' was a [[torpedo cruiser]] of the {{sclass-|Partenope|cruiser|4}} built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) in the 1880s. She was built by the [[Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando]] shipyard; her [[keel laying|keel was laid]] in July 1891, she was [[ship launching|launched]] in May 1894, and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in December 1895. Her main armament were her five [[torpedo tube]]s, which were supported by a battery of eleven small-caliber guns. ''Calatafimi'' spent most of her career in the main Italian fleet, where she was primarily occupied with training exercises. The ship was sold in March 1907 and [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.

==Design==
{{main|Partenope-class cruiser}}
''Calatafimi'' was {{convert|73.1|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.22|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|3.48|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|839|MT|sp=us}} normally. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s, each driving a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by four coal-fired [[locomotive boiler]]s. Specific figures for ''Calatafimi''{{'}}s engine performance have not survived, but the ships of her class had top speeds of {{convert|18.1|to|20.8|kn|lk=in}} at {{convert|3884|to|4422|ihp|lk=in}}. The ship had a cruising radius of about {{convert|1800|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She had a crew of between 96 and 121 personnel.&lt;ref name=G347&gt;Gardiner, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

''Calatafimi'' was armed with a [[main battery]] of one {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} /40 gun and six {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} /43 guns mounted singly.{{ref|Alpha|α}} She was also equipped with three {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on|1}} /20 guns in single mounts. Her primary offensive weapon was her six {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to {{convert|1.6|in|abbr=on}} thick; her [[conning tower]] was armored with the same thickness of steel plate.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;

==Service history==
The new cruiser was originally to have been named ''Tersicore'', but she was renamed ''Calatafimi'' the day construction began. The last member of her class, ''Calatafimi'' was laid down on 15 September 1891 at the [[Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia]] (Royal Dockyard in [[Castellammare di Stabia]]), and was launched on 18 March 1893. After [[fitting-out]] work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 16 January 1894.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt; The following year, she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Permanent Squadron, which included her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Euridice||2}}, the [[ironclad battleship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Francesco Morosini||2}}, and the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Etruria||2}}. The Squadron was based at [[La Spezia]] at the time, though ''Calatafimi'' was stationed primarily in [[Taranto]] and [[Naples]], along with most of the other [[torpedo cruiser]]s of the Italian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett 1895, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, unrest in the [[Ottoman Empire]] that killed hundreds of foreign nationals prompted several of the European [[great power]]s to send an international fleet to pressure the Ottomans into compensating the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sultan Continues to Defy the Menaces of the Powers|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=27 November 1895|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1895/11/27/page/4/article/foreign-news|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, a small Italian squadron sent to [[Smyrna]] to join the fleet in there; ''Calatafimi'' was mobilized as part of a larger force in Naples that consisted of the ironclads ''Francesco Morosini'', {{ship|Italian ironclad|Lepanto||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ruggiero di Lauria||2}}, the protected cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Elba||2}}, the torpedo cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Folgore||2}}, and five torpedo boats. This second squadron was stocked with coal and ammunition in the event that it would need to reinforce the squadron at Smryna.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Fleets in the Levant&quot;, p. 16,664&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--yes, it is actually page 16,664.--&gt;

In 1896, she took part in the annual summer maneuvers in July as part of the First Division of the Reserve Squadron, which also included the ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re Umberto||2}} and ''Lepanto'' and the protected cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Ettore Fieramosca||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, ''Calatafimi'' was assigned to the Reserve Squadron, which included the [[ironclad warship|ironclads]] ''Lepanto'', ''Francesco Morosini'', and ''Ruggiero di Lauria'', three protected cruisers, and the torpedo cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Goito||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett (1898), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she returned to the Active Squadron, where she served with six ironclads, the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Vettor Pisani||2}}, the protected cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Lombardia||2}}, and ''Goito''.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett (1899), p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was sold for scrap in March 1907 and subsequently [[ship breaking|broken up]].&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;

==Notes==
:{{note|Alpha|α|&quot;/40&quot; refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[caliber (artillery)|calibers]], meaning that the length of the barrel is 40 times its internal diameter.}}
