==Bad link ==

The 'Harry O'Neill' link goes not to the MLB player, but to a 'One Life To Live' character page.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.66.52.141|70.66.52.141]] ([[User talk:70.66.52.141|talk]]) 16:27, 3 December 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Article Inaccuracies ==

This article says that Elmer's uncle Joe was implicated in the Black Sox scandel. The [[Joe Gedeon]] article doesn't say anything about playing for the White Sox, reads that Elmer was his son, and reads that Elmer was one of four Major League Baseball players killed in combat. This article says two were killed in combat. Clearly these inaccuracies need to be worked out. --[[User:Daysleeper47|Daysleeper47]] 17:17, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

==GA Review==
Hi, nice article, not bad at all but needs a little bit of work before it is ready.
*The headings are misplaced. I would suggest removing either &quot;Three-sprt athlete&quot;, &quot;Professional baseball&quot; or both. Or alternately make them smaller headings with ===.{{Y}}--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:22, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
*Do the minor teams he played for in Orlando and Charlotte have names? Can they be linked to? 
**I don't know how to figure out any more about them.--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:20, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
*Is there any further information which can be added about his baseball career? I must admit I know nothing whatsoever about baseball, but clearly this guy is notable for his baseball career and so it deserves more than one short paragraph.{{Y}}--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 19:42, 10 December 2007 (UTC)
*Harry O'Neill links to a strange place. Make it link to the right person (or at a pinch, don't link it at all).{{Y}}--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 19:42, 10 December 2007 (UTC)
*Insert a new heading above the paragraph called &quot;Legacy&quot; and then merge all the listy short sentances below that into a single coherent paragraph containing this data.
*AS it says above, Persondata is needed.{{Y}}--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 21:27, 9 December 2007 (UTC)
*Merge all short two sentance paragraphs into longer ones.{{Y}}--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:23, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
*Is there anyway to merge the baseball infobox with a military one. At the very least, the information there should be expanded. We have no information about him personally in the box and it is distracting since the picture is clearly of a USAAF officer. There is also no mention of his military career, no date of death and very little personal information.{{Y}}--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 21:01, 9 December 2007 (UTC)
This article should probably have been nominated for the sports section, as that is what he is notable for, and I am not sure if this article satisfys the sports bio requirements. I will have to reassess it once the above information is dealt with and will then let you know the final desicion. For now the article is on hold.--[[User:Jackyd101|Jackyd101]] ([[User talk:Jackyd101|talk]]) 04:22, 9 December 2007 (UTC)


Great, the article is much easier on the eye. I will now conduct a second review, note any further changes needed and extend the hold period another seven days. Apologies for this two-stage review but I was a little unfamiliar with the sporting format and wanted to the see the article more cohesive before giving it a more thorough GA review.
*&quot;ultimate service&quot; in the intro is a slightly odd usage. It might be better phrased as &quot;final mission&quot; or &quot;death in action&quot; etc etc. In fact, that entire sentance should probably come after the sentance on his baseball career and it should be mentioned he served with the USAAF before commenting that he had flown several missions e.g.{{Y}}--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:45, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Elmer John Gedeon (April 15, 1917 - April 20, 1944) is best remembered as one of only two Major League Baseball players killed in action during World War II. He was a professional baseball player who had been a multisport star in college at the University of Michigan. He had also flown several missions in the European Theater of Operations as an officer of the United States Army Air Force before his final, fatal mission. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Rest of the lead is fine.
*I really like the dual infoboxes, they provide all relevant information between each other without overlapping or conflicting with one another.
*Any info on parentage? Not essential, but would certainly be interesting.
**Sorry. I have no further info.--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:45, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
*Can you explain what &quot;Gedeon, who wore #51 for the Michigan Wolverines football program from 1991 to 1994&quot; means either here or in the article if necessary? As I mentioned I know nothing about baseball, so this maybe obvious to people who follow it, but I don't understand it at all.
**On many sports-related infoboxes Jersey numbers are included.  People care about who wore what Jersey.  Thus, for the reader a jersey number is an encyclopedic fact.  Here we are saying what jersey number he wore for Michigan football.  I do have the wrong years though.--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:45, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
*Good work on linking the Hornets, never mind about the Orlando team, its not vital.

Thats it. A very nice and solid article and these fixes are minor and shouldn't take long. I will be happy to pass this for GA when they are addressed. Well done to all concerned. When it is passed, what do the contributors think about placement - military or sports?--[[User:Jackyd101|Jackyd101]] ([[User talk:Jackyd101|talk]]) 02:42, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

In life he is notable as a baseball player.  I.E., he would be eligible for a WP article as a former professional baseball player.  The page would withstand any [[WP:AFD]] challenge.  His military service during his life would not.  In death, he is notable as a military officer who died as a former major league baseball player.  I think if I were to look at a priority scale for which I have added tags and say which should have the highest priority rating it would be MILHIST.  He is an important footnote for each of the projects, but he is most important for his contribution to military history.  Thus, I think he should be included in the military section.--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|c]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|bio]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:LOTD]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:54, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

Fine, the jersey thing makes more sense now you've explained it. I'll also go with your opinion on military history as the place for this to go (and I was never worried about Afd, this is clearly notable). The article is vastly improved since my first review and is now a very fine GA (I made a slight edit to the lead). Well done to all involved.--[[User:Jackyd101|Jackyd101]] ([[User talk:Jackyd101|talk]]) 00:44, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

==Copy edit==
I am just doing some minor copy edit. I hope folks don't mind. Nice work so far! Cheers, --[[User:Threeafterthree|Tom]] 17:42, 12 December 2007 (UTC)
