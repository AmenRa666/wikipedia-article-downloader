'''Eastbourne Redoubt''' is a circular [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defence]] [[fort]] at [[Eastbourne]], [[East Sussex]], on the south coast of [[England]]. It was built in 1805 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–1805|British anti-invasion preparations]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[redoubt]] is now open to the public and houses a [[Museum#military museum|military museum]].

==Description==
[[File:Redoubt Fortress Eastbourne, Casemates No.2 &amp; No.3.jpg|thumb|Redoubt Fortress Eastbourne, Casemates No.2 &amp; No.3]]
The redoubt is a circular structure, measuring 224 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] (68 metres) in [[diameter]] and is built almost entirely of [[brick]] with some [[granite]] facing. The lower tier is composed of a ring of 24 [[casemate]]s or vaulted chambers, which open into a central [[parade ground]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p5&quot;&gt;Eley, Jamieson and Limbert, Matthew (2014), ''Redoubt Fortress'', Jarrold Publishing, ISBN 978-0-85101-545-3 (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Casemate 11 was the main [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] for the redoubt, casemate 8 was modified in the 1870s as a cook house and casemates 23 and 24 were altered in the 1880s to provide a detention room and two [[Prison cell|cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eley pp. 11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper tier above the casemates forms the [[terreplein]] or gun platform, which has a tall [[parapet]] pierced by granite-faced [[embrasure]]s for eleven [[artillery|gun]]s. Beside each gun position is an &quot;L&quot; shaped expense magazine which held a supply of ammunition for the guns to use in combat and could also be used as a shelter for the gun crews during an enemy bombardment. The low roof of these magazines forms a [[banquette]] or fire step so that the garrison could fire their [[musket]]s over the parapet in the event of an [[infantry]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;Eley pp. 6-11&lt;/ref&gt;  The parapet is also pierced by the main gate, which was originally the only access to the redoubt.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p.16&quot;&gt;Eley p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The redoubt is surrounded by a [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] or dry [[moat]] which is 30 feet (9 metres) from the top of the parapet and 25 feet (7 metres) wide. On the far side of the moat, a [[glacis]] or earth ramp slopes away to ground level.&lt;ref&gt;Eley p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Both the moat and the glacis have been removed on the seaward side during construction of a [[sea wall]] and [[promenade]] in 1890.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p20&quot;&gt;Eley p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The floor of the ditch is traversed by five [[caponier]]s or covered galleries with [[loophole]]s that allowed the defenders to fire at any attackers who had reached that point. These are unique in any of the circular redoubts and are thought to have been added in the mid-19th century. Access to the main gate of the redoubt is across a wooden [[drawbridge|drop bridge]],&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p.16&quot;/&gt; which is a modern reconstruction of the original, built in 2003 with help from the [[Royal Engineers]]. A second entrance from the ditch was created in 1957 by inserting a large doorway through the [[Counterscarp|scarp]] wall into one of the casemates.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p20&quot;/&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
The decision to build the redoubt was made at a conference held in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on 21 October 1804, to discuss defence against [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom]], preparations for which were gaining momentum on the opposite side of the [[English Channel]]. The meeting, which was attended by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[William Pitt the Younger]], agreed to adopt a revolutionary scheme to build a chain of mutually-supporting circular artillery towers along a stretch of the Channel coast where the French were thought to be most likely to land. The scheme had been devised by Captain [[William Henry Ford]] of the [[Royal Engineers]] and championed by [[Brigadier-General]] [[William Twiss]] who commanded the Royal Engineer Southern District. The original plan called for 83 [[Martello towers]], each mounting a single heavy gun, at intervals along the coast and three 11-gun towers at Sea Houses (Eastbourne), [[Rye]] Harbour and [[Dymchurch]]. In the event, 74 Martello Towers were actually built and plans for the 11-gun tower at Rye were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Bill (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hLX7kXj-lrsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Eastbourne+Redoubt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ybSQU-CuCovo7AbUpYGIBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Eastbourne%20Redoubt&amp;f=false ''Martello Towers Worldwide''], Pen &amp; Sword Books Limited, ISBN 978-1-84884-535-0 (pp. 24-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The 11-gun towers, which came to be known as &quot;circular forts&quot; or &quot;grand redoubts&quot;, were intended to act as barracks and stores depots for the rest of the Martello chain, as well as formidable fortresses in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subterraneanhistory.co.uk/2009/05/eastbourne-redoubt-sussex.html |title=Eastbourne Redoubt, Sussex |last1=Godfrey |first1=Colin |last2= |first2= |date=5 May 2009 |website=www.subterraneanhistory.co.uk |publisher=Subterranean History |accessdate=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third redoubt was later constructed at [[Harwich Redoubt|Harwich]] in [[Essex]] to support the Martello chain built to defend the east coast; although broadly similar, it differs in some details from the south coast redoubts.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Bernard (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zqD1fiJFRJwC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Harwich+Redoubt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mMqQU6amNYPdOuLHgNgH&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Harwich%20Redoubt&amp;f=false ''Discovering Fortifications: From the Tudors to the Cold War''], Shire Discovering ISBN 978-0747806516 (p. 49)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Redoubt Fortress - geograph.org.uk - 1739731.jpg|thumb|right|View of the redoubt from the [[glacis]], showing the [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] and the reconstructed drop bridge.]]

===Construction and the Napoleonic Wars===
The contract to build the redoubt at Eastbourne was awarded to William Hobson. Five million [[brick]]s were brought around the coast by barge from London for the project&lt;ref name =&quot;History_pdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediafiles.thedms.co.uk/Publication/ES/cms/pdf/History%20of%20the%20Redoubt%20Fortress.pdf |title=History of the Redoubt Fortress |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council |accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others were made locally. Work started on 16 April 1805,&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p20&quot;/&gt; but a report by Brigadier-General Twiss to the [[Board of Ordnance]] in May 1808 recommended that the money to settle Hobson's account be withheld until all the work was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, Sheila (1972) [https://books.google.com/books?id=b062YixS9s8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=m,artello+towers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4c6QU4CjA4fgOM7YgNAM&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=m%2Cartello%20towers&amp;f=false ''Martello Towers''], David &amp; Charles, ISBN 978-0715356074 (p. 82)&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was built on a raft of compacted [[chalk]] laid directly onto the natural [[Shingle beach|shingle]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p8&quot;&gt;Eley p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed almost entirely of brick, over 50,000 being used in a single course.&lt;ref&gt;Eley p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Cavities within the structure were filled with shingle.&lt;ref&gt;Eley p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The redoubt was initially armed with [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounder gun]]s on traversing [[gun carriage|carriage]]s; although there are [[embrasure]]s for 11 guns, only 10 appear to have been mounted.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p8&quot;/&gt; These were replaced shortly afterwards by longer ranged 36-pounder guns, after fears the redoubt could be bombarded at a distance by heavier French weapons.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p20&quot;/&gt; By the time that the redoubt had been fully armed and garrisoned, the likelihood of an invasion had become very remote and the guns were only fired in anger once; in 1812 two shots were fired at a passing French warship but missed.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p5&quot;/&gt;

===Later 19th century developments===
By the 1830s, Europe was experiencing a long peaceful period and the garrison consisted of only seven gunners and a gate keeper,&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p20&quot;/&gt; together with their families.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p5&quot;/&gt; The main role of the redoubt was as a [[barracks]] rather than a fortress, with troops being stationed there for a few weeks at a time while using nearby training facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Eley p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was intended for 350 men, it is thought unlikely that more than 200 could be accommodated at any one time. Despite this, the armament of the fort was progressively improved throughout the century. In 1853, the 32-pounders were replaced by [[68-pounder gun|68-pounder smoothbore gun]]s. In 1859, the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] which had been set up by [[Lord Palmerston]] to review Britain's fortifications, reported that the redoubts and Martello towers were &quot;not an important element of security against attack&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;History_pdf&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, by 1873, the armament had been increased to four [[RML 8 inch 9 ton gun|8 inch rifled muzzle loader]]s and three [[RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun|110-pounder rifled breech loader]]s, together with two of the older 68-pounders.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p8&quot;/&gt; Various improvements were made to the living conditions in the barracks including the addition of a cookhouse in the 1870s and a latrine outside the main gate in the 1880s.&lt;ref name =&quot;Eley_p20&quot;/&gt;

===The World Wars and later===
[[File:The model village, Eastbourne Redoubt - geograph.org.uk - 1435952.jpg|thumb|right|The [[miniature park|model village]] which was an attraction inside the redoubt from 1957 to 1975.]]
During the [[World War I|First World War]] the [[Royal Military Police|military police]] used the redoubt as a headquarters and temporary [[gaol]]. Following this, [[Eastbourne Borough Council]] purchased the redoubt for £150 with the plan to turn it into a venue for leisure activities. The only part of the plan to be implemented was in 1934; the construction of a new [[bandstand]] in the gardens just to the west of the redoubt and an associated [[colonnade]] to shelter the audience, which was built over part of the moat. During the [[Second World War]], the army requisitioned the building to use for storage. The remaining artillery pieces were sold for scrap. [[Canadian]] troops were accommodated there prior to the unsuccessful [[Dieppe raid]] in 1941. In 1944, [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were mounted on the gun platforms to counter passing [[V-1 flying bomb]]s. In 1957, the redoubt was leased to an [[entrepreneur]] named Benjamin White, who created a [[miniature park|model village]] on the parade ground and constructed a new entrance from the moat, with a staircase that gives access from the promenade. The bandstand colonnade was converted into the Blue Grotto [[Aquarium]]. The model village was vandalised and then removed in the 1970s, and the aquarium closed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Eley p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The [[redoubt]] opened as a military museum in 1977, and is now the largest military museum in south east England. It contains military collections of [[The Royal Sussex Regiment]], which moved to the museum in 1983, [[The Queen's Royal Irish Hussars]] (see also [[The Queen's Royal Hussars]]), which moved in 1988, [[Eastbourne]] Borough's Military Collection and the founding collection, the Sussex Combined Services. In addition the museum also features displays on the history of the redoubt and a number of temporary exhibitions and displays. 
[[File:Arnim 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hans-Jürgen von Arnim|General von Arnim]]'s staff car, a [[Steyr 1500A]], on display in the museum.]]
Among the artefacts that the museum possesses and displays is General [[Hans-Jürgen von Arnim]]'s [[Steyr Automobile]] [[Steyr 1500A|1500A]] [[Afrika Korps]] Staff Car, which the Royal Sussex Regiment captured [[Tunisian Campaign|in Tunisia]] in May 1943, a Russian bugle rescued from the ill-fated [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], a uniform of the [[Desert Rats]] worn at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] in 1942, and a Gulf War camp of the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.eastbournemuseums.co.uk/Collections.htm|title=Redoubt Fortress and Military Museum - Collections|publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015's temporary exhibition, [[Treasure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Treasure at Redoubt Fortress &amp; Military Museum {{!}} Exhibition {{!}} Eastbourne{{!}}East Sussex|url = http://www.eastbournemuseums.co.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=3&amp;feature=1038&amp;venue=3410803&amp;easi=true&amp;pvieflag=e|website = www.eastbournemuseums.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores what treasure can be and includes a 15th Century [[Book of Hours]], 1940s sound projector (invented locally)and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Coin Horde recovered from [[Beachy Head]].

== Access and events ==
The redoubt and cafe is open to the public between April and mid-November, every day from 10 am to 5 pm. Access to the gun platform and the parade ground is free. There is an admission charge to visit the museum which is inside the casemates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.eastbournemuseums.co.uk/visit.aspx|title=Redoubt Fortress and Military Museum – Visit |publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free return visit is included in the entry price and the museum offers discounts and free entry for various events throughout the year.
The museum has a lively events programme, including films, lectures, tours, collection handling sessions, star gazing, ghost nights and commemoration events.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.eastbournemuseums.co.uk/whats-on.aspx|title=What’s on at the Redoubt Fortress |publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages families to visit, has permanent children's area and through the summer holidays runs daily events to keep children entertained.
