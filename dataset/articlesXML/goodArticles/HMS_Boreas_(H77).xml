'''HMS ''Boreas''''' was a {{sclass2-|B|destroyer|0}} [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] around 1930. Initially assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], she was transferred to the [[Home Fleet]] in 1936. The ship then patrolled Spanish waters enforcing the arms blockade during the first year of the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–39. She spent most of [[World War II]] on [[convoy]] escort duties in the [[English Channel]] and the [[North Atlantic]], based at [[Dover]], [[Gibraltar]], and [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]]. ''Boreas'' also served two brief tours with the Mediterranean Fleet and participated in [[Operation Husky]], the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily. She was loaned to the [[Hellenic Navy#History|Royal Hellenic Navy]] the next year after conversion into an [[escort destroyer]]. She was renamed ''Salamis'' and served in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] for the rest of the war. ''Salamis'' became a [[training ship]] after the war until she was returned to Britain and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1951.

==Description==
''Boreas'' displaced {{convert|1360|LT|t|lk=on}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1790|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|323|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|32|ft|3|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|3|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=w78/&gt; She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s,&lt;ref name=m0/&gt; driving two [[Drive shaft#Marine drive shafts|shafts]], which developed a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s. ''Boreas'' carried a maximum of {{convert|390|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|4800|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.&lt;ref name=w78&gt;Whitley, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's complement was 134 officers and enlisted men, although it increased to 142 during wartime.&lt;ref name=f8&gt;Friedman, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship [[Weapon mount|mounted]] four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Boreas'' had two {{convert|40|mm|1|adj=on}} [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk II]] AA guns mounted on a platform between her [[funnel (ship)|funnels]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.&lt;ref name=f8/&gt; One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was fitted with a Type 119 [[ASDIC]] set to detect [[submarine]]s through sound waves beamed into the water that would reflect off the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1940, the ship's AA armament was increased when the rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|{{convert|3|in|1|adj=on}} (12-pounder)]] AA gun and 'Y' gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 237, 241&lt;/ref&gt; ''Boreas'' was converted to an [[escort destroyer]] in late 1943 with the replacement of the 12-pounder high-angle gun with additional depth charge [[stowage]]. The 2-pounder mounts were replaced during the war by [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|adj=on|1}} Oerlikon]] [[autocannon]]. Four additional Oerlikon guns were added in the forward superstructure for a total of six guns.&lt;ref name=w0&gt;Whitley, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=l3&gt;Lenton, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
The ship was ordered on 22 March 1929 from [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company|Palmer's]] at [[Jarrow]], under the 1928 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 22 July 1929, and launched on 11 June 1930,&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; as the fourth RN ship to carry this name.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; ''Boreas'' was completed on 21 February 1931&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of £221,156, excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns, ammunition and communications equipment.&lt;ref name=m0&gt;March, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; After her commissioning, she was assigned to the [[4th Destroyer Flotilla]] with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] until September 1936 when it was transferred to [[Home Fleet]]. Her service in the Mediterranean was uneventful until shortly before she returned home when ''Boreas'' evacuated civilians at the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936. After a refit at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] that lasted until 26 September, she made multiple deployments off the coast of Spain in 1937 and 1938. On 6 March 1938, She rescued survivors of the torpedoed [[Spanish Nationalists|Nationalist]] [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Baleares||2}} off [[Cartagena, Spain]] with the destroyer {{HMS|Kempenfelt|I18|2}}. Upon her return the following month, the ship began a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until 11 June. ''Boreas'' escorted the [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HMY|Victoria and Albert|1899|2}} during the Royal Tour of Scotland from 26 July to 4 August. The ship escorted the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}} and the [[ocean liner]] {{RMS|Aquitania||2}} in September during the [[Munich Crisis]]. She remained with the 4th Destroyer Flotilla until April 1939. ''Boreas'' briefly served as a [[plane guard]] for the [[aircraft carrier]]s of the Home Fleet later that year.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was assigned to the [[19th Destroyer Flotilla]] on the start of the war and spent the first six months on escort and patrol duties in the [[English Channel]] and [[North Sea]]. While assisting the damaged [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Sphinx|J69|2}} on 4 February 1940 in the [[Moray Firth]], ''Boreas''{{'}}s stern was damaged and she required repairs that lasted until the following month. The ship was attached to the [[12th Destroyer Flotilla]] on 29 March until she was damaged in a collision with her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Brilliant|H84|2}} on 15 May. Her repairs lasted until 19 June and ''Boreas'' was assigned to the [[1st Destroyer Flotilla]] at [[Dover]] upon their completion. On 25 July, the ship engaged German [[E-boat]]s off Dover Harbour together with ''Brilliant'' and was badly damaged by German [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' [[dive bomber]]s after she was ordered to withdraw. Her [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was hit twice by bombs that killed one officer and twenty crewmen. ''Boreas'' was under repair at [[Millwall Dock]] until 23 January 1941; she was lightly damaged by bomb splinters on 19 January.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1941, she was fitted with a [[Type 286 radar|Type 286]] short-range surface search [[radar]].&lt;ref name=w0/&gt;

After [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]], the ship was briefly assigned to [[Western Approaches Command]] on escort duties before she was transferred to the [[18th Destroyer Flotilla]] at [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], where she arrived on 28 April. ''Boreas'' remained there until she joined [[Convoy HG 70]] on 10 August at [[Gibraltar]]. The ship rescued survivors from four ships and returned them to Gibraltar on 25 August. She received a lengthy refit at [[South Shields]] from 19 September to 4 January 1942, after which rejoined the 18th Destroyer Flotilla on 25 January.&lt;ref name=e7&gt;England, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

''Boreas'' remained on escort duty in the Eastern Atlantic until she arrived in [[Alexandria]], Egypt on 11 November after escorting a convoy around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. She was immediately assigned to escort the ships of [[Operation Stoneage]] that relieved the  [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Siege of Malta]]. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until January 1943 before she was briefly assigned to the [[13th Destroyer Flotilla]] at Gibraltar. ''Boreas'' returned to Freetown in February and remained there until June when she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in preparation for [[Operation Husky]]. She was converted into an [[escort destroyer]] in [[Liverpool]] from September 1943 to February 1944.&lt;ref name=e7/&gt; As part of the conversion, a [[Type 271 radar|Type 271]] target indication radar was installed above the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] that replaced her [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]] and [[rangefinder]] and her Type 286 radar was replaced by a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]].&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was loaned to the Royal Hellenic Navy on 10 February and recommissioned by them on 25 March as ''Salamis''. She was damaged while working up at [[Scapa Flow]] and was under repair at [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] from 28 April to 13 June.&lt;ref name=e7/&gt; ''Salamis'' was assigned to escort duty at Gibraltar until October when she was transferred to the Aegean where she served with the [[12th (Greek) Destroyer Flotilla]] for the rest of the war. The ship was used as a training ship after the war until she was returned to the Royal Navy at Malta on 9 October 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salamis'' arrived at [[Rosyth]] under tow on 15 April 1952 to be broken up by [[Metal Industries, Limited]].&lt;ref name=e7/&gt;
