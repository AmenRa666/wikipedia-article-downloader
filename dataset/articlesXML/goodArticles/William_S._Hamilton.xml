'''William Stephen Hamilton''' (August 4, 1797 –  October 9, 1850), a son of [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]], was a politician and miner who lived much of his life in the U.S. state of [[Illinois]] and [[Wisconsin Territory|territorial Wisconsin]]. Hamilton was born in New York, where he attended the [[United States Military Academy]] before he resigned and moved to Illinois in 1817. In Illinois he lived in Springfield and Peoria and eventually migrated to the lead-mining region of southern Wisconsin and established Hamilton's Diggings at present-day [[Wiota, Wisconsin|Wiota]]. Hamilton served in various political offices and as a commander in two Midwest [[Indian Wars]]. In 1849 he moved to California on the heels of the [[California Gold Rush]]. He died in [[Sacramento]], most likely of [[cholera]], in October 1850.

==Early life==
William Stephen Hamilton&lt;ref name=namenote&gt;As [[aide de camp]] to Illinois Governor [[Edward Coles]], Hamilton's name was recorded as &quot;William Schuyler Hamilton&quot;. This was incorrect. See Reed, ''The Bench and Bar of Wisconsin''.&lt;/ref&gt; was born August 4, 1797 in New York, third-youngest child and second-youngest son of [[Alexander Hamilton]] (1755–1804) and [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Elizabeth Schuyler]] (1757–1854).&lt;ref name=reed/&gt; His maternal grandparents were General [[Philip Schuyler]] (1733–1804) and [[Van Rensselaer family|Catherine Van Rensselaer]] (1734–1803).&lt;ref name=hendrickson&gt;Hendrickson, Robert A. ''The Rise and Fall of Alexander Hamilton'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Qp7EAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Hendrickson,+Rise+and+Fall+of+Alexander+Hamilton,&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 Google Books]), Van Nostrand Reinhold: 1981, (ISBN 0442261136), p. 188. Retrieved September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

William was a month shy of his seventh birthday in 1804 when his father was infamously killed in a duel with Vice President [[Aaron Burr]]. In 1814, he was admitted to the [[United States Military Academy]], resigning three years later in 1817.&lt;ref name=reed/&gt; Following his resignation from West Point, Hamilton migrated to [[Sangamon County, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=lusk&gt;Lusk, David W.

==Career==
===Political and militia service===
Hamilton first held elected office in 1824 as a member of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] from Sangamon County in 1824.&lt;ref name=reed&gt;Reed, Parker McCobb. ''The Bench and Bar of Wisconsin'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=gzOmY6UBQTcC&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=%22William+S.+Hamilton%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA427,M1 Google Books]), Reed: 1882, pp. 427&amp;ndash;28. Retrieved September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the legislature Hamilton sponsored a bill that imposed a statewide tax intended to fund road repair and maintenance. The tax was proportional to property value, to be paid in labor or money, and replaced an older system which required every able-bodied man to work on the roads five days per year. The bill passed, and the new law was met with much opposition; it was repealed by the next legislature in 1826&amp;ndash;27.&lt;ref name=ford&gt;[[Ford, Thomas]]. ''A History of Illinois, from Its Commencement as a State in 1818 to 1847'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=GAyA6ninhBQC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;vq=William+S.+Hamilton&amp;dq=A+History+of+Illinois#PPA58,M1 Google Books]), Ivison &amp; Phinney: 1854, pp. 58&amp;ndash;59. Retrieved September 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamilton served as [[aide de camp]] to Governor [[Edward Coles]], and while living in Illinois, first in Springfield and later in Peoria, Hamilton worked for the [[General Land Office]] as Deputy Surveyor of Public Lands.&lt;ref name=gara&gt;Gara, Larry. ed. &quot;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/wmh&amp;CISOPTR=26062&amp;CISOSHOW=26008 William S.

Retrieved September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In that position he surveyed [[Springfield Township, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield's township]].  He was also an incorporator of the original [[Illinois and Michigan Canal| Illinois and Michigan Canal Company]], along with Coles and other prominent Illinoisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=James William |authorlink= |title=The Illinois and Michigan Canal: A Study In Economic History |url=https://archive.org/details/illinoismichigan00putn |accessdate=December 18, 2013 |year=1918 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn= |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1827, Hamilton served during the [[Winnebago War]] in the volunteer [[Illinois Militia]] as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]]. Hamilton commanded a [[Company (military unit)|company]] raised in [[Galena, Illinois]] known as the Galena Mounted Volunteers. Hamilton's company was under the command of [[Henry Dodge]] and was mustered into service on August 26, 1827 and released on September 10, 1827.&lt;ref name=hamiltonmuster&gt;&quot;[http://www.geocities.com/old_lead/winwarhamiltonco.htm Muster Role of Captain William Hamilton's Company], via Old Lead Regional Historical Society, transcribed by Jim Hanson and Marjorie Smith from muster rolls in Record Group 94 at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], Washington, D. C. Retrieved September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton moved to Wisconsin and established [[Hamilton's Diggings]] in 1827.

During the April&amp;ndash;August 1832 [[Black Hawk War]], between white settlers in the lead mining regions and [[Sauk people|Sauk]] Chief [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk's]] [[British Band]], Hamilton again served in the volunteer militia. Accounts of the war indicated that Hamilton was often in charge of the militia's indigenous allies. At the war's onset it was known that many of the [[Sioux]] and [[Menominee]] were eager to join the conflict against the Sauk. Hamilton was sent to the [[Michigan Territory]], north of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]], to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies. The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] joined the war.&lt;ref name=smith2&gt;Smith, ''The History of Wisconsin: In Three Parts, Historical, Documentary, and Descriptive'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Hamilton's return to [[Fort Hamilton (Wisconsin)|Fort Hamilton]] with a large group of militia-aligned Native Americans coincided with the arrival of one of the survivors of the June 14 [[Spafford Farm massacre]]. The survivor, Francis Spencer, arrived at the fort around the same time as Hamilton did - accompanied by U.S. aligned [[Menominee]].&lt;ref name=wakefield/&gt;&lt;ref name=butterfield/&gt; Afraid that the fort, like his party at the farm, had also been attacked, Spencer retreated back into the woods. He avoided the fort for between six and nine days, when hunger finally drove him into the open and he realized his mistake.&lt;ref name=wakefield&gt;

Though well known as a [[smelter]] and miner in the lead region of southern Wisconsin and [[northern Illinois]], Hamilton was unable to achieve the political fame he desired.&lt;ref name=gara/&gt;

===Mining career===
When Hamilton moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in the late 1820s he established a [[lead ore]] mine that became known as [[Hamilton's Diggings]]; he later renamed the settlement [[Wiota, Wisconsin|Wiota]].&lt;ref name=reed/&gt; During the 1832 Black Hawk War a fort was erected at Hamilton's Diggings, it was known as Fort Hamilton.&lt;ref name=butterfield&gt;Butterfield, Consul Willshire.

Retrieved September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Two contemporary descriptions of Hamilton's Diggings provide a glimpse into the mining life of Hamilton and the others settled at present-day Wiota. An 1831 account from [[Juliette Kinzie]] noted the unkempt conditions as &quot;shabby&quot; and &quot;unpromising&quot;.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt; Kinzie also decried the foul language from the miners, whom she called the &quot;roughest-looking set of men I ever beheld.&quot;&lt;ref name=trask2&gt;Trask, ''Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The other description of early Wiota was provided by Theodore Rodolf in 1834. Rodolf, a one-time political opponent of Hamilton, contrasted the settlement's apparently rough exterior with small, finer details, such as the presence of a [[quarto]] edition of [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] works, printed in Paris.&lt;ref name=gara/&gt;&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;Murphy, Lucy Eldersveld.

Retrieved September 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[California gold rush|gold was discovered in California]], in 1848, [[gold rush|gold fever]] spread into the Midwest lead-mining region. Hamilton set out for [[California]], arriving in 1849, with high hopes, and new equipment. His life in the west would prove to be a disappointment and he later regretted moving there. Hamilton told a friend in California that he would &quot;rather have been hung in the 'Lead Mines' than to have lived in this miserable hole (California).&quot;&lt;ref name=gara/&gt;

==Personal life==
Hamilton never married and presented a rough, garish appearance.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;
