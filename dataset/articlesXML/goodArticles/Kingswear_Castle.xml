'''Kingswear Castle''' is an artillery fort, built to protect [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth harbour]] in [[Devon]], England. It was constructed between 1491 and 1502 in response to the threat of French attack and was one of the first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain. By the end of the 16th century, however, improvements in the range of artillery weapons had reduced the utility of the castle. It took part in the [[English Civil War]] and continued to be armed until the early 18th century, but fell into ruin. Restored as a [[summer house]] in 1855, in the 21st century it is managed by the [[Landmark Trust]] as a holiday let.

==History==

===15th–16th centuries===
Kingswear Castle was built to protect the coastal town of [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in Devon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1936|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Davison|2000|pp=19, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period, the town's harbour, located in the estuary of the [[River Dart]], was an important trading and fishing port, able to hold up to 600 vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|2000|pp=19–20}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/dartmouth-castle/history/|title=History of Dartmouth Castle|publisher=English Heritage|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of a French invasion, combined with the hope of retaining a valuable royal subsidy, led the town to develop [[Dartmouth Castle]], on the west side of the estuary, into an artillery fort between 1486 and 1495.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|2000|pp=23–24}}; {{harvnb|O'Neil|1936|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on Kingswear began in 1491, with the intention of providing protection to the east side of the estuary, and by the time it was completed in 1502 it formed one of the first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|2000|p=24}}; {{harvnb|Keay|Stanford|2015|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took the form of a three-storeyed, square tower built of [[slate]] rubble with [[red sandstone]] detailing.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1108543|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Historic England|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its large, rectangular [[gun-port]]s with wooden shutters on the ground level matched those at Dartmouth Castle, and looked out close to the water at the entrance to the harbour, covering both the sea and the anchorage itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1936|p=136}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Keay|Stanford|2015|p=60}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/kingswear-castle-8737/#tabs=History|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Landmark Trust|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor would have also held guns and provided accommodation for the garrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keay 2015 60&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Keay|Stanford|2015|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1570s, a survey recommended that four brass artillery guns be kept at the castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keay 2015 60&quot;/&gt; The range of artillery guns soon increased, however, making it unnecessary to have armed forts on both sides of the river and, by the end of the 16th century, the castle's military utility had lessened and it was not normally manned.&lt;ref name=&quot;landmarktrust1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/kingswear-castle-8737/#tabs=History|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Landmark Trust|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th–18th centuries===
At the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] between the supporters of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and those of [[Roundheads|Parliament]] in 1642, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the town invested money in Kingswear's castle doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|2000|p=27}}; {{harvnb|O'Neil|1936|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Maurice of the Palatinate|Prince Maurice]] besieged and took the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|2000|p=28}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1108543|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Historic England|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earthwork fort, called Mount Ridley or Kingsworth, may subsequently have been built to protect the vulnerable position behind Kingswear Castle; an alternative supposition is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|2000|p=28}}; {{harvnb|O'Neil|1936|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1646, [[Thomas Fairfax|Sir Thomas Fairfax]] led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, capturing Kingswear from Sir Henry Cary, the [[High Sheriff of Devon]], who had been left in charge of defending it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davison|2000|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Watkin|1920|pp=12–13}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1108543|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Historic England|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A governor, [[Sir John Fowell, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Fowell]], was appointed to run the local defences, and to prevent smuggling, while Sir Henry was heavily fined by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neil|1936|pp=150–151}}; {{harvnb|Watkin|1920|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1661 and the [[Restoration (England)|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the throne, the guns at Kingswear were mounted on the roof, which had been accidentally burnt down during the fighting in the war and had been replaced with a new lead version.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keay|Stanford|2015|p=61}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/kingswear-castle-8737/#tabs=History|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Landmark Trust|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John retained his role as governor and, although Charles briefly reasserted the rights of the town over the defences, control quickly passed to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/kingswear-castle-8737/#tabs=History|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Landmark Trust|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}; {{harvnb|O'Neil|1936|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, Kingswear had fallen into ruin, although 12-pounder, 9-pounder and 8-pounder (5.4&amp;nbsp;kg, 4&amp;nbsp;kg and 3.6&amp;nbsp;kg) guns were still installed there in 1717.&lt;ref name=&quot;landmarktrust1&quot;/&gt;

===19th–21st centuries===

In 1855, the businessman [[Charles Seale Hayne]] restored Kingswear to form a [[summer house]], using the local architect Thomas Lidstone; the ground floor was redesigned, a conical roof added and a detached round tower constructed on the north-west side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keay|Stanford|2015|p=61}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/kingswear-castle-8737/#tabs=History|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Landmark Trust|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1108543|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Historic England|access-date=16 August 2016}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV8540&amp;resourceID=104|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Heritage Gateway|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]], it was used by the [[Royal Marines]] and the site reinforced by a concrete blockhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;landmarktrust1&quot;/&gt; The [[Landmark Trust]] acquired it in 1987 for use as a holiday let, restoring the ground floor of the main building to its original appearance and recreating the earlier flat, lead roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/kingswear-castle-8737/#tabs=History|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Landmark Trust|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV8540&amp;resourceID=104|title=Kingswear Castle|publisher=Heritage Gateway|access-date=16 August 2016|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is protected under UK law as a [[Grade I listed building]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland1&quot;/&gt;
