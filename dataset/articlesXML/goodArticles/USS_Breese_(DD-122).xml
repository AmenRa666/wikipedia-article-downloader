'''USS ''Breese'' (DD–122)''' was a [[Wickes class destroyer|''Wickes'' class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]], and later redesignated, '''DM-18''' in [[World War II]]. She was the only ship named for [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Kidder Breese]].

Commissioned as a destroyer in 1919, she undertook a number of patrol and training duties along the [[East Coast of the United States]] until being decommissioned in 1922. Overhauled in 1931, she returned to service with the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] on training and patrol for the next 10 years. She was present during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and following this she supported several operations during the war, laying minefields and sweeping for mines in the Pacific. Following the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1946 and broken up.

== Design and construction ==
{{main|Wickes-class destroyer}}

''Breese'' was one of 111 [[Wickes-class destroyer|''Wickes''-class destroyer]]s built by the [[United States Navy]] between 1917 and 1919. She, along with ten of her sisters, were constructed at [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] shipyards in [[Newport News, Virginia]] using specifications and detail designs drawn up by [[Bath Iron Works]].{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=124}}{{sfn|Friedman|2003|p=40}}

She had a [[standard displacement]] of {{convert|1,213|t}} an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|314|ft|5|in}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|31|ft|8|in}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|9|ft|4|in}}. On trials, ''Harding'' reached a speed of {{convert|33.2|knots}}. She was armed with four [[4&quot;/50 caliber gun]]s, two [[3&quot;/23 caliber gun]]s, and twelve [[Mark 15 torpedo|21-inch torpedo tube]]s. She had a regular crew complement of 122 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}} She was driven by two Parsons or Westinghouse turbines, and powered by four Normand boilers.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=124}}

Specifics on ''Breese'''s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of ''Wickes''-class destroyers known unofficially as the 'Liberty Type' to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by [[Bethlehem]], which used [[Curtis steam turbine]]s and [[Yarrow boiler]]s. The Bethlehem destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in [[fuel efficiency|fuel economy]], with most only able to make {{convert|2,300|nmi}} at {{convert|15|knots}} instead of the design standard of {{convert|3,100|nmi}} at {{convert|20|knots}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=124}}{{sfn|Friedman|2003|p=41}} The class also suffered problems with turning and weight. Ships such as ''Breese'', however, performed better than this.{{sfn|Friedman|2003|p=46}}

''Breese'' was the only U.S. Navy ship to be named for [[Kidder Breese]], who had been a U.S. Navy officer during the [[Mexican-American War]] and later the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}}

==Service history==

===Interwar period===
''Breese'' was launched on 11 May 1918 out of Newport News, Virginia. She was sponsored by Gilbert McIlvaine, daughter of Breese; and commissioned 23 October 1918 under the command of [[Lieutenant, junior grade|Lieutenant]] B. Smith. After her commissioning, she reported to the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]] and cruised for several days as an escort for convoys supporting [[World War I]], before the end of the conflict on 11 November. Returning to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] at the end of the war, she was assigned to Destroyer Division 12 and served off the coast of [[Cuba]] on training exercises during the spring of 1919. In July 1919, Destroyer Division 12 was assigned to the [[United States Pacific Fleet]], based at [[San Diego, California]]. For the next year, she served with Destroyer Squadron 4 and, from June 1920, began operating in Rotating Reserve. From October 1920 to June 1922, she participated in division maneuvers and fleet maneuvers with the Pacific Fleet's main battle force, and she was placed out of commission 17 June 1922.{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}}

On 5 January 1931, ''Breese'' was redesignated as a light [[minelayer]], with the [[hull classification symbol]] of DM-18. Following an overhaul and conversion at [[Mare Island Navy Yard]], she was recommissioned on 1 June 1931. She then returned to San Diego for sea trials and standardization tests in her new role. These completed, she departed for [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. She was assigned to Mine Division 1 of the Pacific Fleet, and operated out of [[Hawaii]]an waters. She conducted several training exercises, including with the submarine divisions where she served as a target ship. She also served as a station ship for aircraft. She returned to San Diego in June 1937, and placed out of commission and in reserve on 12 November 1937. On 25 September 1939, ''Breese'' was again recommissioned and assigned to Mine Division 5 of the Pacific Fleet. On 2 November 1939, she arrived at [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] and began to conduct [[Neutrality Patrol]] off the [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] coasts. Throughout 1940, she cruised to different bases along the coastline of [[Alaska]] with the commander of the Alaskan Sector aboard. Upon returning, she rejoined Mine Division 5 in [[San Francisco]] and steamed for Hawaii, returning there on 10 December 1940. Attached to Mine Division 2 in the Pacific Fleet, she took part in training exercises in the operating area and on the [[Maui]] range during much of 1941.{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}}

===World War II===
On 7 December 1941, ''Breese'' was moored in the Middle Loch, northwest of [[Ford Island]]. She was moored to Buoy D-3 alongside a nest of three other minelayers which were also converted ''Wickes'' destroyers; {{USS|Ramsay|DD-124|2}}, {{USS|Montgomery|DD-121|2}}, and {{USS|Gamble|DD-123|2}}. At the outbreak of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack]], her crew was distracted by the initial assault on Ford Island and was buzzed by a flight of [[Nakajima B5N]] [[torpedo bomber]]s.{{sfn|McWilliams|2011|p=411}} ''Breese'' quickly loaded her machine guns and began firing at 07:57.{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}} She and many of the other ships in the area were quickly able to mobilize a strong anti-aircraft defense which lasted throughout the morning.{{sfn|McWilliams|2011|p=359}} She was credited with hits on several [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] aircraft and damaging at least one [[midget submarine]].{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}} ''Breese'' was undamaged in the attack.{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}}

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, she remained berthed in the harbor until leaving on 26 December, carrying mail and orders for other ships. She rendezvoused with {{USS|Southard|DD-207|2}} at the mouth of the harbor to offload this, then steamed east on patrol.{{sfn|McWilliams|2011|p=817}}

On 6 May 1942, she took on 84 survivors of the carrier {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} which had sunk in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Midway]].{{sfn|Cressman|1999|p=102}} During the summer of 1942, she operated out of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]  On 3 August 1942, she, along with minesweepers ''Gamble'' and {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}}, were laying mines in Segond Channel, [[Espiritu Santo]].{{sfn|Cressman|1999|p=112}} Destroyer {{USS|Tucker|DD-374|2}} entered the strait on escort patrol, having not been notified of the minefield, when she struck one of the mines and sank. ''Breese'', which was moored in the channel, rendered aid.{{sfn|McWilliams|2011|p=913}} On 30 September 1942, she was on a nighttime exercise off Espiritu Santo when she was damaged in a collision with the cruiser {{USS|San Francisco|CA-38|2}}.{{sfn|Cressman|1999|p=121}} She carried out minesweeping duties during the consolidation of the [[Solomon Islands]] from 1–13 May 1943, where she was assigned to Task Group 36.5 alongside ''Gamble'', {{USS|Preble|DD-345|2}}, and {{USS|Radford|DD-446|2}}. They laid mined in [[Blackett Strait]] to guard the western approaches to [[Kula Gulf]].{{sfn|Cressman|1999|p=159}}

She supported Allied efforts around [[New Georgia]]-[[Rendova]] [[Vangunu]] from 29 June to 25 August. Assigned to Task Unit 36.2.2, she, ''Preble'' and ''Gamble'' laid mines off [[Shortland Harbor]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].{{sfn|Cressman|1999|p=166}} She then supported the occupation and defense of [[Cape Torokina]] conducting minesweeping duties there from 1 to 8 November. She later supported the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]] landings from 12 to 24 October 1944. She was subsequently among the ships to support the [[Lingayen Gulf]] landings from 4 to 18 January 1945. She supported the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] from 7 February to 7 March. She undertook mine duties supporting the [[Battle of Okinawa]] between 25 March and 30 June. In her final act of the war, she steamed in support of the [[United States Third Fleet]] near mainland Japan between 5 and 31 July. In August and September 1945 ''Breese'' swept mines in the [[East China Sea]] and [[Kyūshū]]-[[Korea]]n area following the end of the war.{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}}

On 7 November 1945, ''Breese'' steamed to the west coast arriving 26 November. She transited the [[Panama Canal]] and arrived at New York City on 13 December. She was decommissioned on 15 January 1946 and sold for scrap on 16 May 1946. She received ten battle stars for her service in World War II.{{sfn|DANFS|1959|p=259}}
