The '''Farouq Brigades''' ({{lang-ar|كتائب الفاروق}}), also spelt '''Farooq''' and '''Farook''', is an armed rebel organisation formed by a number of [[Homs]] based members of the [[Free Syrian Army]] early in the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abouzeid&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria’s Up-and-Coming Rebels: Who Are the Farouq Brigades?|url=http://world.time.com/2012/10/05/syrias-up-and-coming-rebels-who-are-the-farouq-brigades-2/print/|last=Abouzeid |first=Rania|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|date=5 October 2012|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group rapidly expanded in size and prominence in 2012,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abouzeid&quot;/&gt; before suffering internal splits and battlefield reversals in 2013 that greatly reduced its influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;fp211113&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/21/rebels_inc|title=Rebels, Inc.|publisher=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|date=21 November 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 the group was largely defunct, with member factions joining other rebel groups.&lt;ref name=huffpo11april/&gt; The brigades were named Farouq after [[Omar bin al-Khattab]], a [[Sahaba]] (companion) of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and the second [[Caliph]].

== Background ==
The Farouq Brigades emerged from the central city of [[Homs]] just months into the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Its beginnings are as a subunit of the Khalid bin Walid Brigade, a group of defectors from the [[Syrian Army]] that announced its formation in June 2011 and engaged in clashes with members of the Syrian security forces in Homs and [[Al-Rastan]]. During the second half of 2011, Farouq was active in Homs, particularly the [[Baba Amr]] neighborhood. It was led by a defector, Lieutenant Abdul Razaq Tlass, who was a nephew of the former Syrian Defense Minister [[Mustafa Tlass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holliday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria’s Armed Opposition |url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Syrias_Armed_Opposition.pdf|last=Holliday|first=Joseph|publisher=[[Institute for the Study of War]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent success of Farouq in holding territory in Baba Amr lead to the Syrian government escalating their use of force in an [[2012 Homs offensive|offensive in early 2012]], causing heavy casualties amongst the rebels and forcing their retreat into the Homs countryside and the towns of [[Al-Qusayr, Syria|Al-Qusayr]] and Al-Rastan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holliday&quot;/&gt;

In the following months, Farouq absorbed preexisting rebel units and formed new ones across Syria, from [[Daraa]] in the south near the Jordanian border to the Farouq al-Shemal (Northern Farouq) which controlled some of the border posts in the north with Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abouzeid&quot;/&gt;

In September 2012, a large number of [[Islamist]] rebel brigades, including the Farouq Brigades and the [[Suqour al-Sham Brigade|Suquor al-Sham]] formed the [[Syrian Islamic Liberation Front]], under the leadership of Suquor al-Sham commander Ahmed Abu Issa. Abu Issa claimed the new Front had more than 40,000 fighters and aimed to establish a state with an ''Islamic reference''.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters111012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-syria-crisis-rebels-idUSBRE89A0Y920121011|title=Syria's Islamist rebels join forces against Assad|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=15 May 2014|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, the [[BBC]] used an estimate of 20,000 fighters.&lt;ref name=bbc-20130514/&gt; In November 2013 the SILF was superseded by a new rebel coalition called the [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]], however Farouq was not a member of this grouping.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC22Nov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25053525|title=Leading Syrian rebel groups form new Islamic Front|publisher=BBC|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology and funding ==
Jeffrey White, a former U.S. defense intelligence officer with the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] and Joseph Holliday, a research analyst with the [[Institute for the Study of War]] consider the Farouq Brigade to be “moderately Islamist” – that is, neither [[secular]] nor [[Salafis]].&lt;ref name=bbc-20130514/&gt; While many of their fighters wear [[Jihadist]]-style black headbands and beards, it is unclear how much of this is genuine belief and how much is to secure additional funding from Islamist donors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ackerman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Rebels Burn Down a Marijuana Field on Facebook|url=http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/syrian-rebel-facebook/|last=Ackerman|first=Spencer|publisher=[[Wired Magazine]]|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farouq has their own [[public relations]] wing which film their battlefield operations and upload them to [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] with their groups logo. These clips are used for fundraising from Syrians, donors in Gulf states, western sources and Islamist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Battle for Syria: on the ground with the Farouk brigade|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/battle-for-syria-on-the-ground-with-the-farouk-brigade|publisher=[[Channel 4 News]]|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In April 2012, the Farouq Brigade was accused of collecting [[jizyah]], or taxes imposed on non-Muslims living under Muslim rule, in Christian areas of Homs province. However, the group denied this and the [[Institute for the Study of War]] said that &quot;the accusation is likely from the Assad regime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria’s Maturing Insurgency|url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Syrias_MaturingInsurgency_21June2012.pdf|last=Holliday|first=Joseph|publisher=[[Institute for the Study of War]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also reports that the group had expelled 90% of the Christian population of Homs City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fides.org/aree/news/newsdet.php?idnews=31228&amp;lan=eng|title=Abuse of the opposition forces, &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of Christians in Homs, where Jesuits remains|agency=Agenzia Fides|accessdate=15 May 2014|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fides.org/en/news/31262?idnews=31262&amp;lan=eng#.U3TibHaGe0o|title=The Jesuits: &quot;Christians have fled from Homs, not thrown out by Islamists&quot;|agency=Agenzia Fides|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jesuits]] in Homs disputed the cause of the exodus, and said that Christians were not targeted specifically, but fled the city on their own initiative because of the ongoing conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=13804|title=Are Islamists targeting Christians in Homs? Catholic groups dispute cause of exodus|publisher=catholicCulture.org|date=27 March 2012|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to interviews made by ''McClatchy Newspapers'' of refugees in Lebanon, there was no targeting of Christians because of their religion. Rather, a number of government-affiliated Christians were seized by the Farouq Brigades, which led to some Christians fleeing the area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In August 2012, Lieutenant Abdul Razzaq Tlass, one of the Farouq Brigades top leaders, was implicated in a [[sex scandal]] when video was posted to [[YouTube]] appearing to show him having [[cybersex]] with a woman through [[Skype]]. Tlass and others claimed the video was a fabrication by the Syrian Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian Rebel Leader Accuses Regime Of Fabricating Scandalous Video|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/08/20/159375256/syrian-rebel-leader-accuses-regime-of-fabricating-scandalous-video|last=Marrouch|first=Rima|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=15 May 2014|date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, by October 2012 Tlass was replaced as commander by Abu Sayeh Juneidi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lund&quot;/&gt;

In September 2012, the northern branch of the Farouq Brigades was accused of kidnapping and killing Abu Mohamad al-Absi, a Syrian Jihadist who led a group of foreign fighters. The local Farouq Brigade leader said the foreign fighters had ignored their demands to leave the Bab al-Hawa border post. He said that al-Absi had &quot;raised the al-Qaeda flag, and al-Qaeda is not welcomed by us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abouzeid&quot;/&gt;

In May 2013, a video was posted on the internet showing rebel commander Abu Sakkar cutting organs from the dead body of a Syrian soldier and putting one of them in his mouth, &quot;as if he is taking a bite out of it&quot;. He called rebels to follow his example and terrorize the Alawite sect, which mostly backs Assad. [[Human Rights Watch]] confirmed the authenticity of the footage, and stated that &quot;The mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime. But the even more serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and violence&quot;. It said that Abu Sakkar appears to be a commander of the &quot;Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade&quot;. The BBC called it an offshoot or sub-unit of the Farouq Brigades, saying that &quot;the Farouq Brigade appears to be actually a complex of sub-units with a tangled pedigree&quot;.&lt;ref name=bbc-20130514/&gt; Human Rights Watch said &quot;It is not known whether the Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade operates within the command structure of the Free Syrian Army&quot;. The incident was condemned by the FSA's Chief of Staff and the Syrian National Coalition said that the commander would be put on trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/13/syria-brigade-fighting-homs-implicated-atrocities |title=Syria: Brigade Fighting in Homs Implicated in Atrocities|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22519770|title=Outrage at Syrian rebel shown 'eating soldier's heart'|publisher=BBC|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebel Supreme Military Council called for Abu Sakkar's arrest, saying it wants him &quot;dead or alive&quot;. Abu Sakkar said that the mutilation was revenge. He claimed he found a video on the soldier's cellphone in which the soldier sexually abuses a woman and her two daughters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2013/05/14/we-will-slaughter-all-of-them-an-interview-with-the-man-behind-the-syrian-atrocity-video/?iid=gs-main-lead|title=&quot;Exclusive: &quot;We Will Slaughter All of Them.&quot; The Rebel Behind The Syrian Atrocity Video|publisher=Time|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other videos showing Assad loyalists raping, torturing, [[dismemberment|dismembering]] and killing people, including children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10066988/Syrian-cannibal-rebel-explains-his-actions.html|title=Syrian 'cannibal' rebel explains his actions|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Austria]], a former fighter of the Farouq Brigades was prosecuted for the [[summary execution]] of 20 wounded Syrian Army soldiers while in Homs between 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tirol.orf.at/news/stories/2808022/|title=For the first time a murder case for acts in Syria|work=Tirol|date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decline ==
By November 2013, the Farouq Brigades was reported as having suffered a serious decline in strength and area of influence, with it having splintered into numerous smaller factions,&lt;ref name=&quot;fp211113&quot;/&gt; such as the Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade and the Islamic al-Farouq Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/5243eca24.html|title=Kata'ib al-Farouq al-Islamiya: A Key Armed Opposition Group in the Battle to Cut Assad Off from Damascus |publisher=[[Jamestown Foundation]]|date=19 September 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24403003|title=Syria crisis: Guide to armed and political opposition|publisher=BBC News|date=18 November 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's presence outside Homs was said to have declined after losing feuds with more hardline Islamist rebel groups like [[Ahrar ash-Sham]] and [[Jabhat al-Nusra]], resulting in Farouq being expelled from [[Raqqa Governorate]] and losing control of the strategic border crossing at [[Tal Abyad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fp211113&quot; /&gt; By 2014, the rebel [[Hazzm Movement]] contained several groups that were formerly part of the Farouq Brigades.&lt;ref name=huffpo11april&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-lister/american-anti-tank-weapon_b_5119255.html|title=American Anti-Tank Weapons Appear in Syrian Rebel Hands (Updated)|publisher=Huffington Post|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
