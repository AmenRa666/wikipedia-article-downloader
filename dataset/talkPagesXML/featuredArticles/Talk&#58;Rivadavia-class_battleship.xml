== Convergence with articles in Spanish &quot;WikiPedia&quot; about this class and the ships that belonged to it ==

I'm currently trying to homogeinize the existing/future articles in both the English and the Spanish &quot;Wikipedia&quot; related to this battleship class.&lt;br&gt;
I will concentrate first in having the same articles, with similar contents and layout (albeit this will be based in the current, outdated template that the existing articles have).At a minimum I'll add 1 article to the Spanish Wikipedia (to cover the &quot;Rivadavia class&quot;) and 2 articles to the English one (to cover both class members' history).&lt;br&gt;
Once this is done, I'll try to improve the layout of all these articles (6 in total) based on more current templates (eg: as those used in the &quot;Iowa&quot; battleship class articles, which seem to be pretty thorough and well done).&lt;br&gt; Regards,[[User:DPdH|DPdH]] ([[User talk:DPdH|talk]]) 06:48, 23 April 2008 (UTC)

:''Status Update'': still trying... too few time! Thanks to those who contributed in the meanwhile. Cheers, [[User:DPdH|DPdH]] ([[User talk:DPdH|talk]]) 23:20, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
::Please discuss anything relating to this class at [[WP:OMT]] to centralize all discussion on battleships with interested editors. -'''[[User:MBK004|MBK]]'''&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:MBK004|004]]&lt;/sub&gt; 22:44, 13 December 2009 (UTC)

== Orphaned references in [[:Rivadavia class battleship]] ==
I check pages listed in [[:Category:Pages with incorrect ref formatting]] to try to fix reference errors. One of the things I do is look for content for [[User:AnomieBOT/docs/OrphanReferenceFixer|orphaned references]] in wikilinked articles. I have found content for some of [[:Rivadavia class battleship]]'s orphans, the problem is that I found more than one version. I can't determine which (if any) is correct for ''this'' article, so I am asking for a sentient editor to look it over and copy the correct ref content into this article.

&lt;b&gt;Reference named &quot;Hore&quot;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From [[ARA Moreno]]: Hore, ''Battleships of World War I, 91.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From [[ARA Rivadavia]]: Hore (2006), p. 91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I apologize if any of the above are effectively identical; I am just a simple computer program, so I can't determine whether minor differences are significant or not. [[User:AnomieBOT|AnomieBOT]][[User talk:AnomieBOT|&lt;font color=&quot;#888800&quot;&gt;⚡&lt;/font&gt;]] 07:26, 31 May 2010 (UTC)

== Notes ==
*&quot;A third dreadnought, provided for in the contract, was strongly supported in Argentina during 1910&quot; ... can you give me any details on who was supporting it, and how, other than the newspapers? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 15:40, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
**I'm not clear on what the first half of that paragraph is saying actually, please give it another look. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 15:45, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
***Hmm, ''I'' understand it, but I can easily see why everyone else wouldn't. :) —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
*&quot;... deal, it was alleged ...&quot;: by Germany? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 17:45, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
**Exactly —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
*&quot;The United States made note ...&quot;: who in the U.S.?  The reference seems to be a story in the ''New York Times'', so I'll attribute it unless you've got another source handy.  And the paper says &quot;built, building or ordered&quot;; does that sound right? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 17:56, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
**Same as below —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
*&quot;The United States abhorred ...&quot;: who did?  When you say the U.S. exerted diplomatic influence, we don't really have to say who or how, the reader can assume that diplomats under the authority of the executive branch were involved.  But countries can't really be &quot;anxious&quot; or &quot;abhor&quot; things; we need a little more detail. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 18:08, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

*I take that back ... there's a lot of &quot;diplomatic pressure&quot; in the article, and I'm not sure I know what you mean by that ... are we talking about diplomats? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 18:23, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
**Oops, I don't know how I didn't think of this while writing the article. Livermore gives a lot of the credit to an American diplomat in Argentina, but I didn't mention his name to make the article simpler. Reading your comments, I think this goal was in error. I'll rework this in the next few days when I am back home. —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

**That was supposed to be ft|8.5|in —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
*&quot;A more reasonable estimate would be {{formatnum:90}}&amp;deg; on their sides.&quot;: might be a good sentence to omit since it sounds hypothetical and it's sourced only to navweaps. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 19:50, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
*&quot;loaded in a dedicated compartment&quot;: not sure what this means. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 20:10, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
**A separate compartment that did not hold shells, bunk crew, etc.&amp;mdash;it was dedicated to launching the torpedoes. Too specific? —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt;Are the rangefinders 15 feet long?  Does that help identify them?  My instinct would be not to give the length, or to substitute a model name or number, unless they were known by their length.  (And if we stick with the length, my call would be not to convert to metric.)&lt;/s&gt; - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 20:15, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
**Good point, removed —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

**I've changed this, but not to the suggested wording.

**I think that is in the service histories, which I haven't rewrote yet. :) —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[WP:OMT|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;majestic titan)]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:34, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

== J's comments ==
The article was just promoted (yay) ... Ed, I don't have some of these sources, can you help with J's FAC comments when you get a chance? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 12:55, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

== Line drawing ==
Note to me (and anyone interested, really): there's a good line drawing of the ship in Google Books [http://books.google.com/books?id=qXcSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=329 here]. [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]] [[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:04, 9 March 2013 (UTC)

== Additional source ==
Just a note for me (and anyone else interested), there is an additional source on these ships' launching [http://books.google.com/books?id=827mAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 here]. [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]] [[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:21, 2 June 2013 (UTC)

== Quote templates ==
{{resolved}}

I recently placed {{tl|bq}} (which used raw styling markup) in this template with {{tl|quote}}. After an unexplained revert, and another with an abusive edit summary, this has now been replaced with bare HTML markup.

The three versions are styled thus:

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;templatequote bq &quot; {{#if:|id=&quot;{{{id}}}&quot;}} style=&quot;{{#if:|margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -0.5em;|margin-top:1em;}} font-size:90%&quot; {{#if:|title=&quot;{{{title}}}&quot;}}&gt;'''Template:BQ (with &quot;style=font-size:90%&quot;):''' &lt;br /&gt;{{lorem ipsum}}{{#if:
 |&lt;div class=&quot;templatequotecite&quot;&gt;&amp;#8212;{{{2}}}{{#if:
  |,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;{{{3}}}{{#if:|, ''{{{4}}}''}}&lt;/span&gt;
 }}&lt;/div&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!--since subst--&gt;

{{quote|'''Template:Quote:''' &lt;br /&gt;{{lorem ipsum}} }}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:90%;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:90%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;:''' &lt;br /&gt;{{lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As can be seen, there are absolutely no style differences between the first two, while the latter has smaller - and thus harder to read -  text. Of the three options, only {{tl|quote}} prevents raw markup from being exposed to editors. It should be restored. &lt;span class=&quot;vcard&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;nickname&quot;&gt;Pigsonthewing&lt;/span&gt;); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:01, 21 October 2014 (UTC)</text>
