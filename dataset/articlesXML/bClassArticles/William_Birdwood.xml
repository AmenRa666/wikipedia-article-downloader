He went on to be General Officer Commanding the [[Northern Command (India)|Northern Army]] in India in 1920 and [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], in 1925.

==Early life==
William Riddell Birdwood was born on 13 September 1865 in [[Khadki|Kirkee, India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=31898|title=Birdwood, William Riddell|last=James|first=Robert Rhodes|authorlink=Robert Rhodes James|origyear=2004|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Herbert Mills Birdwood]], born in Bombay and educated in the UK, had returned to India in 1859 after passing the Indian Civil Service examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB2&quot;&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=31897|title=Birdwood, Herbert Mills|last=Brown|first=F.

Birdwood served in the [[Second Boer War]], initially as brigade-major with a mounted brigade in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] from 10 January 1900 and then as Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General on the staff of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] from 15 October 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27382|supp=|startpage=8563 |date=3 December 1901|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to brevet major on 20 November 1901&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27359|supp=|startpage=6325 |date=27 September 1901|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] in October 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=27383 |date=6 December 1901 |startpage=8643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heath44&gt;Heathcote, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; he became Military secretary to Lord Kitchener on 5 June 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27460|supp=|startpage=4969 |date=1 August 1902|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed him on his return to the United Kingdom on board the ''SS Orotava'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa – Troops returning home |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived in [[Southampton]] on 12 July 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Kitchener′s return |day_of_week=Monday |date=14 July 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36819| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|lieutenant-colonel]] in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue= 27448 |supp=yes |startpage=4191 |endpage=4194 |date= 26 June 1902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kitchener went to India as Commander-in-Chief in November 1902, Birdwood joined him there as Assistant Military Secretary.&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt; He was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 9 May 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27578|supp=|startpage=4592 |date=21 July 1903|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed Military Secretary to Lord Kitchener with the rank of full [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] on 26 June 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27851|supp=yes|startpage=7425 |date=7 November 1905|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been appointed an [[Aide-de-Camp]] to [[Edward VII|the King]] on 14 February 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27885|supp=|startpage=1054 |date=13 February 1906|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was given command of the [[Kohat Brigade]] on the North West Frontier in 1908&lt;ref&gt;Tucker; Roberts, p.388&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to temporary [[brigadier-general]] on 28 June 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28288|supp=|startpage=6874 |date=14 September 1909|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallipoli===
[[File:Anzac Cove.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Anzac Cove looking towards Ari Burnu, 1915]]
In November 1914 Birdwood was instructed by Kitchener to form an army [[corps]] from the Australian and New Zealand troops that were training in Egypt.&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] on 12 December 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29115|supp=yes|startpage=3099  |date=29 March 1915|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given command of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]].&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt; Kitchener instructed General [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Sir Ian Hamilton]], Commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], to carry out an operation to capture the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula and placed Birdwood's ANZAC Corps under Hamilton's command.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Hamilton ordered Birdwood to carry out a [[landing at Anzac Cove|landing]] on 25 April 1915 north of [[Kabatepe]] at a site now known as [[ANZAC Cove]].&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt; The ANZAC Corps encountered high ridges, narrow gullies, dense scrub and strong [[Turkey|Turkish]] resistance and became pinned down.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Major-General [[William Bridges (general)|William Bridges]] and Major-General [[Alexander Godley]], the divisional commanders, were both of the view that the Allied forces, dealing with stiffer-than-expected resistance, should be evacuated ahead of an expected attack by Turkish forces.&lt;ref name=Bean456&gt;Bean, 1981, pp. 456–457&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hamilton ordered them to hold fast.&lt;ref name=Bean460&gt;Bean, 1981, pp. 460–461&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:W. R. Birdwood.jpg|thumb|right|250px|W. R. Birdwood]]
Birdwood took effective command of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]], i.e. all Australian Forces in May 1915 while still commanding Allied troops on the ground at Gallipoli.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He launched a major attack on the Turks in August 1915 (the [[Battle of Sari Bair]]) but still failed to dislodge them from the peninsula.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Notwithstanding this he was the only corps commander opposed to abandoning Gallipoli.&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt; He was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant-general on 28 October 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29341|supp=yes|startpage=10615  |date=27 October 1915|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given command of the newly formed [[Dardanelles Army]]: the one outstanding success of the campaign was the evacuation led by Birdwood, which took place in December 1915 and January 1916, when the entire force was withdrawn before any Turkish reaction.&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt; 

===Western Front===
In February 1916 the Australian and New Zealand contingents, back in Egypt, underwent reorganisation to incorporate the new units and reinforcements that had accumulated during 1915: the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps was replaced by two corps, [[I ANZAC Corps]] and [[II ANZAC Corps]], and Birdwood reverted to the command of II ANZAC Corps. When I ANZAC Corps became the first to depart for France, Birdwood, as senior corps commander, took over command.&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt;

Birdwood was promoted to the permanent rank of full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] on 23 October 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30376|supp=yes|startpage=11661  |date=12 November 1917|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with command of a formation then known as the [[Australian Corps]] in November 1917.&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt; He was also appointed [[Aide-de-Camp General]] to [[George V|the King]] on 2 November 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30365|supp=|startpage=11361  |date=2 November 1917|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given command of the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fifth Army]] on 31 May 1918 and led the Army at the liberation of [[Lille]] in October 1918 and at the liberation of [[Tournai]] in November 1918.&lt;ref name=heath44/&gt;

Birdwood was made Baronet of Anzac and of Totnes, in the County of Devon on 29 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31708|supp=|startpage=15988|date=30 December 1919|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He toured Australia to great acclaim in 1920 and then became General Officer Commanding the [[Northern Command (India)|Northern Army]] in India later that year.&lt;ref name=heath45&gt;Heathcote, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 20 March 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33031|supp=|startpage=1954  |date=20 March 1925|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, having been appointed a Member of the Executive Council of the [[Governor-General of India]] in July 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33069|supp=|startpage=4957  |date=24 July 1925|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he went on to be  [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], in August 1925.&lt;ref name=heath45/&gt;

After leaving the service in 1930, Birdwood made a bid to become [[Governor-General of Australia]]. He had the backing of the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]] and the British government. However, the Australian [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[James Scullin]] insisted that his Australian nominee [[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]] be appointed.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Instead Birdwood was appointed Master of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], on 20 April 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66643#s11 |title=The colleges and halls – Peterhouse|publisher= British History Online|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he wrote for the Western Australian distance education magazine ''[[Our Rural Magazine]]'' claiming that he had two granddaughters making good use of distance courses for educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32812573|title=Our rural magazine|date=18 October 1934|publisher=The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879–1954)|page= 14|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from academic work in 1938.&lt;ref name=heath45/&gt;

His autobiography ''Khaki and Gown'' (1941) was followed by ''In my time: recollections and anecdotes'' (1946).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; Birdwood died at [[Hampton Court Palace]] where he lived in Grace-and-favour apartments on 17 May 1951.  He was buried at Twickenham Cemetery with full [[military honours]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; The Australian Government still pays for the upkeep of his grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miranda|first1=Charles|title=Brit revered by Diggers|work=Courier-Mail|date=11 April 2015|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
