[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir Henry Conyers Leach''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|DL}} (18 November 1923 – 26 April 2011) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer who, as [[First Sea Lord|First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff]] during the early 1980s, was instrumental in convincing British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] that [[Falklands War|retaking the Falkland Islands from Argentina]] was feasible. On account of the determination he showed in the matter, journalist and political commentator [[Andrew Marr]] described him as Thatcher's &quot;knight in shining gold braid&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/naval-obituaries/8474861/Admiral-of-the-Fleet-Sir-Henry-Leach.html |title=Admiral of the Fleet Sir Henry Leach |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born the third son of naval officer [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] and Evelyn Burrell Leach (née Lee), Leach was educated at [[St Peter's Court]], [[Broadstairs]], and the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt;

==Naval career==
Leach joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[cadet]] in 1937. After the [[Second World War]] started in 1939, he served on the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}} in the South Atlantic and the cruiser {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}} in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; Promoted to [[midshipman]] on 1 January 1941,&lt;ref name=heath151&gt;Heathcote, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; he was assigned to {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}. Before he could take up the post, however, his father was given command, so he was reassigned to {{HMS|Mauritius|80|6}}. The ''Mauritius'' soon went into refit in [[Singapore]], during which time Leach was assigned to the [[Command center|war room]] there as a plotting officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; While in Singapore, the ''Prince of Wales'' was sunk by the Japanese off Singapore, and Leach's father died in this action.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' notes that &quot;[s]urvivors of the action remembered a forlorn midshipman searching for his father, who was among those lost. Only two nights earlier, Leach and his father had enjoyed a [[gin sling]] and a swim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Battleships: Terror from above, Documentary |year=2001 |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Battleships-Terror-Above-1939-Present/dp/B00005AA3F}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next post was on the destroyer {{HMS|Sardonyx}} before being promoted to [[sub-lieutenant]] on 1 October 1942 and posted to {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}}, the flagship of the [[Home Fleet]] in January 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt;

[[File:HMS Javelin 1941 IWM FL 10524.jpg|thumb|left|The destroyer {{HMS|Javelin|F61|6}} in which Leach served as the navigating officer during the Second World War]]
Leach was promoted to [[lieutenant]] in October 1943.&lt;ref name=heath151/&gt; Leach was in command of the &quot;A&quot; turret and he was involved in the [[Battle of the North Cape]] in December 1943.&lt;ref name=heath151/&gt; In autumn 1944, he was posted to {{HMS|Javelin|F61|6}} as the navigating officer. During his posting on ''Javelin'', a mutiny broke out whilst Leach was the duty officer: he &quot;conducted himself well under difficult circumstances&quot; and, after the mutiny was put down, the captain and first lieutenant were re-appointed. Leach was given the position as first lieutenant and the ship was transformed within a few weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt;

In April 1946, Leach transferred to the destroyer {{HMS|Chequers||6}}. He was only at this post for a short time as he decided to gain his qualifications as a gunnery specialist at the shore establishment {{HMS|Excellent|shore establishment|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; After qualifying, he remained at the school as a gunnery instructor until he was posted as gunnery officer to the Second Minesweeping Flotilla in the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref name=heath151/&gt; He was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] on 1 February 1952 and attended the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval Staff College]], before becoming a staff officer for the [[Naval Brigade]] in London for the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation of the Queen]].&lt;ref name=heath151/&gt; In July 1953, he was posted as gunnery officer of the 5th Cruiser Squadron in {{HMS|Newcastle|C76|6}} and saw service at the end of the [[Korean War]]. He also saw service in the [[Malayan Emergency]] of 1955 when HMS ''Newcastle'' supported the Army and Royal Marines.&lt;ref name=heath151/&gt; He was promoted to [[commander]] on 30 June 1955 and served as application commander responsible for bringing the navy's first [[surface-to-air missile]], the [[Sea Slug (missile)|Sea Slug]], into service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; He was then posted to the [[Admiralty]] in 1957 and was given his first command in charge of the destroyer {{HMS|Dunkirk|D09|6}} in the [[Mediterranean]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=heath152&gt;Heathcote, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leach was posted to the Training Directorate in the Admiralty in July 1961 and then attended the [[Joint Service Defence College]] before receiving promotion to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] on 31 December 1961.&lt;ref name=heath152/&gt; He became Chief Staff Officer (Plans and Operations) for the [[Eastern Fleet|Far East Fleet]] in July 1962 and organised naval support for British ground forces deployed during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]].&lt;ref name=heath152/&gt; He was appointed captain of the 27th Escort Squadron, which he commanded from the ''Leander''-class frigate {{HMS|Galatea|F18|6}}, in November 1965.&lt;ref name=heath152/&gt; An appointment at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] followed when he became Director of Naval Plans there in February 1968 before he was given another command, that of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Albion|R07|6}}, in March 1970.&lt;ref name=heath152/&gt; Leach was a strong supporter of the abolition of the [[Rum ration|daily issue]] of [[rum]] at that time.&lt;ref name=heath152/&gt; He was appointed Naval [[Aide-de-Camp]] to [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] on 7 July 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=45168 |supp=yes |startpage=8853 |date=7 August 1970 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Albion.jpg|thumb|left|The aircraft carrier {{HMS|Albion|R07|6}} which Leach commanded in the early 1970s]]
Leach became Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Policy) at the Ministry of Defence in April 1971, receiving promotion to [[rear admiral]] on 7 July 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=45410 |supp=yes |startpage=6943 |date=28 June 1971 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then became Flag Officer First Flotilla in May 1974, with promotion to [[vice admiral]] on 6 July 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=46363 |supp=yes |startpage=8525 |date=8 October 1974 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff]] in January 1976,&lt;ref name=heath152/&gt; and having been appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1977 [[New Year Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=47102 |supp=yes |startpage=2 |date=30 December 1976 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was promoted to full [[admiral]] on 30 March 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=47184 |supp=yes |startpage=4281 |date=28 March 1977 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on appointment as [[Commander-in-Chief Fleet]] and [[NATO]] Commander-in-Chief, Channel and Commander-in-Chief Eastern Atlantic.&lt;ref name=heath152/&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1978 [[Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=47549 |supp=yes |startpage=6230 |date=2 June 1978 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leach was appointed [[First Sea Lord]] and Chief of Naval Staff on 6 July 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=47931 |supp=yes |startpage=10651 |date=20 August 1979 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in that role fiercely resisted naval cuts proposed by Defence Secretary [[John Nott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/30/thatcher-warned-defence-cuts-falklands |title=Thatcher warned of defence cuts dangers before Falklands war |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falklands War===

[[File:The Falklands Conflict, April - June 1982 FKD2601.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Falkands War: Leach is second from the left]]
On 31 March 1982, soon after the [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Argentine invasion of the Falklands]], Leach brushed aside serious doubts from the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] Sir [[John Nott]] and addressed the Prime Minister on the appropriate course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief of the Defence Staff at the time was on his way back from a foreign visit, and in addressing the Prime Minister, Leach effectively bypassed the Acting Chief of the Defence Staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; When he was asked if retaking the islands was possible, he replied &quot;Yes we can recover the islands.&quot; He then added &quot;and we must!&quot; [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] replied &quot;Why?&quot; Leach exclaimed &quot;''Because if we do not, or if we pussyfoot in our actions and do not achieve complete success, in another few months we shall be living in a different country whose word counts for little.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; Leach then explained how the task force would take shape and what ships would be involved: when asked about the lack of available aircraft carriers, Leach reassured the Prime Minister that the two small carriers available would suffice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; Thatcher approved this and preparations were made to send a task force to set sail to retake the Falklands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; On account of his determination, [[Andrew Marr]] referred to Leach as Thatcher's &quot;Knight in Shining Gold Braid&quot; in his documentary series ''[[Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain|History of Modern Britain]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; Upon his retirement in December 1982, Leach was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=49174 |supp=yes |startpage=15293 |date=22 November 1982 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In retirement, Leach published his memoirs entitled ''Endure no Makeshifts''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; He involved himself in several charitable organisations and acted as President of the Sea Cadet Association from 1983 to 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; He was the Chairman of the Council of the [[King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes|King Edward VII Hospital]] as well as being a chairman of the Royal Navy Club of 1765 &amp; 1785 (United 1889).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalnavyclub.org/History.html |title=History |publisher=Royal Navy Club of 1765 &amp; 1785 (United 1889) |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was announced that the new [[Navy Command Headquarters]] building of the Royal Navy at [[Whale Island, Hampshire|Whale Island]], [[Portsmouth]], was to be named the &quot;Sir Henry Leach Building&quot; in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/69FD7584-CA23-431A-8064-FCB04C09F8C1/0/whaleisland.pdf |title=Henry Leach Building, New Naval HQ Whale Island |publisher=Ministry of Defence |work=Defence Estates |year=2004 |accessdate=27 August 2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leach lived at [[Wonston]] in [[Hampshire]]&lt;ref name=heath153&gt;Heathcote, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=52975 |supp=yes |startpage=10910 |date=29 June 1992 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interests included shooting, fishing and gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/apr/26/admiral-of-the-fleet-sir-henry-leach-obituary |title=Obituary: Admiral of the Fleet Sir Henry Leach |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 26 April 2011 at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt; A Service of Thanksgiving held in his honour was attended by representatives of the British Royal Family, including the current First Sea Lord [[Mark Stanhope|Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope]] in attendance on behalf of [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=225393880823021 |title=Court Circular |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Leach married Mary Jean McCall, daughter of Admiral [[Henry McCall|Sir Henry McCall]], in 1958. They had two daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph obit.&quot;/&gt;
