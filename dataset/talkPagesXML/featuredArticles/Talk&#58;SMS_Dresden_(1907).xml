Why isn't it mentioned that the &quot;After a few shots were fired, the Dresden ran up a white flag &quot; were illegal, as the ship was in a Chilean harbour which was neutral? So the shots were done ignoring the neutral status of the place where the ship was.
:Err because it wasn't illegal.  Dresden wasn't in a neutral harbour, she was anchored in a bay off a neutral island.  If she had put into a neutral harbour, she would have been interned, that is to say the neutral country would have taken the ship over to prevent it being used as an enemy warship in the future, thus violating their neutrality.  She was a German warship flying German colours.  If anyone was being illegal, it was the Dresden, violating neutral territorial waters. [[User:Benea|Benea]] 20:58, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

== I was illegal. ==

As my Uncle always told me, the Ship was allready officialy turned over to Chile. It was no official Harbour, but clearly in Chilenian Territory. The Engine was worne out and ther was no Cole left. My Grandfather was one the eight German Man killed. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:77.128.52.153|77.128.52.153]] ([[User talk:77.128.52.153|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/77.128.52.153|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:Unless you have a reliable source stating that the ship was indeed already legally transferred to Chile, we cannot accept your assertions. I myself doubt such a document exists, given the ship wasn't in a Chilean harbor, and it was still flying its ensign.

It is very clear that the behavior of the british forces were complettly illeagal. It has nothing to do with &quot;fairplay&quot; - more it was the &quot;my country first&quot; attitude. This should be mentioned on the british wikipedia page as it is mentioned on the german wikipedia page.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/87.123.70.181|87.123.70.181]] ([[User talk:87.123.70.181|talk]]) 14:00, 5 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The ship was anchored within the territorial waters of Chile or the chilean island &quot;Más a Tierra&quot;, in front of the beach, flying a white flag and definitely no ensign.
&quot; ... Im Ersten Weltkrieg stellte sich der deutsche Kreuzer SMS Dresden am 14. März 1915 nach Verfolgung durch die britischen Kreuzer Kent, Glasgow und Orama in der Cumberlandbucht der Insel Más a Tierra unter chilenische Hoheit. Die englischen Schiffe eröffneten das Feuer und die Dresden geriet in Brand. ...&quot; 
The Dresden was shot without negotiations or contact, as soon as the british ships were at firing range. There was no contact of any of the german officers with their british adversaries, this is simply not true but most probably propaganda.
When the SMS &quot;Dresden&quot; began to burn, the Captain tried to scuttle the ship. The crew had already evacuated to the island before. English rumours said it was a retaliation from Churchill, ordering to sink the SMS &quot;Dresden&quot; at any cost and &quot; ... kill the crew or take prisoners, whatever you see fit&quot;, as he already had ordered to do with shipwrecked german soldiers from U-boats.
The papers are in the british archives (only to be opened in 2018) and the german Bundearchiv. The surviving, then first officer of the SMS &quot;Dresden&quot; was the later SD-chief Wilhelm Canaris.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/79.238.15.14|79.238.15.14]] ([[User talk:79.238.15.14|talk]]) 13:26, 12 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
: It should be added that the Dresden, awaiting a Chilean vessel to surrender to, had lowered and tied down her guns. This did not prevent the gallant British navy from opening up on this easy stationary target, killing, not wounding eight crew members. Of course they must have been wounded, before they died. An elucidating example that almost a hundred years after the event a WP moderator, possibly a British national, has difficulty acknowledging a historical fact. Phrases in the passive voice &quot;some shots were fired&quot; leave it open as to who actually fired. The Dresden with her guns tied down and the majority of her crew ashore? What did Winston Churchill, who had in all likelihood ordered the unconditional sinking of the Dresden, say about the authors of history?

==No. of propellers==
The info. box says ship had two propellers. German Wiki says four (''Die &quot;Dresden&quot; verfügte über vier Propeller....''). [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 14:31, 2 April 2013 (UTC)

:According to Gröner, she only had 2 Parsons turbines - don't know where the other two screws would have come from ;) [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 14:38, 2 April 2013 (UTC)

::That's logical. Guess Ger. Wiki is wrong ... OTOH Spanish Wiki says four, and while French Wiki says two, it also seems to say that in addition to two turbines ''Dresden'' had two triple-expansion, i.e. piston, engines — although I must admit my French is rudimentary. [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 16:33, 2 April 2013 (UTC)

:::PS. English and German entries on the succeeding [[Kolberg-class cruiser]]s list four propellers for those ships. [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 16:39, 2 April 2013 (UTC)
