[[Air Vice-Marshal]] '''William Hopton (Bill) Anderson''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (30 December 1891&amp;nbsp;– 30 December 1975) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He flew with the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in World War&amp;nbsp;I, earning the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Croix de guerre (Belgium)|Belgian Croix de guerre]], and leading [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;3]] and [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF|7 Squadrons]]. Anderson commanded the Australian Air Corps during its brief existence in 1920, before joining the fledgling RAAF the following year. The service's third most senior officer, he primarily held posts on the Australian Air Board in the inter-war years. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1934, and promoted to [[air commodore]] in 1938.

When World War&amp;nbsp;II broke out, Anderson was Air Member for Supply. In 1940 he acted as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] between the resignation of Air Vice-Marshal [[Stanley Goble]] in January and the arrival of Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]], [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], the next month. He led the newly formed [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central]] and [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area Command]]s between December 1940 and July 1943, briefly returning to the Air Board as Air Member for Organisation and Equipment in 1941–42. Anderson was founding Commandant of the RAAF Staff School from July to November 1943, and held this post again from October 1944 until his retirement in April 1946. Known to his colleagues as &quot;Andy&quot; or &quot;Mucker&quot;, he died on his birthday in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Anderson, William Hopton&quot;, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and World War I==
[[File:E04320No.3SquadronR.E.8.jpg|thumb|left|250px|R.E.8 of No. 3 Squadron in Belgium, 1919|alt=Single-engined military biplane with two men in the cockpit, parked in front of a large tent]]
Born on 30 December 1891 in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], Victoria, Bill Anderson was the third son of surveyor Edward Anderson, from England, and his wife Florence, a native Victorian. The youth was educated at [[Melbourne Grammar School|Melbourne Church of England Grammar School]], where he joined the [[Australian Army Cadets|cadet corps]]. He began his professional military career as a [[Royal Australian Artillery|Royal Australian (Garrison) Artillery]] officer in December 1910, before transferring to the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]], based at [[Rabaul]] in what was then [[German New Guinea]], in March 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The following January, Anderson joined the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as a [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]], serving with [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in Palestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/03.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29757|supp=yes|startpage=9188|date=19 September 1916|accessdate=on 10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gazette ref not really needed, kept here for completeness--&gt; He was posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] (designated No.&amp;nbsp;69 Squadron [[Royal Flying Corps]] by the British) in August 1917, operating [[Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8]] two-seat reconnaissance aircraft on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/13.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 1917, No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron was heavily involved in artillery ranging, activity that left the slow R.E.8s vulnerable to attack by German fighters. Twice that month Anderson's plane was dived upon by multiple enemy aircraft. He was, in his own words, &quot;too scared to think&quot; on the first occasion, but both times held his nerve and manoeuvred his plane so that his observer could hold off their opponents with [[Lewis Gun]] fire while other R.E.8s came to their aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was spotting for artillery near the [[Mesen|Messines Ridge]] on 6&amp;nbsp;December when he engaged a German two-seat [[DFW C.V|DFW]] that observer John Bell was able to shoot down; it was No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron's first confirmed aerial victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clash of Eagles&quot;&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1918, Anderson was given the temporary  rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and posted to England to take charge of [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;7 (Training) Squadron AFC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was recommended for the [[Military Cross]] (MC) on 12&amp;nbsp;March for his achievements with No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in France, the citation noting his &quot;resolute fight&quot; and &quot;cool and capable flying&quot; in evading attacks by enemy aircraft and successfully carrying out his reconnaissance missions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/122/0015.pdf Recommendation: Military Cross] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 26 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) in the [[King's Birthday Honours]] promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 3&amp;nbsp;June, becoming the first Australian to receive the newly created decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30722|supp=yes|startpage=6519|date=3 June 1918|accessdate=on 30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, ''Flying the Southern Skies'', pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the [[Croix de guerre (Belgium)|Belgian Croix de guerre]], gazetted on 9&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30792|supp=yes|startpage=8169|endpage=8189|date=9 July 1918|accessdate=on 30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson went back to France in October 1918 as commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison Ch.01&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 1, 16]&lt;/ref&gt; His service earned him a [[Mentioned in Despatches|mention in despatches]] on 11&amp;nbsp;July 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31448|supp=yes|startpage=8813|endpage=8839|date=11 July 1919|accessdate=on 18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson relinquished command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in January 1919 and returned to Australia two months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_8007.asp Air Vice-Marshal William Hopton Anderson] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 30 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year the [[Australian Flying Corps]] was disbanded, to be replaced on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1920 by the short-lived Australian Air Corps (AAC), which was, like the AFC, a branch of the Army. The AFC's senior officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], was still in England, and Major Anderson was appointed commander of the AAC, a position that also put him in charge of [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] (CFS) at [[RAAF Williams#Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Command and Leadership'', pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 17–21&lt;/ref&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;March 1921, he joined the newly formed Australian Air Force (the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix being added in August) as a [[squadron leader]], becoming its third most senior officer after Williams and former [[Royal Naval Air Service]] pilot [[Stanley Goble]], both now [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commanders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison Ch.01&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 31, 332&lt;/ref&gt; During 1921, Anderson headed up the RAAF's Point Cook base and its two major units, [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS)—the successor to CFS—and the newly established [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD).&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four years he acted as Director of Personnel and Training, Chief of the Administrative Staff, and Second Air Member on the RAAF's controlling body, the Air Board, when Goble was away on overseas postings. In April 1922, he took part in the new service's first [[close air support|army co-operation]] exercise, piloting an [[Airco DH9]] with [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], who spotted for artillery firing from an emplacement at [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]], Victoria. A year later, Anderson proposed a special RAAF workshop for research and development, which was duly formed at Point Cook later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAVM&quot;&gt;[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/138/Honorary-Air-Vice-Marshals.aspx Honorary Air Vice-Marshals] at [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

The young Air Force staged numerous public displays in its early years; on one such occasion over the Melbourne suburb of [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]] in September 1924, Anderson, [[Raymond Brownell|Ray Brownell]] and another pilot took part in a mock dogfight while [[Flying ace|ace]] [[Harry Cobby]] gave a demonstration of [[Observation balloon|balloon busting]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925–26, Anderson again took command of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS, as well as occupying a position on the Air Board as [[Air Member for Personnel (Australia)|Air Member for Personnel]]. He was posted to England between 1927 and 1929, attending [[RAF Staff College, Andover]], and serving as [[Air Liaison Officer]] (ALO) to the British [[Air Ministry]]. On 23&amp;nbsp;March 1927 he was promoted to wing commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HAVM&quot;/&gt; As ALO in 1928, he provided information to the Air Board concerning shortcomings of the [[de Havilland Hound]] light day bomber, then being strongly considered for the RAAF, that led to the [[Westland Wapiti]] being ordered instead.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Allitude'', pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Australia in mid-1929, Anderson was for a short time in charge of No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD, now based at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria, before appointment to the Air Board as Air Member for Supply in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of the 1930s in this position, aside from an acting role as Air Member for Personnel in 1933–34, and attendance at the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]], London, the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAVM&quot;/&gt; Anderson had no formal training in the supply field,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; and though regarded with affection was variously considered &quot;not quite on the same wave length as others&quot; and &quot;so immersed in the minutiae of administration that some important policy matters languished&quot;. His chronic shyness with women other than his unmarried sister also made him an object of fun in some quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 359–360&lt;/ref&gt;  He was raised to [[group captain]] in December 1932 and [[air commodore]] in January 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 1933 [[King's Birthday Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33946|supp=yes|startpage=3807|date=2 June 1933|accessdate=on 10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was promoted Commander in the same order (CBE) in the [[1934 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34010|supp=yes|startpage=8|date=29 December 1933|accessdate=on 10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson was still serving as Air Member for Supply when [[Military history of Australia in World War II|Australia declared war]] in September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; On 9&amp;nbsp;January 1940 he was appointed acting [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), following the resignation of the incumbent, [[Air Vice-Marshal]] Goble. Anderson remained in the position until 10&amp;nbsp;February, when Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]], seconded from the [[Royal Air Force]], arrived to take over.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison Ch.03&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 67, 77]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government at this stage had so little faith in the leadership of its Air Force that it had briefly considered offering temporary command of the service to a [[Royal Australian Navy]] officer, Second Naval Member [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] Maitland Boucher, before deciding against such a &quot;monumental slight to the senior ranks of the RAAF&quot; and settling on Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', pp. 18–21&lt;/ref&gt; After relinquishing his temporary position as CAS, Anderson briefly reverted to his previous role as Air Member for Supply before taking over as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in March 1940; he was succeeded in November by Air Vice-Marshal [[Henry Wrigley]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth&quot;&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, Anderson took over from Air Commodore [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Cole]] as [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[Central Area Command (RAAF)|Central Area]], with responsibility for air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance for most of [[New South Wales]]; he remained at this post until it was disbanded in August the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 91–92]&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted acting air vice-marshal in September 1941, Anderson resumed his position on the Air Board by replacing [[Air marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Williams]] as Air Member for Organisation and Equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1942, he assumed command of the newly established [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area]], which was headquartered in Sydney and controlled seven squadrons from southern [[Queensland]] to southern New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; One of the area's main roles was [[anti-submarine warfare]]; its squadrons also included fighters and army co-operation aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/09.pdf ''Air War Against Japan 1943–1945'', pp. 141, 152]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1943 Anderson became the inaugural Commandant of the RAAF Staff School at [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/adc/centres/acsc/history.html RAAF Staff College History] at [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]].

Retrieved on 7 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A confidential report in September 1944 had found him &quot;hard working, conscientious and loyal&quot; but lacking in &quot;constructive capacity and organising ability&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson&quot;/&gt; He was still four years below the statutory retirement age of fifty-seven for his substantive rank of air commodore.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power With Attitude'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Following his discharge from the RAAF as an honorary air vice marshal, Anderson lived in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]]. A lifelong bachelor, he shared a house with his sister, who also never married. From 1947 until 1971, he served as honorary chairman of the Victorian branch of the Services Canteens Trust Fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;March 1971, he was among a select group of surviving founder members of the RAAF who attended a celebratory dinner at the [[Hotel Canberra]] to mark the service's [[Golden Jubilee]]; his fellow guests included Air Marshal Williams, Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley, Air Commodore [[Hippolyte De La Rue|Hippolyte (Frank) De La Rue]], and Wing Commander [[Lawrence Wackett|Sir Lawrence Wackett]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 451, 498&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Anderson died on his birthday in 1975, and was buried in [[City of Boroondara|Boroondara Cemetery]], Kew.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;
