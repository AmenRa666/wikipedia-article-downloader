The '''P class''' was a planned group of twelve [[heavy cruiser]]s of Nazi Germany's ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''; they were the successor to the {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser|2}}s. Design work began in 1937 and continued until 1939; at least nine designs were considered. The final design was armed with six {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} quick-firing guns in two triple turrets, as in the preceding ''Deutschland'' class. The ships were designated as ''Panzerschiff'' (armored ship), and given the preliminary names P1–P12. They were an improved design over the preceding planned [[D-class cruiser (Germany)|D-class cruisers]], which had been canceled in 1934. Although the ships were already assigned to shipyards, construction never began on the P-class ships after the {{sclass2-|O|battlecruiser|2}} design superseded them.

== Design ==

In the early 1930s, [[Adolf Hitler]] began a rearmament program in Germany. He signed the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which allowed Germany to build up its navy to 35 percent of the strength of the British [[Royal Navy]] and effectively repudiated the restrictions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on the German fleet.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Chesneau|p=220}} This led to a decision in 1937 to build ships to an improved {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser|2}} design.{{sfn|Garzke &amp; Dulin|p=351}} Design work on the new class of armored ships began that year.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}} After more than twenty designs were considered to meet the navy's specifications, one was chosen; it was designated as cruiser &quot;P&quot;.{{sfn|Garzke &amp; Dulin|p=351}} It called for a {{convert|20000|t|LT|adj=on|sp=us}} with a maximum speed of {{convert|34|to|35|kn|abbr=on}}, armed with six {{convert|28|cm|abbr=on}} guns in two triple [[gun turret|turrets]].{{sfn|Garzke &amp; Dulin|p=352}}

By 1938, it became clear to Admiral [[Erich Raeder]] that Hitler's aggressive foreign policy would bring conflict with Britain. He therefore decided that a significantly larger force of armored ships would be necessary to execute an effective commerce raiding campaign against the British. Raeder's intention to fight a commerce war against Britain was the basis for [[Plan Z]],{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Chesneau|p=220}} which included twelve ships of the P-class design.{{sfn|Garzke &amp; Dulin|p=351}} The design work on the new ships proceeded in parallel with work on the {{sclass2-|O|battlecruiser|2}} design.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Chesneau|p=226}} Experiments were conducted on at least nine different design proposals between March 1938 and December 1939. The designs varied somewhat in terms of dimensions as well as armament; some of the designs featured three 28&amp;nbsp;cm triple turrets.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}}

Many problems were encountered with designing the ships, the most prevalent being armor. The required maximum speed of {{convert|34|kn|abbr=on}} meant that the minimum [[Length overall|length]] had to grow from the original {{convert|217|m|ftin|abbr=on}} to {{convert|229.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. It also meant that the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] could be a minimum of {{convert|25|m|ftin|abbr=on}}—unless [[diesel engine]]s, like those used in the ''Deutschland''{{'}}s, were desired; they would increase the beam by {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Unfortunately for the designers, the widened beam meant that an even longer hull was needed to maintain hydrodynamic efficiency. All of this complicated the armor arrangements, as more armor was needed to cover the longer length and widened beam. Eventually it was deemed that it was impossible to include diesel power on a {{convert|20000|t|LT|adj=on|sp=us}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]].{{sfn|Garzke &amp; Dulin|pp=351–352}}

Initially, twelve ships were ordered based on the P-class design. The ships were ordered under the provisional names P1 through P12; the contracts were awarded to a number of German shipyards, including [[Deutsche Werke]] in [[Kiel]], [[Blohm &amp; Voss]] in [[Hamburg]], and the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|KM Dockyard]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]]. However, Plan Z was reduced in size, and the number of armored ships was pared down to only eight vessels. This caused several of the contracts to be shifted around amongst the various shipbuilding companies. The first keel was set to be laid on 1 Feb 1940. The revised version of Plan Z, approved on 27 July 1939, removed the P-class ships from the construction queue. Instead, the decision was made to build the O-class battlecruisers only.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}}

=== Characteristics ===

The P-class ships were {{convert|223|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Waterline length|at the waterline]], and {{convert|230|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[Length overall|overall]]. The ships had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|26|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a designed [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}; the maximum draft was {{convert|8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}} They were to have incorporated longitudinal frame stringer steel construction, and would have been primarily welded. The ships would have had thirteen [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[transom stern]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=63}} The ships were equipped with two catapults and two [[Arado Ar 196|Arado 196]] [[seaplane]]s.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}} The armor layout was to have used [[Krupp armour|Krupp cemented steel]], but the design was not complete; only broad requirements are known. The main armored deck was {{convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, with {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}–thick sloping deck armor. The upper deck was {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The two main-battery barbettes had armor protection that ranged between {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and had a depth of {{convert|14.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The [[armored belt]] was {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick over the vital areas of the ship, and tapered down to {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} in less critical areas.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=63–64}}

The ships were designed to be equipped with twelve MAN 9-cylinder V-configuration double acting two-stroke diesel engines that were designed to provide a total of 165,000&amp;nbsp;shaft horsepower at 250&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The engines were arranged in four sets of three, each of which drove one of four shafts. The shafts each turned a [[Propeller|screw]] that was 4.3&amp;nbsp;m in diameter. The ships were designed to carry {{convert|3600|t|sp=us}} of fuel oil, but were capable of storing up to {{convert|5000|t|abbr=on}}. At a cruising speed of 13&amp;nbsp;knots, this enabled a maximum range of 25,000&amp;nbsp;nautical miles; at 19&amp;nbsp;knots, the range was reduced to 15,000&amp;nbsp;nmi.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}}

The ships were armed with six {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} quick-firing guns mounted in two triple turrets, one fore and one aft. It is not known if these were to have been the same [[28 cm SK C/28 naval gun|28&amp;nbsp;cm SK C/28 guns]] as the preceding ''Deutschland''-class cruisers, or a different design. The ships were also armed with four {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}/L55 guns in two twin turrets, also mounted on the centerline, fore and aft. The fore 28&amp;nbsp;cm turret would have been superfiring over the fore 15&amp;nbsp;cm turret; the layout was reversed for the aft pair of turrets.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}} The 15&amp;nbsp;cm twin turrets were Drh L. C/34 mounts—the same type as those fitted to the {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship|5}}- and {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s, as well as a number of other designs. The turrets allowed depression to −10&amp;nbsp;degrees and elevation to 40&amp;nbsp;degrees, which enabled a maximum range of {{convert|22000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The 15&amp;nbsp;cm guns had a rate of fire of between 6 and 8 {{convert|45.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} rounds per minute, at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 875&amp;nbsp;meters per second (2,871&amp;nbsp;ft/s). The guns used two propellant charges: a {{convert|14.15|kg|lb|abbr=on}} RPC/38 fore charge and a {{convert|23.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} main charge in a brass cartridge.{{sfn|DiGiulian (15 cm/55)}}

The P-class ships were to have mounted a fairly small anti-aircraft battery: four {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}/L65 high-angle guns and four {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak guns.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}} The 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm guns fired two types of projectiles: a {{convert|58.4|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[high explosive]] shell and a {{convert|51.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} incendiary round. Both types of ammunition used a single propellant charge: the {{convert|11.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} RPC/32 charge. The guns could elevate to 80&amp;nbsp;degrees, and could hit targets {{convert|12500|m|yd|abbr=on}} away.{{sfn|DiGiulian (10.5 cm/65)}} The ships were also armed with six {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} submerged torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gröner|p=64}}
