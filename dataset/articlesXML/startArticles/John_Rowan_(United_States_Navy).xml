[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] '''John J. Rowan''' (September 6, 1919 &amp;ndash; October 6, 2012) was an American [[Captain (United States)|Navy Captain]].

==Military career==

===World War II===
Rowan graduated from the United States Naval Academy in December 1941. His first tour of duty as a newly commissioned Ensign was aboard the [[USS Vincennes (CA-44)]], a heavy cruiser, which was sunk in the first [[Battle of Savo Island]].  Ensign Rowan with only a life jacket waited five hours in the water until rescued.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;Interview of Captain Rowan, 2011-10-15, Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

After his rescue, he was assigned to the [[USS North Carolina (BB-55)]] for three months and then transferred to the [[USS De Haven (DD-469)]].

Eight weeks after his assignment on the [[USS De Haven (DD-469)]], it was sunk in the second [[Battle of Savo Island]].  Ensign Rowan sustained injuries and was in the water for two hours until rescued by an [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] which the ship had been escorting.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot; /&gt;
After the second rescue, he spent the next seven months recuperating from injuries in the [[Naval Medical Center San Diego|San Diego Naval Hospital]].  While recuperating, he met and married Miss Mary Thompson (Durham, North Carolina), who was working at the hospital.

He returned to duty aboard the [[USS Blue (DD-744)]] and in late August 1945 he was the senior officer of the boarding party from the [[USS Blue (DD-744)]] that accepted the surrender of the [[I-400 class submarine]], then the worldâ€™s largest submarine.

He later received a citation for his participation on the Vincennes during the Jimmy Doolittle Tokyo Raid.

He also served on the [[USS Lyman K. Swenson (DD-729)|USS Swenson (DD-729)]], and the staff of ComDesRon TWO where he spent the remaining two years of the war and the first three post war years.

===Post World War II===
After attending Postgraduate School in communications at the [[United States Naval Academy]] in Annapolis in 1948, Rowan was assigned to duty on the staff of [[ComCruDesPac]] in 1949 as Communications Officer and in 1952 to [[NavCommFac]], London, as Executive Officer.

He was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] for his participation in planning the move of U.S. Communications Systems from France to Germany.

In 1954 he reported as Operations Officer of the [[USS Newport News (CA-148)]], and in 1955 he assumed command of the [[USS Wren (DD-568)]].

Two years later he reported to the Superintendent of the [[United States Naval Academy|U. S. Naval Academy]] for duty as Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel and Administration.

===Vietnam War===
In April 1961, after twelve months as Executive Officer of the [[USS Newport News (CA-148)]], Rowan was assigned to duty in Washington D.C with the Director of Naval Communications where he served successively as Director, Plans and Policy Division; followed by Officer in Charge, Naval Communications Systems, Headquarters Activity; and then as Director, Program Division.

In September 1963, Rowan was hand picked as the prospective Commanding Officer of the Navy's first Communication Major Relay Ship [[USS Annapolis (AGMR-1)]].  He served in this position until the ship's commissioning in March 1964.  At that time, Rowan became the [[USS Annapolis (AGMR-1)|USS Annapolis']] first commanding officer and served in that position until April 1965, when he was relieved by Captain John Newland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uss-annapolis.org/co_2_newland.htm Newland biography]&lt;/ref&gt; As the first commanding officer of the ''USS Annapolis'', the ship has the distinction because of his direct involvement and planning for the first &quot;floating communications&quot; station and first ship to transmit messages ship-to-shore via satellite.

==Retirement==
Captain Rowan resided in Springfield, Virginia, Pinehurst, North Carolina, and Williamsburg, Virginia with his wife Mary until his death on October 6, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APT. JOHN JOSEPH ROWAN|url=http://www.bucktroutfuneralhome.net/memsol.cgi?user_id=761823|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received a Full Honors burial in Arlington National Cemetery on Oct. 18, 2012.

He and his wife attended the 1999 and 2011 [[USS Annapolis (AGMR-1)]] reunions.
