[[Vice-Admiral]] '''Sir Arthur Richard &quot;Baldy&quot; Hezlet''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Most Honourable Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO and Bar]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]], [[Legion of Merit|Legion of Merit (United States)]] (7 April 1914 – 7 November 2007) was a decorated [[Royal Navy]] [[submarine]]r.  He became the Royal Navy's youngest captain, aged 36, and its youngest admiral, aged 45. In retirement he became a military historian.

==Early life==
Hezlet was born in [[Pretoria, South Africa]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7087305.stm Obituary ('''BBC News''')]&lt;/ref&gt; where his father Major-General RK Hezlet, CB, CBE, DSO, was serving in the [[British Army]]. 

Hezlet joined the [[Royal Navy]] in January 1928, aged 13.  He attended the [[Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]] and the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], and went to sea in 1932, serving as a [[midshipman]] on the [[battleship]]s [[HMS Royal Oak (08)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']] and [[HMS Resolution (09)|HMS ''Resolution'']].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By 1936, he was the correspondence officer on the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Daring (H16)|HMS ''Daring'']], later volunteering to serve on [[submarine]]s.  He served on [[HMS Regulus (N88)|HMS ''Regulus'']].

==Second World War==
Hezlet was serving on the submarine [[HMS H43|HMS ''H43'']] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], but quickly became First Lieutenant aboard the submarine [[HMS Trident (N52)|HMS ''Trident'']]. By early 1940, he was engaged in operations in the [[Norwegian Sea]], as the Germans launched their [[occupation of Norway]].  He was [[mentioned in dispatches]].  Following the military disaster in [[Dunkirk]], ''Trident'' was re-positioned in the [[English Channel]] to assist in repulsing an expected [[Nazi Germany|German]] attempt at [[Operation Sealion|invasion of mainland Britain]]. 

In 1940, Hezlet passed the [[Submarine Command Course|&quot;perisher&quot;]] exam to become a submarine commanding officer, and took command of the obsolete coastal submarine [[HMS H44|HMS ''H44'']] in December.&lt;ref name=lh&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/HEZLET1.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to [[Malta]] as a &quot;spare CO&quot;.  He commanded the submarine [[HMS Unique (N95)|HMS ''Unique'']], one of the &quot;Fighting&quot; [[10th Submarine Flotilla]] based in [[Malta]] from 1941 to 1944. The flotilla helped sink over 1,000,000 tonnes of Axis shipping.  Hezlet was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] for sinking the 11,000 tonne Italian troopship ''Esperia''.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  He also commanded [[HMS Ursula (N59)|HMS ''Ursula'']]&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; on six patrols, and [[HMS Upholder (P37)|HMS ''Upholder'']] on one patrol. 
 
Hezlet returned to the UK in September 1941, with [[Ian McGeoch]] as his first lieutenant, to take command of ''Trident'' again.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; In May 1942, he was involved in protecting convoys to North Russia.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  He sank the German ore carrier ''Hoedur'',&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; and picked up survivors from sunk merchant vessels.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He also operated on the surface as escort vessel for the large convoy [[PQ16]], and was [[mentioned in dispatches]] again.  He became a special training officer on the banks of the [[River Clyde]] in September 1942, at the informally named &quot;[[HMS Varbel]]&quot;, training the crews of [[midget submarine]]s to attack the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  He invented the &quot;Hezlet Rail&quot;, bar and strap that kept men aboard the vessel.  He was Mentioned in Despatches after commanding the towing submarine [[HMS Thrasher (N37)|HMS ''Thrasher'']].&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;

Hezlet then took command of the submarine [[HMS Trenchant (P331)|HMS ''Trenchant'']],&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; based at [[Trincomalee]], [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]).  He undertook long-range patrols in the Indian and Pacific oceans, earning him his first [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO). He sank the long-range German [[U-boat]] [[U-859]],&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; on 22 September 1944, near the [[Sunda Strait]], as a result of [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] intelligence information.  The ''Trenchant'' also sank numerous Japanese [[submarine chaser]]s, [[landing craft]], [[coasters]] and a [[minelayer]].

His crew conducted the last attack by two-man [[Human torpedo|&quot;chariot&quot;]] submarines, on the Japanese-held harbour of [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] in [[Thailand]].

On 8 June 1945, Hezlet took ''Trenchant'' into shallow [[Naval mine|mined]] water in the [[Bangka Strait|Banka Strait]] off [[Sumatra]], to intercept [[Japanese cruiser Ashigara|Japanese heavy cruiser ''Ashigara'']].  Despite being attacked by the [[Japanese destroyer Kamikaze (1922)|Japanese destroyer ''Kamikaze'']], five out of eight torpedoes that he fired hit ''Ashigara'', which quickly sank.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  It was the largest [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] warship sunk by a Royal Navy warship during the war.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  Hezlet was ordered to [[Subic Bay]] in the [[Philippines]], where he was awarded the U.S. Legion of Merit&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; by U.S. Admiral [[James Fife, Jr.]].  He was also awarded a [[medal Bar|Bar]] to his DSO.  Ordered to return to the UK, he ended the war as he began it, serving on a submarine.

==Post-war career==
After the war, Hezlet attended naval and three-service [[staff college]]s.  In 1946, he was one of a small group of Britons permitted to observe the U.S. [[nuclear bomb]] tests at [[Bikini Atoll]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He commanded the destroyer [[HMS Scorpion (D64)|HMS ''Scorpion'']],&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; and then served in the [[Admiralty]], and as Chief Staff Officer to the [[Flag Officer Submarines]],&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; before taking command of the destroyer [[HMS Battleaxe (D118)|HMS ''Battleaxe'']] and becoming Captain D of the [[6th Destroyer Flotilla]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;
 
In 1956, Hezlet was appointed as Director of the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Naval Staff College]] at Greenwich.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; After commanding the [[cruiser]] [[HMS Newfoundland (59)|HMS ''Newfoundland'']],&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; he became [[Flag Officer Submarines]]&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; and was promoted to [[rear admiral]] in 1959. The submarine [[HMS Dreadnought (S101)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']], Britain's first [[nuclear attack submarine]], was launched in early 1960.  The task of the Flag Officer Submarines was to help formulate plans for support and training facilities in a force as yet unfamiliar with nuclear propulsion.  He was also in office later that year, when the preferred option for the UK's nuclear deterrent moved from the air-launched [[AGM-48 Skybolt|Skybolt missile]] to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missile]] launched by [[ballistic missile submarine]]s.  He was appointed CB in 1961.

Hezlet's final tour was [[Flag Officer Scotland, Northern England, Northern Ireland|Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland]] (FOSNI).&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He was promoted to [[vice-admiral]] and appointed [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] before his retirement in 1964.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;

==Later life==
Hezlet returned to his family home, Bovagh House, at [[Aghadowey]] in [[County Londonderry]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  He was Northern Ireland president of the [[Royal British Legion]] for 25 years.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  He also served with the [[RNLI]],&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; a member of the [[general synod]] of the [[Church of Ireland]],&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; and was an original council member of the [[University of Ulster]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He was a keen yachtsman, and his yacht Agivey was a familiar sight on the coast of Ireland and Scotland. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of County Londonderry]] for 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette | city = b | issue = 2461 | startpage = 6 | date = 5 January 1968 | accessdate = 2012-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hezlet died at Bovagh, at the age of 93, in 2007.  He was survived by his wife, Anne Joan Patricia Clark whom he married in 1948, and their two daughters.

==Writings==
In retirement, Hezlet wrote many books on naval matters. His first book, ''The Submarine and Sea Power'' (1967), foresaw the continuing invulnerability of the seaborne [[nuclear deterrent]].  In ''Aircraft and Sea Power'' (1970), he took the view that the Atlantic could be defended by land-based aircraft and submarines, with no surface vessels. 

Hezlet also wrote a history of the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]], the &quot;[[B Specials]]&quot;, in 1972.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  He reviewed the use of electricity and electronics in naval warfare in ''The Electron and Sea Power'' (1976).  He published a memoir, ''HMS Trenchant at War: from Chatham to the Banka Strait'', in 2001, and his last book, the authoritative ''History of British and Allied Submarine Operations'' (2002), listed every patrol taken by an Allied submarine in the Second World War.
