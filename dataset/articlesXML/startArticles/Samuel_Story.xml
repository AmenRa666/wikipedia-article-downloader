'''Samuel Story''' (2 October 1752 – 8 January 1811) was a [[vice-admiral]] of the navy of the [[Batavian Republic]]. He commanded the squadron that surrendered without a fight to the [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Vlieter Incident]] in 1799.

==Early life==
Story was born in [[Maasbommel]]. He entered the navy of the [[Dutch Republic]] ([[Admiralty of Rotterdam|Admiralty of the Maze]]) in 1770. On 5 July 1774 he became a [[lieutenant]] on the 20-gun ''Orangezaal''. His first command (in 1781) was the 36-gun frigate ''Jason''. In 1793, he was appointed captain of the 40-gun frigate ''Pollux'' at [[Hellevoetsluis]].

==Revolution of 1795==
In the severe winter of 1794/95 the ships of the Dutch navy at the roadstead of Hellevoetsluis became frozen in the ice on the [[River Maas]]. Story's commanding officer [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Pieter Melvill van Carnbee (1743-1810)|Pieter Melvill van Carnbee]] then appointed him commander of the naval base and squadron. The armies of the [[French Republic]] had invaded the Netherlands in the course of the War of the [[First Coalition]]. They made easy progress in early 1795 and the commander-in-chief of the Dutch navy, [[lieutenant-admiral]] [[Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen]] ordered Story to offer no resistance. On 3 January 1795, he released and armed 600 French prisoners of war, who had been incarcerated on his base. In that way he secured the base for the [[Batavian Republic]] that was proclaimed shortly afterward.

The new government of that Republic appointed Story in February, 1795, to a commission that was charged with making an inventory of the ships of the fleet, and other naval installations, in connection with accusations of neglect by the previous regime. The commission presented its report on 27 May 1795, and concluded that the state of the navy was deplorable. This was the basis for an ambitious programme of naval construction in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;De Jonge, pp. 219-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Camperdown==
The new fleet was first put to the test in the [[Battle of Camperdown]] of 1797. During this battle, Story commanded the Batavian frigate division as rear-admiral aboard the 74-gun ship-of-the-line [[Dutch ship Staaten Generaal|''Staten-Generaal'']]. This ship caught fire, and while this was extinguished, it drifted to [[leeward]], which made it impossible to rejoin the battle. This may have contributed to the loss of the battle by Vice-Admiral [[Jan Willem de Winter]].&lt;ref&gt;De Jonge, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the battle is remarkable because of the new tactics employed by Admiral [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Adam Duncan]], which amounted to breaching the Dutch line, instead of sailing parallel to it (as were the usual tactics up to then). The point where the line was breached was just before Story's ship.&lt;ref&gt;De Jonge, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Story distinguished himself in the sequel of the battle by rallying the Batavian frigate division and leading them safely into port.

==Vlieter Incident==
In 1798, the Batavian Republic was asked by its French ally to take part in the expedition to assist the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. A Batavian squadron was formed near [[Texel]] under the command of Story. When the Dutch part of the expedition to Ireland was cancelled, this squadron was next re-targeted to the [[East Indies]] at the request of the Committee of East Indian Commerce of the Batavian government. It was to escort an expeditionary force of 5,000 soldiers under the command of General [[Herman Willem Daendels]] who was to be in overall command. Story now attained the temporary rank of vice-admiral.  However, strong rumours of a planned Anglo-Russian attack on the Republic in summer 1799 led to the cancellation of this expedition.

When the [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland|Anglo-Russian expedition]] materialized in August 1799, Story still commanded the squadron at Texel, again as a rear-admiral. The machinations of a number of officers in his command with [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangist]] leanings led to the debacle of the [[Vlieter Incident]] in which Story felt constrained to surrender without a fight to the Royal Navy squadron under Admiral [[Andrew Mitchell (Royal Navy officer)|Andrew Mitchell]] because of a mutiny aboard the Batavian squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gf8bAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=%22samuel+story%22++-wiki+Camperdown&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ci6MzrvEN3&amp;sig=nzvPHWQN_gV5RTUYWJChohEsahE&amp;hl=en#PPA331,M1 |title=History of the People of the Netherlands |last=Blok |first=P.

==Conviction and banishment==
After this surrender, Story was made a prisoner of war in England till the [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]]. After his release, he did not feel welcome in England as a loyal [[Patriots (faction)|Patriot]], unlike his Orangist colleagues, who were in a similar predicament. The Batavian government had meanwhile tried him ''in absentia''. He dared not return to the Republic because of this, instead trying to conduct his defence from abroad. He moved to [[Bremen]] in October 1802.

The ''Hoge Militaire Vierschaar'' (High Military Court) convicted him on 16 January 1804 of dereliction of duty,  cowardice, and disloyalty. He was declared to be &quot;perjurious, without honor, and infamous,&quot; cashiered from the navy, and sentenced to banishment for life, on penalty of beheading. After this harsh sentence, he spent the rest of his life trying to be rehabilitated. In 1805, he published a defence in the form of a book that was part auto-biography.&lt;ref&gt;Story, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; He did not succeed, mainly because he died before the restoration of the leader of the Orangist faction, [[William I of the Netherlands]] to power. Other &quot;mutineers&quot;, like [[Theodorus Frederik van Capellen]] were rehabilitated by the new king, but this was not extended to Story because he could not ask for rehabilitation.

Story died ''&quot;of the impact of dropsy&quot;'' in exile in [[Kleve|Cleves]] on 8 January 1811.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?query=samuel+story+verveer&amp;coll=ddd&amp;identifier=ddd%3A010123676%3Ampeg21%3Aa0018&amp;resultsidentifier=ddd%3A010123676%3Ampeg21%3Aa0018&lt;/ref&gt;
