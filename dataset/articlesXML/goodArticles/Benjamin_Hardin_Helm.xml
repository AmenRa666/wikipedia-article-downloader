'''Benjamin Hardin Helm''' (June 2, 1831 – September 21, 1863)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=293}}; {{harvnb|Warner|1989|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Kentucky]] politician, [[Lawyer|attorney]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Brigadier general|brigadier general]], and a [[brother-in-law]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He was also the son of [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[John L. Helm]]. Helm was born in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]]. He attended the [[Kentucky Military Institute]] and the [[West Point Military Academy]] and then went to study law at the [[University of Louisville]] and [[Harvard University]]. He served as a [[Kentucky Legislature|state legislator]] and the state's attorney in [[Kentucky]]. He also served as the assistant inspector-general for the Kentucky state guard. Helm was offered the position of [[Union Army]] [[paymaster]] by his [[brother-in-law]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], a position which he declined. Helm felt it was an honor to serve in the [[Confederate States Army]], where he was initially a colonel and later promoted to brigadier general. Helm commanded the 1st Kentucky Brigade more commonly known as [[The Orphan Brigade]]. He died on the battlefield during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Helm was married to Emilie Todd, the [[half-sister]] of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].

==Early life==
[[File:Helm-Place.jpg|left|195px|thumb|The [[Helm Place (Elizabethtown, Kentucky)|Helm Place]] in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.]]
The son of [[lawyer]] and [[politician]] [[John L. Helm]] and Lucinda Barbour Hardin, Benjamin Hardin Helm was born in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]] on June 2, 1831.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1989|p=132}}; {{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1846, at age 15, Helm enrolled at the Kentucky Military Institute, where he remained for three months. He left on his 16th birthday to accept an appointment in West Point the same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;thompson&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1868|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helm graduated in 1851 near his 20th birthday, ranked 9th in a class of 42 [[cadet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1868|p=338}}, {{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He served at a [[cavalry]] school at [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], and at [[Fort Lincoln, Texas]], but resigned his commission after a year, when he was diagnosed with inflammatory [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1868|p=339}}, {{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grave01&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=8925 |title=Benjamin H. Helm |publisher=Find a Grave |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helm then studied law at the [[University of Louisville]] and [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1853 and practicing law with his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, he was elected to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] of Kentucky from [[Hardin County, Kentucky|Hardin County]], and was the state's attorney for the 3rd district of Kentucky from 1856 to 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1868|p=339}}, {{harvnb|Warner|1989|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, Helm married Emilie Todd, a half-sister of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alardice01&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, he was appointed assistant inspector-general of the [[Kentucky Army National Guard|Kentucky State Guard]], which he was active in organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1868|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kentucky remained officially neutral in the [[American Civil War]], but his brother-in-law, now President Abraham Lincoln, offered him the position of [[paymaster]] of the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner01&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1989|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helm declined the offer, and returned to Kentucky to raise the [[1st Kentucky Cavalry]] Regiment for the [[Confederate Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner01&quot;/&gt;

==Military career==
Helm was commissioned a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on October 19, 1861, and served under [[Brigadier General]] [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon B. Buckner]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|pp=149, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helm and the 1st Kentucky were then ordered south.&lt;ref name=Grave01 /&gt; He was promoted to brigadier general on March 14, 1862 and, three weeks later, received a new assignment to raise the 3rd Kentucky Brigade, in the division of [[Major General]] [[John C. Breckinridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot02&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Shiloh]], Helm used his brigade to guard the Confederate flanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot02&quot; /&gt; In 1862, he was also sent to protect the ''[[CSS Arkansas|Arkansas]]'', an [[ironclad warship]] of the [[Confederate States Navy|Confederate Navy]] under construction in [[Yazoo City, Mississippi|Yazoo City]], [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving under Breckinridge in January 1863, he was given command of the First Kentucky Brigade, commonly known as the &quot;''[[Orphan Brigade]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|p=149}}; {{harvnb|Warner|1989|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helm's brigade was assigned to the [[Army of Tennessee]], where it participated in the 1863 [[Tullahoma Campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga Campaign|Chickamauga]] campaigns.&lt;ref name=Warner01 /&gt; Near the end of the spring of 1863, Breckenridge ordered Helm to deploy the brigade to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] to participate in [[General (United States)|General]] [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s unsuccessful attempt to break the [[Siege of Vicksburg|siege]]. Helm called it &quot;the most unpleasant and trying [campaign] of his career&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Chickamauga and death==
In the fall of 1863, the 1st Kentucky Brigade formed a part of General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s counteroffensive against [[Union army|Union]] [[Major General]] [[William Rosecrans]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alardice&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 9:30 am on September 20, 1863, the divisions of Generals Breckinridge and [[Patrick Cleburne]] were ordered to move forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot;/&gt; Helm's brigade and the others in Breckinridge's division drove into the Federals' left.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot;/&gt; General Cleburne's division, which was intended to strike near the center of the line, was delayed by heavy fire from Union soldiers, leaving the left flank unguarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot;/&gt; Repeated attempts to overwhelm the Federals were in vain, though some of Helm's Kentuckians and Alabamans managed to reach within {{convert|39|yd|m}} of the Federal line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot;/&gt; In less than an hour of the order given to advance, fully one third of the Orphan Brigade had been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the remainder of Helm's men clashed with the Union line, a [[sharpshooter]] from the [[15th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry|15th Kentucky Union Infantry]] shot Helm in the chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot;/&gt; Bleeding profusely, he remained in the saddle a few moments before toppling to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allardice |Hewitt|2008|p=139}}; {{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being carried off the battlefield, Helm's surgeons concluded that his wounds would be fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot;/&gt; Helm clung to life for several hours. Knowing that his health was deteriorating, he asked who had won the battle. When assured that the Confederates had carried the day, he muttered: &quot;Victory!, Victory!, Victory!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allardice|Hewitt|2008|p=139}}; {{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|pp=150, 151}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1863, Gen. Helm succumbed to his wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot, Allardice&quot; /&gt;

Following his death, Abraham Lincoln and his wife went into private mourning at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=Barefoot151 /&gt; Mary Lincoln's niece recalled: &quot;She knew that a single tear shed for a dead enemy would bring torrents of scorn and bitter abuse on both her husband and herself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clinton|2010|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the widowed Emilie Todd Helm was granted safe passage to the White House in December 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mrlincolnswhitehouse.org/content_inside.asp?ID=23&amp;subjectID=2 |title=Emilie Todd Helm |publisher= Mr. Lincoln's White House |accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official report of the Battle of Chickamauga, General [[Daniel Harvey Hill]] stated that Benjamin Helm's &quot;gallantry and loveliness of character endeared him to everyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot151&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barefoot|2005|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Emilie Todd Helm, General Breckinridge said, &quot;Your husband commanded them [the men of the Orphan brigade] like a thorough soldier. He loved them, they loved him, and he died at their head, a patriot and a hero.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barefoot151&quot;/&gt;
