I'll remove the trivial link to [[counter-offensive]]s (it's also a non-existant article), but I'm wondering which counter offensives those were? The article doesn't say anything about which, where and what the outcome of those offensives were. Were they during the [[Battle of Moscow]], or somewhere else on the eastern front? I think at least where this was, should be added. [[User:Shanes|Shanes]] 14:09, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;I checked the source, it was indeed the battle of Moscow&lt;/s&gt;.

:On a second reading, that line is drawn from two sources: one being Jukes' and the other from the SAE. Jukes makes mention of his help in organizing two counteroffensives without specifying which ones, while the SAE specifically mentions that he took part in organizing the December [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Moscow#Soviet_counteroffensive Moscow counter-offensive].--[[User:MarshallBagramyan|MarshallBagramyan]] 17:37, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

First off, congratulations everyone for the FA status. Second, did you really have to use that picture for the FA thumbnail? I checked to make sure it was the right one as soon as I saw it.

My great-grandfather had that kind of mustache and they'd always raise that point, tongue in cheek, that he resembled Hitler. Must have been in style back then.--[[User:MarshallBagramyan|MarshallBagramyan]] 18:56, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

I have attempted to change the awkward reference, &quot;non-aggression Molotov-Ribbentrop pact&quot; to &quot;Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact.&quot; I've kept the link intact, and the changed usage is standard and acceptable. But Wafulz keeps changing it back with no explanation.

The latter one you proposed sounds right. Besides, whoever might be doing is probably just doing it for the sake of playing around with the article so it doesn't appear too constitute any real violation of edit warring.--[[User:MarshallBagramyan|MarshallBagramyan]] 18:56, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

== Allegiance ==
Bagramyan never had an 'allegiance' to Armenia. He was an ethnic Armenian, and he obviously was a leading personality in Armenia, but his allegiances were with the Soviet Union. If he had been anything else, ne would have been branded 'nazionalist' and dismissed from the Army at the very least. He never to may knowledge advocated Armenian independence during his lifetime, and using the post-Soviet Union Armenian flag is of course misinforming the reader. If anything, the Soviet era Armenian republic flag should be used since I believe he was at one time a deputy representing Armenia in the Communist Party. It seems to me that the symbol of the Marshal, the shoulder-board needs to be more prominent since this is a major defining symbol of Bagramyan.--&lt;font color=&quot;#21468B&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 21:14, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

::I'm not confusing anything. Bagramyan may have served in the Armenian Army before its incorporation into the Soviet Union, but not in the rank of a Marshal of Soviet Union, which is what this articles is about :o)--&lt;font color=&quot;#21468B&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 22:43, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

But he didn't become a Marshal until 1955. From 1917, he had been a junior officer and worked his way up until finally reaching the highest rank of Marshal. We shouldn't discard his service in any of the armies he served, whether they being the Imperial Russian Army, DROA Army or the Red Army.--[[User:MarshallBagramyan|Marshal Bagramyan]] ([[User talk:MarshallBagramyan|talk]]) 00:08, 1 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;
:Bagramyan, AS IT SAYS IN THE ARTICLE, was a praporshik in the Imperial Russian Army, and then joined the Red Cavalry. He never held a noteworthy commission in the Armenian forces that I know of, and achieved all his officer ranks in the Soviet Army. In what way does his living in Armenia during its brief experience of independence suggest his ALLEGIANCES were with Armenia? In fact he left Armenia and didn't live there for most of his life due to Army service!So what is the point of adding the Armenian falg? I suggest it is simply your attempt to nationalise the article to reflect some sense of patriotic pride in his achievement, but this is not the place to show it. Bagramyan was for all records of history a Soviet officer and a Soviet Marshal. There were other Marshals of non-Russian extraction. You can't rewrite history based on your patriotic feelings.--&lt;font color=&quot;#21468B&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 00:39, 1 January 2008 (UTC)

Baghramyan was a praporshik in the Imperial Russian Army until his unit was withdrawn from Turkey following Brest-Litovsk. But Baghramyan didn't join the Red Army until '''May 1920'''. So I believe there is a two year gap between that time where he was in the armed services of something along the lines called the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]]. As it's clearly stated in the article, Baghramyan served in Armenian units fighting for the Armenian army for two years and this coming not from some nationalistic source but Soviet ones which clearly warrants mention that his allegiance at one point of his life were to the DROA. 

We therefore can mention his allegiance of all three factions: the Imperial Russian Army, the DROA and finally the USSR. [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]] is remembered as a brilliant Soviet officer yet his article makes mention of his allegiance to the Imperial Russian army. You can file an RfC to resolve this issue if you wish, if you still feel the compromise version is inadequate but you are engaged in nothing but distortion of sources. Regards, --[[User:MarshallBagramyan|Marshal Bagramyan]] ([[User talk:MarshallBagramyan|talk]]) 21:08, 1 January 2008 (UTC)
:I think you are just misinterpreting history. Vasilevsky HAD TO swear allegiance to the Tsar on his commission as an officer. Bagramyan was drafted, and as an NCO swore his allegiance to the Tsar as part of the unit ceremony. Unless you can provide factual information that he was a commissioned officer in the DROA, I would have to assume that he supported Communism, or at least Socialism in his early life, which is why he joined the Red Army. That he had to be a member of the Communist Party after reaching the rank of a Captain goes without saying. How can you suggest compromises in interpreting history? This is the same argument some Turkish historians use when they claim that the deaths of Armenians during the 20s were a part of the general 'unrest' of the times and that Turks died also. Something either is, or is not, and the job of a historian is to show otherwise. I'll be happy to see any evidence, because I have read only one book on Bagramyan written in USSR, so I'm not suggesting that I'm an authority, but you have not offered any such evidence.--&lt;font color=&quot;#21468B&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 22:33, 1 January 2008 (UTC)
:PS. If anything, Bagramyan's actions suggest he did not swear allegiance to DROA. If he had, he would have remained there, but he left and joined the Red Army, and on joining the Red Army, he did have to swear allegiance to the Revolution and the Party of Workers, etc.  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] ([[User talk:Mrg3105|talk]] â€¢ [[Special:Contributions/Mrg3105|contribs]]) 22:38, 1 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Hi Mrg, please avoid such sentences as &quot;I suggest it is simply your attempt to nationalise the article to reflect some sense of patriotic pride in his achievement, but this is not the place to show it.&quot; They go against [[WP:AGF]]. I can start simply assuming as well about your intentions but such things are not helpful at all to discussion.

This is a very simple non-issue. Bagramyan enlisted into the DRA army and fought within its ranks in very crucial (and famous to Armenians) battles against the invading Turks. When you join an army, you are going to fight by its side which Bagramyan did, especially during that time when the Turks were a few km away from Yerevan. The battles (especially Sardarabad) were battles that would determine life or death of the newly established republic. What he joined, became or did after or during the fall of the DRA has nothing to do with what he did prior to it. The DRA's &quot;brief experience of independence&quot; does not disqualify Bagramyan's service to the country and to its survival.
 
Also, &quot;Unless you can provide factual information that he was a commissioned officer in the DROA, I would have to assume that he supported Communism, or at least Socialism&quot;. Don't forget that the DRA was ruled by socialists who were majority in government by far and also held all important posts. - [[User:Fedayee|Fedayee]] ([[User talk:Fedayee|talk]]) 00:11, 2 January 2008 (UTC)

== Allegiance to... ==
User [[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] has been reverting the notion of Baghramyan's allegiance to the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] in the infobox of the article, claiming that this stems from my attempt to &quot;nationalize&quot; Baghramyan, who was a Soviet officer for most of his career. I beg to differ and proposed that we can list his service to each faction with dates including the Russian Empire, but attempts to engage him with dialogue have been fruitless and frustrating, himself evidently referring to me as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMrg3105&amp;diff=181476403&amp;oldid=181468359 nationalistic sod]  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:MarshallBagramyan|MarshallBagramyan]] ([[User talk:MarshallBagramyan|talk]] â€¢ [[Special:Contributions/MarshallBagramyan|contribs]]) 22:00, 2 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Transliteration ==
Folks, this is an excellent article, so maybe transliteration has already been discussed in detail, but just in case, I'd like to bring it up.  What is it spelled Bagramyan in English, rather than Baghramyan, which is how the Õ² is normally written in English.  I know Russian doesn't have the &quot;gh&quot; sound, so in Russian they'd use the plain g, but this is English.  Shouldn't it be gh?  --[[User:RaffiKojian|RaffiKojian]] ([[User talk:RaffiKojian|talk]]) 04:05, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

Normally the Armenian Õ² is transliterated in English as gh. However, in this case his allegiance matters, which is Soviet Union, with Russian as its state language. Generally, in the Soviet era, the Russian spelling served as the basis of spelling the names of Armenians and all other Soviet peoples representing the Soviet Union. Nowadays, it wouldn't be a good idea to alter the Russified English spelling since it would alter tons of references to his name spelled the old way for decades. The same refers to composer Khatchaturian's name, the Armenian-based transliteration of which would be Khatchatrian (without the 'u').
