'''HMCS ''St. Eloi''''' was one of twelve {{sclass2-|Battle|trawler|0}} [[naval trawler]]s constructed for and used by the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Following the war the ship was transferred to the Canadian [[Department of Marine and Fisheries (Canada)|Department of Marine and Fisheries]] and converted into a [[lightvessel]]. Re-designated ''Lightship No. 20'', the vessel returned to RCN service in 1940 to become the [[gate vessel]] ''Gate Vessel 12'' during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After the war, the trawler returned to government service and was discarded in 1962.

==Design and description==
The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to [[Admiralty]] warnings to Canada about the growing German [[U-boat]] [[Atlantic U-boat Campaign (World War I)|threat to merchant shipping]] in the western Atlantic.&lt;ref name=tucker253&gt;Tucker, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British [[North Sea]] trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 254, 257&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, [[Polson Iron Works Limited|Polson Iron Works]] of [[Toronto]] and [[Canadian Vickers]] of [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name=johnston417&gt;Johnston et al., p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; Those vessels built at Polson Iron Works [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|320|LT|t|lk=in}} and were {{convert|130|ft|m}} [[Length overall|long overall]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|23|ft|5|in|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|13|ft|5|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=mac27&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; They were propelled by a steam-powered [[triple expansion]] engine driving one shaft creating {{convert|480|ihp|lk=in}} giving the vessels a maximum speed of {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=johnston417/&gt;&lt;ref name=maginley67&gt;Maginley and Collin, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

All twelve trawlers were equipped with a [[Quick-firing gun|QF]] [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun]] mounted forward.&lt;ref name=mac27/&gt;{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref name=tucker253/&gt;&lt;ref name=tucker257&gt;Tucker, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The trawlers were named after battles of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel.&lt;ref name=johnston417/&gt;{{efn|name=inflation}}{{efn|name=cost}}

==Service history==
Named after the [[List of Canadian battles during the First World War|Action of the St. Eloi Craters]], the trawler was built by Polson Iron Works at Toronto, [[Ontario]], and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2 August 1917.&lt;ref name=mac30&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al., pp. 481-84&lt;/ref&gt; ''St. Eloi'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 13 November 1917.&lt;ref name=mac30/&gt;

''St. Eloi'' sailed to the east coast where for the 1918 shipping season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al., pp. 543, 645&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sinking of the merchant vessel ''Luz Blanca'' off [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], ''St. Eloi'', {{HMCS|Armentières||2}} and {{HMCS|Festubert||2}} were tasked with hunting for the German submarine {{ship|SM|U-156||2}}, which had been operating off the coast of [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al., pp. 635, 643-44, 665&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle class was used for patrol and escort duties off the Atlantic coast of Canada until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al., p. 645&lt;/ref&gt;

The trawler remained in RCN service until being [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1920. ''St. Eloi'' was turned over to the Department of Marine and Fisheries and, like [[sister ship]]s {{HMCS|Messines||2}}, {{HMCS|St. Julien||2}}, and {{HMCS|Vimy||2}}, was converted to a [[lightvessel]].&lt;ref name=mac30/&gt;&lt;ref name=maginley113&gt;Maginley and Collin, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; This involved placing an electric light at the [[foremast]] head and installing a [[foghorn]] atop a latticework tower.&lt;ref name=maginley113/&gt; The ship was re-designated ''Lightship No. 20'' and remained as such until 1940.&lt;ref name=mac30/&gt; Returned to the RCN in 1940, ''St. Eloi'' became a gate vessel, designated ''Gate Vessel 12'', and spent part of the war at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]. Handed over to the Department of Transport (the successor department of the Department of Marine and Fisheries) in June 1945, ''St. Eloi'' was ultimately disposed of in 1962.&lt;ref name=mac30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;
