[[Image:Alexander von Benckendorff.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander von Benckendorff by [[George Dawe]]]]
Count '''Alexander Carl Wilhelm Christoph von Benckendorff''', ({{lang-ru|граф Александр Христофорович Бенкендорф}}, ''Aleksandr Khristoforovich Benkendorf'', {{OldStyleDate|4 July|1781 or 1783|23 June}} {{spaced ndash}} {{OldStyleDate|5 October|1844|11 September or 23 September}}), was a [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n [[History of Russian military ranks|Cavalry General]] and statesman, [[Adjutant General]] of [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]], a commander of ''partisan'' (''Kossak irregular'') units during the [[French invasion of Russia|War of 1812-13]]. However, he is most frequently remembered for his later role, under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], as the founding head of the [[Special Corps of Gendarmes|Gendarmes and the Secret Police]] in Imperial Russia.

==Life and career==
Alexander von Benckendorff was born into Russia's distinctive [[Baltic nobility]] to a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] family in [[Reval]] (now Tallinn) in today's [[Estonia]], son of General Baron {{Interlanguage link multi|Christoph von Benckendorff|de|3=Christoph Iwanowitsch von Benckendorff}} ([[Friedrichsham]], 12 January 1749 - 10 June 1823), who served as the military governor of [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]], and wife Baroness Anna Juliane Charlotte Schilling von Canstatt ([[Thalheim, Saxony|Thalheim]], 31 July 1744 - 11 March 1797), who held a high position at the [[Romanov dynasty|Romanov]] Court as senior lady-in-waiting and best friend of Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Fyodorovna]], and paternal grandson of Johann Michael von Benckendorff and wife Sophie von Löwenstern.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2005|page=32}} His brother [[Konstantin von Benkendorff]] was a general and diplomat, and his sister [[Dorothea von Lieven]] a socialite and political force in [[London]] and [[Paris]]. His other sister Maria von Benckendorff ([[Saint Petersburg]], 1784 - ?) married Ivan Georgiecitch Sevitsch.

Having received his education at a [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] [[boarding school]], Benckendorff started military service in 1798 in the [[Semyonovsky Regiment|Semyonovsky Life-Guards Regiment]].{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2005|page=32}} During [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]], Benckendorff led the [[Velizh]] offensive, taking prisoner three French generals. When [[Moscow]] was liberated, he became the commander of its garrison. In the foreign campaigns following, he defeated a French contingent at [[Tempelberg]] and was one of the first Russians to enter [[Berlin]]. He further distinguished himself [[Battle of Leipzig|at Leipzig]] and later cleared out the French forces occupying the [[Netherlands]]. After British and Prussian forces arrived to succeed him, his unit proceeded to take [[Leuven|Louvain]] and [[Mechelen]], liberating 600 imprisoned Englishmen on the way.

In 1821 he attempted to warn [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] against the threat from the [[Decembrist]] [[secret society|clandestine organisation]], but the Tsar ignored his note. After the 1825 [[Decembrist Revolt]], he sat on the investigation committee and lobbied for the creation of a [[Special Corps of Gendarmes|Corps of Gendarmes]] and a [[secret police]], the [[Third Section]] of [[His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|the Imperial Chancellery]]. He was the first Chief of Gendarmes and Executive Director of the Third Section from 1826 to 1844. Under his management, the Third Section established, i.a., a strict [[censorship]] over literature and theatre performances. His aim for [[Russian historiography]] was reflected in his statement that &quot;Russia's past was admirable, its present is more than magnificent and as for its future — it is beyond anything that the boldest mind can imagine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10102921 Economist article]&lt;/ref&gt; In his rôle as Chief Censor, he became involved in the fate and tragic death of [[Alexander Pushkin]] in an unnecessary duel, an involvement that for long made him an ''unmentionable'' in Russian historiography.

Yet by temperament, he was the very opposite of a proto-[[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Dzerzhinsky]] or a proto-[[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]]. He suffered from a bizarre tendency to forget his own name, and periodically had to be reminded of it by consulting his own visiting card.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mk.by/content/view/1063/47/] {{icon ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1830s, his family seat was the [[Gothic Revival]] manor, Schloss Fall (now [[Keila-Joa]]) near Tallinn in today's Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltische-ritterschaften.de/forum/?de=true&amp;language=de&amp;message=.73.1 Forum entry about Benckendorff's residence]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Dagö]].

He was married to Elisaveta Pavlovna Donez-Sacharshevskaya (11 September 1788 - 7 December 1857). Their daughters were: Countess Anna Alexandrovna Benckendorff (11 September 1818 - 19 November 1900), married to Count Rudolf Appony de Nágy-Appony; Countess Maria Alexandrovna Benckendorff (Saint Petersburg, 24 May 1820 - [[Rome]], 4 November 1880) married in Saint Petersburg on 12 January 1838 as his first wife Prince [[Grigori Petrovich Wolkonsky]] (Saint Petersburg, 28 March 1808 - [[Menton]]e, 7 May 1882); and Countess Sophia Alexandrovna Benckendorff (1830? - 1875), married to Pavel Grigorievich Demidov and to Prince Sergei Viktorovich Kutchubey.

==Benckendorff's notes==
A recent Russian publication reveals his own view of his early life: ''Zapiski Benkendorfa: Otechestvennaia voina; 1813 god: Osvobozhdenie Niderlandov'' (Benkendorff's Notes. The Patriotic War; 1813: The Liberation of the Netherlands): Iaziki slavyanskikh kul'tur, Moscow, 2001. ISBN 5-7859-0228-1. This book reproduces two sections of Benckendorff's private notes that had not seen publication since 1903, very lively on the events of the Napoleonic war, correspondences with his contemporaries, Bagration and others, and associated regimental histories.

According to that book, Benckendorff kept personal notes and diaries throughout his life. One additional source for his notes, in this case from the late 1830s, can be found in volume 91 of the journal ''Istoricheskii vestnik'' for 1903.
