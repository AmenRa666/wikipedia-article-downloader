'''USS ''Palomas'' (IX-91)''' was a two-masted, steel hulled, Miscellaneous Unclassified-Schooner in service with the [[United States Navy]]. She served during [[World War II]], and briefly after the war. She was sold for disposal by the [[Maritime Commission]] in 1947. 

Built as the schooner yacht '''''Goodwill''''' by the [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.]] in 1922, she was acquired by the U.S. Navy on  12 September 1942, and placed into service on 2 October 1942 as the Miscellaneous Unclassified-Schooner ''Palomas''.

==History==
Operating from [[San Diego]], [[California]], ''Palomas'' steamed along the southern California coast in a training capacity. A unit of the [[Western Sea Frontier]], ''Palomas'' protected the southern California area guarding [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and friendly shipping, and operated in a patrol capacity. She was assigned as a unit of ServRon 2 on 19 October 1943 and continued west coast operations with this unit until the war's end in 1945. 

After the cessation of hostilities, ''Palomas'' served as a radar training ship, serving out of [[Naval Station Treasure Island]]. She then reported to San Francisco for disposal on 1 June 1946. She was placed out of naval service on 10 August 1946, struck from the Naval Register on 25 September 1946, and transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 3 March 1947.

==Fate==
After sale to Ralph E. Larrabee in 1951 for $35,000 USD, her name was changed to ''Goodwill'' as she returned to civilian service. Larrabee, spent a total of $500,000 USD to restore her back to civilian condition. She was already a famous vessel among boat racers and yacht owners. She made a name for herself, being one of the largest civilian yachts on the [[Pacific Ocean]], and winning the TransPacific Race in both 1953 and 1959. She also made two Atlantic crossings sometime before or after her military service. 

===Sinking===
On 25 May 1969, ''Goodwill'' ran aground on [[Sacramento Reef]]. The wreck was located {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} off the coast of [[Baja California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TmO48kJzAmsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA45 |title=Goodwill, With All Hands Lost |work=MotorBoating |date=July 1969 |pages=45-46 |issn=1531-2623}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|180|mi|km}} south of the [[United States]] border. ''Goodwill'' was reported overdue on 31 May, after she was supposed to arrive at [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]] on 27 May. A joint search effort began with the [[United States Coast Guard]] and the [[Mexican Navy]]. On 1 July, her wreck was spotted half-careened on the reef, submerged under {{convert|25|ft|m}} of water by a search helicopter. The search continued until 6 June, when a private salvage crew arrived. Two bodies of the nine aboard were recovered. By 10 June, powerful surges and tides had battered the yacht's hull, and gutted the interior; the ship was rapidly breaking up. Though investigation of the incident had continued, salvage, like the ship, was abandoned.

==Ship Awards==
During her brief U.S. Navy service, ''Palomas'' earned the following decorations:
*[[American Campaign Medal]]
*[[World War II Victory Medal]]
