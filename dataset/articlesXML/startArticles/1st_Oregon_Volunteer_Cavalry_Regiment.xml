The '''First Regiment, Oregon volunteer Cavalry''' was a volunteer [[regiment]] in United States service [[Union army]] that was formed in response to the [[American Civil War]]. With men recruited in Oregon and some recruited in surrounding states, the regiment primarily served to protect the state of [[Oregon]] and surrounding territories during the [[American Civil War]].

==Background==
In 1861, Colonel [[George Wright (general)|George Wright]] requested permission from Oregon Governor [[John Whiteaker]] to form a cavalry company in the state, as Wright was commander of the District of Oregon that included the [[Washington Territory]].&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. (1989) ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright was motivated by the fact that there were a total of 700 soldiers and 19 officers in the Pacific Northwest at a time when there were often battles with Native Americans.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Some volunteers joined up, asked to provide their own horse, but were later discharged when the organization failed before Wright was transferred to [[California]].&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel Cody replaced Wright late in 1861 as [[United States Army]] regular troops were returned east for the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; To replace those troops, Wright sent volunteers from California to protect Oregon from attacks by Native Americans.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; In response, Oregon then commissioned [[Thomas R. Cornelius]] in November 1861 as colonel and ordered him to raise ten companies of cavalry troops. Oregonians were unhappy with California volunteers protecting Oregon.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

==Formation==
The initial part of the regiment (companies A through F) was organized and mustered into the army in Oregon from December 1861 to April 1862. In May 1862, it was sent into the [[Washington Territory]] to the [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla country]] to protect immigrants and miners along the [[Salmon River (Washington)|Salmon River]]. The 1st Oregon occupied [[Fort Walla Walla]] in June 1862 and sent out various expeditions over the next two years to fight the [[Snake Indians]] and other threats. Hence, the regiment was rarely intact as a single unit for much of the war. Several companies scattered to other frontier forts, including [[Fort Vancouver]] and [[Fort Dalles]] (see also [[The Dalles, Oregon]]) for detached duty such as constructing roads through the wilderness.

In January 1863, the remaining portion of the regiment (companies G, H, I, K, and M) were authorized and activated for duty. Companies G and H served at [[Camp Watson]] on [[Rock Creek (Wheeler County, Oregon)|Rock Creek]]; Company I was at [[Fort Klamath]], Company K at Fort Dalles and Companies L and M at [[Fort Boise]] in [[Idaho Territory]]. The battalion came together for several skirmishes with local Indians in the [[Harney County, Oregon|Harney Lake Valley]] and other locations.

Men signed up for a three-year tour of duty with the cavalry.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Pay was $31 per month for each soldier, and at the end of service men were given a $100 bounty and {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of land.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; In addition to Col. Cornelius, other officers included R. F. Maury, [[C. S. Drew]], [[Benjamin F. Harding]] as quartermaster, and J. S. Rinearson.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

==Disbanding==
In January 1865, Col. [[Reuben F. Maury]], 1st Oregon Cavalry, assumed command of the Federal District of Oregon. The 1st Oregon Cavalry mustered out November 20, 1866.

The 1st Oregon Volunteer Cavalry Regiment did not muster out all at once, but did so in stages beginning in November 1864.  Two years later there were only a small number of men remaining to muster out of service.
