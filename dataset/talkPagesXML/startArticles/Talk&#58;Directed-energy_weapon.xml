Well, what can I say, Wikipedia is ahead of it's reputation. Although A-60 Soviet aircraft made in 70's with a laser gun on board was WAY before american recent 747, it is not even mentioned in the article, it is after articles like this one that clueless american kids are running around yelling that USA is ahead in technology. Also, I do not seem to find any mention of Ranets microwave gun, I will not go to detail about it, here is some material: http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-PLA-PD-SAM.html#Ranets and a western source too. Also, it would be nice to mention russian Almaz-Antey High Energy Laser Directed Energy Weapon, also can be read about on the page I gave, and yes, it is like Thel, only it is mobile. You know, you can in fact generalize on the issue. I wonder, will someone add the information I mentioned, will someone make this an unbiased article, are people in this encyclopedia wanna-be interested in writing an encyclopedia or in creating an opinion forum? Don't call yourself an encyclopedia until you are one. [[Special:Contributions/99.231.50.118|99.231.50.118]] ([[User talk:99.231.50.118|talk]]) 02:08, 1 September 2008 (UTC)Pavel Golikov.

Pavel: the americans have been putting laser on airplanes basically since lasers were invented - yes even back in the 70's. it's only been now however that the technology has matured to the point where a viable battlefield weapon could be made. the ABL is NOT the first american effort to putting such a laser on an airplane. Before you are overly critical of people getting their facts straight you should do so yourself.

==BH-209 plasma cannon==
I do not see that the BH-209 is any more likely to be made real, than any other sci-fi plasma gun. [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] 09:23, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

the 'medusa' doesnt even rise into the 'not likely to be produced int he real world' category. The link cited is fraught with a fundamental lack of understanding of the concepts involved and psuedo science. For example the electrons at the collector end of a klystron are no longer relatavistic. they loose the vast majority of their kinetic energy while radiating RF energy. thats how a klystron WORKS. The RF from the klystron isnt going to 'bunch' the output electron beam. due to the comparativly slow speed of the electrons they would be out of phase with the RF generated in under 1 cycle - while the beam was still in the machine. not to mention little things like if you wanted to do something like this you would use as small a frequency as possible so as to decrease the amount of laser power required to generate this plasma waveguide.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.98.163.50|71.98.163.50]] ([[User talk:71.98.163.50|talk]]) 02:08, 25 August 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Weapon that shoots light at the eyes==
I've seen this device in use on a documentary on non-lethal weapons. It was a prototype I think, but more than rumoured. It emitted a cone of strobing green laser light. Could someone dig up some more info and tidy the article up? --[[User:KharBevNor|KharBevNor]] 23:56, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== Problems with lasers/Blooming ==

This section needs clarification for various reasons: It neglects to define &quot;blooming.&quot; It describes the plasma-forming effect of a powerful laser in the atmosphere (which I assume is the blooming effect) but then describes this as a positive effect for long range projection of the laser, rather than a problem. There is also a sentence noting that a laser is invisible unless something scatters its light, and the relevance of this isn't clear.

* ''Continuous wave laser beam propagation through an absorbing medium heats the medium along the path of the beam; the heating of the medium then induces a local change in the index of refraction of the medium which, in turn, causes some effects of spreading, distorting, bending, or defocusing of the beam. These are known as thermal blooming or thermal lensing effects. One important consequence of these effects is to spread the laser beam over a larger area, thereby reducing the intensity incident on a target.'' [http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R1726/]

* ''High power phenomena such as thermal blooming arising from absorption of beam power in the beam line optics or gas within the beam line, generally causes the beam diameter to increase dramatically. In the case of CO2 laser radiation, thermal blooming can take place if a significant amount of water or organic vapour is present inside the beam path. Such vapour if result from the evaporation of the oil or grease hat are used to lubricate bellow sections of the beamline.'' [http://info.tuwien.ac.at/iflt/safety/section3/1_17_1fr.htm]

* ''Absorption of laser energy causes local heating of the air. The resulting local reduction in both the air density and refractive index causes the laser beam to undergo thermal blooming, i.e., defocusing. This deleterious process can be significantly reduced by choosing an operating wavelength in an atmospheric window where the absorption is low.'' [http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=04REVIEW59]

Some links about blooming. — [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 03:28, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

why not just use two lasers focused on the same target? It is certainly doable

Because both lasers bloom and become ineffective. [[User:Bobman110|Bobman110]] 23:21, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

How would laser light lose power that fast if the laws of physics say otherwise then. The speed of light would be far too fast to have the bloom effect unless your aiming very long distances as this artice implies. ~~unknown~~  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.70.14.63|68.70.14.63]] ([[User talk:68.70.14.63|talk]]) 17:49, 17 December 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Seizure-inducing light weapon, &quot;or so the legends say...&quot; ==

&quot;There is said to exist a real non-lethal weapon that disorients a target by shooting disorienting lighting patterns at the eyes.&quot;

The phrase &quot;there is said to exist&quot; has no place in an encyclopedia. Said by whom, and why has it not been conclusively proven or refuted?


:I removed it.  If anyone has any citable information on such a device, post it.  Otherwise there's no reason for it to be there. [[User:Ziiv|Ziiv]] 15:16, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== Microwave guns ==

Microwave guns are NOT masers. Thats like calling a HERF gun a laser. Some companies think they can rename stuff to fit their &quot;new&quot; &quot;cool&quot; product but it needs to stop. Masers a hundred year old technology thats a direct prelude to lasers. The only major difference between masers and lasers, is that masers don't lase but they do have a lasing chamber that can get some limited wave form alignment in the beam. So, with that in mind I removed the &quot;aka&quot; reference from the Microwave section.

== Move or Delete Pulse rifles ==

Pulse rifles as defined in the article can include any weapon the fires in pulses. Who ever wrote that doesn't have a clue about modern small arms. Any pistol, sub machine gun, assault rifle, and/or machine gun would qualify as a &quot;pulse rifle&quot; if it includes a burst fire mode. Normally burst fire modes are three shots per pull of the trigger but this is adjustable on some guns or fully programmable on some very high tech weapons (there is an advanced OICW Landwarrior prototype that supports this and Glock has another &quot;digital&quot; weapon that supports it too). The G11 was released to market in the 80's, so this stuff is nothing &quot;new&quot;. Very cool stuff but it does not belong in an article about direct energy weapons because it is not a direct energy weapon of any kind. Please move it or delete it.

-MegaBurn

: I agree. &quot;Pulse rifle&quot; is just a cool-sounding term that's been tossed into various SF movies and novels. It has no real definition that pertains to directed energy weapons. I've deleted the section (and you could have done that yourself; it's allowed  :-)  [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 21:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Relationship to radar ==

The claim that ''Radar may be a by-product of this research'' seems too
strong.  There's an early overlap of research, for obvious reasons, but it doesn't
appear that failed research by Grindell-Matthews or anyone else substantially led to radar.

There is justification that Watson-Watt and Wilkins suggested to the British
Air Ministry the use of radio for aircraft detection, after being asked whether
a &quot;death ray&quot; was possible and concluding that it was not feasible (see
[[History of_radar#Robert Watson-Watt]]).

[[User:JDX|JDX]] 05:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

The statement referenced above has no place in the article. Nothing referenced in the article nor found by myself (admittedly online only) has given any indication that the mention of Grindell-Matthews merits placement in this article. As such I am removing it. If any ''valid'' sources become available, preferably ones with more veracity than Grindell-Matthews himself, then of course it could be replaced. His refusal to provide proof, to anyone, of his claims, smacks of a con game. At least IMHO. Statement &quot;Radar may be a by-product of this research&quot; being deleted.[[User:Radiooperator|Radiooperator]] 18:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

This subsection has been moved to [[Dazzler (weapon)]] and other references to dazzlers, etc removed from the article.  This is purely to avoid an edit war with [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] who seems to want a rather narrow definition of the topic. -- [[User:JDX|JDX]] 08:48, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, I narrowly believe that an article about weapons should confine itself to weapons, and not spin speculation about things that can be used as weapons (which, as you know if you're a Monty Python fan, includes boxes of raspberries).

The new subsection on &quot;Types&quot; partly addresses my concerns but I'm wondering if it's not better to scrap this entire article and have the general categories listed under [[Energy weapon]]s and then a separate article for each type: EMP, radio, laser, particle, sonic, mythical, fictional (ie raygun), etc.  Does the military have a standard definition for the term? -- [[User:JDX|JDX]] 02:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

==Tesla 1==

I added a quote to the Tesla section about his death ray.  I think the section needs to be changed; it is not proven that he was just lying.  With his brilliance, it is very possible that he built such a machine.  However, I do think it needs to be noted that he placed it next to his pigeons and told visitors there was a very dangerous weapon in the crate.  He may have been lying to scare others away from his pigeons, but if you read some of the newspaper articles at the time, you will see that he apparently knows what he is talking about.  Such specific mentions, as it involving four new inventions, suggests it is real.  If he were to make up such a number, it would surely be divisible by 3, and I think most people realize 4 is not divisible by 3.  I think the article should be changed, as there is a possibility that he did do as he said.

==Tesla 2==
[[Nikola Tesla]] (1856 - 1943) was a noted inventor, scientist and electrical engineer.  He invented [[Tesla coil]]s, transformers, [[alternating current]] electric [[generator]]s and was a major early pioneer of [[radio]] technology. He was also noted for making some remarkable claims, among them that he had developed what he called a &quot;[[teleforce]]&quot; weapon &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tesla's Ray&quot;. Time, July 23, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;  The press called it a &quot;''peace ray''&quot;  or death ray. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tesla, at 78, Bares New 'Death-Beam&quot;', New York Times, July 11, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Tesla Invents Peace Ray&quot;. New York Sun, July 10, 1934. &lt;/ref&gt; 
Components included &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Death-Ray Machine Described&quot;, New York Sun, July 11, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &quot;A Machine to End War&quot;. Feb. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;: 
# An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a high vacuum as in the past. This, according to Tesla in 1934, was accomplished.
# A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force. This, according to Tesla, was also accomplished.
# A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the second mechanism. 
# A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention. 
Tesla worked on plans for a directed-energy weapon between the early 1900s till the time of his death. Records of his device indicate that it was based on a narrow stream of atomic clusters of liquid mercury or tungsten accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his [[Magnifying transmitter|magnifying transformer]]). Tesla gave the following discription concerning the ''[[Charged particle beam|particle gun]]'''s operation: 
: [The nozzel would] &quot;''send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks''&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Beam to Kill Army at 200 Miles, Tesla's Claim on 78th Birthday&quot;. July 11, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;
The weapon could be used against ground based infantry or for antiaircraft purposes. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Death Ray' for Planes&quot;. New York Times, September 22, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla tried to interest the [[United States Department of Defense|US War Department]] in the device. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aerial Defense 'Death-Beam' Offered to U. S. By Tesla&quot; July 12, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; He also offered this invention to European countries.&lt;ref&gt; O'Neill, John J., &quot;[http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art12.html Tesla Tries To Prevent World War II]&quot;. (unpublished Chapter 34 of Prodigal Genius) (PBS)&lt;/ref&gt; None of the governments purchased a contract to build the device. 

Various theories persist regarding the nature of this device and the whereabouts of Tesla's complete schematics for it. Immediatly after his death, his effects were confiscated and the room's safe opened. The FBI never found the schematics nor any prototype. The so-called &quot;''peace ray''&quot; constitues a part of some [[conspiracy theories]] as a means of destruction.

I wouldn't completely agree with the above remark by KarlBunker.  As he says, there's a lot of nonsense associated with the subject but it's important to document that lore provided that it's clearly stated which claims are baseless and which can actually be attributed to Tesla and which are myths about the man.  The section should be reinstated with minor changes if someone will follow up on the cited references and clearly distinguish real achievements from the (publically reported) myths.

:I agree with [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]]. I find that the article includes &quot;arguments&quot; for some of Tesla's scientifically unsupported claims stated in the article as fact to be very misleading. As someone unfamiliar with Tesla's work and was just reading a few choice articles about him, it is only until you read these discussion pages that there are refutations for some outlandish claims and &quot;facts&quot; in the articles. Treatment of the more outrageous claims as if they were in league with his many notable contributions, and as if there were not largely a consensus among modern scientists as to their improbability, should be cleaned up. As of this post JDX's suggestion to separate myth from man and fact from fiction has not been completed in a clear manner. 
:I don't suggest getting rid of the claims and myths, they're fun and interesting. I don't think anyone would like to see that. But I suspect the only reason they remain as is is because the user arguing that those claims be treated on the same level in the article, as others more solidly grounded in reality, seems personally offended by the notion that they could possibly be the mere fantasies of a brilliant mind nearing the end. That Tesla manages to convince people like the this user 70 years after his death is testament to his genius to be sure. 
:But let's get real here, don't let articles about such an important and interesting figure be hijacked by someone who cites outdated material exclusively and merely rephrases his opponents argument and aims it in the opposite direction. Someone whose argumentative skills never made it out of the schoolyard should not be allowed to impose his will after failing to make a valid point. May I suggest some sort of &quot;disputed claims&quot; header or tag? No one writes about the flat earth theory without including that it is false. The more ludicrous claims made by Tesla may be fact, in that they actually were said by him, but that doesn't mean they're any less ludicrous.

**I also agree with [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]]. Writing and reading about Tesla is fun, because is there is something in it for everybody. Some like the scientific achievements, some enjoy his rather farflung ideas of the time when he was going nuts. AUthors also like Tesla. They can depict some of his more useful and intriguing ideas and use them to subsantiate their rather irrelevant claims. However, that is where the trouble starts. If someone (even a PhD) writes about a subject, it does not mean any of his/her claims are in any way scientifically sound. You can easily find papers about anything (and I mean ANYTHING), but only if the claims in these papers have been cross-checked by other members of the scientific community can they be used in further scientific discourse. Therefore, the articles by Corum, Corum and Daum cited above (18 years old and self-published!) cannot be used in a discourse. This is a major problem of Wikipedia. Many contributors believe that something is true because they found an interesting looking paper on it. Not so! Thus, be careful in what you claim to be &quot;uniformed&quot; or &quot;verifiable facts.&quot;  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ramander|Ramander]] ([[User talk:Ramander|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ramander|contribs]]) 13:47, 6 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Problems with lasers ==

I don't have any research, but I speculate that another hypothetical problem with lasers surrounds their stealthyness. A gun barrel could me made longer so that the only people who see the &quot;muzzle flash&quot; (if it can really be called that on a laser) are the ones being shot, but the real problem comes from noise and heat. Since all of the noise will probably come from the flash-evaporation of the target it would be very difficult to suppress the noise without using some hypothetical technology. 

The heat could also allow some one with infrared vision to see the beem and follow it back to the person who fired it. I also have to wonder if the heat might linger. If the laser heats the air in it's path enough, then the heat dissipation might be slow enough that some one with an infrared camera could see and follow the trail for quite some time after firing the laser weapon.

For those reasons, a Laser would be undesirable as an infantry weapon atleast. A self-propelled laser Counter Artillary unit could still adapt a sort of shoot &amp; scoot tactic.

I didn't add this to the main article because I don't have any research to back it up, and it's just speculation. If the laser is fired for a short pulse, the heat disipation and tracking problem could be resolved. THe noise problem doesn't give away the position of the person firing it, but it does put other enemy units on alert. The affect of the noise could be lessoned by syncronizing the first volly of fire so that all enemy targets are eliminated simultaniously the way artillary batteries sincronize the times their ordinance strikes their targets. That my not be practical with infantry, and all of it is somewhat theoretical. It needs research to confirm if this actually occurs.

Naturally combat weapons already do create a lot of noise, and tracer rounds reveal the shooters position. The real issue is just to what degree this happens.

I do not think that noise will be problem with laser weapons in battlefield conditions. In cases of [[THEL]] and [[COIL]] the problem will be the ammunition, and in every case the excess heat.

All current lasers have a [[thermal efficiency]] below 20%. That means over 80% of the energy is released as a waste heat. Imagine that as a IR target in battlefield conditions!

'''An example:'''
US military is switching from [[chemical laser|chemical lasers]] to [[solid-state laser|solid-state ones]] because of the ammunition problem. (New Scientist - Issue 26 Aug 2006 [http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/522963/])

With solid-state lasers the energy needed is generated by the vehicle. [[M1 Abrams]] has a [[gas turbine]] engine that generates about 1000 kW. The gas turbine itself has a thermal efficiency of ~60%, so the engine running generates about 600 kW waste heat.

Now, if the 1000 kW output is used to fire the laser weapon, the general heat output would be 1400 kW (800 kW from the laser + 600 kW from the turbine).

Use that for 15 minutes and you have one pretty hot tank. -- [[User:Talamus|Talamus]] 15:56, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

For the Tesla section


This is my first time asking so please forgive me for any social error. It uses to be one of my hobbies to study Tesla's weapon designs. I think I still have a disk of his poorly sanitized papers on particle weapon designs.  Would this be a good idea to add? They were based partly on superheated mercury and are internationally illegal to use in war, but the article did not make reference to them. The papers were declared secret, but they only used a black marker type think to cover up the sections. I used a photo shop program and work is plainly legible.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/134.204.228.36|134.204.228.36]] ([[User talk:134.204.228.36|talk]]) 12:41, 22 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Lasers do produce a recoil ==
* Under Lasers, it is stated that &quot;Lasers do not produce recoil.&quot; when in fact they do. 2 simple theorems dictate so. The first is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The transmission of the laser MUST have an equal and opposite reaction, or recoil. Also, light carries some momentum, this means that is has some mass and velocity. If you change the velocity of the mass (as you do with a laser) then you apple some force. If energy is conserved, which it is, then there must be some normalizing force that leave the system in equilibrium, recoil. If you look into Heizenbergs Uncertainty Principle with some attention to detail you will see that we cant dircetly measure electron position and momentum because in measuring one (using light) we have to alter the other. Thus light can add momentum to a particle, meaning it must have momentum as well. However, I will grant any nay-sayers that the effect is nearly negligable and that you would never feel the effect with a typical hand held laser, but there is a great difference between typical hand held lasers and laser weaponary. 17:08, 21 December 2006 [[User:138.162.5.12]]
*Ahem. Light has no mass (check [[Photon]]). It would be pretty devastating if that were different, due to relativity (mass increasing with speed, with lim(infinite) at light speed. Light carries no momentum (which is mass * velocity^2, and as we know, x * 0 is 0). The reason that light can change the momentum of a particle is because light carres ''energy'', not momentum. [[User:212.149.48.44|212.149.48.44]] 15:54, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
*Light '''does''' have a slight momentum. This, for example, is how pressure of sunlight can push gas and dust out of a [[comet]] to make its tail. [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] 05:20, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''NON-SENSE!''' sunlight causes volatiles in the comet to sublime and eject gas and dust from the comet. [[User:T.Neo|T.Neo]] ([[User talk:T.Neo|talk]]) 15:04, 15 December 2007 (UTC)
*It amazes me how many people lack an elementary knowledge of modern physics, and yet still post these kinds of comments without bothering to look them up.  Anyone who bothers to check a high-school physics book will see that light certainly does carry momentum.  Furthermore, radiation pressure and solar wind are responsible for the tail of a comet.  If some kind of sublimation pressure were responsible, it would push the gas and dust in all directions equally, rather than producing a distinct tail in one direction (notably, the direction that points directly away from the sun) as actually occurs.

* actually, photons do have mass, but only in the form of relativistic and not rest mass. because of this, they should not have any inertial momentum, and hence should not have any recoil in the ordinary newtonian sense. (recoil assumes that an obect undergoes acceleration, and photons do not undergo acceleration for the simple reason that it is impossible to accelerate anything into lightspeed unless infinite energy is applied - if that were so, then the recoil energy must be infinite as well).

:: No, I'm afraid you are wrong.  I will say it again: please look it up before you make these kinds of statements.  But since no one seems willing to look it up, I will explain in more detail.

::&quot;actually, photons do have mass, but only in the form of relativistic and not rest mass.&quot;

::Just to make sure we're speaking the same language, I will first point out that the word &quot;mass&quot; in normal modern physics usage means rest mass.  Otherwise there would be no reason to distinguish between &quot;mass&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; and it would become hard to talk about anything.

::&quot;they should not have any inertial momentum, and hence should not have any recoil in the ordinary newtonian sense.&quot;

::If you mean &quot;if the universe obeyed Newtonian physics then there would be no recoil&quot; then I agree.  If you mean &quot;there is no recoil&quot; then I disagree.  Photons have momentum whether you believe it or not.  The momentum p of a photon is given by the pretty famous formula p = E/c (that would be one of the first formulas you found if you had done a web search, but I digress).  You may be thinking of the Newtonian formula for momentum, p = mv, which, of course, is completely wrong at velocities near the speed of light (that's the whole point of relativity, actually).  In relativity, the formula for momentum is dilated by the same gamma factor (1 - v^2/c^2)^(-1/2) as all the other quantities, which obviously approaches infinity as v approaches c, mathematically canceling out the effect of the mass going to zero.

::&quot;recoil assumes that an obect undergoes acceleration&quot;

::No, recoil is the ACT of a massive object &quot;A&quot; undergoing acceleration (receiving momentum) due to imparting momentum upon another (not necessarily massive) object &quot;B&quot;.  There is no reason that object &quot;B&quot; has to accelerate if it is massless (in fact, if I recall correctly, massless objects can never accelerate or decelerate at all; they are all frozen at c).  It just has to receive momentum (which it does when it comes into existence). [[User:Xezlec|Xezlec]] ([[User talk:Xezlec|talk]]) 05:22, 15 March 2008 (UTC)

I'm curious to know something.  

This article makes a lot of the problems facing the creators of D-E weapons.  With all this in mind, it doesn't look like there's any point in developing them . . unless I've missed something.  Regular projectile and explosive weapons seem to have all the destructive potential we need.  Is there any reason a commander or soldier (as opposed to a scientist with obsessive/compulsive disorder) would want to have a D-E weapon?  What can they do that a regular cannon can't do better?

* The most obvious answer would be far too short to be included in the article. The biggest advantage of energy weapons in general over mass-based weapons in general would be in terms of portability, versatility, and safety. After all, carrying a battery/power pack which could be used to power weapons or other utilities is more convenient that carrying live ammunition. [[User:Ischaramoochie|Ischaramoochie]] ([[User talk:Ischaramoochie|talk]]) 01:41, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

* Unlike projectile weapons or bombs, lasers allow soldiers to engage targets instantly (or at the speed of light if you want to be pedantic), with great accuracy, and often at long range.  The military currently believes that lasers may be useful in destroying improvised explosive devices; destroying rockets, artillery, and mortar rounds in-flight; destroying man-portable missiles in-flight; and percision engagement of targets in close proximity to non-combatants.

:Well of course,the real issues are Columb (electrical) repulsion and the magnetic field in space which is even worse near the Earth.  A 1 centimeter beam will spread out to a diameter 100s of times wider by the time it has traveled to the target.  And of course the beam will curve enough to make aiming extremely difficult.

Those are just the technical issues.  The politics of ICBMs makes it very worrying to have a bunch of energy weapons in orbit which could just as well be aimed at satellites and spacecraft.  Even the appearance of a good chance to survive a nuclear war could actually encourage one.

== Silent weapons ==

&quot;Laser beams do not generate sound or light that would be detected by human senses when emitted, so the weapon would not betray its user's position when fired.&quot;

While this is true about the beam, it isn't always true about either the target (mentioned before), or the weapon itself.  Some equipment can make a lot of sound - but the ones for weapons obviously would best be silent at least the source.

A more practical use of lasers is to paint a target for a physical weapon such as a gravity or chemical bomb.

== Why don't we use these again? ==

Sorry for this.

I realize that talk pages aren't for general disscusion of the subject, but this sort of pretains to the artcile.

It seems out of date to me. The main issues mentioned as to why we don't use them a lot or hy we don't have general DE weapons are more or less not an issue.

Today, one can modify a normal laser pointer to melt through various materials, and that is around the size of a pencil. To me, somthing the size of an rifle would have much more room to store power supply, and would be able to eaidly inflict burn wounds.

== Germany's DEW during World War II ==

Content is highly douptful, only source only states facts contrary to content. Source only contains information about a never-in-use research facility, and the method of scientist to get fundings for their projects by let it look like important work that could help win the war (already after the USA joined the war and the Nazis lost more and more battles).
Only mentoined DEW in the article is a prototype or copy of the prototype of the norwegian scientist Rolf Wideröe, who wanted to save his brother. Due to text structure and grammar, the author seems to connect this case to others where a man tried to get attention from German officials to gain something of interest (in this case the life of the brother), but without actual scientific foundation. Additionally, the text states, that the device should have been put there under tests, but never was due to the invasion.

In brief: Only source describes a desperate war-monger, who turns to science for a wonder weapon, that were proclaimed as those by the scientist, but without any realistic foundation and only for the purpose of achieving personal goals (as more money for other research projects or saving lifes of relatives and co-workers).

== Removal of information by potentially vested interests/Disinfo ==

RE: Batvette (and some others)

Thanks for declaring your US military web background on your page. Clearly there are a lot of military people getting involved in this article. Where their content is objective I would welcome this. Where it is military disinfo or disregard for others content it would obviously not be welcome.

This article needs a lot of disinformation removed. 

That which I have submitted doesn't come into that category.

The sections which i have reinstated previously to our actions were different ones where people have removed them
without valid reason so your point doesn't apply.

Half of my links that you say were broken were still active, other files were moved. With regard to the ones where the website admin had shifted them (Official US and Canadian military or peace corp sites) please attempt to replace the link by locating the document specified rather than simply removing data.

This page is extremely convoluted with information of limited relevance already and quotations would make it worse. It needs to be more succinct. 

Please look at the specific sections of the references and dispute them here first before just removing the work
provided. You should read the content I have submitted and be specific about what you are disputing. 

If you want to cut the crap out of this article I suggest you start from the bottom up.

I am going to proceed to reinstate the information and update the broken links.


With regards to moving this article forward, it needs to make references to DEWs being used as a form of Electronic Attack which comes under Electronic Warfare. 

It should also move to reference military satellite ('Milsat') usage as Directed Energy Weapons.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Radicalmix66|Radicalmix66]] ([[User talk:Radicalmix66|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Radicalmix66|contribs]]) 19:17, 29 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

If you're looking to establish editorial control over this article and wish to fight about it, you're going nowhere with such personal attacks and false accusations about the intents of other editors. (In fact it suggests a POV agenda of your own, in light of the unsupported edits)
:Secondly you want other editors to fix broken links and find references that have expired or were removed, for material you enter? Surely you are joking. I'm going to do as I have done and remove any material that lacks supporting text in the references as provided. Nobody is suggesting you enter direct quotations in the article, but the references need to support the claims- for instance the reference you used to back up the claim that said weapons were available for &quot;decades&quot; didn't say that at all- it was a contractor/vendor saying he had worked in development for decades.

You refused to provide any specific detail for your reasoning, just saying that is 'your right' or some other similar disrespectful and arrogant comment. 
I've encourage you to go into specifics because your comments have not been specific and have been increasingly inflammatory, speculative and intentionally offensive (notes on edits). 

The amount of information you've decided to remove has only stabilized in the last week or two and initially the changes were varying. 

Recently your changes have become more aggressive and consistent. You have never gone into detail on things you removed and it is this attack like approach which has led me to believe that your changes are malicious. 

Of course we welcome multiple inputs to articles as this is democratic. But when this appears to amount to getting your military/defence mates to pitch in with similar chat and no logic it's pretty transparent and does not help at all. 

Despite this, I note that one of the pseudonyms of the person/persons now suddenly replicating such activity decided to posted some (albeit minor) relevant detail on my talk page rather than here. I choose to see this as an opportunity to move forward. The relevant comment is as follows:

:a war-college paper discussing ways a weapon ''might'' be used does not support a statement that those weapons ''are'' being used that way. (EEng)

Ok so firstly I would say that this seems to refer to the University of Wisconsin Electromagnetic Spectrum Tutorial as this is the only university based reference deleted. 

I'm not sure what fact it is he is contesting is not accurate or represented by the University tutorial; but two things spring to mind:
1. The facts portrayed by the article are fairly obvious to the majority of people. Radiation in the Radio spectrum is invisible. This is self evident? So these waves can pass through walls. Please make it clear if this is what you are contesting or something else?

2. You have removed way more than just that text and reference. I believe almost all of the other references are from official government bodies. Largely, as mentioned, those militaries spoken of. So please provide information as to why you think what they say they do is not sufficient substantiation that they are engaged in such activities. 

I take the point that the use of the complaint might be relevant to the use of the word &quot;commonly&quot; and I will remove that. However the documents explicitly state that such weapons are part of Information Operations so this is accurate.

:::What those documents state about &quot;Info Ops&quot; and DEW are not supportive of the claims in the article that state that Info Ops ARE being currently conducted domestically and DEWs ARE currently being used as part of them. It's like finding a military guide that says we have nukes and can use them so this validates a claim made that the military just nuked Cleveland. Other specific problems include that the weapons have not BEEN DEVELOPED for decades, they have been IN DEVELOPMENT for decades. Why did you change that? And what's with the BS about satellites? There is NO evidence to substantiate that a space based directed energy weapon system has ever been successfully tested let alone deployed. AND this nonsense about &quot;targets&quot; being &quot;misdiagnosed&quot;. Where did that come from? The Mind Control forums?

A link to the wikipedia information which states what you have said. The document was carried by Leeds University until recently when they changed their Intranet. This why the link was updated. This seems a rotten way to try and remove info rather than discuss content specifics. You are implying that the document is falsified. Is that correct?

I'm saying that we cannot verify that it is authentic, and consequently we can't use it as a source.

== WTF are HERF guns ==

HERF guns redirect here, but here does not define or describe or reference HERF. [[Special:Contributions/172.5.154.148|172.5.154.148]] ([[User talk:172.5.154.148|talk]]) 19:03, 20 November 2013 (UTC)

:A Google search suggests that it refers to &quot;high-energy radio frequency&quot;.  [https://www.google.co.uk/#q=herf+gun] From what I can figure out, it is some sort of homebuilt radio-frequency directional electronic-gizmo zapper, built out of the magnetron from a microwave oven, along with other components.

== The &quot;problems&quot; section ==

The section titled &quot;Problems and ethical considerations&quot; is only focused on laser weapons. No mentioning of the problems facing any other type of weapons mentioned in the article. Also, there are exactly zero &quot;ethical considerations&quot; mentioned.

In fact, the whole article is focused on lasers a lot more than electromagnetic or microwave for example that they seem like a small expansion of an article about laser weapons.

I think the article needs reorganization. --[[User:AbderrahmanNajjar|Abderrahman]] ([[User talk:AbderrahmanNajjar|talk]]) 09:54, 11 June 2014 (UTC)

== This article is a mess. ==

I wonder if anyone else agrees with me that this article is unfocused and somewhat 'fannish' in terms of its account of Directed Energy weapons. The problems, as I see them, are:

1) It lacks any real sense of overview. The history section should be one of the first sub sections here, below the definition of what directed energy weapons are; thus historicizing the interminable and scattergun treatment of detail here.

2) There is an eccentric choice of detail here, from multiple unconfirmed conspiracy theories (which, if included, should really be included in a subsection of their own, or removed totally from the article) to multiple accounts of experiments in directed energy that have not produced any weapon worthy of the name.

3) Even the useful detail is very often unfocused and confusing. The unstructured nature of the 'Non-lethal weapons' section here is instructive.

4)
* There
* is
* too
* much 
* bulletpointing

--to the detriment of clarity, and creating the chaotic 'listing' effect in the article as a whole.

5) The article reads at times like a promo piece for the possible application of technologies, indulging in tiresome speculation into how current theoretical or practical problems might be solved in some future scenario. There is too much speculation, in short, and too little substantiation. 

Some capable editor is needed to organize and hack away at the overgrown mess that is this article.

Hope this helps.
