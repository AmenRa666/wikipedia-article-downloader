The '''fortifications of Valletta''' ({{lang-mt|Is-Swar tal-Belt Valletta}}) are a series of [[defensive wall]]s and other [[fortifications]] which surround the capital city of [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. The first fortification to be built was [[Fort Saint Elmo]] in 1552, but the fortifications of the city proper began to be built in 1566 when it was founded by [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Jean Parisot de Valette|Jean de Valette]]. Modifications were made throughout the following centuries, with the last major addition being [[Lascaris Battery|Fort Lascaris]] which was completed in 1856. Most of the fortifications remain largely intact today.

The city of Valletta, along with [[Nicosia]] in Cyprus, was considered to be a practical example of an [[ideal city]] of the Renaissance, and this was due to its fortifications as well as the urban life within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosmescu|first1=Dragos|title=Nicosia|url=http://fortified-places.com/nicosia/|website=fortified-places.com|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortifications were well known throughout Europe by the 17th century, and might have influenced the designs of part of the [[Fortress of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luxembourg|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/luxembourg/|website=fortified-places.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222023008/http://www.fortified-places.com/luxembourg/|archivedate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1878 book, Valletta was described as &quot;one of the best fortified [cities] in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pembroke Fetridge|first1=William|title=The American Travellers' Guides: Hand-books for Travellers in Europe and the East, Being a Guide Through Great Britain and Ireland, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Greece, Switzerland, Tyrol, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Spain, and Portugal|date=1874|publisher=Fetridge &amp; Company|page=517|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=AhE2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA517#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Valletta's fortifications are regarded as the most important of the [[fortifications of Malta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malta restores her historic fortifications|journal=Arx - International Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=July 2011|volume=8|page=7|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/arx-journal-vol-8.html|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they form part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Valletta|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/131|website=UNESCO World Heritage List|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
The construction of a fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula was first proposed in 1524, when the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] sent a commission to inspect the Maltese Islands.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; Back then, the only fortification on the peninsula was a militia watchtower built by the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] in 1488.&lt;ref name=stelmo&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort St. Elmo|url=http://heritagemalta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FORT-ST-ELMO.pdf|website=[[Heritage Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206083119/http://heritagemalta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FORT-ST-ELMO.pdf|archivedate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was strengthened in 1533, but the proposed city was not built since the Order focused on building the fortifications of [[Birgu]], which had become their base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Il-Gran Mastri - Ġabra ta' Tagħrif dwar l-Istorja ta' Malta fi Żmienhom - L-Ewwel Volum 1530-1680|date=1992|publisher=Valletta Publishing &amp; Promotion Co. Ltd.|location=[[Valletta]]|page=22|language=mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1551, an Ottoman force briefly attacked Malta, and then [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)|sacked Gozo]] and [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|captured Tripoli]], and as a result, the Order set up a commission to improve the island's fortifications. In 1552, the Aragonese watchtower was demolished and [[Fort Saint Elmo]] was built in its place. The fort played a significant role in the [[Great Siege of Malta]] of 1565. It eventually fell after a month of fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general [[Dragut]] was killed). The knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived, and the siege was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=James|title=History's bloodiest siege used human heads as cannonballs|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-466818/Historys-bloodiest-siege-used-human-heads-cannonballs.html|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
After the Order emerged victorious from the siege, it received financial support from Europe, which was used to construct the new capital city on the Sciberras Peninsula. The Italian engineer [[Francesco Laparelli]] was sent by the Pope to design the city's fortifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eccardt|first1=Thomas M.|title=Secrets of the Seven Smallest States of Europe: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City|date=2005|publisher=Hippocrene Books|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=9780781810326|page=235|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=gQFzO_v_uwwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were designed along the [[Star fort|Italian bastioned system]].&lt;ref name=militarch1566&gt;{{cite web|title=Valletta - 1566|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/valletta-1566.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laparelli's original design consisted of a bastioned [[enceinte]], with nine [[Cavalier (fortification)|cavaliers]] and a ditch. The city was to be designed along a [[grid plan]], and was to include a naval [[arsenal]] and a ''[[Manderaggio]]'' (a harbour for small ships).&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The city's first stone was laid by Grand Master [[Jean Parisot de Valette|Jean de Valette]] on 28 March 1566, and the new city was called ''Valletta'' in his honour. The city walls were among the first structures to be built within the city, and were largely complete by the 1570s. Some changes were made to the design while the city was being constructed, and only two cavaliers were constructed, while the arsenal and Manderaggio were never built. Fort St. Elmo, which had been severely damaged in the 1565 siege, was also rebuilt and integrated in the city walls.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The city of Valletta officially became the capital city of Malta and the seat of the Order on 18 March 1571, although it was still unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaul|first1=Simon|title=Malta, Gozo &amp; Comino|date=2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=9781860113659|page=100|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=Fevix8jSqg0C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century, Valletta was the largest settlement in Malta.&lt;ref name=militarch1566/&gt;

===Improvements and modifications===
[[File:GrandHarbourValletta1801.jpg|thumb|left|View of Valletta and the [[Grand Harbour]] in 1801]]

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Valletta's fortifications were strengthened with the construction of various [[outwork]]s, consisting of four [[counterguard]]s along the land front, as well as a [[covertway]] and a [[glacis]]. The northern end of the peninsula, including Fort St. Elmo, was also enclosed in a bastioned enceinte (known as the [[Gregorio Carafa|Carafa]] Enceinte) in the late 1680s to prevent a landing from the sea.&lt;ref name=stelmo/&gt;

Despite the modifications, it was realized that the walls of Valletta were not strong enough to withstand a long siege. In 1635, construction of the [[Floriana Lines]] commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of [[Floriana]] developed in the area between the Floriana Lines and the Valletta Land Front, and it is now a town in its own right.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attard|first1=Sonia|title=The Valletta Fortifications|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/vallettafort.shtml|website=aboutmalta.com|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flanks of the city were further protected in the 17th and 18th century, with the construction of the [[Santa Margherita Lines]], [[Cottonera Lines]] and [[Fort Ricasoli]] on the [[Grand Harbour]] side, and [[Fort Manoel]] and [[Fort Tigné]] on the [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knights' Fortifications around the Harbours of Malta|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/982/|website=UNESCO Tentative Lists|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further proposals, including construction of fortifications on Corradino and [[Ta' Xbiex]], were also made but were never implemented.&lt;ref name=arx-manoel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Fort Manoel|journal=ARX Occasional Papers|date=2014|volume=4|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/arx-fort-manoel-occasional-papers-4.html|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French occupation and British rule===
[[File:Goats at Port Real Wellcome L0045092.jpg|thumb|[[City Gate (Valletta)#Third City Gate|Porta Reale]], constructed in 1853 and demolished in 1963]]

The fortifications of Valletta first saw use during the [[French occupation of Malta|French invasion of Malta]] on 9 June 1798. The Order capitulated only three days later on 12 June, and Valletta and its fortifications were handed over to the French. Upon viewing the fortifications, [[Napoleon]] reportedly remarked &quot;I am very glad that they opened the gate for us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valletta - The Fortifications|url=http://romeartlover.tripod.com/Malta3.html|website=romeartlover.tripod.com|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of months after the beginning of the French occupation, the Maltese people rebelled against the French and [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|blockaded them in the Harbour area]] with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese support. The French managed to hold out in Valletta until September 1800, when General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois|Vaubois]] capitulated to the British, who took control of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conflict for Malta, 1798 – 1802|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/1798/c_Malta.html|website=napoleon-series.org|accessdate=11 July 2015|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various modifications were made to Valletta's fortifications during British rule. The most significant of these was the construction of [[Lascaris Battery|Fort Lascaris]] between 1854 and 1856. Other alterations included the addition of [[artillery battery|batteries]] and concrete gun emplacements, changes to parapets and their embrasures, and the construction of [[gunpowder magazine]]s. All three original Hospitaller gateways to Valletta were demolished, and two of them were replaced by larger gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valletta|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1572.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=11 September 2015|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British proposed the demolition of the fortifications a number of times in the 19th century. The first proposal was made by Major-General [[Henry Pigot]] at the beginning of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonello|first1=Giovanni|title=Let’s hide the majestic bastions|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121118/life-features/Let-s-hide-the-majestic-bastions.445894|accessdate=5 October 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, a proposal was made to demolish [[Saint James Cavalier]] to make way for a military hospital. In 1855, Sir [[John Lysaght Pennefather]] proposed the construction of a [[citadel]] on the high ground of the Sciberras peninsula, on the site of the Valletta Land Front and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regimental Hospitals and Military Hospitals of the Malta Garrison|url=http://www.maltaramc.com/articles/contents/reghosp.html|website=maltarmc.com|publisher=British Army Medical Services  And the Malta Garrison  1799 – 1979|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the demolition of the city's outworks was proposed, while the demolition of the entire land front was suggested in 1882.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; Eventually, the fortifications were left largely intact, and the only part that was demolished was St. Madeleine's Lunette, which was located near the entrance to the city (on the site now occupied by the [[Triton Fountain (Malta)|Triton Fountain]]).&lt;ref name=advanced/&gt;

The fortifications were eventually decommissioned between the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Some parts, such as Fort St. Elmo, Fort Lascaris and the [[Saluting Battery (Valletta)|Saluting Battery]], remained in use until after [[World War II]], with Fort St. Elmo being decommissioned in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gusman|first1=George R.|title=Fort St Elmo|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120405/letters/Fort-St-Elmo.414180|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939.|url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627|website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6guMwmZDW|archivedate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the 19th century [[City Gate (Valletta)#Third City Gate|Porta Reale]] was demolished to make way for a [[City Gate (Valletta)#Fourth City Gate|modern City Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Attard|first1=Chris|title=The gate triumphant|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080824/opinion/the-gate-triumphant.222115|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first plans to restore the fortifications of Valletta, along with those of [[Fortifications of Birgu|Birgu]], [[Fortifications of Mdina|Mdina]] and the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]], were made in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zammit|first1=Ninu|title=Restoration of forts and fortifications|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20061212/opinion/restoration-of-forts-and-fortifications.32474|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A fortune on fortifications|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080620/local/a-fortune-on-fortifications.213404|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration started in 2010, with the project being described as &quot;the biggest in a century&quot;.
