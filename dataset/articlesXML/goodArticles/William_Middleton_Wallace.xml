'''William &quot;Willie&quot; Middleton Wallace''' (23 September 1892 – 22 August 1915) was a [[rugby union]] player. He played [[fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] for [[Cambridge University RFC]] and was [[cap (sport)|capped]] for {{nrut|Scotland}} in 1913–14.

Having grown up in [[Edinburgh]], Willie Wallace went to [[King's College, Cambridge]] in 1912, where he was immediately noticed for his rugby-playing ability. He was selected to play against [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford]] in the [[Varsity Match]] in his first term. Later in the season, in March 1913, Scotland picked him to play away against {{nrut|England}}, in a close game, which England won by just three points. The following season he played in all three [[Six Nations Championship|Home Nations]] matches against {{nrut|Wales}}, {{nrut|Ireland}} and England.

He was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] [[second lieutenant]] in [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]] at the start of the First World War and departed for the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] a few weeks later. In February 1915, he was attached to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] and soon became [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 Squadron]]'s senior [[air observer|observer]]. In August 1915, while on a [[photographic reconnaissance]] mission, his aircraft was shot down in northern France, near [[Lille]]. At the time of his death, it was suggested that he might have been the first undergraduate to see action in the war.

==Early life==
Wallace was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of Robert and Mary Wallace, on 23 September 1892.&lt;ref name=WMWCWGC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/584343/WALLACE,%20WILLIAM%20MIDDLETON|title=CWGC – William Middleton Wallace|author=Reading Room Manchester|work=cwgc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to school at [[Edinburgh Academy]] from 1899 to 1912 then studied at [[King's College, Cambridge]] until  15 July 1914. At school, he was in the rugby team for his final three years and vice-captain in the final year. He also played [[cricket]], captaining the school team in 1911, as [[wicket-keeper]].{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=219}}

==Rugby career==
According to the rugby journalist and author [[E. H. D. Sewell]], Wallace was the best [[fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] in the United Kingdom between 1912 and 1914.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=220}} On arriving at Cambridge in 1912, his performance in the [[freshman|freshers]]' rugby match earned him his place on the Cambridge XV to play [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford]] in the [[Varsity Match]].{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=220}}

He was selected to play for {{nrut|Scotland}} against {{nrut|England}} in 1913; and {{nrut|Wales}}, {{nrut|Ireland}}, and England in 1914.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=220}}

Scotland's first [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] match of 1914 was on 7 February, played away to Wales at Cardiff. Scotland had not won in Cardiff since 1890 and Wales were favourites, having 'lost so unluckily'&lt;ref name=AWW/&gt; against England. The match pitted Welsh [[Rugby_union_positions#Forwards|forward]] strength against the swift [[Rugby_union_positions#Three-quarters|threequarter]] line of the Scots. The first points came from a [[try]] for Scotland by W. A. Stewart, converted by Hamilton, giving the visitors a five-point lead after four minutes. These were the only points they scored. Wales then attacked repeatedly and Wallace was kept busy in defence. With a 7–5 lead at half time, the Welsh pressed their advantage and ended the game 24–5 winners.&lt;ref name=AWW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10107/4091943|title=Amazing Win for Wales – South Wales Weekly Post|date=1914-02-14|accessdate=2015-07-24|publisher=William Llewellyn Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the country's final game before the outbreak of the First World War, on 21 March Scotland played host to an English team that had already defeated Wales and Ireland. The Scots, with the wind behind them, opened the scoring in the first half with a try but England equalised just before half time. After the break, England got up a lead of 6–16 and the visitors seemed certain to win. Scotland responded and closed the gap to one point. The English were then playing with fourteen men after [[Cherry Pillman]]'s leg was broken in a tackle, since substitutions at the time were not allowed. They managed to hold on, beating Scotland 15–16, thereby winning both the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] and the [[Calcutta Cup]], as well as the Five Nations.{{sfn|Collins|2009|pp=47–48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scotland beaten by a point|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000576/19140323/122/0009|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Aberdeen Journal|date=23 March 1914|page=9|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was England's last international test on British soil before the First World War: of the 30 players in the match, 11 went on to be killed in it, including the Englishman [[Arthur James Dingle]],{{sfn|Corsan|2009|pp=269–270}} who died the same day as Wallace.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=44}}

Wallace, who was a cadet of the [[Officers Training Corps]], was commissioned [[second lieutenant]] in the 5th Battalion, [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]] on 5 August 1914, while still an undergraduate.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=214}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28873|date=18 August 1914|startpage=6503|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28922|date=2 October 1914|startpage=7816|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29278|supp=yes|date=27 August 1915|startpage=8617|accessdate=21 July 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were suggestions at the time that he was the first undergraduate to go into action but they were not substantiated.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=220}} After two weeks' training at [[Isle of Sheppey|Sheppey]], he departed for France on 30 August. There, he participated in the [[First Battle of the Aisne]] and was active on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] at [[Frelinghien]] and [[Ploegsteert Wood]].{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=220}}

Wallace was attached to [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 Squadron]], 1st Wing [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) on 14 February 1915 as an [[air observer|observer]],{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=220}} alongside [[William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse]], the first serviceman of the RFC to be awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=214}} By July he was the squadron's senior observer and was made up to [[lieutenant]] on 21 July 1915.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=220}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29279|supp=yes|date=27 August 1915|startpage=8631|accessdate=21 July 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 1915, Wallace was on a photographic reconnaissance mission in a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2#B.E.2c|B.E.2c]] piloted by his friend 2Lt Charles Gallie. The plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire and came straight down at Sainghin, near [[Lille]], northern France.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=214}}

Both men were buried near to where they fell, but after the war their bodies were reinterred at the Cabaret-Rouge British Cemetery (Grave reference XII. D. 11), [[Souchez]], near [[Arras]], France.{{sfn|McCrery|2014|p=214}}&lt;ref name=WMWCWGC/&gt;
