The '''2nd Commando Regiment''' is a [[special forces]] unit of the [[Australian Army]], and is part of [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]]. The regiment was established on 19 June 2009 when the [[4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando)]] was renamed. It is based at [[Holsworthy Barracks|Holsworthy]], [[New South Wales]]. The 2nd Commando Regiment often trains and deploys with the [[Special Air Service Regiment]], is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad, and has been involved in operations in [[Operation Astute|East Timor]], [[Operation Catalyst|Iraq]] and [[Operation Slipper|Afghanistan]], where it was used in a direct action warfighting role. It has also been involved in a number of domestic security operations including the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] and the [[2014 G-20 Brisbane summit|2014 G20 Leaders Summit]].

==Role==
Part of [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]] (SOCOMD),{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=338}} the 2nd Commando Regiment is one of three combat-capable units within SOCOMD{{sfn|AAP|2009|}} and operates in conjunction with other SOCOMD units, services and interagency organisations in joint and combined operations.&lt;ref name=2Cdo_Role&gt;{{cite web|title=Roles of the 2nd Commando Regiment|url=http://2commando.gov.au/about/our-roles|website=2nd Commando Regiment|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the regiment is to conduct large scale offensive, support and recovery operations beyond the scope and capability of other Australian Defence Force (ADF) units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History – 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|url=http://www.4rarassociationsaustralia.com/history.html|website=4 RAR Associations of Australia|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army doctrine specifies that the role of commando units is to &quot;span the gap between conventional infantry operations and unconventional operations&quot;, focusing on  [[Advanced Force Operations|advance force operations]] and [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;gg.gov.au&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=2Cdo_Role/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commando (Land Warfare Doctrine 3-3-11 Employment of Special Operations, 2005)|url=http://armynews.realviewdigital.com/?iid=5264&amp;xml=defencenews_army.xml|accessdate=30 August 2016|work=Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper|edition=1174|date=6 September 2007|pages=25|publisher=Department of Defence|location=Canberra|issn=0729-5685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed to complement the [[Special Air Service Regiment]] (SASR), according to Blaxland the regiment is designed to be a &quot;self-contained flexible and rapidly deployable force&quot; and is structured for both special operations and domestic [[counter-terrorism]].{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=175}} In its domestic counter-terrorism role it provides the [[Tactical Assault Group|Tactical Assault Group (East)]] to respond to high-risk incidents on the eastern coast of Australia beyond the capability of state/territory and federal [[Police tactical group|Police Tactical Groups]] to respond to.{{sfn|Davies|Jennings|Scheer|2014|p=10}} The regiment maintains a high readiness element which encompasses the parachute company group role that the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (3 RAR) had maintained prior to being reroled as a light infantry battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1268/1268.pdf|title=Transfer of parachute capability announced|newspaper=Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper|edition=1268|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Department of Defence|location=Canberra|p=3|issn=0729-5685|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scanlan|2012|pp=37–54}}

==History==

===Formation===
In 1995, as part of an expansion of the number of [[Australian Army]] infantry battalions, the [[2nd/4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]]—then operating as a standard light infantry battalion—was delinked into separate battalions which resumed their original identities as the [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|2nd]] and [[4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|4th Battalions]].{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=295}} The decision was then taken that the 4th Battalion would become a Regular Army [[commando]] unit and on 1 February 1997 the unit was renamed to 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) (4 RAR Cdo). The unit would be structured for both conventional operations and domestic counter-terrorism, with an initial establishment of a battalion headquarters, Tactical Assault Group, two commando companies, logistic support company, logistic support company, operational support company and a signal squadron.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=329}} Regular serving members were given the opportunity to undertake special forces training provided by the Commando Training Wing of the Reserve [[1st Commando Regiment (Australia)|1st Commando Regiment]], or elect to be posted to a conventional forces unit.{{sfn|Collins|2005|pp=244–245}} No General Reserve positions existed in the new structure, and reserve members discharged or posted to reserve units.&lt;ref name=2Cdo_Unithistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2commando.gov.au/about/unit-history|title=Unit History|date=2013|website=2nd Commando Regiment|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was planned that 4 RAR (Cdo) would eventually take over the SASR counter terrorist role.&lt;ref name=2Cdo_Unithistory/&gt;{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=301}}

The initial years were busy with the unit creating a structure and recruiting members suitable for commando training, while conducting sub-unit and unit training activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=4RAR History 1995–2000|url=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20011101180205/http://www.defence.gov.au/army/4rar/history6.html|website=Australian Army|date=2 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; B Company was raised in 1997, followed by C Company in 1999, both of which took 24 months to reach full maturity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army01&quot; /&gt; A small team from 4 RAR (Cdo) deployed to [[East Timor]] as part of the [[International Force for East Timor]] (INTERFET) in September 1999 providing close personal protection for the media and also as interpreters in the initial months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Op WARDEN|url=http://2commando.gov.au/about/past-and-current-operations/28-op-warden|website=2nd Commando Regiment|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, elements were involved in the evacuation of Australian nationals from the Solomon Islands in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Op PLUMBOMB|url=http://2commando.gov.au/about/past-and-current-operations/45-op-plumbomb|website=2nd Commando Regiment|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While later that year, 4 RAR (Cdo) assisted with counter-terrorism at the [[Sydney Olympic Games]] as part of Joint Task Force 114, with C Company on standby as a response force such as providing a cordon around an incident site in support of the SASR.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|pp=1}}{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=330}} In 2000, it was decided that the counter terrorist role should remain with the SASR.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=301}} A period of rapid capability development, equipment acquisition and training subsequently followed. The unit that was developed as a result is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad, and has conducted operations in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also been awarded a number of citations for bravery and meritorious service.&lt;ref name=&quot;gg.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

On 19 June 2009, the battalion was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooke|first1=Michael|title=A special moment in unit history|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1216/1216.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2016|work=Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper|edition=1216|date=9 July 2009|publisher=Department of Defence|location=Canberra|issn=0729-5685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the name 4 RAR remains on the Army's [[order of battle]] and its history, colours and traditions have been preserved, ready to be re-raised as a regular infantry battalion in the future if required. All awards and battle honours received during the time as 4 RAR (Cdo) were passed onto the 2nd Commando Regiment, while those awarded before the transformation to a commando battalion were retained by 4 RAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New Name for Sydney Commandos|publisher=Department of Defence|date=19 June 2009|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=9192|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Timor===
The 2nd Commando Regiment, then known as 4 RAR (Cdo), was deployed as a part of the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET) in 2001. When notified to replace 1 RAR in [[East Timor]], 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion, developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR. With the commitment to East Timor continuing, however, 4 RAR was re-roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to East Timor as AUSBATT IV. This involved reorganising from the existing two commando-companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|pp=1}} This saw B and C Company remain commando-qualified. A Company was formed in June 2000 followed by D Company in November both filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in to the unit.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|pp=1}} The battalion took official control over [[Area of operations|Area of Operations]] (AO) Matilda in the northern border region on 25 April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Sengelman.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|pp=11}}{{sfn|Horner|2008|pp=315–317}}

During its time deployed as a part of UNTAET, the battalion established a security partnership with the East Timorese, focusing strongly on languages and maintaining the relationships previous Australian battalions had established, as well as transferring new technologies to the local security forces. This &quot;intelligence-led&quot; but &quot;people-focused&quot; approach saw the battalion group conduct the majority of its operations in close proximity to the Tactical Coordination Line (TCL) on the border with Indonesian [[West Timor]]. The battalion saw few contacts while in East Timor. These included a TCL violation on 5 May 2001 which was intercepted by a section from D Company, an outbreak of violence involving a grenade attack by militia members at the Maubasa markets on 29 May which resulted in several people killed and about 50 wounded, and shallow cross-border militia raids in June, including an attack on a section patrol from A Company. The battalion was withdrawn and replaced in October 2001.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|pp=11–24}}{{sfn|Horner|2008|pp=316–318}}

===Expansion and domestic security===

Following the battalion's return from East Timor it was again restructured to resume its role as a two-company commando battalion.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=329}} However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second TAG to be based on the east coast of Australia. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002.&lt;ref name=2Cdo_Unithistory/&gt; Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali bombings]] in October that year, further resources became available.{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=328}} The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002.&lt;ref name=2Cdo_Unithistory/&gt; Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the [[Pong Su|MV ''Pong Su'']]—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 April 2003.{{sfn|Mickelburough|2003|p=1}}{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=287}}{{refn|Commanded by CO 4 RAR (Cdo), the operation involved members of TAG (West), TAG (East) and the Incident Response Regiment.{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=287}}|group=Note}} In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D Company being formed.&lt;ref name=2Cdo_Unithistory/&gt; Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in Melbourne.{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=311}} In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the [[2014 G-20 Brisbane summit|G20 Leaders Summit]] held in the city on 15 and 16 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADF support G20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ADF support G20 Leaders Summit|url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-work/News-and-media/ADF-support-G20-Leaders-Summit|publisher=Australian Army|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
The battalion provided a commando force element as part of the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, known as [[Operation Falconer]]. A reinforced commando platoon formed an element of the Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG), which also included 1 Squadron, SASR, a troop from the [[Incident Response Regiment]], and three [[CH-47 Chinook]] helicopters from the [[5th Aviation Regiment (Australia)|5th Aviation Regiment]]. The commandos formed the &quot;[[Quick reaction force|quick reaction]]&quot; element for the task group. The SFTG operated in western Iraq where it was successful in securing its area of operations, including the huge [[Al Asad Air Base]].{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=250–325}}{{sfn|Department of Defence|2004|pp=21–26}} After the invasion was complete, the 40-man commando element provided security to humanitarian assistance missions and other security operations, later providing close protection for Australian officials in [[Baghdad]] as part of [[Operation Catalyst]].{{sfn|Horner|2008|pp=329–330}} In 2004, claims appeared in the media that Australian special forces were involved in counter-insurgency operations inside Iraq, although this was denied by the government.{{sfn|Toohey|2004|}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Financial Review Wrong on Special Forces Allegations|publisher=Department of Defence|date=28 August 2004|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=4198|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20140804003917/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=4198|accessdate=22 November 2014|archivedate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last commando element was withdrawn in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4rarassociationsaustralia.com/world-template.html|title=RAR global operations|year=2007|publisher=4RAR Association|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timor Leste===
Later, in May 2006 a commando company group was deployed to [[Timor Leste]] as part of [[Operation Astute]], after relations between the East Timorese government and military forces broke down.{{sfn|Farrell|2006|p=34}} The commandos operated alongside the SASR as part of the Special Forces Component{{sfn|Blaxland|2014|p=201}} and were tasked with advanced force operations in preparation for the arrival of follow-on forces, focusing on [[Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport|Dili Airport]]. In March 2007, the commandos, along with elements of the SASR, took part in the [[Battle of Same]] during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, [[Alfredo Reinado]]. After the battle, the commandos and SASR elements were withdrawn at the request of the East Timorese government in order to start negotiations with the rebels.{{sfn|Australian &amp; NZ Defender Magazine|2007|pp=22–26}}

===Afghanistan===

[[File:580164 2nd Commando Regiment Afghanistan 2012 walking to US Army Chinook.jpg|thumb|right|Commandos walking with Afghan National Army to a waiting U.S. Army Chinook helicopter in 2012]]

Meanwhile, in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was deployed to [[Afghanistan]] as part of [[Operation Slipper]], operating in the southern province of [[Uruzgan Province|Uruzgan]]. The SFTG, based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer, was made up of elements from the SASR, a commando company and a troop from the Incident Response Regiment.
