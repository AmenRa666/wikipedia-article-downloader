{{Campaignbox Vietnam War}}

The '''Action of 1 March 1968''' refers to a co-ordinated attempt by four North Vietnamese trawlers to resupply the [[Viet Cong]] and the efforts of [[Operation Market Time]] elements to stop them during the Vietnam War. On 28 February 1968, [[United States Navy]] [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|SP-2H Neptune]] aircraft on routine patrol detected a North Vietnamese [[SL class trawler|SL class]] [[naval trawler]] heading towards the South Vietnamese coast from north of the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]. By the next morning, three more trawlers were discovered and units of [[Operation Market Time]] were deployed for a surprise interception. The suspect trawlers did not fly flags so it was not until the start of the engagement that their origin was discovered. The trawlers were steel hulled vessels, 100 feet long and armed with 57-millimeter [[recoilless rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s. All four vessels were loaded with weapons and ammunition intended to be delivered to the [[Viet Cong]]. American and South Vietnamese forces that engaged in action included the [[United States Coast Guard]] [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]]s {{Ship|USCGC|Androscoggin|WHEC-68|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Grey|WPB-82324|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Welcome|WPB-82329|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Winona|WHEC-65|2}}, {{USCGC|Point Grace|WPB-82323|2}}, {{USCGC|Point Hudson|WPB-82322|2}}, {{USCGC|Point Marone|WPB-82331|2}}, the [[Patrol Craft Fast|swift boats]] {{USS|PCF-18||6}}, {{USS|PCF-20||6}}, {{USS|PCF-42||6}}, {{USS|PCF-43||6}}, {{USS|PCF-46||6}}, {{USS|PCF-47||6}} and {{USS|PCF-48||6}}, two [[South Vietnamese Navy]] [[junk (ship)|junks]] and one [[patrol boat]]. Two [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[helicopter gunship]]s also participated in combat as well as aircraft used to fire [[flare (pyrotechnic)|flare]]s.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary. March 1968|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/docs/comnavforv/1968/March1968.pdf|publisher=Naval Historical Center, U.S. Navy|accessdate=23 June 2011|author=Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam|pages=Appendix I|format=pdf|date=March 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The United States Navy, South Vietnamese navy, and the U.S. Coast Guard, operating under the authority of the South Vietnamese government, established a blockade of South Vietnam designated Operation Market Time to prevent infiltrations of personnel, munitions and equipment by the North Vietnamese government. A twelve mile wide restricted zone existed along the entire South Vietnamese coast and ships assigned to Market Time had the authority to stop and search any vessel within the zone for contraband material and check the identity papers of any person on a detained vessel.&lt;ref name=Cutler81&gt;Cutler, p 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere6-7&gt;Larzelere, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti18&gt;Scotti, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==

===Action off Bo De River===
The trawler designated in U.S. Navy records as ''An Xuyen Province Trawler'' (map reference #1) was first sighted on 28 February approximately 150 miles east southeast of [[Vũng Tàu]] holding a southeasterly course.&lt;ref name=Kelley5-541&gt;Kelley, p 5-541&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of the 29th she changed to a westerly course and USCGC ''Winona'' started a covert surveillance. The trawler crossed the 12 mile limit at 0120 1 March and began a run for the beach near the mouth of the [[Bo De River]] at 0200.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt; A blocking force placed near the mouth of the river consisted of several Navy PCF's and the Coast Guard cutters ''Point Hudson'', ''Point Grace'', and ''Point Marone''.&lt;ref name=Tulich8&gt;Tulich, p 8&lt;/ref&gt; ''Winona'' fired warning shots eight miles off the coast which were ignored so she opened up with her [[5 inch/38 caliber gun]] after receiving return fire from the trawler.&lt;ref name=Johnson335&gt;Johnson, p 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere130&gt;Larzelere, p 130&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler exploded in a huge fireball after taking several direct hits and sank approximately seven miles off the beach.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutler131&gt;Cutler, p 131&lt;/ref&gt; ''Winona'' was struck by several pieces of debris from the explosion, however only minor injuries were sustained by the crew during the action.&lt;ref name=Scotti77&gt;Scotti, p 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action off Nha Trang===
The trawler designated ''Khánh Hòa Province Trawler'' (map reference #2) was first sighted by Market Time aircraft on 29 February approximately 90 miles east northeast of [[Nha Trang]] with a southwesterly course.&lt;ref name=Kelley5-359&gt;Kelley, p 5-359&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance was continued by Market Time vessels until she crossed the 12 mile limit 28 miles northeast of Nha Trang.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt; Ignoring warning to heave to for boarding, the trawler continued on towards the beach. A [[South Vietnamese Navy]] patrol boat opened fire on the trawler and it quickly changed course and returned fire. Assisted by a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[AC-47 gunship]], [[Patrol Craft Fast|swift boats]] ''PCF-42'', ''PCF-43'', ''PCF-46'', ''PCF-47'', ''PCF-48'' and two SVN junks sortied to help the patrol craft chase the trawler to a cove where it ran aground in the [[Hon Heo Secret Zone]]&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutler131&gt;Cutler, p 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelley5-247&gt;Kelley, p 5-247&lt;/ref&gt; At 0230, 1 March, five 81-millimeter [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds from ''PCF-47'' were direct hits and the trawler exploded with a massive explosion due to the munitions aboard.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt; Fourteen dead North Vietnamese sailors were recovered the following morning. Rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers; along with considerable ammunition and explosives were recovered from the sunken trawler. The salvage operations extended over 12 days and included the recovery of a 14.5 millimeter antiaircraft gun and 68 cases of ammunition.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt;

===Action off Tha Cau River===
[[File:USCGC Androscoggin 2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|USCGC ''Androscoggin, &quot;Weather decks secure&quot; by Don Van Liew.'']]
Forty miles from [[Chu Lai]] and six miles off the coast, (map reference #3) USCGC ''Androscoggin'' intercepted a third trawler designated in U.S. Navy records as the ''Quảng Ngãi Province Trawler''. ''Androscoggin'' signaled the trawler to identify itself at 0112 but there was no response so ''Androscoggin'' shot 5-inch [[Shell (projectile)#Illumination|star shells]] into the air to illuminate the trawler.&lt;ref name=Larzelere128&gt;Larzelere, p 128&lt;/ref&gt; It was then that the trawler was positively identified as an ''SL class'' North Vietnamese trawler so the ''Androscoggin'' opened fire at 0120 with 5-inch high explosive naval gunfire and .50 caliber machine guns.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler returned fire with a recoilless rifle, laid a smoke screen and turned into ''Androscoggin'''s direction but one of the cutter's shells hit the after starboard side, so the trawler turned reversed course and headed for the shore.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti75&gt;Scotti, p 75&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of a civilian junk passing through the battle area the Market Time ships had to cease fire.&lt;ref name=Cutler130&gt;Cutler, p 130&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[United States Army]] helicopters were directed engage the trawler with rockets and miniguns at 0129 and after their attack a reduction in the amount of fire coming from the trawler was noticed.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt;  At 0140 ''Point Grey'', ''Point Welcome'', ''PCF-18'' and ''PCF-20'' were ordered to take the trawler under fire with mortars and machine guns at close range because the trawler had moved too close to shore for ''Androscoggin'' to maneuver.&lt;ref name=Cutler130&gt;Cutler, p 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson336&gt;Johnson, p 336&lt;/ref&gt; ''Point Welcome'' struck the trawler twice with 81-millimeter rounds.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler then grounded 50 yards off the mouth of the [[Tha Cau River]] at 0210.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt; At 0220, the North Vietnamese tried to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] their ship and failed but a second attempt at 0235 succeeded in destroying the vessel in a 500 foot fireball.&lt;ref name=Scotti76&gt;Scotti, p 76&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion caused some damage to the pilothouse of ''Point Welcome'' and the deck was littered with debris but no casualties were reported.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other action on 1 March==
{{Ship|USCGC|Minnetonka|WHEC-67|6}} shadowed the trawler designated as the ''Bình Định Province Trawler'' (map reference #4) but soon after being detected, the trawler turned around and headed back out to sea without being engaged.&lt;ref name=Johnson335&gt;Johnson, p 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere130&gt;Larzelere, p 130&lt;/ref&gt; It was apparently headed for the [[Lo Dien]] area 42 miles north of [[Qui Nhơn]].&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelley5-430&gt;Kelley, p 5-430&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler never got any closer to the coast than 30 miles and after she reversed course was monitored by aircraft until she approached the coast of the [[Peoples Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt;

While on Market Time patrol duties on 1 March, {{USS|Persistent|MSO-491|6}} discovered an abandoned junk at anchor 52 miles southeast of Da Nang. After a search of the area failed to locate persons in the water, the junk was boarded and items were found of a Communist Chinese origin including a Communist Chinese flag. The junk was hoisted on board ''Persistent'' and delivered to Da Nang for further inspection.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0368 /&gt;

==Aftermath ==
The destruction of three of the four trawlers and the turning back of the fourth demonstrated that Operation Market Time was an effective net for the interception of supplies destined for resupply of the Viet Cong. Except for the 1 March trawlers and one other instance in the days after Tet 1968 no other trawlers were spotted between July 1967 and August 1969.&lt;ref name=Summers100&gt;Summers, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; The North Vietnamese were forced to use the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] through [[Laos]] or the neutral port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] in [[Cambodia]] to ship supplies to the Viet Cong. With the closing of the port at Sihanoukville to Communist shipping in August 1969, attempted North Vietnamese trawler traffic into South Vietnam resumed.{{#tag:ref|Cambodian Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] halted arms shipments through Cambodia in August 1969, effectively closing the port city of Sihanoukville to Communist shipping.&lt;ref name=Scotti54&gt;Scotti, p 54&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;ref name=Scotti54&gt;Scotti, p 54&lt;/ref&gt; Of 15 trawlers detected by Market Time assets from August 1969 to late 1970, one was sunk, 13 were turned back and only one got through.&lt;ref name=Summers100&gt;Summers, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, ten out of eleven trawlers were either sunk or were turned back.&lt;ref name=Summers100&gt;Summers, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;
