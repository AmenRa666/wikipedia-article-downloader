== I hadn't known of this vehicle. Thanks ==

It took a reading or two to understand how it was intended to be used, not because you weren't clear but that it was a distinctly different concept. Once I understood it, can its design be traced as influencing other military vehicles, not necessarily for the same purpose? I immediately thought of [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge]] and wondered if there is any connection. [[User:Hcberkowitz|Howard C. Berkowitz]] ([[User talk:Hcberkowitz|talk]]) 20:45, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

:Perhaps... I will add a section on that referes to modern day technology that may have originated from something like this. [[User:Dreamafter|&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;Dreamafter&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Dreamafter|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:51, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
::It is [[Heuschrecke 10#Modern Day Result of the Development|right here]]. [[User:Dreamafter|&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;Dreamafter&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Dreamafter|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:09, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't see this section; the link goes back to the same article.  See [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge]]. Apparently, the first AVLB was German and preceded the Heuschrecke, but it is probably fair to observe that the concept of a self-deploying (?) piece of equipment was German, and the idea has become common in AVLBs. [[User:Hcberkowitz|Howard C. Berkowitz]] ([[User talk:Hcberkowitz|talk]]) 02:37, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

::::Yes, it was removed becuase it had little relevance. ~  &lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;[[User:Dreamafter|&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;Dreamy&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Dreamafter|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 20:19, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

== More background ==

It would be good to know more about why they needed this vehicle and if it would replace other vehicles or equipment. Who made a request for the design (Amry commanders or just in general) etc[[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 11:54, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

==Copy edit==

I've completed a full copy edit, added a few tags, and removed unnecessary white-space. If you're going for FAC, I would recommend lengthening the background of the gun. If you need another copy edit, don't hesitate to ask for another at [[WP:GOCE]], or at my talk page. Good luck!

==Incredible==

That is, the dual-use removable turret. Are there any sources explaining the reasoning that led to such &quot;swiss knife of an SPG&quot; concept? Wasn't it obvious that the combination was just too smart to compete against ordinary towed or ordinary self-propelled guns?

'''1:'''

*Minor issues with lead, e.g. it does not summarize all topics (competion, armour and prototype) and “A prototype that was never put into action, multiple prototypes were designed and built, but none were put into the full production stage” borders on redundancy.
{{Done}}

*Inconsistent use of American and “Queen’s” English, e.g. “Armour” is “Queen’s” and “utilize” is American.  Language should be consistent.
{{Done}}

*Possible weasel words, e.g. “it was then decided”.
{{Done}}

*Grammar issues, e.g. the comma does not belong in “by placing it on Panzerkampfwagen IV, or Panzer IV, chassis and …” and the article needs commas to separate independent clauses.
*I’m not sure “Waffenträger” is an appropriate title for the article.  “Heuschrecke 10” is the actual designation; “Waffenträger” just describes functionality.  Perhaps a move is in order?  
{{Done}}

'''2:'''

*Article relies solely on one source – Achtung Panzer.  Additional sources are needed very badly.  Further, as this article essentially reiterates the Achtung Panzer page, there may be copyright/plagiarism implications.
*Per [[WP:NOTE]], “a topic is presumed to be notable if it has received ''significant coverage'' in reliable sources that are independent of the subject”.  As a technical matter, this article may be [[WP:CSD#A7|eligible for speedy deletion]] with only one source and no assertion of notability/importance.
{{Done}}

'''3:'''

*Article content is too minimal.  At a minimum, elaboration is needed on the impetus for its design, intended application if produced (e.g. Atlantic Wall, Eastern Front, etc.), design process (e.g. why was chassis changed) and reason(s) it was not put into active service.

*This was essentially a turret delivery vehicle that could carry ordinance once the turret had been deployed.  Why, then, is there so little discussion about armament and so much about armor (something that, in the article’s current state, appears to be of minimal importance)?
{{Done}}

*Do historians or contemporary figures (axis and/or allies) have opinions about the vehicle’s expected impact on the war effort, had it been utilized?

*How is it that one of these survived, given the German desperation for materials late in the war?  The PzKfW in the photo is at the United States Army Ordnance Museum.  How did the US get their hands on one?

'''General:'''

*I’ve placed the GA nomination on hold.  If additional, reliable sources and significant additional content can be added promptly (7 days), the article will pass.  Please let me know if there are questions or if my assistance is needed.

:The article is progressing; here are some follow-up comments:
:*Competition section needs rewording, e.g. article states the Heuschrecke “was built in competition with Krupp's Heuschrecke 10”.  It was not built in competition with itself.  Article states “Its overall performance was slightly better than that of Krupps' vehicle”. Heuschrecke is the Krupp vehicle; Alkett/Rhinemetall made the other one.  Article needs to more clearly define and distinguish the two versions.
{{done}}
:*“The turret could then be used…” is the first sentence of the “Design” paragraph.  The “then” implies this sentence should be preceded by something.
{{done}}
:*Change infobox header and image caption to reflect “Heuschrecke 10”, not Waffenträger.
{{done}}
:*I reformatted the references and provided an additional link.  Here are three more from which you should gather information:
::*[http://members.fortunecity.com/panzer4/Panzer4/EnglishVersion/4-Conversions/Data/Heuschrecke10.htm Data comparison between Krupp and Rhinemetall versions]
::*[http://members.fortunecity.com/panzer4/Panzer4/EnglishVersion/4-Conversions/Heuschrecke10.htm Overview page - has reason these were developed]
::*[http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/AberdeenUSArmyOrdinanceMuseum/GermanTanks/Heuschrecke/index.htm Minimal info, but at least it’s another source.  Maybe an external link for the photos]
{{done}}
:*Add additional content from these sources and the two German sources already added and I believe content will be sufficient to pass.{{done}}

:::Almost there – fix these things and we’ll wrap it up:
:::*Competition section is still wrong.  Krupp’s model was the Heuschrecke.  The Rheinmetall was not given a “name”, but was called by its literal description (10.5cm leFH 18/40/2 auf Geschützwagen III/IV) – which is just 105mm light field howitzer on ordinance vehicle III/IV (we aren’t the most creative people).  Also, the Rheinmetall version was the one with the superior performance (the Achtung Panzer site is not well written, so I can see the confusion).
:::*Design section reads like a bunch of sentences have been thrown together, not written as a cohesive paragraph.  Rephrase to make it a progressive and lucid thought (start by making the last sentence the first).
