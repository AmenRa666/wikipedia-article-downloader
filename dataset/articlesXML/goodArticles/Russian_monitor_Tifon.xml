'''''Tifon''''' ({{lang-ru|Тифон}}) was an {{sclass-|Uragan|monitor|0}} [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the mid-1860s. The design was based on the American {{sclass-|Passaic|monitor|2}}, but was modified to suit Russian engines, guns and construction techniques. Spending her entire career with the [[Baltic Fleet]], the ship was only active when the [[Gulf of Finland]] was not frozen, but very little is known about her service. She was struck from the [[Navy List]] in 1900, converted into a storage [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] for [[naval mine|mines]] in 1909 and renamed ''Blokshiv No. 3''. The ship was bandoned by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in Finland in 1918; although retroceded to the Soviets in 1922, she was later [[ship breaking|scrapped]] by the Finns.

==Description==
While the ''Uragan''s were extensively modified by the Russians, they did retain the single twin-[[gun turret]] and low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] of the original ''Passaic''-class design. ''Tifon'' was {{convert|201|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|46|ft|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.16|-|10.84|ft|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|1500|-|1600|LT|t}}, and her crew numbered 8 officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865. They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877.&lt;ref name=m3&gt;McLaughlin, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was fitted with a two-cylinder, horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting steam engine]]&lt;ref name=m3/&gt; built by the [[Charles Baird (engineer)|Baird Works]] of [[Saint Petersburg]]. It drove a single propeller&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin 2012, pp. 106–07&lt;/ref&gt; using steam that was provided by two rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Specific information on the output of the ship's engine has not survived, but it ranged between {{convert|340|-|500|ihp|0|lk=in}} for all the ships of this [[ship class|class]]. During ''Tifon''{{'}}s [[sea trial]]s on 19 June 1865, she reached a maximum speed of {{convert|6.7|kn|lk=in}}. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|190|LT|t}} of coal, which gave her a theoretical endurance of {{convert|1440|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at full speed.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tifon'' was designed to be armed with a pair of {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0}} [[smoothbore]] [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading guns]] purchased from [[Krupp]] of Germany and [[Rifling|rifled]] in Russia, but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with the Krupp smoothbore guns. These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by [[Licensed production|license-built]] {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} smoothbore muzzle-loading [[Rodman gun]]s in 1867–68. The Rodmans were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine-inch rifled guns.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 104–05&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the [[wrought-iron]] armor that was used in the ''Uragan''-class monitors was in {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} [[Vehicle armour|plates]], just as in the ''Passaic''-class ships. The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates, of which the three innermost plates extended {{convert|42|in|m|1}} below the [[waterline]]. The [[gun turret]] was protected by eleven layers of armor and the [[pilothouse]] above it had eight layers of armor. Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] up to a height of {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} above the deck. Unlike their predecessors, the ''Uragan''s were built without deck armor to save weight, but ''Tifon'' was modified for the addition of {{convert|0.5|in|1|adj=on}} armor plates after completion, although it is unknown if they were ever fitted. They were, however, manufactured and then placed in storage.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 105–06&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
Construction of the ship began on 13 June 1863 at the [[Admiralty Shipyard|New Admiralty Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. ''Tifon'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 1 December 1863 and she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 May 1864. She entered service in 1865 and cost a total of 1,105,800 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she, and all of her [[sister ship]]s except {{ship|Russian monitor|Latnik||2}}, made a port visit to [[Stockholm]], Sweden in July–August 1865 while under the command of [[General Admiral]] [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 100, 104, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after ''Tifon'' was completed, an armored ring, {{convert|5|in|0}} thick and {{convert|15|in|0}} tall, was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it. Later, an armored, outward-curving [[wikt:bulwark|bulwark]] was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there. Three [[sponson]]s were later added, probably during the 1870s, to the upper portion of the turret. Each sponson, one above the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] and one on each side of the turret, mounted a light gun, probably a {{convert|1.75|in|adj=on}} [[Engstrem gun]], for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a [[Deck (ship)#Hurricane deck|hurricane deck]] was built between the funnel and the turret, also probably during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the ship's career other than that she was [[Ship decommissioning|laid up]] each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. ''Tifon'' was reclassified as a [[coastal defense ship|coast-defense]] [[ironclad]] on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of [[Kronstadt]] for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. ''Tifon'' was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1909 and renamed ''Blokshiv No. 3'' on 27 October of that year. She was abandoned by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in [[Helsingfors]] (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922. The ship was subsequently broken up in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;
