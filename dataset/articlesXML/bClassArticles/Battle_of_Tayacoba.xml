The '''Battle of Tayacoba''', June 30, 1898, was a disastrous American effort to land supplies and reinforcements to [[Cuba]]n rebels fighting for their [[independence]] in the [[Spanish–American War]].

==Background==
On June 25 the American steamships ''Fanita'' and ''Florida'' accompanied by the gunboat {{USS|Peoria|1898|6}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_History_of_the_Tenth_Cavalry_1866_19.html?id=fKg0AQAAMAAJ Edward L.

On board were 650 Cubans under General [[Emilio Núñez]], fifty troopers of the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)#Spanish–American War|Tenth U.S. Cavalry]] under [http://littletroops.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/quite-a-character-%E2%80%93-carter-p-johnson/ First Lieutenant Carter P.

The first attempt to land took place on June 29 near the port of [[Cienfuegos]], at the mouth of the San Juan River, however as a result of a [[Battle of Cienfuegos|prior assault on May 11]], the position was too heavily defended to effect a landing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;Thomas, Lately. ''The Astor Orphans: A Pride of Lions'', W. Morrow, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The American force then sailed about 40 miles east along the south coast of Cuba, to a point near the town of [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]]. On June 30 a landing party went ashore on a beachhead just west of Tunas de Zaza, near the mouth of the [http://www.geody.com/geospot.php?world=terra&amp;ufi=-1646813&amp;alc=rAt Tallabacoa River] (mispronounced 'Tayacoba' by the Americans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/book/History_Spanish_American_War.pdf Richard H. Titherington, ''A History of the Spanish-American War of 1898'', New York: D. Appleton and Company 1900, p. 149.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
Four miles west of the town, at the mouth of the river, stood a large fort built of railroad iron, surrounded by earthworks and defended by about 100 Spanish regulars. The ''Peoria'' fired several shots with her [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|three-pounders]] into the fort but there was no response. Before dropping off [[mule]]s, men, and [[materiel]], a party of 30 Cubans and Americans led by Captain Jose Manuel Núñez (brother of General Núñez) and including Winthrop Chanler and [[William Louis Abbott|Dr. William Louis Abbott]], went ashore to ensure the safety of the landing site, about 500 yards east of the fort.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W5xVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SpsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6959%2C411734 &quot;In a Hot Engagement: Captain Nunez was Killed, Winthrop Chanler and Five Others Wounded.&quot; ''The Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, WA July 14, 1898, p. 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dennis Bell.jpg|right|thumb|Private [[Dennis Bell (Medal of Honor)|Dennis Bell]] was awarded the Medal of Honor after participating in the rescue of Cuban soldiers on the beach at Tayacoba.]]

The party took cover in a [[mangrove swamp]] and one of them, a German surgeon named Dr. Maximilian Lund&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-RFYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA562&amp;dq=%22Maximilian+Lund%22+1900&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5xQ3UsLRA5i84AO4xYHQDw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Maximilian%20Lund%22%201900&amp;f=false &quot;Acting Assistant Surgeons in the Army,&quot; in George Frederick Shrady, Thomas Lathrop Stedman, eds.

Wood, 1900; pp. 561–62.&lt;/ref&gt; swam out to the ''Peoria'' (naked and armed only with a knife to fend off sharks) to report that survivors on the beach were in need of assistance.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;NUNEZ KILLED; Chanler's Brother Wounded – Filibusters Get Near the Fire Line.&quot; ''Minneapolis Journal'', July 15, 1898, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescue==
The ''Peoria'' continued firing at the Spanish troops, who were hidden behind a grove of coconut palms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice&quot; /&gt; On the ''Florida'' Lieutenant Johnson began organizing rescue attempts. The first four were dispersed by heavy enemy fire and forced to retreat, but the fifth, operating under cover of darkness and crewed by four men of the [[Buffalo Soldier|U.S. 10th Cavalry]] under the command of Lieutenant Ahern, successfully located the Cuban survivors. The body of Captain Núñez was left on the beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice&quot; /&gt;

Just before sunrise, a second boat manned by Lieutenant Ahern and [[war correspondent]] (later Lieutenant) Grover Flint&lt;ref&gt;Grover Flint, [https://books.google.com/books?id=onAUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Marching with Gomez: A War-Correspondent's Field Note-Book Kept during Four Months with the Cuban Army''], New York: Houghton-Mifflin, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; located Chanler and Abbott.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; Once they were safely aboard, the ''Florida'' promptly left the bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50916FD345911738DDDAC0994DF405B8885F0D3 &quot;FIGHTING FILIBUSTERS; Expedition to Cuba Has Several Brushes with Spaniards.

==Aftermath==
[[File:USS Helena LOC det.4a13896.jpg|right|thumb|The USS ''Helena'']]On the afternoon of July 2 the ''Peoria'' returned to the mouth of the Tallacaboa River accompanied by the USS ''[[USS Helena (PG-9)|Helena]]'' and shelled the fort for 30 minutes, damaging the fort and the earthworks. The force then proceeded east to Palo Alto where the troops and supplies disembarked on July 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice&quot; /&gt;

On June 23, 1899 four of the five rescuers, Sergeant [[William H. Thompkins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{find a grave|7414250|William H. Thompkins|work=Medal of Honor Recipient}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporal [[George H.
