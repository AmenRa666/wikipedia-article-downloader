[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir Charles Edmund Nugent'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|GCH}} (c.1759 – 7 January 1844) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer. He saw action as a junior officer in the 50-gun {{HMS|Bristol|1775|2}} at the [[Battle of Sullivan's Island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was held as a prisoner-of war for a day by Spaniards shortly before the [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa]] later on in the War.

Nugent served in the [[naval brigade]] in the invasions of [[Battle of Martinique (1794)|Martinique]], [[Saint Lucia]], and [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1794)|Guadaloupe]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, when [[William Cornwallis]] assumed command of the blockade of Brest, Nugent was selected to serve as his [[Captain of the Fleet]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He never commanded any fleet or naval station but did rise to the highest rank in the Navy.

==Early career==
He was the son of Lieutenant Colonel [[the Honourable]] Edmund Nugent, the only son of [[Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent]], but after his father's death in 1771 his marriage was found to have been illegal, and he and his elder brother [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George]] were declared illegitimate, and thus unable to inherit any of his grandfather's titles.&lt;ref name=heath198&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heathcote|first1=Tony|title=The British Admirals of the Fleet 1734-1995: a biographical dictionary|date=2002|publisher=Cooper|location=Barnsley|isbn=0-85052-835-6|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nugent entered the Navy as a youngster in 1771,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nugent, Charles Edmund |last=Laughton |first=John Knox |authorlink=John Knox Laughton |volume=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving aboard the sloop ''Scorpion'', commanded by [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]] (later Viscount Keith) until 1774.&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=John |authorlink=John Marshall (biographer) |title=Royal Naval Biography : or Memoirs of the services of all the flag-officers, superannuated rear-admirals, retired-captains, post-captains and commanders, whose names appeared on the Admiralty list of sea officers at the commencement of the year 1760, or who have since been promoted; illustrated by a series of historical and explanatory notes. With copious addenda. |volume=Vol. I, Part I |pages=94–99 |year=1823 |publisher=[[Longman|Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green]] |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/royalnavalbiopt101marsuoft |accessdate=2 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then served aboard {{HMS|Trident|1768|2}}, flagship of [[Sir Peter Denis, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Denis]], in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Battle of fort moultrie.JPG|thumb|left|Nugent fought as a junior officer at the [[Battle of Sullivan's Island]]]]
Towards the end of 1777 he was appointed to the 50-gun {{HMS|Bristol|1775|2}}, flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Parker]]. On 26 December 1777 Parker sailed from [[Portsmouth]] with a squadron of ships, carrying troops under the command of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]], to launch an attack on [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] in May, and was joined by General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] and his troops. The combined force advanced upriver until reaching the strongly fortified Sullivan's Island. In the [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|subsequent battle]] on 28 June the British were unable to subdue the defenders or mount an attack by land. ''Bristol'' bore the brunt of the American fire and had 111 men killed and wounded. The British eventually withdrew, and sailed north to attack New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;/&gt; Nugent was serving as an acting-lieutenant during the attack on Sullivan's Island, and in September 1777 he followed Parker into the {{HMS|Chatham|1758|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; In December Parker and Clinton were sent north to capture Rhode Island, which was taken without resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;/&gt; At the beginning of 1778 Parker sailed to Jamaica to serve as commander-in-chief, and on 26 May promoted Nugent to the rank of [[commander]], his promotion to lieutenant as yet still unconfirmed by the Admiralty, and thus his name first appears in the Navy List as a commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;

On 2 May 1779 Nugent was promoted to [[post-captain]] in command of the 28-gun frigate {{HMS|Pomona|1778|2}} at Jamaica. Before the [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa]] in October 1779 Nugent was sent in the schooner {{HMS|Racehorse|1781|2}} to employ local pilots from the [[Gulf of Honduras]], but when attempting to land at St. George's Key was captured by armed Spanish boats. He was held as a prisoner until the next day, when ''Pomona'' arrived, the Spaniards fled, and Nugent and his boat crew released themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; Nugent remained on the [[Jamaica Station (Royal Navy)|Jamaica station]] until mid-1782, when he returned to England with Sir Peter Parker. The following year he was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;/&gt;

[[File:HMS Caesar (1793) engaging Mont Blanc.jpg|thumb|left|The 80-gun ship {{HMS|Caesar|1793|2}}, a ship which Nugent commanded]]
When the war with France began in 1793 Nugent was appointed to the 64-gun ship {{HMS|Veteran|1787|2}}, and sailed for the Caribbean at the end of the year. He served in the [[naval brigade]] in the invasions of [[Battle of Martinique (1794)|Martinique]], [[Saint Lucia]], and [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1794)|Guadaloupe]], receiving the thanks of the military Commander-in-Chief, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|Sir Charles Grey]], before returning to England with despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;/&gt; Nugent then commanded the 80-gun ship {{HMS|Caesar|1793|2}} in the Channel from early 1795 until early 1797.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;

==Senior command==
Nugent was promoted to [[rear-admiral]] on 20 February 1797&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13981|supp=|startpage=171|date=18 February 1797|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and to [[vice-admiral]] on 1 January 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15324|supp=|startpage=9|date=30 December 1800|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1805, when [[William Cornwallis]] assumed command of the blockade of Brest, Nugent was selected to serve as his [[Captain of the Fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; Nugent was present at the funeral of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] in January 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15881|supp=|startpage=59|date=14 January 1806|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw no further service at sea, but was promoted to full [[admiral]] on 28 April 1808,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16140|supp=|startpage=581|date=26 April 1808|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] on 24 April 1833,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=19042|supp=|startpage=793|date=26 April 1833|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the most senior officer of the Royal Navy, at the same time that his brother, Field Marshal [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|Sir George Nugent]], held the same position in the British Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;GentMag&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obituary : Admiral Sir C. E. Nugent |journal=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]] |volume=XXII |pages=89–90 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31158013256143;view=1up;seq=103 |year=1844 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 1834 Nugent was made a [[Royal Guelphic Order|Knight Grand Cross of the Hanoverian Order]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; He died on 7 January 1844, aged 85,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; at his son-in-law's home in [[Studland]], [[Dorset]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GentMag&quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Nugent was married, and his only daughter&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt; Georgina Charlotte married [[George Bankes]], MP for [[Corfe Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Corfe Castle]] on 8 June 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/bankes-george-1787-1856 |title=Bankes, George (1787-1856) |first=R.
