'''John Lansdale Jr.''' (9 January 1912&amp;nbsp;– 22 August 2003) was a [[United States Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] who was in charge of intelligence and security for the [[Manhattan Project]].

A graduate of the [[Virginia Military Institute]] and [[Harvard Law School]], Lansdale was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Reserve]] in 1933. He was called up for active duty in June 1941, and was assigned to the Investigations Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 ([[military intelligence]]) of the [[War Department General Staff]]. He became involved with the Manhattan Project in 1942, eventually becoming [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie Groves]]'s special assistant for security. Lansdale coordinated the activities of the Manhattan Project's field security teams with those of other agencies such as the [[FBI]].

In April 1945, Groves sent Lansdale to Europe, where he worked with the [[Alsos Mission]] to secure 1,000 tons of [[uranium ore]] from the German ''[[WIFO (Nazi company)|Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft]]'' (WiFO) plant in [[Stassfurt]]. He also participated in the planning and execution of [[Operation Harborage]], in which a special Allied force went deep behind enemy lines, seized 1.5 tons of uranium ingots, and captured a number of [[German nuclear energy project]] scientists, including [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], [[Max von Laue]], [[Karl Wirtz]], [[Horst Korsching]] and [[Erich Bagge]] and [[Otto Hahn]].

==Early life==
John Mannen (Jack) Lansdale was born in [[Oakland, California]] on 11 June 1912, the son of John Lansdale Sr. and his wife May Hamilton née Mannen. After his sister Sally Mannen Lansdale was born in 1921 he dropped his middle name and was henceforth known as John Lansdale Jr. He was educated at [[San Jacinto High School (Houston, Texas)|San Jacinto High School]], from which he graduated in 1929. He entered the [[Virginia Military Institute]], graduating in 1933, and then [[Harvard Law School]], from which he graduated in June 1936. He took a job with a law firm, [[Squire Patton Boggs|Squire, Sanders and Dempsey]] (now Squire Patton Boggs), initially in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]&lt;ref name=&quot;family tree&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ancestors.pitard.net/getperson.php?personID=I11&amp;tree=Pitard |title=John &quot;Jack&quot; Lansdale Jr. |publisher=Pitard.net Genealogy |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ancestors.pitard.net/getperson.php?personID=I11&amp;tree=Pitard |title=John Lansdale, Sr. |publisher=Pitard.net Genealogy |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;law museum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-606/John-Lansdale-1912-2003.aspx |title=John Lansdale 1912–2003 |publisher=Law Museum |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Metta Virginia Tomlinson in [[Trinity Episcopal Church (Houston, Texas)|Trinity Episcopal Church]] in [[Houston, Texas]] on 17 June 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;family tree&quot;/&gt; They had five daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/31/obituaries/31LANS.html |title=John Lansdale Jr., 91, Is Dead; Found German A-Bomb Project|first=Anahad |last=O'Connor |date=31 August 2003|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

===Counterintelligence===
After graduating from the Virginia Military Institute, Lansdale joined the [[United States Army Reserve]].&lt;ref name=&quot;family tree&quot;/&gt; He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|field artillery branch]] in 1933, and was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] in 1937. He was called up for active duty in June 1941, a few months before the United States entered World War II, and was assigned to the Investigations Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 ([[military intelligence]]) of the [[War Department General Staff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MIS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://micastore.com/Vanguard/PastIssues/2010AugustTextVersion.pdf |journal=The Vanguard |publisher=Military Intelligence Corps Association |date=August 2010 |volume=15 |number=3 |pages=12–16 |title=2010 Military Intelligence Hall of Fame Inductee Ceremony |editor-first=John |editor-last=DellaGiustin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1942, Lansdale, now a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]], met with [[James B. Conant]]. the Chairman of the [[National Defense Research Committee]], who briefed him on efforts to create an [[atomic bomb]], and charged him with responsibility for [[United States Army Counterintelligence|counterintelligence]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MIS&quot;/&gt;

When Colonel James C. Marshal established the [[Manhattan District]] in June 1942, he created a Protective Security Section as part of its staff, responsible for the security of its people, installations and information. He also arranged with the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[George V. Strong]], for support from the [[Military Intelligence Service (United States)|Military Intelligence Service]]. Strong gave Lansdale special responsibility for the Manhattan District, and Lansdale, in turn, arranged with the G-2s of each of the [[Corps area|service command]]s for officers to be assigned to report directly to him, thus bypassing both the service command G-2s and their commanders. He also organised a special counterintelligence group in Washington, D.C., headed by himself, that reported directly to both Strong and [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie Groves]],{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=255}}{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=138–139}} who became director of the Manhattan Project in September 1942.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=17}}

Lansdale had security concerns about the head of the weapons laboratory, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], because of his communist connections, but Lansdale and Groves agreed that Oppenheimer was loyal and cooperative on security matters. Nonetheless, Lansdale had Oppenheimer's movements followed, his telephones tapped, and his mail opened.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=46–47}} Lansdale interrogated Oppenheimer over the latter's relationship with [[Haakon Chevalier]].{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=59–65}}

[[File:Alsos Mission - Perrin, Lansdale.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Michael Perrin]], Lansdale, [[Samuel Goudsmit]], and [[Eric Welsh (born 1897)|Eric Welsh]] search for uranium in a field at [[Haigerloch]], Germany, in April 1945.{{sfn|Pash|1969|p=217}}|alt=Four men in uniforms. One is leaning on a spade, and wearing an American helmet. Two others are wearing British helmets. A dark haired man has no helmet.]]
On 1 January 1944, the Army decentralized counterintelligence to the service commands. Lansdale attempted to have his group exempted from this, but when he failed, Groves had Lansdale's unit reassigned to the Manhattan Project, creating a new [[Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) unit within the Project. Groves had Lansdale transferred to the Manhattan District, but instead of placing him in charge of the new CIC unit, Groves made Lansdale his special assistant for security at Manhattan Project headquarters in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=257}} Lansdale coordinated the activities of the Manhattan Project's field security teams with those of other agencies such as the [[FBI]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=263}}

===Overseas operations===
In April 1945, Groves sent Lansdale, now a [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], to Europe, where he met with [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Walter B. Smith]] and Major General [[Harold Bull]] of [[SHAEF]] to develop a plan for [[Operation Harborage]], the capture of [[German nuclear energy project]] scientists, materials and facilities in the vicinity of [[Hechingen]], [[Bisingen]] and [[Haigerloch]].{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=233–236}}

While waiting for an opportunity to launch this operation, the Alsos Mission learned that [[uranium ore]] that had been taken from Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the ''[[WIFO (Nazi company)|Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft]]'' (WiFO) plant in [[Stassfurt]], which was captured by the [[83rd Infantry Division (United States)|83rd Infantry Division]] on 15 April. As it was in the [[occupation zone]] allocated to the [[Soviet Union]] at the [[Yalta Conference]], the Alsos Mission, led by [[Boris Pash]] and accompanied by Lansdale, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, [[sodium uranate]] and [[ferro-uranium]] weighing about 1,000 tons were taken away.{{sfn|Pash|1969|p=198}}{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=237}}

Lansdale accompanied the Alsos Mission on Operation Harborage, which began on 22 April 1945. A special Allied force called T Force went deep behind enemy lines, seized 1.5 tons of uranium ingots, and captured a number of scientists, including [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], [[Max von Laue]], [[Karl Wirtz]], [[Horst Korsching]] and [[Erich Bagge]] and [[Otto Hahn]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=298–299}}{{sfn|Pash|1969|pp=207–210, 217}}

The uranium ore was handed over to the Combined Development Trust, a legal entity set up to handle the acquisition of nuclear ores and materials. Lansdale had written a legal opinion for the Manhattan Project that it was within the powers of the President of the United States to conclude such agreements with the British without consulting [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=289–290}} In July 1945, Lansdale concluded an agreement with Brazil for the purchase of 3,000 tons of [[thorium]]-bearing [[monazite]] ore.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=306}} For his wartime services, Lansdale was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] and was made an honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MIS&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
After the war, Lansdale and his family moved back to Cleveland, and he returned to working for Squire, Sanders and Dempsey.&lt;ref name=&quot;law museum&quot;/&gt; He also served as a [[councilman]] for the city of [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]], from 1949 to 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;family tree&quot;/&gt; Lansdale testified at a 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing|Atomic Energy Commission hearing]] on behalf of  Oppenheimer, who was threatened with loss of his security clearance because of Communist associates. A seasoned trial lawyer, Lansdale was not intimidated by AEC lawyer [[Roger Robb]]'s prosecutorial tactics, and his combative replies contrasted sharply with Oppenheimer's own sheepish answers to Robb's questions.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=297–298}} Lansdale felt that Oppenheimer was a loyal American citizen and was outraged by his treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;

In 1972, Lansdale moved to Essex Farm in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]]. For a time he commuted to Cleveland, but eventually shifted to Squire, Sanders and Dempsey's Washington, D. C. office, remaining with the firm until he retired in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;family tree&quot;/&gt; He died at his home near [[Annapolis, Maryland]], on 22 August 2003 and was survived by his five daughters: Helen, Chloe, Mary, Metta Jr. and Sally. His wife Metta had died in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; Lansdale was buried at [[All Hallows Church (South River, Maryland)|All Hallows Cemetery]] in [[Davidsonville, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave | grid = 7800173 | name = John Lansdale Jr. | accessdate = 5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIS&quot;/&gt;
