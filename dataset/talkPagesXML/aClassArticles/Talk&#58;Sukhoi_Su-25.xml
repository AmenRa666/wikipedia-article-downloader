&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
I would like to correct an error in the article on SU-25. It says that its maximum service ceiling is &quot;7,000 m, or 5,000 m when fully armed&quot;. However, the Russian Chief of Staff Gen. Kartapalov today announced that a SU-25 can easily fly and operate at altitudes higher than 10,000 m. I believe the Russian Chief of Staff trumps Wikipedia when it comes to knowledge about Russian military planes. Thus my humble request to increase the ceiling to 10,000 m, or just in case - to 20,000, to avoid further requests.

However, it is a Russian Su-25 variant which the [[Ukrainian Air Force]] doesn't operate.

::::I try to assume good faith even when edits are clearly motivated by politics. Further research continues to show that those &quot;putinbots&quot; aren't entirely wrong. '''There are Su-25 variants that have 10,000 m service ceiling.'''

The type of engines used dictates the service ceiling. All Su-25 variants equipped with [[ru:Р-195]] engines have 10 km service ceiling, while those using older [[ru:Р-95Ш]] engines have 7 km service ceiling. References in [[ru:Су-25]], [[ru:Су-25Т]] and [[ru:Су-39]] may also be useful. Unfortunately, most information on soviet-era hardware tend to be in Russian. This article might need an expert's help.

:::::The manufacturer's website states that the Su-25K is fitted with P-195 engines, and that it has a service ceiling of 7,000 m. So you'd assume the information on the manufacturer's site is incorrect? That seems unlikely, they build the plane after all. And with 30 years of engineering experience under my belt, this much I know: in case of contradictions on specs, go with the manufacturer's data - it's more likely to be correct.

:::::Mind NPA:WP - No personal attacks, 91.157.56.43. Rather attempts to lessen ceiling of SU 25 are politically motivated, since modernization suggests improvements always.

I believe we're all in agreement over the specifications section. It is reliably referenced, accurate and there is no reason to change to a different variant from Su-25K. But variants capable of higher service ceiling should be given [[WP:WEIGHT|due but not undue weight]].

:: I would agree for indication of range 7000-10000 as Ceiling in specifications per reliable source - Ukrainian government arms trading company. The same way it is done in other war airplanes entries in Wikipedia. To leave the old entry means then we need to indicate for which specific old modification of Su-25 this entry is applicable.

:::The specific variant described is indicated in the section name ''[[Sukhoi Su-25#Specifications (Su-25/Su-25K, late production)|Specifications (Su-25/Su-25K, late production)]]'' in a manner that is consistent with [[WP:WikiProject Aircraft/page_content#Aircraft_specifications|WikiProject Aircraft § Aircraft specifications]] and other aircraft articles on English Wikipedia. Furthermore, the cited 7,000 m service ceiling attribute has a reference link, so that information should be very easily verifiable by readers.
:::What I see as a problem with the current article is that it makes absolutely no mention of the variants capable of 10,000 m service ceiling. Including that information in the relevant sections should hopefully calm any future editwarring over the service ceilings. - [[Special:Contributions/91.157.56.43|91.157.56.43]] ([[User talk:91.157.56.43|talk]]) 17:05, 23 July 2014 (UTC)

:::::I agree that editing should be left to experienced, neutral editors who are experts on the topic.

:::::It really doesn't matter what the ceiling of the highest-flying Su-25 variant is unless we know what variant the mythical Su-25  near the airliner was. If there was an Su-25 nearby, it's more likely it was the intended target of the missiles, especially given that 2 Su-25s were shot down by missiles today. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 21:38, 23 July 2014 (UTC)

::::::I personally doubt the entire Russian story. Especially the implied claim of a lightweight air-to-air missile destroying an airliner like that is ridiculous. But whatever happened is irrelevant. Recent events should not concern this article outside its operational history section. More capable variants exist and sources already cited in the article confirm this. Denying them their due weight would violate [[WP:NPOV]]. Perhaps in the future those variants will have their own articles like they do in ru.wikipedia.

::::::::The problem is that the efforts to include upgraded features began with the release of the Russian propaganda, which makes the timing highly suspicious. WP has no deadlines, so there's no hurry. Give it some time, and come back with reliable published third-party sources after this has settled down.

:::::::::I can understand the suspicion - naturally, the interest in this was caused by said propaganda and reports of its effect on wikipedia.

::::::::::::: Actually no, it's definitely in meters. The Su-25 barometric altimeter gauge says &quot;ВЫСОТА&quot; (height) in &quot;МЕТРЫ&quot; (meters). But barometric altimeters aren't all that reliable. The more accurate radar altimeter below is also graded in meters, but it is capped at 1500, no doubt to facilitate the kind of terrain-dodging the aircraft is designed for.

There's a Tass interview online (but it's in Russian) where Sukhoi's director of attack aircraft, Vladimir Babak, seems to say that the Su-25K could just reach 10,000m, but he does not think it could shoot down a Boeing 777 at that height. The 10,000m figure seems to be absolute ceiling: the height at which the jet just stops climbing on an average temperature-and-pressure day. How long it takes to get there and how fast it can go once it's there... well, it's just not designed to cruise fast and high as the Boeing is. So 10,000m is *not* service ceiling. The 7,000m service ceiling, also mentioned by Babak and confirmed on Sukhoi's own site, would relate to practical, useable performance (like good cruise speed, good dash speed and good handling), and the fact that the cockpit is not pressurised. Service ceiling and absolute ceiling are by no means always the same thing. -HB [[Special:Contributions/31.185.175.23|31.185.175.23]] ([[User talk:31.185.175.23|talk]]) 17:02, 30 July 2014 (UTC)

*&lt;b&gt;Ucroboronservice&lt;/b&gt; (a state enterprise which major activity is the realization of state interests of the Ukraine in the field of export / import of products, military-technical and special-purpose services) &lt;b&gt;reveils&lt;/b&gt; the same &quot;secrets&quot; on Su-25 &lt;b&gt;service ceiling: 7,000 — 10,000 meters.&lt;/b&gt; Look at its official site: http://en.uos.ua/produktsiya/aviakosmicheskaya-tehnika/84-cy-25 . Should it be lower than 10,000 meters, consumers might sue it for false information on this product :))

:In a RTR TV channel talk show of October 10, 2014 Mr. Alexander Rutskoy (former vice-president of Russia in 1991 — 1993 and Su-25 pilot and regiment commander in 1983 — 1986) also confirmed flying as high as 11,000 meters aboard his Su-25 (its maximum ceiling being 14,600 meters) before attacking the targets and on return flights in Afganistan. No surprise. Su-25 is propelled by the same pair of engines as MiG-21 with service ceiling of the later being 15,000 meters. But one does have to put on an oxygen mask higher than 7,000 meters, said the retired ace.

:Correct, except you got it all wrong. Prior to the downing of MH-17, the service ceiling of the SU-25 was listed as 7km. Only afterwards started the very suspicious appearance of 10km+ altitudes. [[User:Lklundin|Lklundin]] ([[User talk:Lklundin|talk]]) 08:47, 29 October 2014 (UTC)

=== Global Service Ceiling ===
A number of Wikipedias that I checked (English, Danish, Swedish, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Chinese) agree on a Service Ceiling of 7000m (clean or unspecified).

Some of these articles also specify a lower ceiling of 5000m with weapons.

But the Russian article lists a &quot;Практический потолок&quot; which more or less means &quot;service ceiling&quot; of no less that 14900m.

Additionally it lists a &quot;Максимальная высота боевого применения&quot; which more or less means &quot;combat ceiling&quot; of 9600m.

As far as I can understand, both the Arabic and the Georgian language articles list a(n unspecified) service ceiling of 10000m.

It is a problem that different language articles on exactly the same aircraft can list completely different specs.

My Russian is not good enough that I can start this discussion on the Russian Talk page (and in case anybody is wondering I don't actually know Arabic nor Georgian), but since there could very well be other language articles that specify other ceilings as well, the English Talk page might be as good as any place to start a discussion about how to rectify any discrepancy regarding the SU-25 service ceiling across different languages.

:Honestly, I'd ignore the Russian site completely, and inviting them here to discuss what's a dead issue at this point, trolling aside, isn't good.

::Good point. I am however thinking of a general, technical approach. In the case of very specific information (e.g. fields in info-boxes), it should be possible to let a bot flag (preferably visible directly in the article) specific information, which in a given language article is in conflict with the same information in a majory of other languages. This would be handy as a general detection of disruptive editing of specific information and serve as a warning to the reader in case the discrepancy cannot be resolved.

http://www.sukhoi.org/planes/military/su25k/lth/ here su25k 7km here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90iCLNZUVI height of 14600 and shows how there were so many and then after the disaster corrected to 7 km, http://uos.ua/produktsiya/aviakosmicheskaya-tehnika/84-cy-25 here urosayt official 7-10km !!

* You all know what the maximum height ** ** this is for example 20 km (MiG-25) but 37 km (record and the height but not the flight), 37&gt; 20. If 7 km without a mask, but 10km mask for breathing. Of course that the absolute maximum is much higher / more, and possible to carry a weapon (gun, it weighs one hundred kilograms (and hidden inside in a housing, it does not remove) - plane did not explode, it weighs 10,000 kg) and ammunition.

* This is true for every combat aircraft, your plane will not fall apart and do not bump into sky / cloud, and will not even resisting, if you go up higher than the maximum (standard). Same thing if you fly up to the wheels or release the landing gear. It is possible although it is not standard. You are still a long time will normally fly and your wheels do not break away / complaint.
If there are so many questions about the height, it is necessary to write the article. 7km su25 (version) 7-10 km su25 (version 2) + text, any plane can go higher than allowed, but with significant restrictions (no load (yes it is true actually) and / or for a long time and / or loss of speed and the ability to steer).
It is well known and does not even require a data source, each plane as any other mig25 can rise higher than specified for the standard.

In 2012 the 10 km ceiling for modified SU-25 M1 was the main selling point for Ukrainian manufacturer. See website for

== Hardpoints and fuel ==

''Combat range: 750 km (405 nmi, 466 mi) at sea level, 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) weapons and two external tanks''

I just saw a picture in the news because Russia is allowed to strike targets inside Iraq now and there is a pic without description and I looked in the list of active aircrafts which it could be, it is a Su-25 with 2 external tanks. Combat RANGE means 750km to the target (than attacking the target, means using all or most of the weapon weight) and than fly back with a much lighter machine (since fuel is consumed too and I guess the external tanks are used right from the start and dropped as soon as possible since they create a &quot;aerodynamic drag&quot; (I hope its the right word) and they have a small weight too and every kilometer range is important.

There are 11 &quot;hardpoints&quot; for a maximum of 4,000 kg load. Could there be 4 external, 2 on each side for a small increase in range? There would still be 7 hardpoints left...and how many fuel is usually in soviet designed external tanks.... 250 litres? 200? The weight is only 0.775 - 0.800 gram per liter of kerosene anyway, so 500 litres (in 2 tanks for example) got a weight of around 400 kg only...
