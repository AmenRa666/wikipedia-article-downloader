The '''United States International Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions''' ({{USBill|113|S|2183}}; {{USPL|113|96}}) is a law that authorizes the federal government to spend $10 million on programming for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] and the [[Voice of America]] to be broadcast into the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=2183text&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2183 - Text|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2183/text|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the increased funding would be to combat the Russian &quot;propaganda&quot; in the [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name=CoxSenatePasses&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Senate passes bill to fund Ukraine broadcasting|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/202006-senate-passes-bill-to-fund-ukraine-broadcasting|newspaper=The Hill|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[United States House of Representatives]] wrote in their bill to provide aid to the Ukraine, the [[Ukraine Support Act (H.R. 4278; 113th Congress)]], that &quot;the Russian Government has deliberately blocked the Ukrainian people's access to uncensored sources of information and has provided alternative news and information that is both inaccurate and inflammatory.&quot;&lt;ref name=4278text&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4278 - Text as Engrossed|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4278/text|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate's Ukraine aid bill failed to include any provisions to provide increased funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty or the Voice of America, so they wrote this separate bill to do so.&lt;ref name=DespiteVotesPete&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Despite votes, Ukraine bill not done yet|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/foreign-policy/201978-despite-votes-congress-has-more-work-to-do-on-ukraine|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The law was passed during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
===2014 Crimea crisis===
{{main|2014 Ukrainian revolution|2014 Crimean crisis|2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine}}

The [[2014 Crimean crisis]] is an ongoing [[international crisis]] principally involving [[Russia–Ukraine relations|Russia and Ukraine]]. Most developments apply to the [[Crimean Peninsula]], formerly a multi-ethnic region of [[Ukraine]] composed of the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and the administratively separate municipality of [[Sevastopol]]; both are populated by an [[Russians|ethnic Russian]] majority and a minority of both ethnic [[Ukrainians]] and [[Crimean Tatars]].

The crisis unfolded in late February 2014 in the aftermath of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Ukrainian Revolution]] which resulted in [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovich]]'s impeachment by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] after his flight from the capital, and the [[transitional government|interim appointment]] of a new government. The [[First Yatsenyuk Government|Yatsenyuk Government]] attained recognition from western countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;themoscowtimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/new-ukraine-government-has-white-houses-support-us-vice-president-says/495403.html New Ukraine Government Has White House's Support, U.S. Vice President Says], [[The Moscow Times]] (28 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/joe-biden-ukraine-prime-minister-arseniy-yatsenyuk-104069.html Joe Biden calls new Ukraine leader, pledges support], [[Politico]] (27 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/biden-us-supports-ukraines-new-government/1861085.html Biden: U.S. Supports Ukraine's New Government], [[Voice of America]] (27 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/28/us-ukraine-crisis-whitehouse-idUSBREA1R04W20140228 Vice President Biden calls Ukraine PM Yatseniuk, pledges U.S. support], [[Reuters]] (27 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Russian government held that Yanukovych was illegally impeached and continues to regard him as Ukraine’s last democratically elected and legitimate president,&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47362&amp;Cr=Ukraine&amp;Cr1=#.UyU87PmSySo United Nations News Centre - UN Security Council action on Crimea referendum blocked]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Lally; Englund (2014) &quot;The current government is illegitimate, Russia contends, because Yanukovych was not properly removed from power in a formal impeachment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-reserves-the-right-to-use-force-in-ukraine/2014/03/04/92d4ca70-a389-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html |title=Putin defends Ukraine stance, cites lawlessness |first1=Kathy |last1=Lally |first2=Will |last2=Englund |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date={{date|2014-03-04}} |accessdate={{date|2014-03-13}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} while considering the Yatsenyuk government illegitimate and the result of a &quot;[[coup d'etat]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;{{efn|name=cnn-2014-moscow-denounced|Gumuchian; Morgan; Chance (2014) &quot;Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of Crimea, which has longstanding ties to Russia and has thousands of Russian troops stationed there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/09/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/ |title=Demonstrators rally as Crimea crisis mounts |date={{date|2014-03-10}} |accessdate={{date|2014-03-10}} |publisher=[[CNN]] |first1=Marie-Louise |last1=Gumuchian |first2=Kellie |last2=Morgan |first3=Matthew |last3=Chance }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|Dawber (2014) &quot;Vladimir Putin has given a confident performance in front of the media, insisting that the events of the last 10 days in Ukraine amounted to nothing less than a coup d’état.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawber&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-crimea-9169236.html |title=Ukraine crisis: How do you solve a problem like Crimea? |first=Alistair |last=Dawber |date={{date|2014-03-05}} |accessdate={{date|2014-03-10}} |newspaper=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|''The Washington Post'' (2014) &quot;[Putin says:] Are the current authorities legitimate?

Beginning on February 26, pro-Russian forces began to gradually take control of the Crimean peninsula. At first the gunmen, wearing masks and unmarked uniforms, seized government buildings&lt;ref&gt;[[2014 Crimean crisis#cite note-NYT-60]]&lt;/ref&gt;  but by no later than the 24th of March had occupied all Ukrainian military bases in Crimea, forcing the Ukraine armed forces to withdraw from the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26713727&lt;/ref&gt;
During this time, the question of secession was put to a referendum, which resulted in a 96% affirmative vote&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voanews.com/content/voting-under-way-in-crimea-referendum-to-join-russia/1872380.html&lt;/ref&gt; but has been condemned by the EU, USA, and the interim Ukraine government as unconstitutional and thus illegal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26595776&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voanews.com/content/voting-under-way-in-crimea-referendum-to-join-russia/1872380.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite international opposition, on March 17 the Crimean parliament declared independence from Ukraine and asked to join the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26609667&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, on March 27 the [[United Nations General Assembly|U.N. General Assembly]] passed a non-binding [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|Resolution 68/262]] that declared invalid Crimea's referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charbboneau|first=Louis|title=U.N.

===United States Congressional response===
On March 5, 2014, U.S. Representative [[Hal Rogers]] introduced the bill [[To provide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine (H.R. 4152; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would provide loan guarantees to [[Ukraine]] of up to $1 billion, part of the American response to the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=ReidUkraineVote25&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Reid sets up Ukraine vote for Thursday|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/201730-reid-sets-up-ukraine-vote-for-thursday|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 2014, the House voted in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll114.xml Roll Call Vote 114] to pass the bill 385-23.&lt;ref name=4152allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4152 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4152/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 2014, Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] indicated that [[United States Senate]] would vote on this bill on March 27, 2014, but only after amending it to include provisions that would put sanctions &quot;against anyone deemed by the president to have undermined Ukraine's security or independence, or to have engaged in corruption in Ukraine or Russia.&quot;&lt;ref name=ReidUkraineVote25&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Reid sets up Ukraine vote for Thursday|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/201730-reid-sets-up-ukraine-vote-for-thursday|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2014, U.S. Senator [[Robert Menendez]] introduced the [[Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (S. 2124; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would provide funds to implement a U.S. quota increase at the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), rescind other funds previously appropriated for the IMF, and provide or authorize various forms of assistance to [[Ukraine]] and the surrounding region.&lt;ref name=2124cbo&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2124 - CBO Cost Estimate|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/s2124_0.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would require sanctions on individuals responsible for violence, corruption, human rights abuses, or undermining stability in Ukraine, and would authorize sanctions on certain individuals in Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;2124cbo&quot;/&gt; On March 24, 2014, the Senate voted 78-17 to advance the bill to floor consideration.&lt;ref name=SenateAdvances24&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate advanced Ukraine aid package|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/201579-senate-advances-ukraine-aid-package|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=24 March 2014|author=Ramsey Cox|author2=Erik Wasson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration of the bill was withdrawn, however, the next day, after a decision by Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]].&lt;ref name=ReidUkraineVote25&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Reid sets up Ukraine vote for Thursday|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/201730-reid-sets-up-ukraine-vote-for-thursday|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of continuing with this bill and it's controversial International Monetary Fund provisions, the Senate was to take up a House-passed bill already offering Ukraine loan guarantees, amending it to add sanctions provisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReidUkraineVote25&quot;/&gt;

===Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty===
{{main|Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) is a [[broadcasting|broadcaster]] funded by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] that provides &quot;news, information, and analysis&quot; to countries in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], and the [[Middle East]] &quot;where the free flow of information is either banned by government authorities or not fully developed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/section/FAQ/777.html#section5 About RFE/RL - FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;  RFE/RL is supervised by the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], a [[bi-partisan]] federal agency overseeing all U.S. international broadcasting services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbg.gov Broadcasting Board of Governors (official site)]&lt;/ref&gt;

RFE/RL was headquartered at [[Englischer Garten]] in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], from 1949 to 1995. In 1995, the headquarters were moved to  [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. European operations have been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the headquarters, the service maintains 20 local bureaus in countries throughout their broadcast region, as well as a corporate office in [[Washington, D.C.]] RFE/RL broadcasts in 28 languages&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aferrz909tI Youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to 21 countries&lt;ref&gt;[http://flashvideo.rferl.org/Flashmaps/en-US/coverageOneWin/default.htm RFERL.org]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Armenia]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://flashvideo.rferl.org/Flashmaps/en-US/coverageOneWin/default.htm RFE/RL Coverage Map]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2183sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2183 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2183|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bill would direct [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL), Incorporated, and the [[Voice of America]] (VOA) service to Ukraine and neighboring regions to: (1) provide accurate and accessible news and information; (2) emphasize investigative and analytical journalism to highlight misinformation provided by Russian or pro-Russian media outlets; (3) prioritize programming to target populations and areas where access to uncensored information is limited, especially populations serviced by Russian supported media outlets; (4) increase the number of reporters and organizational presence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Crimea; (5) promote democratic processes, human rights, freedom of the press, and territorial sovereignty; (6) increase programming and content services to Russia; (7) partner with private sector broadcasters and affiliates to increase distribution; (8) expand the use and audience of mobile news and multimedia platforms, including through Internet-based social networking platforms; and (9) provide programming content 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to target populations, including specified programming in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]] languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;2183sum&quot;/&gt;

The bill would authorize FY2014 appropriations for programming in the Ukrainian, Balkan, Russian, and Tatar language services of RFE/RL, Incorporated, and VOA.&lt;ref name=&quot;2183sum&quot;/&gt;

The bill would require the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] to report to Congress on plans to increase broadcasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;2183sum&quot;/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The United States International Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions was introduced on March 27, 2014 by [[Mitch McConnell|Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY)]].&lt;ref name=2183allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2183 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2183/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was not referred to any committees. The [[United States Senate]] voted on March 27, 2014 by [[unanimous consent]] to pass the bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;2183allactions&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CoxSenatePasses&quot;/&gt; The House voted on April 1, 2014, to pass the bill 399-12 in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll150.xml Roll Call Vote 150].
