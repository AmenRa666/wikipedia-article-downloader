The '''Cadet Instructors Cadre''' (CIC) ({{lang-fr|Cadre des instructeurs de cadets}}) Branch consists of approximately 7,500 [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) officers whose primary duty is the safety, supervision, administration and training of Royal Canadian Sea, Army, and Air Cadets. The Branch is the largest single group within the Canadian Forces reserve force subcomponent [[Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service]] (COATS)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Administrative Order: Implementation of Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service&quot;, NDHQ 1085-30 (D Cdts 6) dated 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest officer branch in the Canadian Forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;forces.gc.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/commun/ml-fe/article-eng.asp?id=5000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609140311/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/commun/ml-fe/article-eng.asp?id=5000|archivedate=2011-06-09|date=14 January 2009|work=The Maple Leaf|title=Largest officer occupation marks centennial }}&lt;/ref&gt; The COATS subcomponent of the Reserve Force employs members from all branches and occupations of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[Canadian Army]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] of the Canadian Forces.

Cadets are youth 12 to 18 years of age, and participate in 1,150 Sea and Army Cadet Corps and Air Cadet Squadrons located across Canada.&lt;ref name=cic&gt;{{cite web | title = Cadet Instructors - Get Work and Training | url=http://www.cadets.forces.gc.ca/cic/get_work_traning_e.html | accessdate = 2008-08-06 | year = 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006051338/http://www.vcds-vcemd.forces.gc.ca/cic/|archivedate=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Canadian Forces Chief of Review Services about 45% of all CIC branch personnel have former Regular Force or Primary Reserve service. Some are former cadets who wish to continue their involvement in the Canadian Cadet Organizations: the [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]], [[Royal Canadian Army Cadets]], and  [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]]. Others are recruited from the general population.

==History==
The first authority for [[cadet]] instructors to hold rank in the [[Militia]] was established by Special General Order Dec. 21, 1903. The appointment was 2nd Lieutenant and the officer was permitted to retain the rank only as long as he remained an instructor and the cadet [[corps]] remained efficient.
[[File:Cadet Services of Canada capbadge.jpg|thumb|Cadet Services of Canada (Army) cap badge]]
On May 1, 1909 a cadre of commissioned officers, as a [[Corps of School Cadet Instructors]] was established. It was composed of qualified male school teachers. On May 1, 1921 the Corps was disbanded and reorganized on Jan 1, 1924 and designated the [[Cadet Services of Canada]]. It was a component of the Canadian Army [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]] and the forerunner of the current Cadet Instructor Cadre.

Initially, Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps were administered by civilians wearing Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) uniforms, differentiated by a small anchor in place of the executive curl. After 1951 RCN Reserve Officers joined the &quot;warranted&quot; Sea Cadet Officers until 1968 when Sea Cadet Officers became part of the Cadet Instructors List with the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces.

Air cadet officers were initially civilians who were granted &quot;warrants&quot; from the Air Cadet League of Canada.  Their uniforms were the same as those of the cadets except [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF-style]] officer and warrant officer rank insignia were worn.  Beginning in 1943, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] began granting King's Commissions in the &quot;Air Cadet Corps&quot;, a special reserve component of the RCAF responsible for the [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets|Royal Canadian Air Cadet]] program.  They wore uniforms identical to all other members of the RCAF with the exception of badges, composed of the letters ''ACC'', worn on the shoulders and lapels.  The League-commissioned officers and warrant officers and RCAF-commissioned officers co-existed until approx 1946 when the former were phased out.  With the [[unification of the Canadian Forces]] in 1968, the officer cadre underwent a period of reorganization. It reappeared as the tri-service [[Cadet Instructors List]] (CIL) at the [[National Defence Headquarters (Canada)|National Defense Headquarters]]. In July 1994 it was renamed Cadet Instructor Cadre (CIC).
[[File:CIL Capbadge.jpg|thumb|right|Cadet Instructor List Tri-Service Capbadge]]
On June 2, 2009 the CIC sub-component of the Canadian Forces Reserve was renamed the [[Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service]] (COATS). The other sub-components are the [[Canadian Forces Primary Reserve|Primary Reserve]], [[Canadian Forces Supplementary Reserve|Supplementary Reserve]], and [[Canadian Rangers]]. The Cadet Instructors Cadre is a CF Personnel Branch and a CF occupation within COATS and is the largest officer branch in the Canadian Forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;forces.gc.ca&quot;/&gt;

===Centennial===
[[File:Cadet Instructors Cadre Branch Flag.jpg|thumb|right|CIC Branch Flag]]

====Branch Flag====

In the summer of 2008 on the recommendation of the CIC Branch Advisor, the Director History &amp; Heritage authorized the creation of a CIC Branch/Camp Flag to recognize the CIC Centennial year. The flag was unveiled by the Honourable [[Peter MacKay]], Minister of National Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff General [[Walt Natynczyk]] at a ceremony at National Defence Headquarters on May 1, 2009, the 100th anniversary of the authorization of The Corps of School Cadet Instructors (Militia), the predecessor of the CIC Branch.

Camp flags are not saluted, dipped or lowered as a means of paying salute or compliment and a camp flag is never:
:a. presented on parade or in any ceremony, which may afford the flag special treatment or honour or
:b. draped over a casket.
A camp flag may, however, be taken into service or initially broken on flagpoles in a public display to mark their adoption.

The flag is made up of the three Canadian Forces elemental colours behind a centred CIC Branch badge.  The gold trim is representative of the cadets who are the primary focus of the CIC Branch.  Cadets are the common element that binds the three elements within the Branch.

==Branch identification==
As a branch of the Canadian Forces, members of the Cadet Instructors Cadre wear the Distinct Environment Uniforms (DEU) of the navy, army, and air force representing their leadership of the Royal Canadian Sea, Army or Air Cadets. As required they wear the base/garrison, field and working uniforms - Naval Combat Dress (NCD) for sea, CADPAT combat uniform for army or air, or flight suit.

CIC officers are issued branch accouterments upon enrollment. With Canadian Forces integration and the formation of the Cadet Instructors List (CIL), a tri-service cap badge was authorized for wear but members opted for elemental cap badges and collar badges (crossed swords for Army, fouled anchor for Navy and an eagle for Air). The air and sea collar badges became obsolete with the return of the services distinct environmental uniforms and discussions began in the mid-1990s to create a new distinct CIC Branch badge but no proposed design gained support from members of the branch.  The separate elemental versions of the branch badge were never officially authorized for wear. In 2015, the Branch Advisory Committee caused the proper tri-service branch badge to be available, and all officers are required to wear the official badge. CIC Army wear CIC brass shoulder titles and specific land element collar badges. Members of the CIC Branch may wear cadet power or glider pilot wings or Canadian Forces parachute wings earned while a cadet. CIC officers of any element and other branch officers training cadets who earned equivalent civilian flying qualifications may be authorized to wear &quot;Cadet&quot; wings while actively engaged as a pilot in air cadet flying or gliding operations. Members with former Regular Force or Primary Reserve Service continue to wear service qualifications such as flying qualifications (e.g. pilot, navigator), parachute wings, diver, submariner dolphins and the sea service badge.

===Branch employment ===
Most members of the CIC Branch are employed at one of the 1150 [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets|Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps (RCSCC)]], [[Royal Canadian Army Cadets|Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps (RCACC)]], or [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets|Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadrons (RCACS)]] located across Canada.

Each local corps or squadron is led by a commanding officer who is the commanding officer of the cadets and the immediate supervisor of the unit's other officers. Cadet corps/squadron commanding officers are not designated commanding officers in accordance with Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces (QR&amp;O's). They may recommend disciplinary action to the Regional Cadet Support Unit Commanding Officer.

Other corps/squadron officers perform the roles of supply officer, administration officer, and training officer. In addition to these responsibilities, the officers are the primary instructors for their cadet corps or squadron assisted by senior cadets. They may also be joined by officers of other CF Branches and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Forces, contracted civilian instructors or volunteers. Cadet corps and squadrons are always supported by a local sponsor which works with the staff to provide the program for the cadets.

===Specialist programs and summer training===
In addition to the unit training syllabus, the Canadian Forces funds and operates specialist programmes and Cadet Summer Training Centres that accommodate the [[Air Cadet Gliding Program]], with Regional [[Gliding]] Schools across Canada, and the Sea Cadet Sail Training Centres.  Cadet training at these facilities is led by members of the CIC Branch augmented by other Canadian Forces members in support occupations and trades including medical, chaplaincy, administration, and logistics.

==CIC training programme==

Nearly half of all CIC Branch members have previous service in the Regular or Primary Reserve. Others have enrolled in the Canadian Forces for the first time and represent all segments of society and occupations. Members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) who were until August 4, 1998, prohibited by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act]] from enrolling in the [[Canadian Forces]] Reserve, are an important source of personnel as are ex-cadets who enrol to work with the cadet program immediately upon leaving the cadet program before their 19th birthday.  While a university degree is not a requirement for enrolment in the CIC Branch, many of the younger members are university students and most of the older officers are well established in their own civilian careers. All candidates must submit to reliability and vulnerable sector screening. Transferring to the [[Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service]] is attractive to former serving members as it allows them to continue to serve in a non-operational environment that is not mandated by the age and universality of fitness standards required in the Regular Force or Primary Reserve. That is particularly important for members who have been injured or wounded but are otherwise able to function in their trade and serve with dignity until aged 65 should they choose.

Those without previous military service are required to take the Basic Military Officer Qualification and CIC Occupational Training Course that together involve seven weeks of distance learning and 16 days of in house training at Regional Cadet Instructor Schools (or ''{{lang|fr|Écoles régionale des instructeurs de cadets}}''). A CIC officer will start at the rank of naval cadet or [[officer cadet]] and upon successfully completing the Basic Officer Training and Occupational Training Courses may be [[Commission (document)|commissioned]] after a year's service and on the job training or immediately if the candidate holds a university undergraduate degree.

Former serving officers of the Canadian Forces may be component transferred to the Cadet Organization Administration and Training Service (COATS) and be required to take specific instruction to familiarize them with the cadet organizations.  Former serving non-commissioned members may component transfer to COATS and retain their rank or be commissioned in the CIC Branch. Those of Sgt. and above will be commissioned on enrolment and be required to take CIC specific courses.

===Mandatory CIC officer training===
CIC Officer training is delivered through the CIC Centre for Distributed Learning and the five Regional Cadet Instructor Schools (RCIS) across Canada. Following the integration of the Canadian Forces in 1969, the training was rank-based, requiring successful completion in order to qualify for promotion. Beginning in 2009 a revised training system was introduced. In addition to providing the requisite military familiarization the courses include instruction on contemporary educational methodology resulting in the skills and knowledge required to administer the Cadet Organizations. Training is delivered both in house and through distance learning at the RCIS facilities in both continuous and weekend instruction. The ability to deliver training by the Canadian Forces internet-based Defence Learning Network / Réseau d'apprentissage de la Defense (DLN/RAD) has expanded the level training provided and prepares the candidates for the in-house training.

:Chacun prendra la fleur qu'il aime
:Cette fleur restera l'emblème
:Du grand amour que j'ai pour vous.&quot;
:
:Le jour dit, dans le paradis
:Les envoyés se rencontrèrent
:La France vint choisir un lys
:L'oeillet fut pris par l'Angleterre
:L'Espagnol eut un frais liseron
:L'Américain un dahlia rose
:L'Italien choisit une rose
:Et l'allemand un vieux chardon
:
:Quand arriva le Canadien
:Emmitouflé dans ses fourrures
:Hélas! il ne restait plus rien
:Que des feuillages, des ramures
:Saint-Pierre était plein de regret
:Il caressait sa barbe blanche
:&quot;Je n'ai plus, dit-il, que ces branches
:Tu peux regagner ta foret.&quot;
:
:Mais Jésus, qu'on ne voyait pas
:Intervint d'un coeur secourable
:S'en alla choisir dans le tas
:Offrit une feuille d'érable
:Et c'est depuis ce beau jour-la
:Qu'un peu partout dans la campagne
:Dans la plaine et sur la montagne
:L'érable croit au Canada
:Dans la plaine et sur la montagne
:L'érable croit au Canada

As sung by members of the CIC across Canada (translated into English)
:On one fine day the good Creator
:said to people of the [[earth]]
:“let each of you go choose a [[flower]]
:and then send an emissary.
:Make sure that they are all on time.
:Each take a flower that he loves.
:And that flower for ever be a symbol
:of the Love, the Love I have for you.”
:
:On the appointed day in [[heaven]]
:the envoys had all gathered there.
:[[France]] chose the [[Lily]] and the
:[[Carnation]] was chosen by the English.
:The Spanish got a [[morning glory]]
:the [[United States|Americans]] pink [[dahlia]].
:The Italians chose a [[rose]] for their flower
:and German, the [[Germans]] chose a [[thistle]].
:
:When the [[Canadian]] arrived
:bundled up in his coat of fur,
:alas, alas all that remained there
:were just left some leaves and boughs.
:[[St. Peter]] was full of regret
:and as he stroked his long white beard,
:“All I have left are these old branches
:Go back to, back to your forest home.”
:
:But [[Jesus]], who had not been seen,
:stepped forth with generosity.
:The Lord, he dug into the pile
:and offered up a [[maple leaf]].
:And ever since that glorious day
:here, there in the countryside,
:on the plains and high up in the mountain,
:the [[maple]] grows, it grows in Canada.
