'''HMS ''Tiptoe''''' ([[pennant number]] P332) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[submarine]] of the third group of the [[British T class submarine|T class]]. She was built by [[Vickers Armstrong]], [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]], and launched on 25 February 1944. She was one of two submarines named by [[Winston Churchill]], and so far has been the only ship of the [[Royal Navy]] to be named ''Tiptoe''. In 1955 she was involved in a collision with a coastal steamer whilst in [[Tromsø]] harbour. She was involved in escape trials off Malta in 1962, and the commanding officer was reprimanded in 1964 following an incident in the [[Firth of Clyde]] where she was run aground, and again in 1965 when she collided with [[HMS Yarmouth (F101)|HMS ''Yarmouth'']]. Although originally named for the ability to sneak up on someone undetected, she maintained several links with [[ballet]], including the [[Royal Ballet]] and ballet dancer [[Moira Shearer]]. She was scrapped in Portsmouth in 1975, while her anchor is on display in [[Blyth, Northumberland]].

==Design and description==
HMS ''Tiptoe'' was one of the group three of T-class submarines.&lt;ref name=&quot;akermann386&quot;&gt;[[#Akermann2002|Akermann (2002)]]: p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; She was named by [[Winston Churchill]], with the intention to imply that it could approach the enemy silently as if on tiptoe, although the Royal Navy naming committee was against the name, stating that &quot;it was derogatory to one of His Majesty's ships&quot;, but the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] had his way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Peter|title=Leotard type?|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=2 November 1981|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=8|issue=61071}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other Royal Navy vessel to be named by Churchill was [[HMS Varangian (P61)|HMS ''Varangian'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;akermann95&quot;&gt;[[#Akermann2002|Akermann (2002)]]: p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

She was part of the second batch of the third group to be ordered, in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccartney12&quot;&gt;[[#McCartney2006|McCartney (2006)]]: p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of a number of boats which had an all-welded hull which increased diving depth to {{convert|350|ft|m}}, an increase of {{convert|50|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccartney13&quot;&gt;[[#McCartney2006|McCartney (2006)]]: p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The torpedo armament was the same as the earlier group two, although by the time group three was coming into service it was realised that external torpedo tubes had major problems and affected the streamlining of the boats; the external tubes were abandoned in the following [[Amphion class submarine|''Amphion''-class submarines]]. Because of expected use in tropical climates, boats of group three were equipped with [[Gas compressor|freon blower]]s in order to deal with the increased temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccartney13&quot;/&gt;

She was built by [[Vickers Armstrong]] and was laid down at their shipyard at [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]] on 10 November 1942 whilst still known as P332. Following her launch on 25 February 1944,&lt;ref name=navalhist/&gt; she departed the builders yard on 10 June 1944, arriving at [[Holy Loch]] on the following day, where she was commissioned on 12 June.&lt;ref name=uboatnet/&gt;

==Service==

===Second World War===
After completing training on 10 September, she returned to Barrow in order to correct some defects. Between 5 October and 12 January 1945, she was equipped with new radar equipment and other equipment to prepare her for deployment in the Far East.&lt;ref name=uboatnet&gt;{{cite web|title=HMS Tiptoe (P 332)|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3522.html|publisher=Uboat.net|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived in [[Trincomalee]], [[Sri Lanka]] on 1 March 1945 prior to her first war patrol. En route from Britain, she had stopped at [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Port Said]] and [[Ismailia]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Aden]], [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name=uboatnet/&gt;

Her first patrol centred around the west coast of [[Burma]] and the [[Andaman Islands]] before heading onto [[Fremantle]], [[Australia]], and was uneventful. She departed Australia for her second patrol on 6 May with orders to patrol the [[Flores Sea]]. On 15 May, she sank a Japanese coaster of around 100 tons with gunfire near Dompo Bay, [[Sumbawa]]. The following day she sank another Japanese coaster with gunfire, this time around 200 tons, in Sepeh harbour.&lt;ref name=uboatnet/&gt; On 1 June, she approached and sank the Japanese merchant cargo ship ''Tobi Maru'' near [[Matasiri]], one of the [[Laut Kecil Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cressman&quot;/&gt; ''Tiptoe'' was damaged during the attack as the cargo ship was about to rendezvous with an escort. The escort launched thirteen [[depth charge]]s, putting all of ''Tiptoe'''s torpedo tubes out of action and flooded her sonar equipment. She returned to Fremantle on 17 June, and remained there undergoing repairs until 16 July when she left on her third patrol in the [[Sunda Strait]] along with her sister [[HMS Trump (P333)|HMS ''Trump'']].&lt;ref name=uboatnet/&gt;

On 31 July she attacked two small Japanese vessels, but broke off the attack when an aircraft was sighted. On 2 August, ''Tiptoe'' and ''Trump'' together destroyed two small vessels totalling 600 tons with gunfire. On 3 August, she carried out a torpedo attack against the Japanese army cargo vessel ''Tencho Maru'' whilst it was in a convoy defended by a patrol boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;cressman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cressman|first=Robert J.|title=Chapter VII: 1945|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1945.html|work=The Official Chronology of the US Navy in World War II|publisher=ibiblio.org|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final action of ''Tiptoe'''s last war patrol was on 9 August, when together with ''Trump'', they destroyed an 800 ton coastal tanker in the northern part of the Sunda Strait. She returned to Fremantle on 21 August 1945.&lt;ref name=uboatnet/&gt;

===Post war===
During the royal inspection of the [[home fleet]] in 1947 by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], ''Tiptoe'' demonstrated diving and surfacing, along with the firing of her deck gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The King with his Fleet|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=24 July 1947|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=4|issue=50821}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of the same year, she was part of a group of seven submarines with destroyer [[HMS Opportune (G80)|HMS ''Opportune'']] to take part in anti&amp;ndash;submarine training over the course of two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naval Exercises|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=4 November 1947|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=3|issue=50909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tiptoe'' was one of several all-welded T-class submarines rebuilt for greater underwater performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;akermann383&quot;&gt;[[#Akermann2002|Akermann (2002)]]: p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Extra batteries were installed below the control room and additional electric motors were accommodated by cutting through the pressure hull and adding in a new {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} hull section inserted aft of the control room.&lt;ref name=&quot;akermann383&quot;/&gt; The diesel engines were modified and supercharged with output increased by 300 BHP. The gun armaments and external torpedo tubes were removed, and the bow reshaped.&lt;ref name=&quot;akermann383&quot;/&gt;

The submarine was used in filming the 1950 film, ''[[Morning Departure]]'', a naval film directed by [[Roy Ward Baker]]. During the course of filming, the [[submarine depot ship]] [[HMS Maidstone (1937)|HMS ''Maidstone'']] was used as a mother ship for ''Tiptoe''.&lt;ref name=wardbaker&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Geoff|title=Roy Ward Baker|year=2004|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-7190-6354-1|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSrBZt_S50wC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22hms+tiptoe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W4VuTqeFNo7dsgaeub2RBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hms%20tiptoe%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 a further cinematic link was made when [[ballet]] dancer [[Moira Shearer]] presented a pair of size 3.5 [[satin]] ballet shoes to ''Tiptoe'' that she had worn in the 1948 film ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''. These are now at the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]].&lt;ref name=redshoeday&gt;{{cite news|title=Red shoe day|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4261562/Red-shoe-day.html|accessdate=12 September 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=25 April 2001|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in [[Tromsø]] harbour on 18 July 1955 ''Tiptoe'' was damaged when a coastal steamer collided with her. The steamer, a 2,162 tonne vessel called ''Nordlys'', was entering the harbour when she collided with the British destroyer [[HMS Chevron (R51)|HMS ''Chevron'']]. The steamer bounced off the destroyer and collided with ''Tiptoe'', snapping her moorings as she was pushed halfway under a wooden quay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Submarine Tiptoe Damaged|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=19 July 1955|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=8|issue=53276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She took part in escape trials in 1962, which were a series of trials conducted off [[Malta]] into escape from a submarine at extreme depths.  Tests were conducted with men escaping from ''Tiptoe'' at depth of up to {{convert|71|m|ft}} with ascent rates of up to 2&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bud|first=Robert|author2=Gummett, Phillip|title=Cold war, hot science : applied research in Britain's defence laboratories, 1945-1990|year=1999|publisher=Harwood Academic Publishers in association with the Science Museum|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5702-481-8|page=348|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMx_6FtHBcUC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=%22hms+tiptoe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W4VuTqeFNo7dsgaeub2RBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hms%20tiptoe%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trials included the use of buoyant ascent suits which involved a suit pulled over the sailor's head which fed them air as they ascended to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Escapes from Submarine at 260ft|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=5 October 1962|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=5|issue=55514}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their work in the escape trials, Chief Petty Officer Christopher Crossman was awarded a commendation, and Lieutenant&amp;ndash;Commander L. Hamlyn was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bravery in Submarine Trials Recognized|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=2 January 1963|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=4|issue=55588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a refit in Portsmouth, ''Tiptoe'' went to the [[Firth of Clyde]] for [[Glossary of nautical terms|working up]], arriving on 10 January 1964, when she was ordered not to enter [[Gareloch]] due to dense fog. The boat was duly turned around and ran aground on a muddy bank. As the fog cleared it was realised the boat had run aground only {{convert|40|yd|m}} opposite that of the house of the Royal Navy's Captain in Charge for the Clyde area, Captain G. D. Pound. Divers were sent out to assess damage, and after finding none, ''Tiptoe'' was refloated on the evening tide and pulled off the shore by two [[tugboat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Submarine Grounds in Clyde|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=11 January 1964|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=6|issue=55906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commanding officer at the time was Lieutenant&amp;ndash;Commander David Brazier, who was in his first command. He was later ordered to be severely reprimanded for negligence at a [[court-martial]] where he pleaded guilty to the charge. His defence statement read, &quot;The ship was not worked up and it was a very green company. Unfortunately he ran into fog. He took all the precautions he considered necessary. Although he had all the theoretical knowledge, he was short of that tangible instinct of which we are all aware.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Submarine Commander Reprimanded |accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=13 March 1964|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=6|issue=55959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tiptoe'' was also damaged in a collision with [[HMS Yarmouth (F101)|HMS ''Yarmouth'']] on 13 July 1965. ''Tiptoe'' was at periscope depth {{convert|10|mi|km}} SE of [[Portland Bill]]. Following the collision, the commanding officer, Lieutenant&amp;ndash;Commander Charles Henry Pope was ordered to be severely reprimanded after being found guilty of four out of five counts of negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Submarine Commander Reprimanded |accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=8 September 1965|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=7|issue=56422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she left for her final commission on 24 February 1967, six ballet dancers from the [[Royal Ballet]] attended the departure ceremony. At the time she was already the oldest submarine in service with the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vintage Submarine|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=22 February 1967|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=10|issue=56872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She attended Portsmouth Navy Days later in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Programme, ''Navy Days Portsmouth, 26th-28th August 1967'', HMSO, p25.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time she was decommissioned in 1969, ''Tiptoe'' was the last active T-class submarine in the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=specialservice&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Submariners Plan Special Service|url=http://www.newspostleader.co.uk/news/local/former_submariners_plan_special_service_1_1637745|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=News Post Leader|date=1 November 2000|publisher=Northeast Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she arrived at [[Spithead]] for decommissioning on 29 August 1969, a 13-year-old ballet dancer named Judy Wright danced on her upper deck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Picture Gallery|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|date=30 August 1969|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=3|issue=57652}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sold in 1971 and scrapped at Portsmouth in 1975. Her anchor was saved, and was mounted on stone in 1979 in [[Blyth, Northumberland]]. The town was used as a training base for submarines during both World Wars.&lt;ref name=specialservice/&gt;
