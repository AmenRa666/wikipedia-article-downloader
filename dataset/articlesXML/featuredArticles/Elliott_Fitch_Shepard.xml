'''Elliott Fitch Shepard'''{{refn|group=nb|Other common spellings of his first name include &quot;Eliot&quot; and &quot;Elliot&quot;; &quot;Shepherd&quot; was sometimes used as his surname. Shepard was sometimes known as Elliott Fitch Shepard, Sr., to distinguish him from [[Elliott Shepard|his son]].}} (July 25, 1833&amp;nbsp;– March 24, 1893) was a New York lawyer, banker, and owner of the ''[[Mail and Express]]'' newspaper, as well as a founder and president of the [[New York State Bar Association]]. Shepard was married to [[Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt]], who was the granddaughter of philanthropist, business magnate, and family patriarch [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]. Shepard's [[Briarcliff Manor]] residence [[Woodlea]] and the [[Scarborough Presbyterian Church]], which he founded nearby, are contributing properties to the [[Scarborough Historic District]].

Shepard was born in [[Jamestown, New York]], one of three sons of the president of a banknote-engraving company. He attended the [[City University of New York]], and practiced law for about 25 years. During the [[American Civil War]], Shepard was a [[Union Army]] recruiter and earned the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He was later a founder and benefactor of several institutions and banks. When Shepard moved to the Briarcliff Manor hamlet of [[Scarborough-on-Hudson]], he founded the Scarborough Presbyterian Church and built Woodlea; the house and its land are now part of [[Sleepy Hollow Country Club]].

== Early life ==
[[File:FitchShepard.png|thumb|left|upright=0.69|alt=Portrait of an old man|Fitch Shepard, father of Elliott Fitch Shepard]]
Shepard was born July 25, 1833 in [[Jamestown, New York|Jamestown]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York]]. He was the second of three sons of Fitch Shepard and Delia Maria Dennis; the others were Burritt Hamilton and Augustus Dennis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descendants&quot;/&gt; Fitch Shepard was president of the National Bank Note Company (later [[Consolidation (business)|consolidated]] with the American and Continental Note Companies), and Elliott's brother Augustus became president of the [[American Bank Note Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt; Fitch, son of Noah Shepard, was a descendant of [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]] (a [[Puritan]] minister) and James Fitch (son-in-law of [[William Bradford (Plymouth soldier)|William Bradford]]). Delia Maria Dennis was a descendant of Robert Dennis, who emigrated from England in 1635.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descendants&quot;/&gt; Elliott was described in 1897's ''Prominent Families of New York'' as &quot;prominent by birth and ancestry, as well as for his personal qualities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProminentFamilies&quot;/&gt; He attended public schools in Jamestown and the college-preparatory University Grammar School (then located in the [[City University of New York]] building),&lt;ref name=&quot;NY-TribuneDeath&quot;/&gt; and graduated from the university in 1855.&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt; Shepard began studying law under [[Edwards Pierrepont]], and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted]] to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in the city of [[Brooklyn]] in 1858.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

== Civil War service ==
[[File:ElliottFitchShepardCivilWar.tif|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of a bearded Caucasian uniformed man|Shepard during the [[American Civil War]], photographed by [[George G. Rockwood]]]]
At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] Shepard became an ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to [[Union Army]] General [[Edwin D. Morgan]], with the rank of colonel. Shepard never entered the field, but was involved in recruiting volunteers.&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--&quot;Between ...proclamations...he served on the field in Virginia, Western Maryland and North Carolina&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BarDescription&quot;/&gt;--&gt; In 1862 he visited Jamestown to inspect, equip and provide uniforms for the Chautauqua regiment, his first return since age twelve,&lt;ref name=&quot;Descendants&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt; and was welcomed by a group of prominent citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descendants&quot;/&gt; Shepard recruited and organized the 51st Regiment, New York Volunteers, which was named the Shepard Rifles in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarDescription&quot;/&gt; George W. Whitman, brother of the poet [[Walt Whitman]] and a member of the regiment, was notified by Shepard of a promotion; Shepard may have influenced his subsequent promotion to [[major]] in 1865. In addition, Shepard was involved in correspondence with Walt Whitman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman2&quot;/&gt;

Shepard was placed in charge of the recruiting station in [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], and enlisted 47,000 men from the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt; Although President [[Abraham Lincoln]] offered him a promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], Shepard declined in deference to officers who had seen field service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

== Career ==
In 1864, Shepard was a member of the executive committee and chair of the Committee on Contributions from Without the City for the New York Metropolitan Fair. He chaired lawyers' committees for disaster relief, including those in [[Portland, Maine]] and [[Chicago]] after the [[1866 Great fire of Portland, Maine|1866 Great Fire]] and the 1871 [[Great Chicago Fire]] respectively, and was a member of the municipal committee for victims of the 1889 [[Johnstown Flood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BarDescription&quot;/&gt;

In 1867 Shepard was presented to [[Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt]] at a reception given by Governor Morgan;&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt; their difficult courtship&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt; was opposed by Margaret's father, [[William Henry Vanderbilt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadingTimes&quot;/&gt; A year later, on February 18, 1868, they were married in the [[Church of the Incarnation, Episcopal (Manhattan)|Church of the Incarnation]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marriage&quot;/&gt; After an 1868 trip to [[Tarsus, Mersin]] he helped found [[Tarsus American College]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarsus&quot;/&gt; agreeing to donate $5,000 a year to the school and leave it an endowment of $100,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1893}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Endowment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarsus2&quot;/&gt; He became one of the school's trustees and vice presidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY-TribuneDeath&quot;/&gt;

In 1868, Shepard became a partner of Judge Theron R. Strong in Strong &amp; Shepard, continuing the business after Strong's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Record&quot;/&gt; He continued to practice law for the next 25 years;&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt; he helped found the [[New York State Bar Association]] in 1876, and in 1884 was its fifth president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidents&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYSBA&quot;/&gt; In 1875 Shepard drafted an amendment establishing an arbitration court for the [[New York Chamber of Commerce]], serving on its five-member executive committee the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commerce1876&quot;/&gt; In 1880, the [[New York City Council|New York City Board of Aldermen]] appointed Shepard and Ebenezer B. Shafer to revise and codify the city's [[local ordinances]] to form the New-York Municipal Code; the last revision was in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCOrd&quot;/&gt;

During the 1880s he helped found three banks. At the [[Bank of the Metropolis]], he was a founding board member.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanPelt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Pelt|first=Daniel|title=Early Banks of New York City|journal=Leslie's History of the Greater New York, Volume de Luxe|publisher=Arkell Publishing Company|url=http://thehistorybox.com/ny_city/nycity_business_banking_article00050.htm|date=1898|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The others were the American Savings Bank and the Columbian National Bank, where he served as attorney.&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=154}} In 1881, US President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] nominated him for [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt; On March 20, 1888, Shepard purchased the ''[[Mail and Express]]'' newspaper (founded in 1836, with an estimated value in 1888 of $200,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|200000|1888}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) from [[Cyrus W. Field]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FullPage&quot;/&gt; for $425,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|425000|1888}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt; Deeply religious, Shepard placed a verse from the Bible at the head of each edition's editorial page. As president of the newspaper company until his death, he approved every important decision or policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appeals&quot;/&gt; In the same year, Shepard became the controlling stockholder of the [[Fifth Avenue Transportation Company]] to force it to halt work on Sundays (the [[Christian Sabbath]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M&amp;amp;E&quot;/&gt;

When Margaret's father died in 1885, she inherited $12&amp;nbsp;million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|12000000|1885}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt; The family lived at 2 West [[52nd Street]] in Manhattan,&lt;ref name=&quot;Location&quot;/&gt; one of three houses of the Vanderbilt [[Vanderbilt houses|Triple Palace]] which were built during the 1880s for William Henry Vanderbilt and his two daughters. After Elliott's death Margaret transferred the house to her sister's family, who combined their two houses into one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotel&quot;/&gt; The houses were eventually demolished; the nine-story [[De Pinna]] Building was built there in 1928 and was demolished around 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;DePinna&quot;/&gt; [[650 Fifth Avenue]] is the building currently on the site.

Shepard and his family toured the world in 1884,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=154}} visiting Asia, Africa, and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt; He documented his 1887 trip from New York to Alaska in ''The Riva.: New York and Alaska'' taken by himself, his wife and daughter, six other family members, their maid, a chef, butler, [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] and conductor. According to Shepard, the family traveled {{convert|14085|mi|km}} on 26 railroads and stayed at 38 hotels in nearly five months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Riva&quot;/&gt; After the 1884 trip, aware of the opportunity for church work in the territory, he founded a mission and maintained it with his wife for about $20,000 (${{Inflation|US|20000|1884|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) a year. For some time Shepard worshiped at the [[Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church]] under John Hall,&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt; and was a vice president of the Presbyterian Union of New-York.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTfuneral&quot;/&gt; Shepard was president of the American Sabbath Union for five years,&lt;ref name=&quot;BarDescription&quot;/&gt; and he also served as the chairman of the Special Committee on Sabbath Observance.&lt;ref name=&quot;SabbathCommittee&quot;/&gt;

During the early 1890s Shepard moved to [[Scarborough-on-Hudson]] in present-day Briarcliff Manor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=158}} purchasing a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian house]] from [[J. Butler Wright]]. He had a mansion (named Woodlea, after Wright's house) built south of the house, facing the [[Hudson River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SHCC5&quot;/&gt; and improved its grounds. Construction of the mansion began in 1892,&lt;ref name=&quot;ScHD&quot;/&gt; and was completed three years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=153}} Shepard died in 1893, leaving Margaret to oversee its completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|pages=159–60}} The finished house has between {{convert|65000|and|70000|sqft|m2}}, making it one of the [[List of largest houses in the United States|largest privately-owned houses in the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=163}}&lt;ref name=&quot;SHCCNew&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SHCC1&quot;/&gt;

After Shepard's death Margaret lived there in the spring and fall,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=165}} with her visits becoming less frequent. By 1900 she began selling property to [[Frank A. Vanderlip]] and [[William Rockefeller]], selling them the house in 1910. Vanderlip and Rockefeller assembled a board of directors to create a country club; they first met at Vanderlip's National City Bank Building office at [[55 Wall Street]] (Vanderlip was president of the bank at the time). Sleepy Hollow Country Club was founded, with Woodlea becoming its clubhouse and the J. Butler Wright house as its golf house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=169}}

Shepard established a small chapel on his Briarcliff Manor property, and founded the [[Scarborough Presbyterian Church]] in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;1939history&quot;/&gt; The church and its [[manse]] were donated by Margaret after his death. It was designed by Augustus Haydel (a nephew of [[Stanford White]]) and August D. Shepard, Jr. (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and [[William Rutherford Mead]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt; The church, dedicated on May 11, 1895 in Shepard's memory,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=165}} was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScPresbHistory&quot;/&gt;

== Family and personal life ==
[[File:Vanderbilt family 1874a.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of formally-dressed people in a room|''Going to the Opera'' (1874) by [[Seymour Joseph Guy]], depicting the Vanderbilt family; Margaret is in blue, with Elliott on her right.]]
Shepard and Margaret had five daughters and one son: Florence (1869–1869), Maria Louise (1870–1948), Edith (1872–1954), Marguerite (1873–1895), [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Alice]] (1874–1950) and [[Elliott Shepard|Elliott Jr.]] (1877–1927). The children attended [[Sunday school]] and church, and were educated by private tutors and [[governesses]]. Shepard also employed a private chef for his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;FamilyLife&quot;/&gt; Shepard was a strict father known to beat his son, who was described as being as wild as his father was rigid and moralizing.&lt;ref name=&quot;FamilyLife&quot;/&gt;

Shepard was tall, with a pleasant expression and manner,&lt;ref name=&quot;BarDescription&quot;/&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him the &quot;perfect type of well-bred clubman&quot;. He had thick hair, manicured nails, a well-trimmed beard and an athletic figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=154}} An opponent of [[antisemitism]], he attended dinners publicizing the plight of Russian Jews and regularly addressed Jewish religious and social organizations avoided by others. He rented pews in many New York churches, supported about a dozen missionaries and was described as a generous donor to hospitals and charitable societies. Shepard was politically ambitious, and decided to build Woodlea as a symbol of power and influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanderbilts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=157}} Shepard had horses and carriages which were ridden by the family in parks, and he prided himself on his [[equestrianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FamilyLife&quot;/&gt; Shepard was a long-time friend of US Senator [[Chauncey Depew]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IllAmerican&quot;/&gt;

Shepard was a supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], contributing $75,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|75000|1888}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to the [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888 Presidential campaign]] fund and $10,000 (${{Inflation|US|10000|1888|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to the state committee for the [[Jacob Sloat Fassett|Fassett]] campaign.

[[File:Elliott Fitch Shepard 1892.jpg|thumb|upright=0.77|alt=Line drawing of bespectacled, mustached man in a derby hat|1892 sketch of Shepard]]
In 1892, the City University of New York gave Shepard a [[Master of Laws]] degree and the [[University of Omaha]] gave him a [[Doctor of Laws]] degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Degrees&quot;/&gt; On January 11, 1893, Shepard addressed the House Committee on the [[Columbian Exposition]] in an effort to convince the committee not to open the exposition on a Sunday - the Sabbath.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColExp&quot;/&gt; Shepard himself attended, having spent $25,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|25000|1891}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) on September 7, 1891 in reserving sixteen rooms with board at the [[Auditorium Building|Auditorium Hotel]] for six months during the fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auditorium&quot;/&gt;

Shepard died unexpectedly during the afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a [[bladder stone]] from him; they gave him [[Diethyl ether|ether]] at 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. For a few minutes Shepard did not seem to react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. His cause of death was [[Pulmonary edema|edema]] and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY-TribuneDeath&quot;/&gt; Shepard was first buried in the Vanderbilt mausoleum in [[Moravian Cemetery]]. On November 17, 1894 one of his daughters, his wife, and her brother [[George Vanderbilt]] oversaw the transfer of his remains and those of his daughter Florence to a new Shepard family tomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transfer&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Vanderbilt mausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An ornate mausoleum built into a hillside|The Vanderbilt mausoleum, Shepard's initial resting place]]
Shepard's estate included the $100,000 Tarsus American College endowment, $850,000 in real estate and $500,000 in personal property for a total of $1.35&amp;nbsp;million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1350000|1893}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). His will distributed money and property to his wife and children, his brother Augustus, and religious organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will&quot;/&gt; Shepard funded a number of scholarships and [[Prize money|prizes]], including one at the City University of New York and [[New York University]]'s annual Elliott F. Shepard Scholarship,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt; and donated a large collection of books from lawyer Aaron J. Vanderpoel's library to the [[New York University School of Law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU&quot;/&gt;

When the wife of Chicago publisher Horace O'Donoghue read him the news of Shepard's death four days after the event, he picked up a razor and slit his throat.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donoghue1&quot;/&gt; Although his suicide was first thought to be impulsive, it was later learned that the likely cause was O'Donoghue's large debts to Chicago publishing houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donoghue2&quot;/&gt;{{clear left}}
