[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] '''Sir Horatius Murray''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCB|KBE|DSO}} (1903–1989) was a senior [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who served during [[World War II]].

==Military career==
Horatius Murray joined the [[British Army]] and was [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32858|supp=|startpage=5911|date=31 August 1923|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33080| date=1 September 1925| startpage=5767| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he was transferred to the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] and advanced to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34181| date=19 July 1935| startpage=4683 | accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]] for two years from January 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34247| date=21 January 1936| startpage=459| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Staff College he was given a staff posting at the [[War Office]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34513| date=24 May 1938| startpage=3351| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] in August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35167| date=16 May 1941| startpage=2872 | accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in [[World War II]] being appointed [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] (CO) of the 1st Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]] in 1941. In June 1942 the battalion, forming part of the [[153rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|153rd Infantry Brigade]] (in turn part of [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]]), was shipped to [[Egypt]] where his unit took part in the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=314}} Murray was seriously wounded in the early stages of the battle and only returned to active service again in April 1943. After a brief period as temporary [[Staff (military)|GSO I]] of the 51st Division, Murray was given command of the 153rd Infantry Brigade in the same division. After a period of rest and refit in [[Algeria]] the brigade saw action in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], after which it was shipped, with the rest of the division, in November 1943 to [[England]] for training and preparation for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]].{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=314}}

Landing in Normandy on the afternoon of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] Murray saw nearly constant action with his brigade until August when he was ordered to Italy to take command of the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]], after its previous commander, [[Gerald Templer]], was wounded.{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=315}} The division, [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fighting in Italy]], was involved in the fighting on the [[Gothic Line]] in late 1944 before being withdrawn into reserve and then joining [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] for the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy]].{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=315}} Following the breaking of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] defences in the [[Battle of the Argenta Gap|Argenta Gap]] by [[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th]] and [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Division]]s, 6th Armoured Division was released to exploit across country.{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=316}} Advancing north-west to the River Po, the division linked up with units of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Lucian Truscott|Lucian K. Truscott]], advancing from the south to cut off Axis forces in Bologna. By 8 May the division was crossing the Austrian frontier becoming the first element of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[Lieutenant-general (United_Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Richard McCreery|Richard L. McCreery]], to enter German territory.{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=316}} He was [[mentioned in dispatches]] in 1945 for his services in Italy.

At the end of the war, because of his relative youth, although he held an appointment as [[Acting (rank)|acting]] [[Major-general (United_Kingdom)|major-general]], his permanent rank was still only major (war substantive [[Lieutenant colonel (United_Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]], temporary [[Brigadier (United_Kingdom)|brigadier]]). In August 1945 he was advanced to temporary major-general, war substantive [[Colonel (United_Kingdom)|colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37239| date=24 August 1945| startpage=4319| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His substantive rank was advanced to full colonel in December 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37906| date=14 March 1947| startpage=1251| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again to major-general in January 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=38197| date=3 February 1948| startpage=889| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War Murray was appointed Director of Personal Services in 1946, [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC) [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Division]] in 1947 and District Officer Commanding [[Northumbrian District (United_Kingdom)|Northumbrian District]] and the [[Army Reserve (United_Kingdom)|Territorial]] [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=dk&gt;[http://www.generals.dk/general/Murray/Sir_Horatius/Great_Britain.html Generals.dk]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 he was mentioned in dispatches for services in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] between March and September 1947.

Relinquishing command of the 50th Division and the Northumbrian District in August 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=39950| date=28 August 1953 | startpage=4689 | supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray saw action again as GOC [[1st Commonwealth Division]] in [[Korea]]&lt;ref name=dk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=40006| date=3 November 1953| startpage=5903| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; relinquishing the appointment in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=40389| date=21 January 1955 | startpage=493| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of [[Scottish Command]] in the temporary rank of lieutenant-general&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=40422| date=1 March 1955| startpage=1315| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Governor of Edinburgh Castle]].&lt;ref name=dk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=40421| date=1 March 1955| startpage=1270| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lieutenant-general's rank was made substantive shortly afterwards, in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=40472| date=6 May 1955 | startpage=2691| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Murray became [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] [[Allied Forces Northern Europe]] which post he relinquished in July 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=42402| date=30 June 1961| startpage=4923| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been promoted to full [[General (United_Kingdom)|general]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=41863| date=6 November 1959 | startpage=7077| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the British Army in September 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=42453| date=1 September 1961| startpage=6485| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained his links with the army, retaining the honorary Colonelship of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=43283| date=127 March 1964| startpage=2836| supp=y| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
