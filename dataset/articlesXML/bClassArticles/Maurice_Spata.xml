'''Muriki''' or '''Maurice Spata''' ({{lang-sq|Muriq Shpata}}, {{lang-el|Μουρίκης Σπάτας}}; {{floruit|1399–1414}}) was the [[Despotate of Arta|ruler of Arta]] from late 1399/early 1400 until his death in 1414 or 1415. Maurice's reign was dominated by his wars with [[Carlo I Tocco]]. Maurice was able to defend his capital of Arta, but despite some victories failed to prevent the fall of [[Ioannina]] to Tocco. As a result, his brother [[Yaqub Spata]] who succeeded him was defeated in October 1416, ending the [[Despotate of Arta]].

==Life==
Maurice was a scion of the Albanian [[Spata family]]. He was a grandson of [[Gjin Bua Spata]], the first Albanian ruler of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. He had one brother, [[Yaqub Spata]], and two half-siblings from his mother's second marriage, Charles Marchesano and Maddalena.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}}{{sfn|PLP|1978|loc=5969. Εἰρήνη}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|p=255}} Shortly before Gjin died on 29 October 1399, he appointed his brother, [[Sgouros Spata]], ruler of [[Naupactus]], as his successor as [[Despotate of Arta|Lord of Arta]]. A few days after Sgouros took over [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], however, the town was captured by the adventurer [[Vonko]]. While Sgouros fled to [[Angelokastro, Aetolia-Acarnania|Angelokastro]]n, a short time after, possibly as early as December 1399, Maurice managed to evict Vonko from Arta and took over the governance of the city himself.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=164, 169}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=355–356}}

[[File:South-eastern Europe 1401.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the states of south-eastern Europe in 1401]]
In 1402–03, Maurice came to Sgouros' aid when the latter was besieged at Angelokastron by the forces of [[Carlo I Tocco]]. The attack, under Carlo's general Galasso Peccatore, was repulsed, but Sgouros died soon after, leaving his possessions to his son [[Paul Spata]].{{sfn|Nicol|2010|p=170}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=356}} In his campaigns against the Spatas, Tocco was supported by a rival Albanian clan to the Spatas, the Bua brothers Maurice and Dimo.{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=169–170}} In 1406, Carlo and the Bua brothers joined forces to raid and devastate [[Acarnania]] and the vicinity of Arta, but the city itself, stoutly defended by Maurice Spata, held out. At Angelokastron, however, Paul Spata, who lacked his father's ability, felt threatened by the Tocco advance and in 1406 called in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] assistance. The Ottoman army, under Yusuf Beg, was defeated, however, and the Turks departed after coming to terms with the Tocchi. As Maurice refused to come to his cousin's aid, Paul ceded Angelokastron to the Ottomans (only for Carlo Tocco to capture it within less than a year) and retired to Naupactus, which he sold to Venice in 1407–08.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=356}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=171–172}}

In order to contain Tocco, Maurice turned to his northern neighbour, the [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] of [[Ioannina]], [[Esau de' Buondelmonti]]. Relations between them were tense because Esau, who in 1396 had taken Maurice's mother Irene as his wife, had divorced her in 1402 to marry [[Eudokia Balšić]]. Nevertheless, the common threat brought the two together, and in ca. 1410, an alliance was concluded between them, sealed by the marriage of Maurice's daughter to Esau's son, [[Giorgio de' Buondelmonti|Giorgio]].{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=173–174}} The war between Maurice and Carlo Tocco was a war of raids and counter-raids, punctuated by battles that ended now in defeat and now in victory, with intermittent truces sealed by marriage alliances, such as when Charles Marchesano was wed to a natural daughter of Carlo Tocco.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}} It was on the occasion of the latter, which was held at Rogoi, that Maurice and his guests were informed of Esau's death on 6 February 1411. This event triggered a contest between Tocco and the Albanian lords to secure possession of Ioannina, left in the hands of the infant Giorgio and his mother, for themselves. The major role in subsequent developments was played by the inhabitants of Ioannina themselves, who soon deposed Eudokia Balšić and Giorgio. Allied with the lord of [[Gjirokastër]], [[Gjon Zenebishi]], Maurice unsuccessfully besieged the Epirote capital twice and plundered its environs. The Ioannites, who utterly opposed the idea of having an Albanian or Serbian ruler over them, opted to surrender their city to Tocco instead, who entered the city in triumph on 1 April.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=175–177}}

This event consolidated the pact between Maurice and Zenebishi, which was further confirmed by another marriage alliance between Maurice's daughter and Zenebishi's son Simon. The two Albanian lords were willing to negotiate with Tocco, but the latter, buoyed by his success, launched raids against both their territories. As a result, Maurice and Zenebishi sent appeals to their clansmen, and a large Albanian army met and almost annihilated the Tocco army at a battle fought at Kranea in the district of [[Mesopotamon]], in spring or summer 1412. The victorious Albanians marched to the walls of Ioannina, but were again unable to take the city.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=179–180}} In late 1412 or early 1413, Carlo Tocco was forced to turn to the Turks for support, arranging for the marriage of one of his natural daughters with [[Musa Çelebi]], one of the Ottoman princes contending for the sultanate during the [[Ottoman Interregnum]]. The alliance eased Tocco's position, but Musa was defeated and killed later in the year by his brother, [[Mehmed I]].{{sfn|Nicol|2010|p=181}} At the same time, Maurice concluded an alliance to Tocco's Italian rival in the [[Morea]], the [[Prince of Achaea]] [[Centurione II Zaccaria]].{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}} Maurice's half-brother Charles, who had been appointed governor of Rhiniasa, tried to go over to Tocco, but was apprehended by the local magnates and handed over to Maurice.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}} A scandal involving Zenebishi's son and a son-in-law of Maurice led to a quarrel between the two Albanian rulers and the collapse of their alliance. Tocco moved quickly to win over Zenebishi and conclude peace with him.{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}} Maurice died in 1414 or 1415,{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}} and was succeeded by his full brother, [[Yaqub Spata]], in Arta, while Charles Marchesano was given the governorship of Rogoi. Maurice's successors proved unable to withstand Tocco's assaults, however, and in October 1416, Yaqub was captured and killed in an ambush. Arta surrendered, ending the era of Albanian rule in the area.{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=185–187}}

== Issue ==
From his marriage to Nerata, a Serbian woman, Maurice is known to have had a number of unnamed daughters, usually considered to have been three:{{sfn|PLP|1991|loc=26524. Σπάτας Μουρίκης}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|p=255}}
* a daughter who married [[Giorgio de' Buondelmonti]]
* a daughter who married [[Simon Zenevisi]], lord of Strovilo
* a daughter who married, after Maurice's death, [[Carlo II Tocco]]

The first daughter is believed by Karl Krumbacher to have married ''Giorgio'', a son of &quot;[[George Balšić]] and Eudokia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krumbacher1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Krumbacher|title=Byzantinische Zeitschrift|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe5YAAAAMAAJ|year=1988|publisher=C.
