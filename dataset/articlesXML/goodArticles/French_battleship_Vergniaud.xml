'''''Vergniaud'''''  was one of the six {{sclass|Danton|battleship|4}} [[semi-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built for the [[French Navy]] in the late 1900s. When [[World War I]] began in August 1914, she unsuccessfully searched for the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}} in the Western Mediterranean and escorted convoys. Later that month, the ship participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]] and helped to sink an [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[protected cruiser]]. ''Vergniaud'' spent most of the rest of the war blockading the [[Straits of Otranto]] and the [[Dardanelles]] to prevent German, Austro-Hungarian and Turkish warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean.

She briefly participated in the [[occupation of Constantinople]] after the end of the war and was deployed in the [[Black Sea]] in early 1919 during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. The ship's crew [[mutiny|mutinied]] after one of its members was killed when a protest against intervention against the [[Bolshevik]]s was bloodily suppressed. ''Vergniaud'' returned to France and was later placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] after a brief deployment in the Eastern Mediterranean. She was condemned in 1921 and used as a [[target ship]] until 1926. The ship was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] two years later.

==Design and description==
Although the {{sclass|Danton|battleship|6}}s were a significant improvement from the preceding {{Sclass|Liberté|battleship|4}}, they were outclassed by the advent of the [[dreadnought]] well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal they had to carry, made them rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=gg6&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vergniaud'' was {{convert|146.6|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|25.8|m|sp=us|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.2|m|sp=us|ftin}}. She displaced {{convert|19736|MT|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]] and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s using steam generated by twenty-six [[Niclausse boiler]]s. The turbines were rated at {{convert|22500|shp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of around {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=gg6/&gt; ''Vergniaud'' reached a top speed of {{convert|19.7|kn|lk=in}} on her [[sea trial]]s.&lt;ref name=g0/&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|2027|t|LT}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|3370|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=gg6/&gt;

''Vergniaud''{{'}}s main battery consisted of four [[305mm/45 Modèle 1906 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve [[240mm/50 Modèle 1902 gun]]s in twin turrets, three on each side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included sixteen {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} L/65 guns and ten {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. The ship was also armed with two submerged {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The ship's [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] was {{convert|270|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor. The [[conning tower]] also had 300&amp;nbsp;mm thick sides.&lt;ref name=gg6/&gt;

===Wartime modifications===
During the war 75&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the ship's two forward 240&amp;nbsp;mm gun turrets.&lt;ref name=m5&gt;Meirat, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; During 1918, the mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive [[kite balloon]] and the elevation of the 240&amp;nbsp;mm guns was increased which extended their range to {{convert|18000|m|yd|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=gg6/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Cuirassé Vergniaud (classe Danton).jpg|thumb| ''Vergniaud'' in Toulon, May 1914.]]
Construction of ''Vergniaud'' was begun on 26 December 1906&lt;ref name=g0&gt;Gille, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde]] in [[Bordeaux]] and the ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on November 1907. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 April 1909 and was completed on 18 December 1911&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; at cost of 55,247,307 [[French franc|francs]].&lt;ref name=m5/&gt; The ship was assigned to the First Division of the First Squadron (''escadre'') of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Fleet]] when she was commissioned. The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between [[Provence]] and [[Tunisia]] in May–June 1913&lt;ref name=g8&gt;Gille, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent [[Review (disambiguation)|naval review]] conducted by the [[President of France]], [[Raymond Poincaré]] on 7 June 1913.&lt;ref name=m5/&gt; Afterwards, ''Vergniaud'' joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October–December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914.&lt;ref name=g8/&gt;

===World War I===
At the beginning of the war, the ship, together with her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|French battleship|Condorcet||2}} and the dreadnought {{ship|French battleship|Courbet||2}}, unsuccessfully searched for the German battlecruiser ''Goeben'' and the light cruiser ''Breslau'' in the [[Balearic Islands]]. She later escorted troop convoys from North Africa to France before she joined her sisters&lt;ref&gt;Gille, pp. 118, 120&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Malta]]. On 16 August 1914 the combined [[wikt:Anglo-French|Anglo-French]] Fleet under Admiral [[Auguste Boué de Lapeyrère]], including ''Vergniaud'', made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea. The Allied ships encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Zenta}}, escorted by the [[destroyer]] {{SMS|Ulan}}, blockading the coast of [[Montenegro]]. There were too many ships for ''Zenta'' to escape, so she remained behind to allow ''Ulan'' to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of [[Bar, Montenegro]]. ''Vergniaud'' was one of the ships that bombarded [[Cattaro]] on 1 September and blockaded the Strait of Otranto for the rest of the year and through August 1915. She was based at Malta and [[Bizerte]] until February 1916 when she sailed to Toulon.&lt;ref name=m5/&gt;

''Vergniaud'' was transferred to the Second Squadron on 27 March 1916 and resumed her former duties of blockading the Strait of Otranto from bases in [[Argostoli]] and [[Corfu]] for most of the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=m5/&gt;&lt;ref name=g8/&gt; The ship transferred some of her men to her sister {{ship|French battleship|Mirabeau||2}} that participated in the [[Noemvriana|Allied attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence]] to [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Allied operations in Macedonia]] in [[Athens]] on 1 December 1916. The [[lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in charge of her landing party was killed as were several other men during the incident.&lt;ref name=m5/&gt; She was given a short refit at Toulon from 9 November 1917 to January 1918 and returned to Corfu. ''Vergniaud'' was transferred to [[Mudros]] in May to prevent ''Goeben'' from breaking out into the Mediterranean. A [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]] burst on 14 September, killing four men and wounding nine others. After the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October between the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], the ship participated in the early stage of the [[occupation of Constantinople]]. She returned to Toulon on 17 December for a short refit.&lt;ref name=m6&gt;Meirat, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar career===
In early 1919, ''Vergniaud'' was among the ships stationed off [[Sevastopol]] as an Allied deterrent to [[USSR|Soviet]] forces who were encroaching on the city during the [[Russian civil war]]. Despite Allied support, the city's [[White movement|White Russian]] forces were in a seemingly hopeless position, and in April 1919 the French naval high command ordered the ships to evacuate. Rejecting this, the commander of the Second Squadron, [[Vice-Admiral]] (''vice-amiral'') [[Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet]], attempted to have his forces intervene in the fighting, only to have a mutiny erupt on several of his ships. War-weary sailors demanded to return home and the ensuing standoff culminated in a mass shooting of sailor demonstrators. Fifteen people were wounded, but only one died, a sailor from ''Vergniaud''. The battleship's crew had thus far remained neutral in the conflict but quickly joined the ranks of the most radical mutineers, unfurling red banners in support of the [[Bolshevik]] forces. The four-day stalemate ended in a victory for the sailors: the ships withdrew from the Black Sea and ''Vergniaud'' returned to France.&lt;ref name=BellElleman&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell|first=C. |author2=Elleman, B. |title=Naval Mutinies of the Twentieth Century: An International Perspective |pages=90–92 |year=2003|publisher=Cass|location=London |isbn= 0-7146-8468-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWcY7Pzq8M8C&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=battleship%20Vergniaud&amp;pg=PA90#v |accessdate=5 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship departed on 29 April, towing the merchant ship {{SS|Jerusalem}} to Constantinople.&lt;ref name=m6&gt;Meirat, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vergniaud'' was based in [[Beirut]] from May to August 1919 to monitor Turkish activities off the coasts of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. She arrived in Toulon on 6 September and was placed in special reserve on 1 October. This ship was later found to be in poor shape, decommissioned in June 1921 and condemned on 27 October. She was disarmed in 1922 and her 240mm guns handed over for coastal defence, nine being installed around [[Dakar]], some still existing there.{{sfn|Dumas &amp; Prévoteaux|p=107}}

''Vergniaud'' became a target ship and was used to evaluate the effects of poison gases and bombs until 1926. She was listed for disposal on 5 May 1927 and was sold for breaking up on 27 November 1928 for the price of 5,623,123 francs.&lt;ref name=m6/&gt; A monument to the French mutineers of 1919 was erected by the Soviets in Sevastopol, at Morskaïa Square where ''Vergniaud''{{'}}s sailor was killed.&lt;ref name=BellElleman/&gt;
