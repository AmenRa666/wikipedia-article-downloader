'''No. 82 Wing''' is the [[bomber|strike]] and [[reconnaissance]] [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). It is headquartered at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland. Coming under the control of [[Air Combat Group RAAF|Air Combat Group]], the wing operates [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornet]] multirole fighters and [[Pilatus PC-9]] [[forward air control]] aircraft.   Its units include [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;1]] and [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|6 Squadrons]], operating the Super Hornet, and [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron]], operating the PC-9.

Formed in August 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing operated [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] heavy bombers in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Initially comprising two flying units, [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;21]] and [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|24 Squadrons]], the wing was augmented by [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|23 Squadron]] in 1945.  After the war its operational units became Nos.&amp;nbsp;1, [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|2]] and 6 Squadrons. It re-equipped with [[Avro Lincoln]]s in 1948 and, from 1953, [[English Electric Canberra]] jets. Both types saw action in the [[Malayan Emergency]] during the 1950s; the Canberras were also deployed in the [[Vietnam War]] from 1967 to 1971.

Between 1970 and 1973, as a stop-gap pending delivery of the long-delayed [[General Dynamics F-111C]] [[Variable-sweep wing|swing-wing]] bomber, Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4E Phantoms]]. No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron continued to fly Canberras until it was disbanded in 1982. After taking delivery of their F-111Cs in 1973, Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 6 Squadrons operated the type for 37 years through numerous upgrades, augmented in the mid-1990s by ex-[[United States Air Force|USAF]] G&amp;nbsp;models. The forward air control unit joined No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing in 2002. In 2010, the wing retired its F-111s and replaced them with Super Hornets as an interim force until the planned entry into Australian service of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35 Lightning&amp;nbsp;II]] Joint Strike Fighter. Twelve [[Boeing EA-18G Growler]]s are scheduled to augment the Super Hornet fleet from 2017.

No. 82 (Heavy Bomber) Wing—the RAAF's first such wing—was formed at [[Ballarat]], Victoria, on 25&amp;nbsp;August 1944, under the command of [[Group Captain]] Deryck Kingwell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelmes91&quot;&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Comprising [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;21]] and [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|24 Squadrons]], both equipped with [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]], the wing became operational on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1945. By this time it was headquartered in the [[Northern Territory]], and came under the control of the RAAF's [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area Command]] (NWA). Based at [[Fenton Airfield]], the wing's aircraft sank seven Japanese ships in the [[Dutch East Indies]] during March.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 400–404]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6&amp;nbsp;April, all available Liberators joined [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchells]] of [[No. 79 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing]] in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser ''[[Japanese cruiser Isuzu|Isuzu]]''. Anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, as well as attacks by enemy fighters, resulted in the loss of two Liberators, and the crews' standard of aerial gunnery was criticised afterwards. Allied submarines sank the damaged ''Isuzu'' the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 405–409]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;23 Squadron]], having recently converted to Liberators from [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|A-31 Vengeances]], was added to No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing's strength.&lt;ref&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt; The wing's three flying squadrons identified themselves with black chevrons on the tail fins of their aircraft, No.&amp;nbsp;21's facing backwards, No.&amp;nbsp;23's downwards, and No.&amp;nbsp;24's forwards.&lt;ref&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing's Liberators played both a tactical and a strategic role in the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]], beginning with the lead-up to Operation Oboe One, the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]] on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1945. During that month a detachment relocated from Fenton to [[Morotai]], attacking targets in [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] and [[Balikpapan]] prior to Operation Oboe Six, the [[Battle of North Borneo|invasion of Labuan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelmes&quot;&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', pp. 110–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 468]&lt;/ref&gt; In June, while the final Allied offensive of the Borneo Campaign got under way as Operation Oboe Two, the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Battle of Balikpapan]], the remainder of No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing transferred from NWA to the command of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] in Morotai.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 477–479]&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the month the wing dropped 120 tons of bombs on Balikpapan's oil fields and surrounding areas, as well as coastal defence sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelmes&quot;/&gt; During July it bombed targets at Celebes and [[Borneo]], losing five Liberators for the month, including that of its new commanding officer, Group Captain Donald McLean. McLean died with most of his crew after being hit by anti-aircraft fire and ditching into the sea, a notoriously risky operation in the Liberator owing to the fuselage's tendency to break in two upon striking the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers483&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/29.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 483–487]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the end of hostilities in the Pacific, the recently established garrison headquarters [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group]] unofficially directed the wing's operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers483&quot;/&gt; Following the Japanese surrender in September 1945, No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing's Liberators were converted to transports and used to repatriate RAAF personnel from the South West Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/30.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 495]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of its wartime existence, the wing's personnel numbered between 3,000 and 5,000, of whom more than half were ground crew. Along with its flying squadrons, its complement included No.&amp;nbsp;24 Air Stores Park, No.&amp;nbsp;6 Repair and Servicing Unit, and No.&amp;nbsp;30 Medical Clearing Station.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelmes91&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Forgotten Air Force'', p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

No. 82 Wing moved to its present location at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, in 1946, where it came under the control of the RAAF's [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area Command]].&lt;ref&gt;Air Power Development Centre, &quot;Superbase #1: RAAF Amberley Past to Future&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Highest Traditions'', pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; In May that year, [[No. 482 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;482 (Maintenance) Squadron]] was formed from No.&amp;nbsp;4 Repair and Servicing Unit, to be responsible for repair and upkeep of the wing's aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; Its flying complement now included [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;12]] (formerly of [[No. 85 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;85 Wing]]), 21, and 23 Squadrons, but these were renumbered [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;1]], [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|2]] and [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|6 Squadrons]] respectively in February 1948. At the same time, the wartime Liberators were replaced by [[Avro Lincoln]] heavy bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A73.htm |title=Avro Lincoln|publisher= [[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Nelmes, ''Tocumwal to Tarakan'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; During 1949–50, some of the Lincolns were specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation to participate in Operation Cumulative, a joint program with the [[Royal Air Force]] gathering long-range navigation and bombing data for use in potential air campaigns against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 445–449&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950 and 1958—for the first two years under the control of [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing]]—the Lincolns of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron were deployed for service in the [[Malayan Emergency]], tasked with the prime responsibility for the Commonwealth's bombing campaign against Communist insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11019malayan_emergency.asp |title=1 Squadron RAAF|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement meant that No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing's flying units were reduced to Nos.&amp;nbsp;2 and 6 Squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Highest Traditions'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 to 1957, the wing flew observation flights in connection with [[Operation Hurricane|British atomic tests in Australia]]. No protective clothing was issued to air or ground crews during these flights and, following the second such operation in October 1953, nine of the twelve Lincolns involved were found to be contaminated, four so heavily that they were parked in a remote corner of the Amberley air base and never flown again.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', pp. 55–61&lt;/ref&gt; On 9&amp;nbsp;April 1953, the wing wrote off three Lincolns—without loss of life—in two separate incidents that collectively became known as &quot;Black Thursday&quot;; one of the Lincolns crashed on landing at Amberley during the day, and that night another Lincoln collided with one of its brethren at [[Cloncurry Airport|Cloncurry Aerodrome]], Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1953, No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing took delivery of the RAAF's first jet bomber, the [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra Mk.20]], 48 of which re-equipped the wing's three squadrons over the next five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canberra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A84.htm |title=Canberra|publisher= RAAF Museum|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new bombers were acquired partly for their capacity to deliver [[nuclear weapon]]s, an ordnance option the RAAF seriously investigated but never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', pp. 108–109, 148–149&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the re-equipping of Nos.&amp;nbsp;2 and 6 Squadrons with the Canberra, a [[Lincoln Conversion Flight RAAF|Lincoln Conversion Flight]] was formed in July 1955 under No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing to provide training on the older bomber for crews preparing to deploy to Malaya for service with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron; it disbanded in March 1956.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Canberras from No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron relieved the Lincolns of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in Malaya during 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1959, [[No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Bomber) Operational Conversion Unit]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;OCU) was established at Amberley under the control of No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing. Its role was to convert pilots and navigators to the Canberra, and train them for operations with the three bomber squadrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing's Canberras were slated for possible bombing and reconnaissance tasks against Indonesian forces under Operation Handover, a little-publicised contingency plan put into effect during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia–Malaysia ''Konfrontasi'']], although no combat ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j37/darwin.htm |title=Operation Handover&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, September 1964|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron Canberras saw extensive action in the [[Vietnam War]] from 1967 to 1971, under the control of the [[United States Air Force|USAF's]] [[35th Fighter Wing|35th Tactical Fighter Wing]]. The Canberras flew almost 12,000 sorties and delivered over 76,000 pounds of bombs, for the loss of two aircraft to enemy action, and gained a high reputation for their accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 271–273&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;OCU was made independent of No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing in April 1968; its sole purpose from then until its disbandment in June 1971 was to supply trained crews to No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations in 1968, while their crews underwent conversion to the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] [[Variable-sweep wing|swing-wing]] bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1973, as an [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in Australian service|interim measure]] pending the delayed delivery of the F-111, Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4E Phantom]]s; meanwhile No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron continued to operate the Canberra, mainly for aerial survey work in Australia and Indonesia, until disbanding in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canberra&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/raafmuseum/research/units/2sqn.htm |title=No 2 Squadron|publisher= RAAF Museum|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force retained the option to purchase the Phantoms if the F-111C program was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Air Power Development Centre, &quot;Phantoms of the Past&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and was highly regarded by its RAAF crews.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 387–388&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 1973, the Officer Commanding No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing, Group Captain [[Jake Newham]], led the first F-111Cs in to land at Amberley, a gala occasion attended by the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], [[Lance Barnard]], the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]], the Air Officer Commanding [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]], Air Vice Marshal [[Brian Eaton]], and a large media contingent.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Read ordered Newham to operate the F-111 with great caution initially, well within limits, lest the controversial aircraft suffer greater damage to its reputation through early attrition.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Over its 37-year career with No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing, the F-111 underwent numerous upgrades, including the [[Pave Tack]] infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system, [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon]] anti-shipping missiles, and advanced digital [[avionics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F-111&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A8.htm|title= General Dynamics F-111|publisher= RAAF Museum|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles within the wing were demarcated such that No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron was the lead strike unit, while No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron was primarily tasked with  [[Operational conversion unit|crew conversion training]]; No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron was also responsible for reconnaissance missions using specially modified RF-111Cs until these aircraft were transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in 1996, and flew leased [[Learjet]]s for survey work in 1982–87.&lt;ref name=&quot;F-111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather34&quot;&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1982–83, four F-111s from the RAAF's original order that had been lost through accidents were replaced by four [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111As]] upgraded to C&amp;nbsp;models.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 an order was placed to augment the F-111C force with fifteen ex-USAF G&amp;nbsp;models, to be operated by No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;F-111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather34&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing was awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]] as most proficient RAAF unit of 1994, in part for its success in introducing the F-111G with minimal additional staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=RAAF News |volume=37 |issue=8|date=September 1995|title=Proficient 82WG proves its performance|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, described the F-111 as &quot;the region's pre-eminent strike aircraft&quot; and the RAAF's most important acquisition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt; The closest the bombers came to being used in anger, however, was during the Australian-led [[INTERFET]] intervention into [[East Timor]] in September 1999. Both F-111 squadrons were deployed to [[RAAF Base Tindal]], Northern Territory, to support the international forces, and remained there until December. From 20&amp;nbsp;September, when INTERFET began to arrive in East Timor, the aircraft were maintained at a high level of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. As it happened, INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance by the RF-111Cs from 5&amp;nbsp;November through 9&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Warden to Tanager'', pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;482 Squadron merged with Amberley's [[No. 3 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Aircraft Depot]] to form No.&amp;nbsp;501 Wing in March 1992.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', pp. 119–123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron completed its disbandment in June that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; In 1998 the RAAF became the only air force operating the F-111, after the USAF retired the type.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001, [[Boeing Australia]] performed all F-111 maintenance under contract.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing came under the control of the newly established [[Air Combat Group RAAF|Air Combat Group]] (ACG), formed by merging Tactical Fighter Group (TFG) and Strike Reconnaissance Group (SRG). The reorganisation altered the wing's responsibilities, as it transferred lead-in training for the F-111s to [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]] at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales, and put No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing in charge of the strike capability of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing's]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]] fighters, also based at Williamtown.

In 2007, the Australian government decided to retire all of the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornets]] as an interim replacement, pending the arrival of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35 Lightning&amp;nbsp;II]] JSF then under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=6619|title=Super Hornet Acquisition Contract Signed|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] |date=3 May 2007| accessdate= 16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smiles|first=Sarah|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/alp-to-stick-with-super-hornet-buy/2008/03/17/1205602291258.html|title=ALP to stick with Super Hornet buy|work=[[The Age]]|date=18 March 2008|accessdate= 16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk owing to fatigue issues, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPhedran|first=Ian|author-link=Ian McPhedran|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/f-111-the-raafs-white-elephant-in-the-sky/story-e6freuy9-1225757243738|title=F-111&amp;nbsp;– the RAAF's white elephant in the sky|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=3 August 2009|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing began re-equipping with the Super Hornet in 2010, and the last F-111s were retired on 3&amp;nbsp;December that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/global/Australia/PigsTales/default.html |title=Pigs' Tales: Official F-111 Retirement Events|publisher= [[Boeing]]|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; FACDU was combined with the RAAF Special Tactics Project in July 2009 to form [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Special Tactics people wanted|magazine=Air Force News|url= http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4913/topstories/story5.htm |date=26 July 2009|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing became home to [[No. 5 Flight RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Flight]], which was responsible for training personnel to operate the RAAF's two [[IAI Heron]] unmanned aerial vehicles based at [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aust_aviation_April10&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=McLaughlin|first=Andrew|date=April 2010|title=Nankeen: The RAAF enters the UAV era with Heron lease|magazine=Australian Aviation|publisher=Phantom Media|location=Fyshwick, Australian Capital Territory|issue= 270|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force acquired a third Heron in 2011, based in Australia and operated by No.&amp;nbsp;5 Flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;5FLT training down under&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Skye|title=5FLT training down under|url=http://digital.realviewtechnologies.com/default.aspx?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&amp;iid=48077&amp;startpage=22&amp;crd=0&amp;searchKey=5flt|accessdate=16 August 2012|magazine=Air Force|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of that year, the F-35 was not expected to enter Australian service until 2018.
