{{DYK talk|5 November|2016|entry= ... that the prototype '''[[Rogožarski IK-3]]''' ''(pictured)'' crashed during a test flight when its windscreen detached and half a wing broke off?|nompage=Template:Did you know nominations/Rogožarski IK-3}}

==Untitled==
I`d like to know about the plane`s wartime service. I have found that 6 of theese aircraft + IK-3b prototype (flown by Milisav Semiz) had claimed 14 German aircraft shot down during the 12-day April war (invasion of Yugoslavia). Any confirmations or denials? Has somebody got a German losses record for comparisson?

== Wing loading ==

Your wing loading has been calculated with the empty aircraft weight. No plane can fly empty, without the pilot and fuel and some ammunition may be useful as well. Please correct this. The loading has been in the 145kg/m² range. 
This is relevant to the maneuverability of the plane; an important number.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.181.17.208|85.181.17.208]] ([[User talk:85.181.17.208|talk]]) 11:42, 4 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Top speed ==

Top speed stated in the Specifications section seems simply wrong. For two reasons:
1. There is a reference to the following publication in both &quot;Design and Development&quot; section and and &quot;Specifications&quot;, with contradicting information:
Oštrić, Šime I.; Janić, Čedomir J. (1973). &quot;IK Fighters (Yugoslavia: 1930–40s)&quot;. In Cain, Charles W.; Windrow, Martin. Aircraft in Profile. 241–246 13. Windsor, Berkshire: Profile Publications. pp. 169–193. ISBN 0-85383-022-3
From &quot;Design and Development&quot; the top speed of the production model is stated as being 527 km/h (327 mph), for the production model:
&quot;The first six aircraft were delivered by late March 1940, but delivery of the rest of the order was not completed until July due to delays by foreign suppliers. The first production aircraft was delivered to the VVKJ Test Group where it was determined that the production aircraft were free of the issues evident in the prototype. The Test Group determined that the maximum speed, previously estimated at 540 km/h (340 mph), was actually 527 km/h (327 mph)&quot;
&quot;Specifications&quot; state :
Maximum speed: 421 km/h (262 mph; 227 kn)
2. 421 km/h is just way to low a top speed for a monoplane with 860hp engine, retractable gear, empty weight of 2,048 kg, and aerodynamic design that it had.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/95.180.66.155|95.180.66.155]] ([[User talk:95.180.66.155|talk]]) 08:21, 4 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The listed speed is the sea-level speed, perhaps it should be the maximum speed at height? [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 08:29, 4 March 2016 (UTC)
::Have substituted the max speed at height. No altitude is given. Thanks for picking up this error, sorry I was a bit abrupt when you first made the edit. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 01:55, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
Thank you for the correction. Most Wikipedia articles on aeroplanes, (and in aeronautics field in general) do silently imply that top speed is actually altitude maximum speed (it is the norm), so for the sake of comparison (and also, as speed was one of the crucial performance factors for fighters of that era) this has been an important edit.
:No worries. Regards, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 06:03, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
::Did a drive-by edit and altered maneuver to manoeuvre before realising it was my English spell-checker not a typo. Feel free to revert as desired. Regards [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 11:34, 17 July 2016 (UTC)
