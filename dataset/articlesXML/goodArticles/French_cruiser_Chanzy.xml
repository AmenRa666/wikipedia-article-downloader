'''''Chanzy''''' was an {{Sclass-|Amiral Charner|cruiser|0}} [[armored cruiser]] built for the French Navy in the 1890s. Upon completion, she served in the [[Mediterranean Squadron (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] and she was assigned to the [[International Squadron (Greco-Turkish War of 1897)|International Squadron]] off the island of [[Crete]] during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. The ship was in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] for several years in the middle of the first decade of the 20th century before she was transferred to [[French Indochina]] in 1906. ''Chanzy'' [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] off the Chinese coast in mid-1907, where she proved impossible to [[Marine salvage|refloat]] and was destroyed in place after her crew was rescued without loss.

==Design and description==
[[File:Amiral-Charner Brassey's1902.png|thumb|left|Line drawing from [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1902]]
The ''Amiral Charner''-class ships were designed to be smaller and cheaper than the preceding armored cruiser design, the {{ship|French cruiser|Dupuy de Lôme||2}}. Like the older ship, they were intended to fill the commerce-raiding strategy of the [[Jeune École]].&lt;ref&gt;Feron, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chanzy'' measured {{convert|106.12|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.04|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The ship had a forward [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|5.55|m|ftin|sp=us}} and drew {{convert|6.06|m|ftin|sp=us}} aft. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|4748|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load and {{convert|4990|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]].&lt;ref name=f8&gt;Feron, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Amiral Charner'' class had two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving a single [[propeller shaft]]. Steam for the engines was provided by 16 [[Belleville boiler]]s and they were rated at a total of {{convert|8300|PS|lk=on}} using [[Mechanical draft|forced draft]]. ''Amiral Charner'' had a designed speed of {{convert|19|knots|lk=in}} and carried up to {{convert|535|t|sp=us}} of coal that allowed her to steam for {{convert|4000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, pp. 15, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships of the ''Amiral Charner'' class had a [[Main battery|main armament]] that consisted of two  [[Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1887]] guns that were mounted in single [[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. Their secondary armament comprised six [[Canon de 138.6 mm Modèle 1887]] guns, each in single gun turrets on each [[broadside]]. For anti-[[torpedo boat]] defense, they carried four {{convert|65|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns, four {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} and eight {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} five-barreled revolving [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. They were also armed with four {{convert|450|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} pivoting [[torpedo tube]]s; two mounted on each broadside above water.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, pp. 11, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The side of the ''Amiral Charner'' class was generally protected by {{convert|92|mm|sp=us}} of steel armor, from {{convert|1.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} below the [[waterline]] to {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} above it. The bottom {{convert|20|cm|in|1|sp=us}} tapered in thickness and the armor at the ends of the ships thinned to {{convert|60|mm|sp=us}}. The curved protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] of [[mild steel]] had a thickness of {{convert|40|mm|sp=us}} along its centerline that increased to {{convert|50|mm|sp=us}} at its outer edges. Protecting the boiler rooms, engine rooms, and [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s below it was a thin splinter deck. A watertight internal [[cofferdam]], filled with cellulose, ran the length of the ship from the protective deck&lt;ref name=f3&gt;Feron, pp. 12, 15&lt;/ref&gt; to a height of {{convert|4|ft|m|1|disp=flip|sp=us}} above the waterline.&lt;ref name=ck4&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Below the protective deck the ship was divided by 13 watertight transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s with five more above it. The ship's [[conning tower]] and turrets were protected by 92 millimeters of armor.&lt;ref name=f3/&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Chanzy'', named after General [[Antoine Chanzy]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; was ordered from [[Chantiers et Ateliers de la Gironde]] on 18 December 1899 and [[keel laying|laid down]] the following month at their shipyard in [[Bordeaux]]. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 January 1894 and initially was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] for her [[sea trial]]s on 6 February. These began two days later and revealed so many problems with her engines and boilers that ''Chanzy'' was decommissioned for repairs on 6 December. Recommissioned on 1 May 1895 to test the repairs, she entered service on 20 July.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Light Division of the [[Mediterranean Squadron (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] before she was transferred to the 4th Light Division on 18 May 1896. ''Chanzy'' participated in the annual fleet maneuvers that summer before she was placed in reserve for repairs at Toulon in August. The ship began trials on 28 December before she was sent to Crete on 16 February 1897 as part of the French contingent of the International Squadron deployed there during the Greco-Turkish War to protect Western interests and citizens. She remained with the squadron until 25 February 1898. Upon arriving in France, ''Chanzy'' was assigned to the reserve squadron and did little for the rest of the year other than participate in the annual naval maneuvers.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1899 the ship was reassigned to the 1st Light Division and her most notable activities for the year were visits to the [[Balearic Islands]] and ports in the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Middle East]]. Her main steam pipe fractured on 20 February and injured three crewmen. ''Chanzy'' was repaired in time to participate in the annual maneuvers and spent three weeks in September attached to the elderly gunnery ship {{ship|French ironclad|Couronne||2}} before making a cruise to [[French North Africa]]. The ship began a brief deployment to the [[Levant]] on 1 February 1901 and returned on 4 April for the annual maneuvers before returning to the Levant on 30 October. She arrived back at Toulon on 1 February 1902 and began a long period of relative inactivity that lasted until she was formally placed in reserve when the new armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Marseillaise|1900|2}} replaced her in the squadron in May 1904.&lt;ref name=f4&gt;Feron, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chanzy'' was recommissioned on 15 September 1906 for service with the Far Eastern Squadron and departed on 15 November. She arrived at [[Saigon]], French Indochina, on 10 January 1907 and visited Hong Kong and ports in China, and Japan in April and May. While departing from Shanghai on 20 May in thick fog, she ran aground on rocks off Ballard Island in the [[Chusan Islands]]. Her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French cruiser|Bruix||2}} and the [[protected cruiser]]s {{ship|French cruiser|D'Entrecasteaux||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Alger||2}} attempted to pull her off, but could not do so in the heavy seas.&lt;ref name=f4/&gt; Her crew remained aboard attempting to get her off until they were evacuated without loss on 1 June when the ship began to [[wikt:founder|founder]]&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes''&lt;/ref&gt; and the wreck was demolished by the other cruisers on 12 June.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;
