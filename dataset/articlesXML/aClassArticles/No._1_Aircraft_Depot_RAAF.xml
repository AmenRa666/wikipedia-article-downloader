'''No. 1 Aircraft Depot''' (No.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;AD) was a maintenance unit of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).  Formed in July 1921 at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, it moved to the nearby [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Laverton]] in March 1926. As well as servicing aircraft and other equipment, in its early years the depot supported survey flights in Australia and the Pacific region. Its strength increased from 350 staff in the 1930s to over 2,000 during World War&amp;nbsp;II, when it assembled, tested and repaired aircraft ranging from [[De Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moths]] to [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] to [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]]. The depot also engaged in aircraft research and development. Shortly after the war it introduced the first jets into RAAF service. In 1961, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD ceased airframe maintenance, but continued to service aero engines. By the 1970s its main focus was ground-based equipment, though it still handled some aircraft components. The depot was disbanded in December 1994, its functions having been taken over by other units and private contractors. At the time of its disbandment, it was the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation.

==History==

===Pre-war years===
No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot (No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD) was one of the first units formed by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) after the new service was established (as the Australian Air Force) on 31&amp;nbsp;March 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070474--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt;  The original components of No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD became known as such in April 1921, though the unit did not formally come into existence until July.&lt;ref name=Clark41&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this it comprised two elements in [[Melbourne]], one at [[Spotswood, Victoria|Spotswood]] handling the equipment of the [[Imperial Gift]] (128 surplus aircraft and associated spare parts donated by Great Britain following the end of World War&amp;nbsp;I), and another at [[Fitzroy North, Victoria|North Fitzroy]] responsible for motor vehicle repair.&lt;ref name=Clark41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; When No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD was officially established at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, on 1&amp;nbsp;July, the Spotswood component was dissolved, while North Fitzroy continued to operate as a detachment. The unit's inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]], who was in overall charge of Point Cook.&lt;ref name=Clark41/&gt;

In January 1922 the depot was organised into a headquarters with stores, aircraft repair, and engine repair sections. The vehicle repair section at North Fitzroy was transferred to Point Cook that April.&lt;ref name=Clark41/&gt; Point Cook's corrosive seaside atmosphere was however deemed an unsuitable long-term location for aircraft maintenance; the base also lacked railway infrastructure, necessary for transporting large aircraft parts.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1921, the government purchased land at [[Laverton, Victoria|Laverton]], near a railway station {{convert|8| km|mi|abbr=off|spell=on|round=5}} inland from Point Cook, for the express purpose of constructing a dedicated home for No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD as the &quot;warehouse of the Air Force&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The depot, staffed by eight officers and seventy-seven other ranks, relocated to the [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|new base]] on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1926.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; It occupied a large hangar that included an administration block, which along with living quarters and ancillary buildings had cost [[Australian pound|£]]300,000 to build.&lt;ref name=Bases&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', pp. 141–143&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P01817.004SeaGullA9-5.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.38|alt=Single-engined military biplane on floats landing in ocean and trailing heavy wake, three-quarters overhead|Supermarine Seagull of the Papuan Survey Flight]]
As well as receiving, assembling, testing and maintaining RAAF equipment, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD was responsible for supporting research flights.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;  In July 1927, it was the departure point for the Northern Survey Flight, comprising a [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland DH.50]] and two [[Airco DH.9]]s, which reconnoitred air routes and landing grounds in [[Northern Australia|northern]] and [[central Australia]] under the command of the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Wing Commander [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 392–393&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD formed the Papuan Survey Flight, consisting of two [[Supermarine Seagull (1921)|Supermarine Seagull&amp;nbsp;III]] amphibious biplanes under the command of Flight Lieutenant [[Ellis Wackett]], which photographed the [[Territory of Papua|Papuan]] and [[New Guinea]]n coasts as far north as [[Aitape]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 412–413&lt;/ref&gt; Wing Commander Bill Anderson returned to command the depot from April to August 1929, handing over to Wing Commander [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], who served in the post until December 1932.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

By the mid-1930s, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD comprised some 350 staff, servicing a range of aircraft that included the [[Westland Wapiti]], [[Bristol Bulldog]], [[Hawker Demon]], [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]], [[Avro 643 Cadet|Avro Cadet]], [[Avro Anson]], and [[North American NA-16]].&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; The NA-16 was later augmented by the purchase of the more advanced [[North American NA-33]], which was licensed and built in Australia by the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] as the [[CAC Wirraway]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 274–280&lt;/ref&gt; To cope with a new policy to rapidly expand the RAAF, a Recruit Training Section, incorporating the nascent School of Armaments and Signals, was formed under the depot's auspices by Flight Lieutenant [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]] on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1935; it was reorganised as Recruit Training Squadron on 1&amp;nbsp;September 1936.&lt;ref name=Clark131&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Training80&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD also commenced formal training courses for aircraft [[Fitter (occupation)|fitters]] and [[Rigger (industry)|riggers]] in 1935, leading to the formation of No.&amp;nbsp;1 School of Technical Training five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4422/topstories/story37.htm|work=Air Force|volume=44|issue=22|date=21 November 2002|title=Proud history continues|last=Eaton|first=Mark|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1935, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD's workshops, under the command Squadron Leader [[Arthur William Murphy|Arthur Murphy]], specially modified a Wapiti and a [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Gipsy Moth]] for [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] conditions, to enable an Air Force team led by Flight Lieutenant (later [[Group Captain]]) Eric Douglas and Flying Officer [[Alister Murdoch]] to rescue explorer [[Lincoln Ellsworth]], who was presumed lost on a journey across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 275, 419–420&lt;/ref&gt; On 3&amp;nbsp;May 1937, Recruit Training Squadron acquired a new sub-unit, the Communications and Survey Flight, utilising [[Tugan Gannet]]s and Dragon Rapides for ongoing photographic survey work; the squadron was re-formed as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Recruit Depot on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1940.&lt;ref name=Training80/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; Coupled with its aircraft assembly and test facilities, the recruit training unit made Laverton an obvious choice for the establishment of future RAAF squadrons.&lt;ref name=Clark131/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD's commanding officers during this decade included Wing Commanders [[Frank McNamara (VC)|Frank McNamara]] (February 1933 to April 1936), [[Frank Lukis]] (April 1936 to January 1938), and Arthur Murphy (January 1938 to May 1940).&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

===World War II===

Although many squadrons were raised at RAAF Station Laverton during World War&amp;nbsp;II, the base's prime focus continued to be its aircraft depot.&lt;ref name=Bases/&gt; Following the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD began expanding to handle the RAAF's growing number of training and combat aircraft, among them the Wirraway, [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]], [[Lockheed Hudson]], [[Hawker Hurricane]], and [[Curtiss P-40 variants|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk]]. The depot assembled and tested new aircraft, and ferried them to operational areas such as northern Australia and New Guinea. It was also responsible for the maintenance of in-service aircraft, including their engines, instruments, and armament. As well as RAAF equipment, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD repaired battle-damaged US aircraft such as [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]].&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

In March 1940, the RAAF began dividing Australia and New Guinea into [[RAAF area commands|geographically based command-and-control zones]]; No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD came under the auspices of [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area Command]], headquartered in Melbourne, which was responsible for RAAF units located in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name=Gillison91&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 91–92]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The depot spawned Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 2&amp;nbsp;Aircraft Parks, which were dedicated to aircraft assembly, in April–May 1940, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Replenishing Unit, which was responsible for the upkeep of ordnance and ammunition at units in Southern Area, in June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Logistics Units'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In October that year, control of No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD was transferred from Southern Area Command to the recently formed [[No. 4 Maintenance Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Maintenance Group]], also headquartered in Melbourne, which took over responsibility for maintenance units in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 479]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Area Headquarters, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD undertook research and development on various aircraft types, including [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s, [[CAC Boomerang]]s, and [[CAC Woomera|Wackett Woomeras]]. It also ran comparative performance studies on Spitfires, Boomerangs, Kittyhawks, [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster Buffalos]], and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zeros]].&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; In the case of the Boomerang, 105 CA-12 models were delivered to No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD for testing between July 1942 and June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Wirraway, Boomerang and CA-15'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the aircraft began arriving, the depot commenced handling and armament trials that continued for six months, identifying and overcoming such issues as the aircraft's guns freezing at high altitudes, and unusual levels of [[carbon monoxide]] in the cockpit.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, ''Wirraway, Boomerang and CA-15'', pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; Fighter aces [[Alan Rawlinson]] and [[Wilfred Arthur]], along with a [[United States Army Air Forces]] pilot, conducted comparative trials between a Boomerang, a Kittyhawk, a Buffalo, and a [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|Bell Airacobra]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Wirraway, Boomerang and CA-15'', pp. 90–91, pp. 114–119&lt;/ref&gt; The depot began despatching the Boomerangs to their operational units in March 1943, and the following month performance tested a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] version of the CA-14, though this model never entered production.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Wirraway, Boomerang and CA-15'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD's Special Duties and Performance Flight was responsible for conducting performance trials during the early war years; in December 1943 it became a separate organisation, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Performance Unit, which would evolve into the [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|Aircraft Research and Development Unit]] (ARDU) in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the depot's wartime commanding officers was Wing Commander [[John Lerew]], who held the post from December 1942 until November 1943.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; During his tenure, after investigating the crash of a [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]], he designed a clip to prevent the accidental release of the pilot's safety harness, which was later adopted for all such harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, ''We Who Are About to Die'', pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1945, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD's strength had increased to its highest level of 2,339 staff.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;

===Post-war years===

After the war, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD was responsible for introducing the first jets into RAAF service.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; A [[Gloster Meteor]] jet made its first flight in Australia from Laverton in 1946. By May 1947, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD had assembled the first [[de Havilland Vampire]] jet in Australia for its maiden flight.&lt;ref name=Bases/&gt; In October the same year, the first helicopter in RAAF service, a [[Sikorsky H-5|Sikorsky S-51]], arrived at the depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A80.htm |title= Sikorsky S51|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD also completed fitting out a [[Douglas Dakota]] with an office, a lounge suite,  and a kitchenette for service as the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General's]] VIP transport, operated out of Laverton by No.&amp;nbsp;1 Communication Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36004156 |title=Governor-General's Plane Ready For Service |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=11 October 1947 |accessdate=30 July 2016 |page=1 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the depot received the sole high-performance piston-engined [[CAC CA-15]] to be built, which had been sent to be &quot;converted to components&quot; (scrapped).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Wirraway, Boomerang and CA-15'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD took delivery of the first Australian-built [[English Electric Canberra]] jet bomber in July 1953.&lt;ref name=Bases/&gt; Shortly afterwards, it modified the three Canberras of [[No. 1 Long Range Flight RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight]] prior to the unit taking part in the [[1953 London to Christchurch air race|1953 London-to-Christchurch air race]].&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In September that year, the first Australian-built [[CAC Sabre|Sabre]] jet fighter was delivered.&lt;ref name=Bases/&gt;

As part of the RAAF's reorganisation from a geographically based command-and-control system to one based on function, No.&amp;nbsp;4 Maintenance Group was superseded by [[RAAF Maintenance Command|Maintenance Command]] on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=23|title=RAAF abandoned area command system|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/AgencyDetail.aspx?reg_no=CA%208690&amp;singleRecord=T|title=RAAF Headquarters No. 4 Maintenance Group, Melbourne|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1959, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD came under the control of [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]], formed when Maintenance Command was amalgamated with [[RAAF Training Command|Training Command]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Between June 1950 and October 1960, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD maintained a detachment at [[RAAF Station Tocumwal]], New South Wales, to store obsolete aircraft awaiting disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136940932 |title=Closure of air force base to-day |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Australian Capital Territory |date=14 October 1960 |accessdate=30 July 2016 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/media/pressrel/HPR10006911/upload_binary/HPR10006911.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22media/pressrel/HPR10006911%22|last=Osborne|first=Frederick|authorlink=Frederick Osborne|title=Closing down of two RAAF bases|date=29 February 1960|publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1961, when all airframe maintenance at Laverton was transferred to [[No. 2 Aircraft Depot RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;2]] and [[No. 3 Aircraft Depot RAAF|3 Aircraft Depots]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD were closed down in 1968.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; Staff were transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;3 Aircraft Depot at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, to prepare for the introduction of the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Bases Williamtown]], Amberley, [[RAAF Base Townsville|Townsville]], [[RAAF Base Darwin|Darwin]] and [[RAAF Base Pearce|Pearce]]), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).&lt;ref name=1AD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/AgencyDetail.aspx?reg_no=CA%201108&amp;singleRecord=T|title=RAAF No 1 Aircraft Depot|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6&amp;nbsp;November 1981, the Governor-General, [[Zelman Cowen|Sir Zelman Cowen]], presented the [[Colours, standards and guidons|Queen's Colour]] to No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126856976 |title=Vice-Regal |newspaper=The Canberra Times |location=Australian Capital Territory |date=9 November 1981 |accessdate=30 July 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September the following year the depot's strength was down to 235 staff, but it pioneered the support of various new technologies for the Air Force, in fields such as [[electoplate|electroplating]], [[Optical fiber|fibre optics]], and electronics. It was also responsible for developing and testing components for the F-111, [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] jets. From 1986, restructuring and outsourcing began to impact heavily upon the RAAF's technical services.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt; In February 1990, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD came under the control of [[RAAF Logistics Command|Logistics Command]], formed when Support Command was split into logistical and training components.&lt;ref name=1AD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; By then the depot's functions had largely been taken over by other units and private contractors, and it was disbanded on 2&amp;nbsp;December 1994. No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD was, at the time, the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation and, according to the RAAF Historical Section, the oldest continuously operating maintenance depot of any air force.&lt;ref name=Units/&gt;
