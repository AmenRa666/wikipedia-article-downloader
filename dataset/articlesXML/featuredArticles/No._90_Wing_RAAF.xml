'''No. 90 (Composite) Wing''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] that operated during the early years of the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Its purpose was to serve as an umbrella organisation for the RAAF units deployed in the conflict, [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Bomber) Squadron]], flying [[Avro Lincoln]]s, and [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 (Transport) Squadron]], flying [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]].  The wing was established in July 1950 and headquartered at [[Changi Air Base|Changi]], on the east coast of Singapore.  No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron operated from [[Tengah Air Base|Tengah]], in Singapore's west. No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron was based at Changi and, from April 1951 to February 1952, at [[Kuala Lumpur]] in central Malaya.  The Lincolns generally conducted [[Area bombardment|area bombing]] missions, as well as precision strikes, to harass communist insurgents. The Dakotas were tasked with airlifting cargo, [[Very important person|VIP]]s, troops and casualties, as well as courier flights and supply drops. Following No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron's departure in December 1952, No.&amp;nbsp;90 Wing was disbanded, leaving No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron to carry on as the sole RAAF unit in the Malayan air campaign until its withdrawal to Australia in July 1958.

==History==

===Origins and formation===
In April 1950, the British government requested Australia's assistance to combat communist insurgents during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. In response, the Australian Defence Committee determined that it was possible to commit a [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] of eight [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transports and a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of four to six [[Avro Lincoln]] heavy bombers. The Federal government formally announced the decision to send the Dakotas soon afterwards; in late June, it confirmed the allocation of six Lincolns.&lt;ref name=Solo246&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Bomber) Squadron]], operating the Lincolns, would be detached from the control of [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing]] at [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland, and be based at [[Tengah Air Base|Tengah airfield]] in the west of Singapore. [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 (Transport) Squadron]], operating Dakotas, would be detached from [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, and be based at [[Changi Air Base|Changi]], in Singapore's east.&lt;ref name=Solo246/&gt;&lt;ref name=Examiner&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52812622 |title=RAAF wing takes over a new important job |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|''The Examiner'']] |location=Launceston, Tasmania |date=20 April 1951 |accessdate=15 April 2013 |page=2 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transport commitment was rendered possible by the recent return of ten Australian Dakota crews from service during the [[Berlin Airlift]].&lt;ref name=Solo246/&gt;

It was agreed that RAAF operations during the Emergency would be directed by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) through [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|Air Headquarters Malaya]] (later [[No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group RAF]]).&lt;ref name=Solo246/&gt; The British also wanted the Australian squadrons attached to an RAF [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]].&lt;ref&gt;Grey, ''A Military History of Australia'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], was mindful of repeating the experience of World War&amp;nbsp;II, when RAAF units and personnel based in Britain had been absorbed by the RAF, rather than operating as a national group led by high-ranking Australian officers. He therefore decided that Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 38 Squadrons should be formed into a &quot;composite&quot; organisation (one made up of disparate elements such as bomber, fighter, or reconnaissance units) and administered by an overarching RAAF headquarters, and put this requirement to the British [[Air Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 224, 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APDC10Jul50&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=196|title=No 90 Wing formed at Singapore| publisher =Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Ministry agreed, and No.&amp;nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing was duly established at Richmond on 10&amp;nbsp;July 1950, under the command of [[Group Captain]] Paddy Heffernan.&lt;ref name=Solo246/&gt;&lt;ref name=APDC10Jul50/&gt;

===Operations===
[[File:38 Squadron RAAF Dakotas in Singapore during 1950.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.28|alt=Black and white photograph of five silver aircraft parked in a line|No. 38 Squadron Dakotas at RAF Changi in 1950]]
No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron's Dakotas began arriving at Changi on 19&amp;nbsp;June 1950, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron's Lincolns at Tengah on 16&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=Examiner/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;90 Wing staff departed Richmond by air and established the headquarters at Changi on 22&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=APDC10Jul50/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roylance&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The Dakotas had flown their first mission the previous day; the Lincolns undertook their initial operations on 26&amp;nbsp;July. Nos.&amp;nbsp;1 and 38 Squadrons were responsible for their own routine maintenance; aircraft rotated back to Australia for major work.&lt;ref name=Examiner/&gt; The RAF provided base support facilities, including messing and accommodation.&lt;ref name=Solo246/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lincolns generally conducted [[area bombing]] missions, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers. Not having to contend with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]], the Lincolns flew mainly by day. After completing a bomb run, they would make another pass over the target to strafe with machine guns and [[20 mm caliber|20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon]]. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, as well as their firepower and heavy bomb load.&lt;ref name=Stephens247&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron also flew night missions—the only Commonwealth air force unit authorised to do so—of up to six hours duration, dropping one bomb every half hour or so.&lt;ref name=Stephens247/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of [[collateral damage]], all air strikes had to be approved by the Joint Operation Centre, located at [[Kuala Lumpur]] in central Malaya and staffed by military, police and civilian personnel. Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops.&lt;ref name=Stephens247/&gt;

[[File:Avro Lincoln of 1 SQN RAAF at RAF Tengah in 1950.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.28|No. 1 Squadron Lincolns at RAF Tengah in 1950|alt=Four-engined bombers with spinning propellers parked on an airfield]]
The Dakotas were tasked with airlifting cargo, [[Very Important Person|VIPs]], troops and casualties, as well as courier flights, supply drops to friendly forces and aerial despatch of propaganda leaflets.&lt;ref name=Solo246/&gt; On other missions they acted as [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinders]] for No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron, dropping smoke canisters on suspected communist hideouts that the Lincolns following above and behind would attempt to bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50042500 |title=With the RAAF &quot;Biscuit Bombers&quot; in Malaya|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane|date=30 November 1950 |accessdate=15 April 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Airlifting and supplying troops was a key part of the strategy to defeat the insurgency, by ensuring that security forces could maintain a semi-permanent presence in the jungle.&lt;ref name=Solo246/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron's operations ranged throughout Malaya and into Borneo, the Philippines, Japan and Korea. Transport requirements in the [[Korean War]] led to a reduction in No.&amp;nbsp;90 Wing's strength when four of the Dakotas were transferred to [[Iwakuni, Yamaguchi|Iwakuni]], Japan, headquarters of [[No. 91 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;91 (Composite) Wing]], in November 1950.&lt;ref name=Examiner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 224, 247&lt;/ref&gt;  The same month, Group Captain [[Frank Headlam]] was appointed to take over command of No.&amp;nbsp;90 Wing from Heffernan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2807473 |title=New RAAF CO in Malaya |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Canberra |date=10 November 1950 |accessdate=15 April 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headlam co-piloted a Dakota on a supply drop on 20&amp;nbsp;December; he was slightly injured and the aircraft badly damaged following a crash-landing at Kampong Aur in [[Pahang]] as a result of engine failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RAAF Headquarters&amp;nbsp;– Directorate of Flying Safety|title=Crash landing of Dakota A65-66|date=1 February 1951|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=3312261|accessdate=4 February 2014|pages=1, 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron's complement was increased from six to eight aircraft after the British Air Ministry requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent withdrawal of the RAF's Lincolns to [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; In April, No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron's four Dakotas relocated to Kuala Lumpur, where they undertook supply drops in cooperation with [[No.&amp;nbsp;41 Squadron RNZAF]].&lt;ref name=Solo249&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;  One of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron's Lincolns was [[Hull loss|written off]] after overshooting the runway at Tengah on 30&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] (later Group Captain) Redmond Green was appointed the new commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;90 Wing the following month, replacing Headlam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18242520 |title=New head for RAAF wing |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=4 December 1951 |accessdate=15 April 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130811170 |title=With the RAAF in Malaya |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=10 July 1952 |accessdate=20 June 2016 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4&amp;nbsp;April 1952, Green participated in a Lincoln [[sortie]] in place of an injured pilot. The first aircraft he took off in had to turn back owing to engine failure. The second completed the mission but was found to have lost brake power as it was returning to Tengah, and there was a danger of the aircraft overrunning the landing strip and sustaining heavy damage; the crew was able to slow the Lincoln on the runway by trailing a parachute from the rear turret upon touching down.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disbandment===
No. 38 Squadron relocated from Kuala Lumpur to its former base at Changi in February 1952.&lt;ref name=Eather51&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; As the year progressed, RAAF transport priorities altered owing to the increasing demands of the Korean War, and the Malayan commitment was no longer considered sustainable.&lt;ref name=Eather51/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Having airlifted more than 17,000 passengers and almost 1,900 [[tonne]]s of cargo, dropped some 750 tonnes of supplies and evacuated over 300 injured troops, No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron departed for Australia on 8&amp;nbsp;December and rejoined No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing at Richmond three days later.&lt;ref name=Eather51/&gt; Following this withdrawal, No.&amp;nbsp;90 Wing was disbanded at Changi, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron became the only Australian flying unit in Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; It continued the bombing campaign against the communists until it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, having flown almost 4,000 sorties in its eight years of operation and dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=336|title=No 1 Squadron returned from Malaya| publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron was relieved by [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]], operating [[English Electric Canberra]] jet bombers out of [[RMAF Butterworth|Butterworth]] in north-west Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;
