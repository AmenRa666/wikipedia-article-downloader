'''Isaac Parsons''' (January 7, 1814 – April 24, 1862) was an American [[Planter (American South)|planter]], politician, and [[Officer (armed forces)|military officer]] in the U.S. state of [[Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]). Parsons served as a [[Justice of the Peace|justice of the peace]] of Hampshire County's District 3 from 1852 to 1853. He later served as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] representing [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] from 1854 until 1857. Parsons was the grandson of Virginia House Delegate [[Isaac Parsons (Virginia politician)|Isaac Parsons]] (1752–1796), the great-grandson of [[Colony of Virginia|Colonial Virginia]] military officer [[William Foreman]] (died 1777), and the grandfather of [[First Lady]] of West Virginia, [[Edna Brady Cornwell]] (1868–1958).

Parsons inherited his family's [[Wappocomo (Romney, West Virginia)|Wappocomo]] plantation north of [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]]. In 1855, [[fugitive slave]] Jacob Green escaped from Parsons' Wappocomo plantation to [[Pennsylvania]] along with several other slaves. Parsons and his nephews went north to pursue the escapees, resulting in the arrest of his nephew, James &quot;Zip&quot; Parsons III (1831–1893). The arrest and trial of Parsons' nephew caused a dispute between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania over the latter's refusal to execute the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]. Following the trial, a dispute ensued between Parsons and [[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]] over legal fees in 1857. At the time of the dispute, Faulkner was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]]. Parsons declared that Faulkner had originally offered his legal services at no cost during his nephew's trial.

Following the onset of the [[American Civil War]], Parsons served on Hampshire County's &quot;committee for safety&quot;. Parsons received permission to raise an independent [[Company (military unit)|company]] of [[mounted infantry]] to provide defense along the border. He served as a military officer in the Huckleberry Rangers and Company K of the [[13th Virginia Infantry|13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] in the [[Confederate States Army]]. Parsons died of natural causes following a skirmish with [[Union Army]] cavalry at [[Grassy Lick Run]] in 1862.

== Early life and family ==
Isaac Parsons was born on January 7, 1814, in [[Hampshire County, West Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCabe|1913|p=269.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCabe|1913|p=255.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third son of James Gregg Parsons (1773–1847) and his wife Mary Catherine Casey Parsons (1773–1846).&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe2&quot;/&gt;

The Parsons family was a prominent family whose ancestors had arrived to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from England in 1635, and relocated to Hampshire County around 1740.&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCabe|1913|p=18.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Zimmerman1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zimmerman|2012|p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons' paternal grandfather, of which he is a likely [[namesake]], [[Isaac Parsons (Virginia politician)|Isaac Parsons]] (1752–1796) served as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] representing [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] from 1789 until his death in 1796; and operated a public ferry across the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac River]]. Through his mother, Parsons was a great-grandson of [[Colony of Virginia|Colonial Virginia]] military officer [[William Foreman]] (died 1777). Parsons was raised through childhood to [[adult]]hood on his family's [[Wappocomo (Romney, West Virginia)|Wappocomo]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] north of [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]].&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe1&quot;/&gt;

== Wappocomo ==
Following the death of James Gregg Parsons on January 25, 1847, his [[last will and testament]] dated November 7, 1846, and probated February 22, 1847, devised Lot Number 21 including Wappocomo (referred to in the will as the &quot;Casey tract&quot;) to his son Colonel Isaac Parsons (1814–1862).&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Zimmerman1&quot;/&gt; Parsons' brother James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Parsons, Jr. (1798–1858), inherited the Collins tract (Lot Number 20) and his other brother David C. Parsons (1803–1860) inherited Lot Number 13.&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Zimmerman1&quot;/&gt; Parsons and his brothers also inherited the nearby &quot;Jake Sugar Rum tract, the McGuire tract, and five town lots in Romney&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe3&quot;/&gt; Parsons eventually acquired Wappocomo plantation outright,&lt;ref name = &quot;Brannon1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=315.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1861 he undertook a two-story stone expansion to the main house at Wappocomo.&lt;ref name = &quot;Brannon1&quot;/&gt; The [[ballroom]] in the upper story of this addition served as the scene of many events and parties.&lt;ref name = &quot;Brannon1&quot;/&gt;

== Political career ==
Following the [[ratification]] of the [[Constitution of Virginia#1851|1851 Constitution of Virginia]], Parsons was elected to serve as a [[justice of the peace]] for Hampshire County's District&amp;nbsp;3 in 1852 and 1853.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=160.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons served in this office alongside David Gibson, T.&amp;nbsp;M. Davis, and Joseph C. Pancake.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske4&quot;/&gt;

Parsons served as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] representing Hampshire County from 1854 until 1857.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;VAVH1&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://vavh.iath.virginia.edu/php/bio.php?pid=5728 | title = Biographical Information: Isaac Parsons | work = The Virginia Elections and State Elected Officials Database Project, 1776–2007 | publisher = Department of Politics, [[University of Virginia]]; [[University of Virginia Center for Politics]]; University of Virginia Library | accessdate = December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons represented Hampshire County, which was a [[Electoral district|multi-member electoral district]],&lt;ref name = &quot;VAVH1&quot;/&gt; in the following sessions of the Virginia House of Delegates: the 1854 session alongside Jesse Lupton;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt; the 1855 session alongside Jesse Lupton;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt; the 1856 session alongside Asa Hiett;&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt; and the 1857 session alongside Asa Hiett.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt; Prior to the [[American Civil War]], Parsons was an ardent proponent of [[Virginia in the American Civil War#Call for secession convention|Virginia's secession]] and the passage of an [[Ordinance of Secession]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jacob Green affair ==
[[File:Charles J. Faulkner 1806-1884 - Brady-Handy.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]]]]
In August 1855, Jacob Green, a slave owned by Parsons, escaped from Wappocomo farm with four other slaves from neighboring plantations.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.historichampshire.org/black/JGreen.htm | title = Jacob Green, Runaway Slave: The Pursuit of Jacob Green by the Parsons Family and the Problem of Free States | work = Historic Hampshire County, West Virginia: West Virginia's Oldest County | publisher = Charles C. Hall, HistoricHampshire.org  | accessdate = December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NPS1&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nps.gov/alpo/historyculture/upload/UGRR-for-web.rtf  | title =What is the Underground Railroad? | work = Allegheny Portage Railroad, National Park Service website | publisher =[[National Park Service]]  | accessdate = December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year, Green returned to Parsons' plantation in Romney, and persuaded four or five slaves from neighboring farms owned by Parsons family relatives to escape with him to Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NPS1&quot;/&gt;

A party of eight to ten men, including Parsons and two of his nephews, James &quot;Zip&quot; Parsons III (1831–1893) and a Mr.&amp;nbsp;Stump, went north in pursuit of the escapees. In the course of the pursuit, they captured two of Stump's escaped slaves, who were sent back to Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NPS1&quot;/&gt; James Parsons III was the son of Parsons' brother James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Parsons, Jr. (1798–1858), and his wife Elizabeth Miller Parsons.&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|MacCabe|1913|p=260.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With information obtained from the two recaptured slaves, Parsons went to [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], James Parsons III to Hollidaysburg, and Stump to [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], where they hoped to intercept Green as he headed west on the [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]] and [[Main Line of Public Works|Main Line Canal]] toward [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NPS1&quot;/&gt; James Parsons III intercepted Green at Hollidaysburg, but local [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] thwarted his attempt to capture Green, and he was arrested and arraigned for kidnapping.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NPS1&quot;/&gt;

Upon learning of the arrest of his nephew, Parsons sought the assistance of [[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]], a prominent [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]] lawyer and [[United States House of Representatives|United States House Representative]] from [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], and of [[James Murray Mason]], a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Virginia.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt; Faulkner and Mason both offered their legal services for James Parsons III's defense.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt; The [[Virginia General Assembly]] pledged its support to Parsons and to Virginia's slaveowners in defending their constitutional rights and to protect them from prosecution.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;VHD1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Virginia House of Delegates|1856|p=246.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Henry A. Wise]] appointed [[John Randolph Tucker (politician)|John Randolph Tucker]] to attend Parsons' trial as a &quot;special commissioner&quot; of Virginia.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NPS1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;VHD2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Virginia House of Delegates|1856|p=454.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania escalated, and on January 31, 1856, an article published in the ''[[New York Herald]]'' read &quot;Threatened Civil War between Virginia and Pennsylvania&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;NPS1&quot;/&gt;

Parsons, Faulkner, and Tucker traveled to Hollidaysburg for James Parsons III's trial.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt; Faulkner provided for Parsons' legal defense, leading to his acquittal as having acted legally under the provisions of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS1&quot;/&gt;

In September 1856, Faulkner billed Parsons $150 for his legal services. Parsons disputed the charge. In a series of articles in the ''[[Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser]]'', he declared that Faulkner had originally offered his services at no cost; that he had been lauded publicly for his generosity in doing so without ever denying that he had been working ''[[pro bono]]''; and that he was practicing &quot;duplicity and deception&quot; in trying to win a reputation in his district through &quot;specious acts of munificence&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt;

James Parsons III and his brother William Miller Parsons (born 1835) were later proprietors of the ''[[Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser]]''.&lt;ref name = &quot;MacCabe4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=357.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;LOC1&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84037876/ | title = About Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, 1850–1861. | work = [[Chronicling America]] | publisher = [[Library of Congress]], [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] | oclc=11111337 | accessdate = December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of articles published in the May 14 and May 21, 1857, issues of the ''Virginia Argus'', Parsons chronicled the 1855 arrest of his nephew for attempting to capture his [[fugitive slave]] and the resulting dispute between the Parsons family and Faulkner over legal fees in 1857.&lt;ref name = &quot;HH2&quot;/&gt;

Following the onset of the American Civil War, Parsons began serving on Hampshire County's &quot;committee for safety&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|pp=548–549.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons served on the &quot;committee for safety&quot; alongside James D. Armstrong, John M. Pancake, David Gibson, Dr. S.&amp;nbsp;R. Lupton, John C. Heiskell, J.&amp;nbsp;W. Marshall, W.&amp;nbsp;A. Vance, R.&amp;nbsp;K. Sheetz, [[Angus William McDonald]], James Sheetz, John T. Pierce, James W. Albin, Charles Blue, Robert Hook, R.&amp;nbsp;B. Sherrard, G.&amp;nbsp;W. Gore, George William Washington, and John Johnson.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell2&quot;/&gt; The &quot;committee for safety&quot; continued to meet until May 29, 1861.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell2&quot;/&gt; Parsons, Pancake, and Armstrong were permitted by the Hampshire County Court to execute bonds for and on behalf of the county to raise money to fund &quot;war purposes&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maxwell2&quot;/&gt;

On May 18, 1861, the Hampshire Guards and the Frontier Riflemen convened in front of the [[Hampshire County Courthouse (West Virginia)|Hampshire County Courthouse]] in Romney before departing to fight in defense of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons and a dozen of his men led the [[wagon train]] conveying these volunteers to [[Green Spring, West Virginia|Green Spring]] on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] mainline, where Parsons and the volunteers departed by train to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue1&quot;/&gt;

Parsons traveled to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], where he received permission to raise an independent [[Company (military unit)|company]] of [[mounted infantry]] to provide defense along the border.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons set about enrolling volunteers, and within a short period of time, he enlisted approximately 30 men.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue2&quot;/&gt; Following its organization, the company became known as the Huckleberry Rangers of the [[Confederate States Army]]'s [[13th Virginia Infantry|13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=162.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following personnel were elected to serve in leadership positions within the company: Parsons as its [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in command; John Blue, [[first lieutenant]]; and his son Isaac Parsons, Jr., [[second lieutenant]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue2&quot;/&gt; Parsons and his company utilized [[flintlock]] [[musket]]s, which they had retrieved from the loft of the courthouse, and additional [[sabre]]s and flintlock horse [[pistol]]s which had last been used during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue2&quot;/&gt; Parsons provided Lt. Blue with a [[Minié ball]] rifle reportedly seized from [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] at Harpers Ferry.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=20.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons again traveled to Richmond with a supply of cattle, and returned to his company's camp on the [[North River (Cacapon River)|North River]] in Hampshire County around November 15, 1861.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue4&quot;/&gt; Upon his return, Parsons was anxious to learn about the condition of his family and property at Wappocomo and needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue4&quot;/&gt; Accompanied by Lt.&amp;nbsp;Blue and Adam Parrish, Parsons traveled west along the [[Northwestern Turnpike]] to around [[Pleasant Dale, West Virginia|Pleasant Dale]], where they set about traversing a series of roads and paths until nighttime when they reached Sugar Hollow {{convert|2|mi}} north of Romney.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue4&quot;/&gt; Parsons stayed behind in the hollow while Lt.&amp;nbsp;Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue4&quot;/&gt; Lt.&amp;nbsp;Blue and Parrish approached Wappocomo with the knowledge that [[Union Army]] forces kept a guard at the main house there day and night.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue4&quot;/&gt; Lt.&amp;nbsp;Blue circled around to the rear of the mansion at Wappocomo and knocked on the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with Parsons' family.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=30.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front porch, and he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter Kate, who provided Lt.&amp;nbsp;Blue with a parcel for her father.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue5&quot;/&gt;
