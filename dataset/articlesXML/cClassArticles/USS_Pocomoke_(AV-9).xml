'''USS ''Pocomoke'' (AV-9)''' was a {{sclass|Pocomoke|seaplane tender}}, originally built as the {{SS|Exchequer}} and acquired by the [[U.S. Navy]] as the military build-up occurred in the [[United States]] just prior to [[World War II]]. She operated principally in the Pacific Theatre of the war and serviced military seaplanes. At war’s end, she returned to the United States with two [[battle stars]].

She was built on 14 August 1939 by [[Ingalls Shipbuilding|Ingalls Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]], [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]], for the [[Maritime Commission]]; launched 8 June 1940; sponsored by Mrs. Max O. Truitt; acquired by the Navy 16 October 1940; and following conversion commissioned 18 July 1941, Comdr. L. T. Hundt in command.

==Initial Atlantic Ocean operations==
When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, ''Pocomoke'' was attached to [[Task force|Task Group]] 4.3 of the Support Force, [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], stationed at [[Argentia, Newfoundland]]. She tended two patrol planes which scouted waters approaching the harbor searching for German [[U-boats]] which threatened [[convoys]] carrying desperately needed war material to [[England]]. On 9 January 1942 she departed Argentia en route to [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Virginia, where she entered the [[Shipyard|yard]] for alterations.
 
Following training and exercises she departed [[Boston, Massachusetts]], 21 May for Argentia to act as [[flagship]] for Commander, [[Task Force]] 24, and tender for Commander, Patrol Wing 7. Returning to Boston 15 August, she proceeded via Norfolk to [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]]. She discharged cargo there and at [[Trinidad]], and steamed back to Norfolk 8 October.

==World War II Pacific Theater operations==
On 30 October ''Pocomoke'' got underway, transited the [[Panama Canal]], and proceeded via [[Seymour Bay]], [[Galapagos Islands]], to [[San Diego, California]], 27 November. Then steaming to [[San Francisco, California]], she sailed 2 December for [[Pearl Harbor]] where she discharged [[spare part]]s and supplies.
 
After returning to the [[U.S. West Coast]] for additional supplies, ''Pocomoke'' sailed to Pearl Harbor 4 January 1943, then, escorted by {{USS|Breese|DM-18|6}}, proceeded to the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]] where she unloaded cargo. Following her return to the United States via [[Christmas Island]] and Pearl Harbor, she carried supplies and spare parts to [[Oahu]] 23 February to 11 March, and returned to San Francisco for repairs at [[Oakland, California]], until 6 May.
 
The next day she weighed anchor for [[Hawaii]] where she took on supplies and equipment at Pearl Harbor, and pushed on to [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]]. On 6 June she embarked men of Patrol Bombing Squadrons [[VPB-15]] and [[VPB-23]] at [[Espiritu Santo]] and provided vital tender services in the area until sailing for Pearl Harbor 18 September. There she loaded cargo for Fleet Air Photograph Squadron 3 and sailed 1 October for [[Canton Island]]. She returned to San Diego 21 October. One week later she steamed with cargo and passengers for Pearl Harbor and continued on to [[Palmyra Island]], [[Tutuila]], [[Efate Island]], and [[Espiritu Santo]], off-loading much needed parts and supplies at these points before returning to [[Alameda, California]], 14 December.

==Making the rounds over vast distances==
''Pocomoke'' continued her vital services, taking on Marine Night Fighter Squadron 532 ([[VMF(N)-532]]) with planes, [[rolling stock]] and equipment and sailed via Pearl Harbor to [[Funafuti Atoll]], anchoring there 11 January 1944. With {{USS|Tisdale|DE-33|6}} she steamed for [[Tarawa]] and returned to Hawaii 25 January. Another brief return to the West Coast was followed by a stopover at Pearl Harbor to take on troops and [[ammunition]] destined for [[Espiritu Santo]]. Shuttling cargo and fighting men between Espiritu Santo and [[Guadalcanal]] consumed ''Pocomoke’s'' efforts until she sailed 4 April among the islands of the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] group, dispensing needed services, and back to Espiritu Santo. She tended [[seaplanes]] at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] before anchoring off [[Saipan]] 15 June to begin operations for Patrol Squadron 16 which were continued until 12 September. She departed for [[Kossol Passage]], [[Palau Islands]] where she continued her repair and supply functions until 23 November. She finally sailed via [[Ulithi]], [[Eniwetok]], and Pearl Harbor for San Francisco, arriving 15 December.

==Philippine Islands support==
Late January 1945, saw ''Pocomoke'' again underway for Pearl Harbor and [[Manus Island]] to report for duty with Commander, Air Force, [[U.S. 7th Fleet]] 18 February. She returned to the task of ferrying supplies and passengers, getting underway for [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], [[Leyte Gulf]], and [[Samar]] Island. She then tended seaplanes at [[Palawan]] Island and [[Tawitawi]] Island, for the duration of the active fighting war in the Pacific.
 
On 28 August 1945 administrative command changed to Commander [[Philippine Sea Frontier]], and 9 September ''Pocomoke'' set course for [[Sangley Point]], [[Manila Bay]]. From 11 September 1945 through 1 February 1946, she steamed among the various islands in the [[Philippine Islands|Philippine]] group, dispensing her services, providing supplies, ferrying troops, and operating search patrols wherever needed.

==Post-war inactivation and decommissioning==
''Pocomoke'' returned to San Diego 28 February 1946 and transited the [[Panama Canal]] 11 March to report for duty to Commander, Air Force, Atlantic. She was ordered to Norfolk, unloaded her ammunition and steamed into [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], where she was placed in the reserve group of the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. ''Pocomoke'' decommissioned 10 July 1946 her name was struck from the [[Navy List]] 1 June 1961, she was ordered disposed 20 September 1961, and was sold 12 December 1961 to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corp.
