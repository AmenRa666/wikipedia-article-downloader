== Build time ==

Does Garzke &amp; Dulin specifically say 3 years? 'Cause Groner's says 3.5 years for the estimated build time. I generally trust what Groner's says (since he used official blueprints and other original documents for his work). [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 18:02, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
:The book does say three years, but please change that; it was most likely rounded off. Or we could put 3&lt;sup&gt;ref to G&amp;D&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;ndash;3.5&lt;sup&gt;ref to Groner&lt;/sup&gt; years... —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 21:05, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
::Since they were only estimates, it'd probably be better to include both. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 21:08, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
:::Thanks :) —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 21:22, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

== Order ==

How do we want the sections ordered? Specifications followed by how the design came about, vice versa, or the specs between the P class summary and the battlecruiser section? —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 02:42, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

:I generally prefer to have the &quot;how the design came about&quot; section first, followed by the specifications. I think the &quot;Battlecruisers&quot; section should go second, since it's also part of the &quot;how the design came about&quot; bit. What do you think? [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 02:57, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

::That's exactly what I was thinking. :) Moving now.
::Interestingly, only about 1 1/2 pages of Garzke and Dulin are devoted to the design history. The one before that are for the P class, the next 7 1/2 are about the specs, and it then wraps up with a &quot;summary&quot;/critique of their design with a little new info on what the ships were intended to do. Got a ways to go yet, but I'll get it to DYK-worthiness by Saturday at the latest followed by GA-level sometime in the next two weeks (whenever I have an ''uninterrupted'' long amount of time on the computer...) —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 05:08, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

:::That sounds like a pretty good plan. I've just about used up Groner's for all of the technical data, so anything that G&amp;D can add would be great. I just checked my ''Conway's All the World's Battleships'', and it has a short listing of the class (but interestingly calls them &quot;P class battlecruisers&quot; (I guess a legacy from them being beefed up P class cruisers), but it doesn't say anything that isn't already in Groner's. I suppose I could replace a couple of the Groner refs with this one, so we have more diversity of references. Do you think it's worth the effort? (normally I wouldn't worry about it, but it was raised at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Moltke class battlecruiser/archive1|''Moltke''s FAC]]). [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 12:42, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

::::I'll be adding it in sometime when I've got time. If you want to add cites, double cite them! 2 cites &gt; 1. :-) —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 16:38, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

== Image ==

Does Garzke &amp; Dulin have any schematics for the ship? Groner's has one that gives a side and top-down view that I could scan in, but it's not my favorite :/ I can scan it in if you want me to though. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 12:38, 29 May 2009 (UTC)
:There are a few, but I have no access to a scanner when I am at home; the local library does not have one. —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 16:40, 31 May 2009 (UTC)
::Having said that, there is also a stern-on painting by Richard Allison of the ships on p. 350 of ''A&amp;N BB of WWII'' ([http://books.google.com/books?id=TAyRtKKRR_cC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=%22Richard+Allison%22+battlecruiser&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s8TcCEjmDb&amp;sig=UL0M6Mh5koyE_LaDJKJjapK4SJk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6LMiSvrBI4zEMe-w5KEJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA351,M1 caption here, no preview for the painting though]), and upon further reflection, I think that I may be able to get to a scanner if I have too... —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 16:47, 31 May 2009 (UTC)
:::That sounds promising :) As I recall, the problem you had with that painting of the 1047s was that you couldn't provide the copyright holder, which won't be a problem here. Now just find a scanner! [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 22:38, 31 May 2009 (UTC)
::::I will be attempting :-) —&lt;font face=&quot;Baskerville Old Face&quot;&gt;[[User:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Ed]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;(Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/the_ed17|&lt;font color=&quot;800000&quot;&gt;Contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 03:04, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

== Question about the painting ==

The painting looks wrong; it looks like the ship has two main turrets aft. We can’t see the bow of the ship. I am wondering if this is actually a view of what the H Class battleship would have looked like, the number of aft turrets and the two smokestacks make it seem so. The O class was, according to the text, supposed to have only one aft main battery turret. Or am I to assume that the superimposed turret in the painting is actually a pair of 15cm secondary guns? 
[[Special:Contributions/207.30.62.198|207.30.62.198]] ([[User talk:207.30.62.198|talk]]) 23:25, 4 October 2011 (UTC)

:One pair of 15cm guns was placed a superfiring turret over the rear main battery, see the paragraph on the secondary battery. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 01:03, 5 October 2011 (UTC)

== Which main gun info is correct? ==

Conflicting info on the main armament size/caliber. The first mention in this article shows them as &quot;380 mm (15 in)/47 caliber guns&quot;, while they are next mentioned as &quot;38.1 cm (15.0 in) L/47 SK C/34&quot;, while that itself links to the 38 cm SK C/34 naval gun article, which gives the length as 52 calibers. Which is right? [[User:Russ3Z|Russ3Z]] ([[User talk:Russ3Z|talk]]) 18:12, 24 July 2012 (UTC)</text>
