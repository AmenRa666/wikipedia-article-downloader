The '''North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' ('''NATO''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|oʊ}}; {{lang-fr|Organisation du Traité de l'Atlantique Nord}}; ''{{lang|fr|OTAN}}''), also called the '''North Atlantic Alliance''', is an [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] [[military alliance]] based on the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] which was signed on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of [[collective defence]] whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|NATO's headquarters]] are located in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], where the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe#Supreme Allied Commander Europe .28SACEUR.29|Supreme Allied Commander]] also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]], joined in April 2009. An additional 22&amp;nbsp;countries participate in NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] program, with 15&amp;nbsp;other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|the global total]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sipri1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Milexdata.sipri.org |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT spending&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last = Erlanger |first = Steven |date = 26 March 2014 |title = Europe Begins to Rethink Cuts to Military Spending |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/world/europe/europe-begins-to-rethink-cuts.html |work = [[nytimes.com]] |accessdate = 3 April 2014 |quote = Last year, only a handful of NATO countries met the target, according to NATO figures, including the United States, at 4.1 percent, and Britain, at 2.4 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO was little more than a political association until the [[Korean War]] galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders. The course of the [[Cold War]] led to a rivalry with nations of the [[Warsaw Pact]], which formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective [[Soviet]] invasion—doubts that led to the development of the [[Strike Force (France)|independent French nuclear deterrent]] and the withdrawal of [[France]] from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, the organization was drawn into the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], and conducted its first military interventions in [[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia from 1992 to 1995]] and later [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia in 1999]]. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.

[[s:North Atlantic Treaty#Article 5|Article&amp;nbsp;5 of the North Atlantic treaty]], requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the [[September 11 attacks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Invocation of Article 5 confirmed |url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm |date=3 October 2001 |publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which troops were deployed to [[Afghanistan]] under the NATO-led [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending [[NATO Training Mission – Iraq|trainers to Iraq]], assisting in [[Operation Ocean Shield|counter-piracy operations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Counter-piracy operations |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_48815.htm |work=North Atlantic Treaty Organization |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 enforcing a [[no-fly zone]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|over Libya]] in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973]]. The less potent Article 4, which merely invokes consultation among NATO members, has been invoked five times: by [[Turkey]] in 2003 over the [[Iraq War]]; twice in 2012 by Turkey over the [[Syrian Civil War]], after the [[June 2012 interception of Turkish aircraft|downing]] of an unarmed Turkish [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 reconnaissance jet]], and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from [[Syria]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/us-syria-crisis-alliance-idUSBRE8921F220121003 |title= NATO demands halt to Syria aggression against Turkey |work= [[Reuters]] |first= Adrian |last= Croft |date= 3 October 2012 |accessdate= 3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 by [[Poland]], following the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian intervention in Crimea]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_107716.htm |title= Statement by the North Atlantic Council following meeting under article 4 of the Washington Treaty |work= NATO Newsroom |date= 4 March 2014 |accessdate= 2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again by Turkey in 2015 after threats by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|the Islamic State]] to its territorial integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/26/middleeast/turkey-nato-talks/index.html |title=Turkey calls for rare NATO talks after attacks along Syrian border |last1=Ford |first1=Dana |date=26 July 2015 |website=www.cnn.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

[[File:Truman signing North Atlantic Treaty.jpg|thumb|The [[North Atlantic Treaty]] was signed in Washington, D.C., on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949 and was ratified by the United States that August.|alt=Eleven men in suits stand around a large desk at which another man is signing a document.]]

The [[Treaty of Brussels]], signed on 17&amp;nbsp;March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. The treaty and the Soviet [[Berlin Blockade]] led to the creation of the [[Western European Union]]'s Defence Organization in September 1948.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=13}} However, participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the [[Soviet Armed Forces|military power of the USSR]] and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism. In addition the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état]] by the Communists had overthrown a democratic government and British Foreign Minister [[Ernest Bevin]] reiterated that the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western military strategy. He got a receptive hearing, especially considering American anxiety over Italy (and the [[Italian Communist Party]]).{{sfn|Pedaliu|2003|p=97}} In 1948 European leaders met with U.S. defense, military and diplomatic officials at the Pentagon, under U.S. Secretary of State [[George C. Marshall]]'s orders, exploring a framework for a new and unprecedented association.{{sfn|Behrman|2007|p=157}} Talks for a new military alliance resulted in the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/history/nato-history.html |title= A short history of NATO |publisher= NATO |date= 2 April 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]], [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|Lord Ismay]], stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was &quot;to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.&quot;{{sfn|Reynolds|1994|p=13}} Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a [[1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland|pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot]] in March 1949. The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called [[Atlanticism]] which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straus|first=Ira|title=Atlanticism as the core 20 th century U.S. strategy for internationalism|journal=Streit Council|date=June 2005|series=Annual Meeting of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations|url=http://streitcouncil.org/uploads/PDF/Straus-%20Atlanticism%20as%20the%20core%2020th%20century%20US%20Strategy%20for%20internationalism.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members agreed that an armed attack against any one of them in Europe or North America would be considered an attack against them all. Consequently, they agreed that, if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence, would assist the member being attacked, taking such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from Article&amp;nbsp;IV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response will be military in nature. It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their &quot;vessels, forces or aircraft&quot; above the [[Tropic of Cancer]], including some [[Overseas departments]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17245.htm |title= Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Greece and Turkey |work= NATO |date= 4 April 1949 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of NATO brought about some [[standardization]] of allied [[military terminology]], procedures, and technology, which in many cases meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300&amp;nbsp;[[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the [[7.62×51mm NATO]] rifle cartridge was introduced in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]]'s [[FN FAL|FAL]], which used 7.62 NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO.{{sfn|Willbanks|2004|pp=129–130}} Also, [[aircraft marshalling|aircraft marshalling signals]] were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.

=== Cold War ===

{{Main|Cold War}}

The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 was crucial for NATO as it raised the apparent threat of all Communist countries working together, and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|pp=13–14}} [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) was formed to direct forces in Europe, and began work under Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in January 1951.&lt;ref name=pace&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/4.htm |title= NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |first= Hastings |last= Ismay |authorlink= Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay |publisher= NATO |date= 4 September 2001 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1950, the [[NATO Military Committee]] called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets, subsequently reaffirming this position at the February 1952 meeting of the [[North Atlantic Council]] in [[Lisbon]]. The Lisbon conference, seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO's Long-Term Defence Plan, called for an expansion to ninety-six [[division (military)|division]]s. However this requirement was dropped the following year to roughly thirty-five divisions with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons. At this time, NATO could call on about fifteen ready divisions in Central Europe, and another ten in Italy and Scandinavia.{{sfn|Osgood|1962|p=76}}{{sfn|Park|1986|p=28}} Also at Lisbon, the post of [[Secretary General of NATO]] as the organization's chief civilian was created, and [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|Lord Ismay]] was eventually appointed to the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816183,00.html |title= NATO: The Man with the Oilcan |date= 24 March 1952 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West German Bundeswehr 1960.jpg|thumb|left|The German [[Bundeswehr]] provided the largest element of the allied land forces guarding the frontier in Central Europe.|alt=Two soldiers crouch under a tree while a tank sits on a road in front of them.]]

In September 1952, the first major NATO [[Military exercise|maritime exercises]] began; [[Exercise Mainbrace]] brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=Hanson |date= 28 September 1952 |title=Navies Meet the Test in Operation ''Mainbrace'' |journal=New York Times |pages=E7  |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20711FF3A5B117A93CAAB1782D85F468585F9 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major exercises that followed included [[Exercise Grand Slam]] and [[Exercise Longstep]], naval and amphibious exercises in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Italic Weld, a combined air-naval-ground exercise in [[northern Italy]], Grand Repulse, involving the [[British Army on the Rhine]] (BAOR), the Netherlands Corps and [[Allied Air Forces Central Europe]] (AAFCE), Monte Carlo, a simulated atomic air-ground exercise involving the [[Allied Force Command Heidelberg|Central Army Group]], and Weldfast, a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving American, British, Greek, Italian and Turkish naval forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/9.htm |title= The increase in strength |publisher= NATO |date= 17 September 2001 |accessdate = 4 September 2013 |first= Hastings |last= Ismay |authorlink= Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay |work= NATO the first five years 1949-1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] also joined the alliance in 1952, forcing a series of controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure.&lt;ref name=pace/&gt; While this overt military preparation was going on, covert [[stay-behind]] arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including [[Operation Gladio|Operation ''Gladio'']], were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the [[NATO Tiger Association]] and competitions such as the [[Canadian Army Trophy]] for tank gunnery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.natotigers.org/tigerassociation/index.php |title= Organisation |work= NATO Tiger Association |accessdate= 4 September 2013 |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://canadianarmytrophy.com/ |title= Historical Overview |work= Canadian Army Trophy |date= 5 October 2012 |accessdate= 4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2009/04/03/f-nato-fast-facts.html |date= 6 April 2009 |title=Fast facts about NATO |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal.

On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council approved MC 48, a key document in the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US [[Strategic Air Command]].

The incorporation of [[West Germany]] into the organization on 9&amp;nbsp;May 1955 was described as &quot;a decisive turning point in the history of our continent&quot; by [[Halvard Lange]], [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519979.stm |title= West Germany accepted into Nato |work=BBC News |date= 9 May 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major reason for Germany's entry into the alliance was that without German manpower, it would have been impossible to field enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=15}} One of its immediate results was the creation of the [[Warsaw Pact]], which was signed on 14&amp;nbsp;May 1955 by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and East Germany, as a formal response to this event, thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the [[Cold War]].

Three major exercises were held concurrently in the northern autumn of 1957. Operation ''Counter Punch'', [[Operation Strikeback|Operation ''Strikeback'']], and [[Operation Deep Water|Operation ''Deep Water'']] were the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance to date, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891351,00.html |title=Emergency Call |accessdate=27 September 2008 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 30 September 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French withdrawal {{anchor|French withdrawal}}&lt;!-- [[French withdrawal from NATO command]]  redirects here --&gt; ===

[[File:NATO AB in France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of the NATO air bases in France before [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s 1966 withdrawal from NATO military integrated command|alt=A map of France with red and blue markings indicating air force bases as of 1966.]]
NATO's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency of France.&lt;ref&gt;Garret Martin, &quot;The 1967 withdrawal from NATO – a cornerstone of de Gaulle's grand strategy?&quot; ''[[Journal of Transatlantic Studies]]'' (2011) 9#3 pp 232–243. {{doi|10.1080/14794012.2011.593819}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle protested against the USA's strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] between it and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President [[Dwight D.

Considering the response to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the [[Eastern bloc]] instead of being drawn into a larger NATO–Warsaw Pact war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-215_162-3334439.html |title=Not Enough NATO In Afghanistan |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2013 |first=Alan |last=Dowd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1959, France withdrew its [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|Mediterranean Fleet]] from NATO command,{{sfn|National Defense University|1997|p=50}} and later banned the stationing of foreign [[nuclear weapon]]s on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the [[United States Air Force in France|air force bases]] that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.

Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[English Channel|Channel]] fleets from NATO command.{{sfn|van der Eyden|2003|pp=104–106}} In 1966, all French armed forces were removed from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France.

=== Détente and escalation ===

{{Main|Détente}}

[[File:Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon talks in 1973.png|thumb|left|Détente led to many high level meetings between leaders from both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.|alt=Two older men in suits sit next to each other, while a third stands behind leaning in to listen to the right man talk.]]

During most of the Cold War, NATO's watch against the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not actually lead to direct military action. On 1&amp;nbsp;July 1968, the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] opened for signature: NATO argued that its [[nuclear sharing]] arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further [[arms race]].{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|pp=659–661}}

Other unaffiliated countries are in white.]]

On 12&amp;nbsp;December 1979, in light of a build-up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US [[BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile|GLCM]] [[cruise missile]]s and [[Pershing&amp;nbsp;II]] theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the [[NATO Double-Track Decision|Dual Track]] policy.{{sfn|Njølstad|2004|pp=280–282}} Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of [[Warsaw Pact]] [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20]] medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations in the event of war.{{sfn|Njølstad|2004|pp=278–279}} This action led to [[peace movement]] protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.

The membership of the organization at this time remained largely static. In 1974, as a consequence of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. The [[Falklands War]] between the United Kingdom and [[Argentina]] did not result in NATO involvement because article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self-defence is only applicable to attacks on member state territories north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].{{sfn|Kaplan|2004|pp=89–91}} On 30&amp;nbsp;May 1982, NATO gained a new member when, following a referendum, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed US forces, under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four echelons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA532510 |title= NATO Command Structure: Considerations for the Future |first1= W.

=== After the Cold War ===

The [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1991 removed the ''de facto'' main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and their focus on the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jul/15/russia.nato |title= Kremlin tears up arms pact with Nato |first= Luke |last= Harding |work=The Observer |date= 14 July 2007 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21551491 |title= The future of NATO: Bad timing |date= 31 March 2012 |journal= [[The Economist]] |accessdate=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.

[[File:Gorbachev Bush 19900601.jpg|thumb|left|Reforms made under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] led to the end of the [[Warsaw Pact]].|alt=Two men in suits sit signing documents at a large table in front of their country's flags. Two others stand outside watching them.]]

The first post-Cold War expansion of NATO came with [[German reunification]] on 3&amp;nbsp;October 1990, when the former [[East Germany]] became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance. This had been agreed in the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]] earlier in the year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east, and there are diverging views on whether negotiators gave commitments regarding further NATO expansion east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141845/mary-elise-sarotte/a-broken-promise |title= A Broken Promise? |first= Mary Elise |last= Sarotte |work= Foreign Affairs |date=September–October 2014 |accessdate= 28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Matlock]], American ambassador to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a &quot;clear commitment&quot; not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the impression that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spiegel review&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last1= Klussmann |first1= Uwe |last2= Schepp |first2= Matthias |last3= Wiegrefe |first3= Klaus |date= 26 November 2009 |title= NATO's Eastward Expansion: Did the West Break Its Promise to Moscow? |url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html |work= [[Spiegel Online]] |accessdate= 7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Gorbachev wrote in his ''Memoirs'', that &quot;during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east,&quot;{{sfn|Gorbachev|1996|p=675}} and

As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps|Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps]] established. The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the [[Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty]], which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4&amp;nbsp;April 2009, which also included France rejoining the [[NATO Military Command Structure]], while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.&lt;ref name=WP-France/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-france&gt;{{cite news |title=Sarkozy military plan unveiled |last=Stratton |first=Allegra |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/17/france.military |work=The Guardian  |location=UK |date=17 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enlargement and reform ===

Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, like the [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] initiative and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. In 1998, the [[NATO–Russia relations|NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council]] was established. On 8&amp;nbsp;July 1997, three former communist countries, [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999. Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29&amp;nbsp;March 2004, shortly before the [[2004 Istanbul summit]]. In Istanbul, NATO launched the [[Istanbul Cooperation Initiative]] with four [[Persian Gulf]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/history/index.html |title= History |publisher= NATO |date= 15 December 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished. In 1997, NATO reached agreement on a significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to just 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1997/s971216aa.htm |title= Statement by Secretary of State Madeleine K.

On 19&amp;nbsp;June 2003, a further restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), was established in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia, United States, and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Allied Command Operations]] (ACO).

The [[2006 Riga summit]] was held in [[Riga]], Latvia, and highlighted the issue of energy security. It was the first [[NATO summit]] to be held in a country that had been part of the [[Soviet Union]]. At the [[2008 Bucharest summit|April 2008 summit]] in [[Bucharest]], Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062445/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/03/nato.members/index.html |date=7 April 2008 |title=U.S. wins NATO backing for missile defense shield – CNN.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a [[NATO missile defence system|missile defence system]]. Studies for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on [[anti-ballistic missile]]s being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] criticized it as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/medvedev-calls-missile-defense-a-threat-to-russia/2012/03/23/gIQA9Id2VS_story.html |title= Medvedev calls missile defense a threat to Russia |work=The Washington Post |first= Will |last= Englund |date= 23 March 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military operations ==

=== Early operations ===

No military operations were conducted by NATO during the Cold War. Following the end of the Cold War, the first operations, ''Anchor Guard'' in 1990 and ''Ace Guard'' in 1991, were prompted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Airborne Early Warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of South Eastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Operations&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aco.nato.int/resources/21/NATO%20Operations,%201949-Present.pdf | title=NATO’s Operations 1949 - Present | publisher=NATO | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bosnian War]] began in 1992, as a result of the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The deteriorating situation led to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 816]] on 9&amp;nbsp;October 1992, ordering a [[no-fly zone]] over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1993 with [[Operation Deny Flight|Operation ''Deny Flight'']]. From June 1993 until October 1996, [[Operation Sharp Guard|Operation ''Sharp Guard'']] added maritime enforcement of the [[arms embargo]] and [[economic sanctions]] against the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 28&amp;nbsp;February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by [[Banja Luka incident|shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft]] violating the no-fly zone.{{sfn|Zenko|2010|pp=133–134}}

On 10 and 11 April 1994, during the [[Bosnian War]], the [[United Nations Protection Force]] called in air strikes to protect the [[Goražde]] safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] jets acting under NATO direction.{{sfn|Zenko|2010|p=134}} This resulted in the taking of 150&amp;nbsp;U.N. personnel hostage on 14&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=NATO Handbook: Evolution of the Conflict|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb050102.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011107101023/http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb050102.htm|archivedate=7 November 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.philly.com/1995-05-31/news/25674772_1_bosnian-serbs-bosnian-government-bosnian-war |title= U.N.

NATO air strikes that year helped bring the [[Yugoslav wars]] to an end, resulting in the [[Dayton Agreement]] in November 1995.&lt;ref name=zenko137/&gt; As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under [[Operation Joint Endeavor|Operation ''Joint Endeavor'']], named [[IFOR]]. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO nations in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller [[SFOR]], which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations were then passed onto [[EUFOR Althea|European Union Force Althea]].{{sfn|Clausson|2006|p=94–97}} Following the lead of its member nations, NATO began to award a service medal, the [[NATO Medal]], for these operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/02/army_natomedal_022209w/ |title= Thousands more now eligible for NATO Medal |work= [[Army Times]] |first= Jim |last= Tice |date= 22 February 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to stop [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s Serbian-led crackdown on [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199|Resolution 1199]] on 23&amp;nbsp;September 1998 to demand a ceasefire.

Though the campaign was criticized for [[Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force|high civilian casualties]], including bombing of the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|Chinese embassy in Belgrade]], Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3&amp;nbsp;June 1999, ending the [[Kosovo War]]. On 11&amp;nbsp;June, Milošević further accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN resolution 1244]], under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence.&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2000/kosovo-report-card.aspx |title= Kosovo Report Card |date= 28 August 2000 |work= [[International Crisis Group]] |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August–September 2001, the alliance also mounted [[Operation Essential Harvest|Operation ''Essential Harvest'']], a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/macedonia/1357773/Macedonia-mission-a-success-says-Nato.html |title= Macedonia mission a success, says Nato |work=The Daily Telegraph  |first= Toby |last= Helm |date= 27 September 2001 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2013|12|01}}, 4,882&amp;nbsp;KFOR soldiers, representing 31&amp;nbsp;countries, continue to operate in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aco.nato.int/resources/site7423/General/Articels%202013/NATO%20FACTS/2013-12-01%20KFOR%20Placemat-final.pdf |title= Kosovo Force (KFOR) Key Facts and Figures |publisher= NATO |format= PDF |date= 1 December 2013 |accessdate= 4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US, the UK, and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/24/nato.un/ |title= NATO reaffirms power to take action without U.N. approval |work= [[CNN]] |date= 24 April 1999 |accessdate= 4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on [[Yugoslavia]], and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its [[1999 Washington summit|Washington summit]] in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.&lt;ref name=&quot;nato.int&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb120704.htm |title= Allied Command Atlantic |accessdate=3 September 2008 |work=NATO Handbook |publisher=NATO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813225955/http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb120704.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11th attacks]] in the United States caused NATO to invoke Article&amp;nbsp;5 of the NATO Charter for the first time in the organization's history. The Article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4&amp;nbsp;October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm |title=NATO Update: Invocation of Article 5 confirmed – 2 October 2001 |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included [[Operation Eagle Assist|Operation ''Eagle Assist'']] and [[Operation Active Endeavour|Operation ''Active Endeavour'']], a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea which is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general which began on 4&amp;nbsp;October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aco.nato.int/resources/21/NATO%20Operations,%201949-Present.pdf |title= NATO's Operations 1949-Present |work= NATO |date= 22 January 2010 |accessdate= 4 September 2013 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance showed unity: on 16 April 2003, NATO agreed to take command of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), which includes troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two nations leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11&amp;nbsp;August, and marked the first time in NATO's history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Auerswald, and Stephen M. Saideman, eds. ''NATO in Afghanistan: Fighting Together, Fighting Alone'' (Princeton U.P., 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rodriguez at Italian command change in Herat.jpg|thumb|ISAF General [[David M. Rodriguez]] at an Italian change of command in [[Herat]].|alt=A general hands a NATO flag from a soldier on the left to one on the right. ]]

ISAF was initially charged with securing [[Kabul]] and surrounding areas from the [[Taliban]], [[al Qaeda]] and factional warlords, so as to allow for the establishment of the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] headed by [[Hamid Karzai]]. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/mandate/unscr/resolution_1510.pdf |title=UNSC Resolution 1510, October 13, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISAF Chronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/chronology/index.html |title=ISAF Chronology |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31&amp;nbsp;July 2006, the ISAF additionally took over [[Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2006|military operations in the south of Afghanistan]] from a US-led anti-terrorism coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a1qU01AKOHT8 |title= NATO Takes Control of East Afghanistan From U.S.-Led Coalition |first= Alex |last= Morales |date= 5 October 2006|accessdate= 4 September 2013 |work= [[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the intensity of the fighting in the south, in 2011 France allowed a squadron of [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]] fighter/attack aircraft to be moved into the area, to [[Kandahar International Airport|Kandahar]], in order to reinforce the alliance's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1002456&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-NC_01 |title=La France et l'OTAN |work=Le Monde  |language=French |location=France |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its [[2012 Chicago Summit]], NATO endorsed a plan to end the Afghanistan war and to remove the NATO-led ISAF Forces by the end of December 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 20120521&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO sets &quot;irreversible&quot; but risky course to end Afghan war|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE84J02C20120521?sp=true|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=22 May 2012|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAF was disestablished in December 2014 and replaced by the follow-on training [[Resolute Support Mission]].

=== Iraq training mission ===

{{Main|NATO Training Mission – Iraq}}

In August 2004, during the [[Iraq War]], NATO formed the [[NATO Training Mission – Iraq]], a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the US led [[Multinational Force – Iraq|MNF-I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfcnaples.nato.int/training_mission_iraq.aspx Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established at the request of the [[Iraqi Interim Government]] under the provisions of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546]]. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17&amp;nbsp;December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/17/us-iraq-withdrawal-nato-idUSTRE7BG0IK20111217 |title= NATO closes up training mission in Iraq |agency=Reuters |first= Rania |last= El Gamal |date= 17 December 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 17&amp;nbsp;August 2009, NATO deployed warships in an operation to protect maritime traffic in the [[Gulf of Aden]] and the Indian Ocean from [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]], and help strengthen the navies and coast guards of regional states. The operation was  approved by the [[North Atlantic Council]] and involves warships primarily from the United States though vessels from many other nations are also included. Operation ''Ocean Shield'' focuses on protecting the ships of Operation ''Allied Provider'' which are distributing aid as part of the [[World Food Programme]] mission in [[Somalia]]. [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[South Korea]] have sent warships to participate in the activities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manw.nato.int/page_operation_ocean_shield.aspx |title=Operation ''Ocean Shield'' |publisher=NATO |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manw.nato.int/page_news_archive_OOS_%202010.aspx |title=2009 Operation ''Ocean Shield'' News Articles |publisher=NATO |date= October 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation seeks to dissuade and interrupt pirate attacks, protect vessels, and abetting to increase the general level of security in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_48815.htm |title=Operation Ocean Shield purpose |last= |first= |date=July 12, 2016 |access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libya intervention ===

{{Main|2011 military intervention in Libya}}

During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], violence between protestors and the Libyan government under Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] escalated, and on 17&amp;nbsp;March 2011 led to the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], which called for a ceasefire, and authorized military action to protect civilians. A&amp;nbsp;coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya shortly afterwards. On 20 March 2011, NATO states agreed on enforcing an arms embargo against Libya with [[Operation Unified Protector|Operation ''Unified Protector'']] using ships from NATO [[Standing NRF Maritime Group 1|Standing Maritime Group&amp;nbsp;1]] and [[Standing NRF Mine Countermeasures Group 1|Standing Mine Countermeasures Group&amp;nbsp;1]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NATOSecGen1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-E403D555-2A5EEC9A/natolive/news_71689.htm?mode=pressrelease|title=Statement by the NATO Secretary General on Libya arms embargo|publisher=NATO|date=22 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional ships and submarines from NATO members.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATOPressBriefing1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-83A5384E-C37D94AC/natolive/opinions_71716.htm?selectedLocale=en|title=Press briefing by NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu, Brigadier General Pierre St-Amand, Canadian Air Force and General Massimo Panizzi, spokesperson of the Chairman of the Military Committee|publisher=NATO|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would &quot;monitor, report and, if needed, [[interdiction|interdict]] vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or [[mercenary|mercenaries]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATOSecGen1&quot;/&gt;

NATO has twenty-eight members, mainly in Europe and North America. Some of these countries also have territory on multiple continents, which can be covered only as far south as the [[Tropic of Cancer]] in  the Atlantic Ocean, which defines NATO's &quot;area of responsibility&quot; under Article 6 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]]. During the original treaty negotiations, the United States insisted that colonies like the [[Belgian Congo]] be excluded from the treaty.{{sfn|Collins|2011|pp=122–123}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/ebookshop/video/declassified/#/en/encyclopedia/the_birth_of_nato/the_key_issues_of_contention/the_area_of_responsibility/ |title= The area of responsibility |work= NATO Declassified |publisher= NATO |date= 23 February 2013 |accessdate= 28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[French Algeria]] was however covered until [[Algerian independence referendum, 1962|their independence]] on 3 July 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-C6AD72DE-2E05A89E/natolive/topics_67656.htm?selectedLocale=en |title= Washington Treaty |work= NATO |date= 11 April 2011 |accessdate= 28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve of these twenty-eight are original members who joined in 1949, while the other sixteen joined in one of seven enlargement rounds.

From the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, [[France]] pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed &quot;Gaullo-Mitterrandism&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009, the latter being disbanded the following year.

=== Enlargement ===
{{Main|Enlargement of NATO}}
[[File:History of NATO enlargement.svg|thumb|NATO has added 12 new members since the [[German reunification]] and the end of the [[Cold War]].|alt=A map of Europe with countries labeled in shades of blue, green, and yellow based on when they joined NATO.]]

New membership in the alliance has been largely from [[Central and Eastern Europe]], including former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Accession to the alliance is governed with individual [[Membership Action Plan]]s, and requires approval by each current member. NATO currently has three candidate countries that are in the process of joining the alliance: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. On 2 December 2015, NATO Foreign Ministers decided to invite Montenegro to start accession talks to become the 29th member of the Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliance invites Montenegro to start accession talks to become member of NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_125370.htm|website=NATO|publisher=NATO|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NATO official statements, the Republic of Macedonia is always referred to as the &quot;former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot;, with a footnote stating that &quot;Turkey recognizes the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name&quot;. Though Macedonia completed its requirements for membership at the same time as [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]], NATO's most recent members, its accession was blocked by Greece pending a resolution of the [[Macedonia naming dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/14/business/macedonia-prime-minister-greece/ |title= Macedonian PM: Greece is avoiding talks over name dispute |first= Oliver |last= Joy |work= CNN |date= 16 January 2014 |accessdate= 18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to support each other in the process, new and potential members in the region formed the [[Adriatic Charter]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/12/09/feature-02 |title= Montenegro, BiH join Adriatic Charter |date=12 September 2008 |first= Jusuf |last= Ramadanovic |author2=Nedjeljko Rudovic |work=[[Southeast European Times]] |accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was also named as an aspiring member, and was promised &quot;future membership&quot; during the 2008 summit in Bucharest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=George J, Teigen JM |year=2008 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a907490331~db=all?jumptype=alert |title=NATO Enlargement and Institution Building: Military Personnel Policy Challenges in the Post-Soviet Context |journal=European Security |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=346 |doi=10.1080/09662830802642512}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in 2014, US President Barack Obama said the country was not &quot;currently on a path&quot; to membership.&lt;ref name = &quot;Obama says no&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last = Cathcourt |first = Will |date = 27 March 2014 |title = Obama Tells Georgia to Forget About NATO After Encouraging It to Join |url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/27/obama-tells-georgia-to-forget-about-nato-after-encouraging-it-to-join.html |work = [[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate = 15 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia continues to oppose further expansion, seeing it as inconsistent with understandings between Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and European and American negotiators that allowed for a peaceful German reunification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel review&quot;/&gt; NATO's expansion efforts are often seen by Moscow leaders as a continuation of a Cold War attempt to surround and isolate Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7312045.stm |work=BBC News | title=Medvedev warns on Nato expansion | date=25 March 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they have also been criticised in the West.&lt;ref name = &quot;Art1998 383 to 384&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Art|1998|pp=383–4}}: &quot;The United States and its NATO allies have gotten themselves into a real pickle ...

The [[European Union]] (EU) signed a comprehensive package of arrangements with NATO under the [[Berlin Plus agreement]] on 16&amp;nbsp;December 2002. With this agreement the EU was given the possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, on the condition that NATO itself did not want to act—the so-called &quot;[[right of first refusal]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bram Boxhoorn, ''Broad Support for NATO in the Netherlands'', 21 September 2005, {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218090444/http://www.ataedu.org/article_new.php?id=107 |date=18 February 2007 |title=ATAedu.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a &quot;double framework&quot; for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme. Additionally, NATO cooperates and discusses its activities with numerous other non-NATO members. The [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] was established in 1994 to coordinate in a similar way with [[Foreign relations of Israel|Israel]] and countries in North Africa. The [[Istanbul Cooperation Initiative]] was announced in 2004 as a dialog forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue. The four participants are also linked through the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-4CA2943D-E00ED2BF/natolive/51288.htm |title=NATO Partner countries |publisher=Nato.int |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political dialogue with Japan began in 1990, and since then, the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries that do not form part of any of these cooperation initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;NATO, [http://www.nato.int/summit2009/topics_en/12-contact_countries.html Relations with Contact Countries]. Retrieved January 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, NATO established a set of general guidelines that do not allow for a formal institutionalisation of relations, but reflect the Allies' desire to increase cooperation. Following extensive debate, the term &quot;Contact Countries&quot; was agreed by the Allies in 2000. By 2012, the Alliance had broadened this group, which meets to discuss issues such as counter-piracy and technology exchange, under the names &quot;partners across the globe&quot; or &quot;global partners&quot;.&lt;ref name=gao&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d101015.pdf|title=NATO PARTNERSHIPS: DOD Needs to Assess U.S. Assistance in Response to Changes to the Partnership for Peace Program|work=[[United States Government Accountability Office]]|date=September 2010|first=|last=|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/51288.htm |title= Partners |publisher= NATO |date= 2 April 2012 |accessdate= 12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], both contact countries, are also members of the [[AUSCANNZUKUS]] strategic alliance, and similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members also aid cooperation. In June 2013, [[Colombia and NATO]] signed an Agreement on the Security of Information to explore future cooperation and consultation in areas of common interest; [[Colombia]] became the first and only [[Latin American]] country to cooperate with NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-5BD27A88-B376D2C3/natolive/news_101634.htm |title=NATO and Colombia open channel for future cooperation |publisher=Nato.int |date=25 June 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main headquarters of NATO is located on Boulevard Léopold&amp;nbsp;III/Leopold III-laan, B-1110 Brussels, which is in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], part of the [[Brussels (municipality)|City of Brussels]] municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/|title=NATO homepage|accessdate=12 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new €750 million headquarters building begun in 2010 is, {{as of|2016|lc=on}}, under construction across from the current complex, and is due for completion by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nato-shows-its-new-hq-be |title= NATO shows off its new HQ-to-be |first= Virginia |last= Mayo |work= Associated Press |date= 13 November 2014 |accessdate= 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems in the current building stem from its hurried construction in 1967, when NATO was forced to move its headquarters from [[Porte Dauphine]] in Paris, France following the French withdrawal.{{sfn|Collins|2011|p=26}}&lt;ref name=bigmove/&gt;

The staff at the Headquarters is composed of national delegations of member countries and includes civilian and military liaison offices and officers or diplomatic missions and diplomats of partner countries, as well as the International Staff and International Military Staff filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49284.htm |title=NATO Headquarters |publisher=Nato.int |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-governmental citizens' groups have also grown up in support of NATO, broadly under the banner of the [[Atlantic Council]]/[[Atlantic Treaty Association]] movement.

=== NATO Council ===

Like any alliance, NATO is ultimately governed by its 28 member states. However, the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and other agreements outline how decisions are to be made within NATO. Each of the 28 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National delegations to NATO What is their role? | publisher=NATO | date = 18 June 2007 | url = http://www.nato.int/issues/national_delegations/tasks.html | accessdate =15 July 2007 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070714120337/http://www.nato.int/issues/national_delegations/tasks.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate =14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior permanent member of each delegation is known as the Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO [[List of diplomatic missions to NATO|through embassies in Belgium]].

Together, the Permanent Members form the [[North Atlantic Council]] (NAC), a body which meets together at least once a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving [[foreign minister]]s, [[Defense Minister|defence minister]]s or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the [[NATO Quint|Quint]], which is an informal discussion group within NATO. [[NATO summit]]s also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7cfc8ac6-ab17-11e4-91d2-00144feab7de.html |title= Battle for Ukraine: How a diplomatic success unravelled |work= The Financial Times |date= 3 February 2015 |accessdate= 4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meetings of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the [[Secretary General of NATO]] and, when decisions have to be made, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.

=== NATO Parliamentary Assembly ===
{{Main|NATO Parliamentary Assembly}}
[[File:NATO Parliamentary Assembly London 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]], an intergovernmental organization of NATO and associate countries' elected representatives, meets in London prior to the start of the [[2014 Newport summit]].|alt=A large baroque yellow and gold room with a stage on the left and long tables filled with men and women in suits on the right.]]

The body that sets broad strategic goals for NATO is the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]] (NATO-PA) which meets at the Annual Session, and one other during the year, and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. [[Karl A. Lamers]], German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the [[Bundestag]] and a member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], became president of the assembly in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=2294 ''Press Statement: German MP Karl A. Lamers elected President of NATO PA'']. [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]], 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.

The Assembly is the political integration body of NATO that generates political policy [[Political agenda|agenda setting]] for the NATO Council via reports of its five committees:
* Committee on the Civil Dimension of Security
* Defence and Security Committee
* Economics and Security Committee
* Political Committee
* Science and Technology Committee

These reports provide impetus and direction as agreed upon by the national governments of the member states through their own [[Political system|national political processes]] and influencers to the NATO administrative and executive organizational entities.

=== Military structures ===
[[File:Petr Pavel 2012.JPG|thumbnail|upright|[[Petr Pavel]], [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]] since 2015|alt=An older man with a gray beard, red beret, and olive green military suit.]]

NATO's military operations are directed by the [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]], and split into two Strategic Commands commanded by a senior US officer and (currently) a senior French officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.act.nato.int/organization/hq-sact/whos-who/300-supreme-allied-commander-transformation |title=General Stéphane Abrial, French Air Force, assumed duties as Supreme Allied Commander Transformation in summer 2009 |publisher=Act.nato.int |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee|Military Committee]] for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command.&lt;ref name=aco/&gt;

Each country's delegation includes a Military Representative, a senior officer from each country's armed forces, supported by the International Military Staff. Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee, a body responsible for recommending to NATO's political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49633.htm |title= Topic: The Military Committee |work= NATO |date= 5 March 2012 |accessdate= 5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]] is [[Petr Pavel]] of the [[Czech Republic]], since 2015.

Like the Council, from time to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior military officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the [[NATO Military Command Structure]], which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/06/17/france.nato/ |title= France to rejoin NATO command |work= [[CNN]] |date= 17 June 2008 |accessdate= 4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case in the lead up to [[Iraq War|Operation ''Iraqi Freedom'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas | last = Fuller | title = Reaching accord, EU warns Saddam of his 'last chance' | work=International Herald Tribune | date = 18 February 2003 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/eu_ed3__1.php | accessdate =15 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012115843/http://iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/eu_ed3__1.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.

The [[structure of NATO]] evolved throughout the [[Cold War]] and its aftermath. An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 as it became clear that NATO would need to enhance its defences for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, [[Allied Command Europe]] and its headquarters ([[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]]) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aco.nato.int/page14612223.aspx |title= 1949-1952: Creating a Command Structure for NATO |work= NATO |accessdate= 4 September 2013 |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders were the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR) and the [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (SACLANT). The current arrangement is to separate responsibility between [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), responsible for transformation and training of NATO forces, and [[Allied Command Operations]] (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Eide | last = Espen Barth |author2=Frédéric Bozo | title = Should NATO play a more political role? | work=Nato Review| publisher=NATO | date = Spring 2005 | url = http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/issue1/english/debate.html | accessdate =15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including [[Eurocorps]], [[I. German/Dutch Corps]], [[Multinational Corps Northeast]], and [[NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps]] among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_50088.htm |title= The Rapid Deployable Corps |work= NATO |date= 26 November 2012 |accessdate= 4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, in the wake of the [[War in Donbass]], meetings of NATO ministers decided that Multinational Corps Northeast would be augmented so as to develop greater capabilities, to, if thought necessary, prepare to defend the Baltic States, and that a new [[Multinational Division Southeast (NATO)|Multinational Division Southeast]] would be established in Romania. Six [[NATO Force Integration Units]] would also be established to coordinate preparations for defence of new Eastern members of NATO.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31137760 NATO Readjusts as Ukraine Crisis Looms], 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multinational Division Southeast was activated on December 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jfcnaples.nato.int/page6814941/nato-activates-new-multinational-division-southeast-in-bucharest. Headquarters Multinational Division South – East (HQ MND-SE) is a North Atlantic Council (NAC) activated NATO military body under operational command (OPCOM) of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) which may be employed and deployed in peacetime, crisis and operations by NATO on the authority of the appropriate NATO Military Authorities by means of an exercise or operational tasking issued in accordance with the Command and Control Technical Arrangement (C2 TA) and standard NATO procedures. https://www.jfcnaples.nato.int/operations/nato-force-structures/MNDSE&lt;/ref&gt;
