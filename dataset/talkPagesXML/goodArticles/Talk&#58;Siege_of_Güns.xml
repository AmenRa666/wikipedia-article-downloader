== Uprising by the Janissaries or a powerful army collected in Vienna? ==

&quot;After the final unsuccessful attack, the Turkish leadership were forced to decamp due to an uprising by the Janissaries.&quot; is written in the article [[Kőszeg]].

I propose to check this information because it contradicts the information written in this article that sultan had not the courage to face a powerful army collected in Vienna.--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 23:10, 20 February 2011 (UTC)

:I found that info in couple sources, but if you have reliable source about 'an uprising by the Janissaries', feel free to insert it as an alternative reason for Suleiman's withdrawal. [[User:Kebeta|Kebeta]] ([[User talk:Kebeta|talk]]) 14:10, 21 February 2011 (UTC)
:: I think that your sources are quite reliable. If I find source about 'an uprising by the Janissaries' I will introduce it to the article.--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 14:30, 21 February 2011 (UTC)
:::How does a comment about courage fit into your NPOV? Why not comment also that the Habsburg Emperor did not have the courage to face Ottomans so he fled to Vienna? So you think war is all about courage?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.14.128.150|98.14.128.150]] ([[User talk:98.14.128.150|talk]]) 00:13, 26 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::::It may be more appropriate use another word and to replace &quot;courage&quot; with more appropriate word (i.e. intention), regardless what source says. --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 09:50, 1 March 2011 (UTC)
:::::Antidiskriminator, you are welcome to rewrite that info. IP, I tend to agree with you &lt;small&gt;&quot;that the Habsburg Emperor did not have the courage to face Ottomans&quot;&lt;/small&gt;, just find sources to back that claim, and add it into the article. --[[User:Kebeta|Kebeta]] ([[User talk:Kebeta|talk]]) 18:38, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

== Ottomans were not defeated ==

Funny, the text and the side bar are in contradiction. In sidebar it is claimed that the Ottomans were defeated and in the text just the reverse is implied. The fact (according to history books) is that although the defenders fought well the fort was finally captured by the Ottomans (Aug. 28) . I'll call the editor. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 09:45, 1 March 2011 (UTC)
:No, the fort wasn't captured. The outcome has two versions. In both version the Ottomans didn't captured the fort, but in one version they were allowed to raise the Turkish flag (only few Turks - token force). Anyway, Suleiman withdrew, and did not continue towards Vienna as previously planned, but homeward (nor he captured the fort - it was in the defenders hands all the time). Regards, [[User:Kebeta|Kebeta]] ([[User talk:Kebeta|talk]]) 10:39, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

This article needs a review by an expert. I checked several sources (Austrian historian [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]], British historian [[Lord Kinross]], Romanian historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] as well as Turkish sources) 
Those sources don't agree with the two versions of the outcome presented in the article. According to sources Güns was captured by [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]].   [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 21:19, 1 March 2011 (UTC)
::Then start disputing them already. Just bring here the source that you have checked, and we will all see them, and decide how to solve the problem (if there is one). I am not sure what expert are you expecting here? --[[User:Kebeta|Kebeta]] ([[User talk:Kebeta|talk]]) 21:45, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

A French translation of Jurischitz's own report of this siege written to his master Ferdinand can be found in Charriere vol i p 215 etc Also in Monumenta Hungariae Historica vol i p 169. The fort was formally capitulated. Jurischitz was a former ambassador to Ottoman Porte and was a good friend of Pargali Ibrahim Pasha, who was leading the siege. He used this to obtain very good conditions. Güns was not pillaged. Ten janissaries entered the forte and erected an Ottoman flag.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.113.196.36|69.113.196.36]] ([[User talk:69.113.196.36|talk]]) 05:34, 29 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::The article talks about two versions of the outcome, but there is really one version. Someone who is more into Wikipedia should clean this article up.
