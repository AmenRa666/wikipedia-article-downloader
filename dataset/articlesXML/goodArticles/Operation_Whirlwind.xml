{{Campaignbox Croatian War of Independence}}

'''Operation Whirlwind''' ({{lang-hr|Operacija Vihor}})&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a failed [[Croatian Army]]  (HV) offensive in the [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] region of [[Croatia]], fought from 11&amp;ndash;13 December 1991, during the early stages of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. The offensive employed a single infantry [[brigade]] as the main attacking force, supported by a bridging unit and a handful of tanks and [[armoured personnel carrier]]s. Although the offensive met hardly any resistance in its initial stage, achieving tactical surprise, the operation was poorly planned, supported and executed as a result of limited training and combat experience. The offensive established a short-lived [[bridgehead]], evacuated in panic two days after the operation commenced, under tank and mortar fire from the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) deployed north of [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]].

The operation was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate command and control methods applied by the [[Sisak]] Operational Group in charge of the offensive. It also lacked clear objectives. Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, but found that there was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led [[Admiral]] [[Davor Domazet-Lošo]] to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.

==Background==
{{main|Croatian War of Independence}}
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions worsened. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' – JNA) confiscated [[Croatia]]'s [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] (''Teritorijalna obrana'' - TO) weapons to minimize resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] by [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]],&lt;ref name=Hoare118&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around Knin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[eastern Croatia]].&lt;ref name=MarticICTY&gt;{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by two unsuccessful attempts by [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]], supported by [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Serbia's provinces of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]] to obtain the [[Yugoslav Presidency]]'s approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991–95|Croatian special police]] in March,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|pp=384–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Milošević, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the Federal Presidency.&lt;ref name=Hoare119&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated into the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents, and preventing [[Law enforcement in Croatia|Croatian police]] from intervening.&lt;ref name=Hoare119/&gt; In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as [[SAO Krajina]], with Serbia. The [[Government of Croatia]] viewed this declaration as an attempt to [[secession|secede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the [[Croatian National Guard]] (''Zbor narodne garde'' - ZNG),&lt;ref name=EECIS272&gt;{{harvnb|EECIS|1999|pp=272–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its development was hampered by a [[United Nations]] (UN) [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 713|arms embargo]] introduced in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Independent|10 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October, [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Narodne novine|8 October 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later the ZNG was renamed the [[Croatian Army]] (''Hrvatska vojska'' - HV).&lt;ref name=EECIS272/&gt; Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, as the [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia]] culminated in the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bjelajac|Žunec|2009|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Battle of Vukovar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|18 November 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In western [[Slavonia]], the HV managed to push back the JNA at several points, and secure [[Papuk]] Mountain in early December in [[Operation Otkos 10]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2012|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order of battle==
The principal force committed to the offensive, planned by the HV [[Sisak]] Operational Group (OG), was the 102nd Infantry Brigade,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; attached to the Sisak OG by the Zagreb Operational Zone command, as the single combat unit deployed as a reserve in the Sisak OG [[area of responsibility]] (AOR).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodalj 1999 16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the 102nd Brigade, commanded by [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Franc Ferenčak,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|102 InfBde}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed an armoured-mechanised unit, attached directly to the Zagreb Operational Zone, into the Sisak OG AOR.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit consisted of eight tanks and two [[armoured personnel carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodalj 1999 28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sisak OG assigned the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO to support the right flank of the 102nd Infantry Brigade.&lt;ref name=Hodalj25&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protection of the left flank was assigned to the 2nd Battalion of the [[2nd Guards Brigade (Croatia)|2nd Guards Brigade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the 2nd Battalion of the 144th Infantry Brigade.&lt;ref name=Hodalj25/&gt;

To reinforce the 102nd Infantry Bridade and the independent armoured-mechanised unit, ten soldiers from the Glina Battalion were attached to each battalion of the 10th and 102nd brigades; two soldiers were assigned to serve as guides for each tank. In addition, the Glina Battalion was tasked with reconnaissance, harassment of JNA's rear and securing captured infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Hodalj25/&gt;

Sisak special police were assigned to support the Glina Battalion, and indirectly the main offensive force. The 36th Engineering-Pontoon Battalion was tasked with the [[Kupa]] River crossing by the 102nd Infantry Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sisak OG was commanded by [[Major General]] [[Božo Budimir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Index.hr|18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croatian Serb TO and JNA defences immediately west of the city of Sisak and north of [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]] were positioned along the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, largely consisting of the JNA 592nd and the 622nd Mechanised Brigades. On the opposite bank, the HV 100th Infantry Brigade held positions west of Sisak, flanked by the 145th Infantry Brigade to its right, and the 10th brigade of the Croatian TO further to the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodalj 1999 16&quot;/&gt; The planned main axis of the Operation Whirlwind extended across the 592nd Mechanised Brigade AOR, commanded by [[Colonel]] Boško Džombić.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HMDCDR|2009|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
[[File:Operation Whirlwind December 1991 Croatia.gif|300px|thumb|right|A map of Operation Whirlwind&lt;br&gt;{{legend-line|black solid 2px|Frontline in December 1991}}{{legend-line|red solid 2px|HV advance 11&amp;ndash;12 December 1991}}{{legend|#e3d6bb|HV bridgehead 11&amp;ndash;13 December 1991}}]]
The HV 102nd Infantry Brigade arrived at the Sisak OG AOR on 11 December 1992, and was ordered to undertake the offensive on the same evening, at about 20:00, leaving no time for any preparation or reconnaissance. A reconnaissance&amp;ndash;sabotage detachment of the HV Glina Battalion and the special police force were ferried across the Kupa River on the night of 11/12 December, capturing the village of Stankovac and preparing to support the 102nd Infantry Brigade at the river crossing. The 36th Engineering-Pontoon Battalion completed a crossing point in the village of [[Šišinec]] by 4:00 and the lead elements of the 102nd Infantry Brigade crossed the Kupa River a half-hour later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river crossing was unopposed until 08:00, when the defending force launched a mortar attack against the crossing point. Nonetheless, the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade cleared the river by 09:00 that morning and reached Stankovac.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodalj 1999 28&quot;/&gt;

After spending three hours crossing the Kupa River, by 13:00 the independent armoured-mechanised unit was headed for Mala Solina, {{convert|6|km|abbr=off}} to the south. However, the unit was intercepted by JNA armour and forced to turn back to Stankovac. To further complicate the situation for the HV, the 10th Brigade did not even start to move south, while the 2nd Battalion of the 102nd Independent Brigade would not cross Kupa before its commander joined the unit at 16:00.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodalj 1999 28&quot;/&gt;

The 3rd Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade reached the village of Vratečko on the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, but was unable to join the force south of Kupa. A bridge separating the battalion from the rest of the brigade remained out of HV's control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodalj 1999 28&quot;/&gt;

By the evening, the 2nd Battalion was ordered to separate from the main axis of the offensive and protect the right flank of the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Brigade&amp;mdash;performing the task originally assigned to the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO. At the same time, the 10th Brigade commanding officer was relieved of duty for failure to advance. Regardless, the unit remained inactive. The HV units that managed to cross the river on 12 December surprised the JNA and reported inflicting considerable casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodalj 1999 28&quot;/&gt;

On the night of 12/13 December, the air temperature dropped to {{convert|-15|C|abbr=on}}, and HV troops sought shelter in Stankovac until the morning&amp;mdash;shrinking the bridgehead held by the 102nd Infantry Brigade. In addition, the 36th Engineering-Platoon Battalion removed engineering equipment from the Kupa crossing, leaving behind only four to six boats. The command post of the 102nd Infantry Brigade remained in [[Stari Farkašić|Farkašić]], detached from the main offensive force in Stankovac.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December, at approximately 07:00, the independent HV armoured-mechanised unit advanced northwest along the Kupa, towards Gračanica. During the advance, one of the tanks was captured and its crew killed after the capture. Nearly simultaneously, the JNA commenced a tank and mortar attack against Stankovac and the river crossing at Šišinec. The HV armoured-mechanised unit and the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade panicked, believing the crossing point was lost, and started to fall back to Šišinec in disarray, sustaining considerable casualties. Since there was no way to transport the remaining HV armour across the Kupa River, the tanks were destroyed by one of the force's own tanks. That tank was then destroyed with explosives to prevent its capture. As there were too few boats at the river crossing to allow a quick retreat, some of the troops swam across the river, causing several to drown in very cold water. The command post of the brigade fell back to [[Galdovo]], while the troops started to retreat to Zagreb. The entire brigade was back in Zagreb by 15 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
While the JNA's casualties are not known, the HV sustained a loss of 18 killed and 18 wounded,&lt;ref name=Vjesnik19Feb&gt;{{harvnb|Vjesnik|19 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a loss of eight tanks, two armoured personnel carriers and seven boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2,011-strong 102nd Infantry Brigade alone suffered 13 dead. Their names were later inscribed on a [[memorial plaque]] in Šišinec, at the Kupa River crossing point. In the aftermath of the offensive, there were speculations in Croatia that the casualties were much higher,&lt;ref name=Vjesnik19Feb/&gt; possibly as many as 60 killed and 200 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vjesnik|12 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Croatian Serb paramilitary unit, &quot;Šiltovi&quot;, based in Glina, is suspected of killing HV troops taken as [[prisoners of war]] during the retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Croatian Serb forces killed 21 civilians in the [[Joševica massacre]] as retribution for the HV offensive.&lt;ref name=Josevica&gt;{{harvnb|HRT|9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killing was investigated by SAO Krajina authorities, which concluded that the killings were in revenge for the deaths of 21 Serb paramilitaries in the village of Gračenica in Operation Whirlwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Amnesty International|1992|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Croatian authorities charged six individuals with war crimes committed in the village of [[Joševica]].&lt;ref name=Josevica/&gt;

The failed offensive was investigated by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV [[Brigadier]] Vlado Hodalj.&lt;ref name=Vjesnik19Feb/&gt; He concluded that the offensive failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate leadership by the Sisak OG as a cause of the failure, pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to the offensive with little, if any, training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the offensive itself had no clear goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian [[Admiral]] [[Davor Domazet-Lošo]] also criticised the offensive as an unnecessary, purely tactical and politically counterproductive move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Domazet|27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodalj praised the Sisak OG command for managing to keep the operation a secret until it was launched, making sure it would surprise the JNA. The secrecy was reflected in the apparent last-minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to the offensive, although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to [[Sunja, Sisak-Moslavina County|Sunja]], to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossings&amp;mdash;relying on oral commands instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, limiting their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodalj concluded that the offensive exceeded needs and capabilities of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that the offensive was prepared for ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the poor preparation of the offensive, the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation Whirlwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodalj|1999|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
