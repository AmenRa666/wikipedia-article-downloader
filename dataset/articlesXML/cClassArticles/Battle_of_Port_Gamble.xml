The '''Battle of Port Gamble''' was an isolated engagement between the United States and the [[Haida people|Haida tribe]] that occurred during, but was not a part of, the [[Yakima War]]. Though a minor incident, it is historically notable for the first [[U.S. Navy]] battle death in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
The Haida of [[British Columbia]] and [[Alaska]] had, since time immemorial, periodically conducted raiding expeditions against the [[Coast Salish peoples]] of the [[Puget Sound]], who were used as a source for slave labor. Haida maritime technology was unsurpassed among [[First Nations]] peoples and raiding parties would travel in [[Pacific Northwest canoes|large dugout canoes]] at distances of up to a thousand miles. The largest of these canoes could hold 100 warriors and their equipment. These raids continued even after the demarcation of the border between the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], then controlled by the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leland |first=Donald |year=1997 |title=Aboriginal Slavery on the Northwest Coast of North America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRHLy4xwcboC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=haida+raids+on+puget+sound&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6XFeSvoPMP&amp;sig=7MfD-Xd06mppSHV1KTxzvosdc6E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fiGBU8PnAcv_oQSI7oLADQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=haida%20raids%20on%20puget%20sound&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=University of California Press|pages=103–112 |isbn=0520206169 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==
In November 1856 a Haida party, consisting of approximately 100 warriors and their accompanying families, entered Puget Sound in a fleet of canoes, in what was then the [[Washington Territory]]. When the force approached the town of [[Steilacoom, Washington|Steilacoom]], residents alerted the U.S. Army garrison at [[Fort Steilacoom]] who, in turn, sent word to the nearby U.S. Navy gunboat ''[[USS Massachusetts (1845)|USS Massachusetts]]''. However, before ''USS Massachusetts'' could arrive the Haida had already withdrawn north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meany&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Port Gamble on Map.jpg|thumb|left|Port Gamble is located on Puget Sound at the entrance to Port Gamble Bay.]]
On November 20 the Haida approached the logging community of [[Port Gamble]], near which was located the [[Port Gamble Band of S’Klallam Indians]] some of the members of which worked at the nearby sawmill. Josiah Keller, superintendent of the mill, sounded the mill's whistle prompting the community to evacuate to a [[blockhouse]] that had been previously constructed for this eventuality. ''USS Massachusetts'' arrived at Port Gamble soon thereafter and, finding that the Haida party had landed and camped at the edge of town, placed a force of 18 armed sailors ashore. The skipper of ''USS Massachusetts'', Commander Samuel Swartout, twice sent messengers to the Haida chiefs with offers to tow them to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], but each offer was rebuffed. The next morning, Swartout began shelling the Haida camp with the deck guns of the ''Massachusetts'', inflicting heavy casualties on the party before they managed to retreat to the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Richardson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The old ship's log reveals the story behind the Port Gamble incident |url= |work=Seattle Times |publisher= |date=2 April 1967 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Haida withdrawal, small arms fire was exchanged between the war party and ''USS Massachusetts''' sailors, resulting in the death of coxswain Gustave Engelbrecht, the only American casualty in the battle and the first U.S. Navy battle death in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=5505 |title=Port Gamble -- Thumbnail History |last1=Wilma |first1=David |last2= |first2= |year=2003 |website=historylink.org |publisher=History Ink |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Haida having abandoned the field, the landing party from ''USS Massachusetts'' proceeded to destroy the beached Haida canoes and burn their provisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meany&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Meany |first=Edmond |year=1909 |title=History of the State of Washington |url= |location= |publisher=[[Macmillan Company]] |pages=205–206 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Joseph |year=1898 |title=History and Government of Washington |url= |location= |publisher=Becktold Print. and Book Mfg. Company |page=88 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later the surviving Haida surrendered. The Haida prisoners were issued a ration of bread and [[molasses]] and given 24 hours to bury their dead, after which they were taken aboard ''USS Massachusetts'' with the intention of deporting them to British Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meany&quot; /&gt; When ''USS Massachusetts'' arrived in Victoria, however, British Columbia governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] objected to the landing of the Haida in the colony. In a dispatch sent to colonial secretary Henry Labouchère, Douglas described Swartout's reaction,&lt;ref name=&quot;despatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/getDoc.htm?id=V56031.scx |title=Despatch to London / Douglas to Labouchere / 2422, CO 305/7, p. 130; received 17 March 1857  |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=bcgenesis.uvic.ca |publisher=[[University of Victoria]] |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|&quot;Captain Swartwout appeared disappointed and irritated at my decision, and somewhat inconsiderately held out a threat of landing his prisoners, with or without my sanction, on some of the uninhabited islets on our coast, but on being reminded that such a course, would be a breach of international law, and immediately become the subject of complaint to his Government, he apologized for the warmth into which he had been inadvertently betrayed.&quot;}}

Swartout and Douglas eventually reached a compromise: the Haida were provisioned with food and new canoes, then dropped-off at the edge of [[Russian America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;despatch&quot; /&gt;

==Aftermath==
One of the Haida killed in the Battle of Port Gamble was a chief and, under Haida custom, a chief of the enemy had to be killed in revenge. On August 11, 1857 the Haida returned to Washington Territory, landing at [[Whidbey Island]]. After inquiring among settlers if there were any chiefs around, they determined that [[Isaac N. Ebey]] was the most important person on the island and shot and decapitated him, before departing for home with Ebey's head as a trophy.&lt;ref name=ebeyscalp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunnysidecemetery.org/history/ebey_family.html |title=The Ebey Family|accessdate=12 May 2010 |date= |work= |publisher=Island County Cemetery District #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brokenshire |first=Doug |year=1993 |title=Washington State Place Names |url= |location= |publisher=Caxton Press|page=58 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increased policing of the [[Canada–United States border]], Haida incursions into Washington steadily dropped in the years following the Battle of Port Gamble. Later incidents involving the Haida and United States tribes occurred in 1859 when [[Suquamish tribe|Suquamish]] warriors repelled a Haida landing on the western shore of [[Bainbridge Island]]; a confrontation between the [[Snohomish tribe|Snohomish]] and Haida in August 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coates |first=Ken |date=2002 |title=Parallel Destinies: Canadian-American Relations West of the Rockies |url= |location= |publisher=University of Washington Press |pages=89–90 |isbn=0295982535 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
