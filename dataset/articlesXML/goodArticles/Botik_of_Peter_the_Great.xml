[[File:Botik of Peter the Great engraving.PNG|thumb|An engraving of a drawing of the boat]]
The '''''Botik'' of Peter the Great''' (also called '''''St. Nicholas''''') was a miniaturized scaled-down warship discovered by [[Peter the Great]] at the Royal [[Izmaylovo Estate]] in 1688.  It was restored by Karshten Brandt, and Peter learned to sail using the boat on waters near [[Moscow]].  It was stored in the [[Kremlin]] of Moscow by Peter and later enshrined in [[St. Petersburg]].  Peter continued to use it in state ceremonies and ordered that the boat be sailed down the [[Neva River]] on 30 August of every year.  It was used in state ceremonies of later Russian monarchs, including the wedding of [[Catherine the Great]] and [[Peter III of Russia]], as well as the centennial celebration of St. Petersburg.  Catherine built a [[boathouse]] in the 1760s to store it.

The boat became less important under Soviet rule, along with other objects from the [[Russian Empire]]; however, patriotism during the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] led to a renewal of the importance of Peter the Great and the ''botik'' along with him.  The boat was moved by the Soviets to the [[Central Naval Museum]] where it remains today.  In 1997, the boat left Russia for the first time to be displayed at the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]].

==Construction and design==
[[File:Botik.jpg|thumb|The boat in the [[Central Naval Museum]] of [[St. Petersburg]]]]
The ''botik'' (small boat) was constructed, either in England or by [[Danes]] in Russia using an English design, in the 1640s,{{r|Cracraft Revolution}} and was then called the ''St. Nicholas''.{{r|РаздолгинФатеев1988}} The boat originally belonged to [[Peter the Great]]'s grandfather;{{r|St. Petersburg Encyclopedia}} an earlier theory held that the boat was a gift from [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] to [[Ivan the Terrible]] in the 1580s.{{r|Martin}} It is the last remnant of the fleet of wooden boats maintained by Peter's father, [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]]; the rest rotted from neglect or were destroyed during the rebellion of [[Stenka Razin]].{{r|CCCP}}

The boat has a [[Draft (hull)|shallow draft]] and a single [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]; it measures {{convert|7|m}} by {{convert|2|m}}.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  It was steered using a [[tiller]] connected to a [[rudder]] attached to the [[sternpost]].{{r|Cracraft Revolution}} It also has four miniature cannons.{{r|Martin}}  Unlike Russian vessels of the time, the boat was designed with the ability to [[Sailing#Beating or &quot;working&quot;|sail against the wind]].{{r|Barrow1834}}{{rp|34}}

==History==

===Discovery===
[[File:Дедушка русского флота.jpg|thumb|Discovery of the ''botik'' by Peter the Great and Franz Timmerman]]
The boat was rediscovered at the Royal [[Izmaylovo Estate]] in 1688 by Peter the Great, then aged about sixteen.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  The derelict boat was pulled from a pile of debris in either a barn or a storeroom.{{r|Martin}}  Peter asked Franz Timmerman, a Dutch seaman, what advantage the newly discovered boat had over Russian boats.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{rp|41–42}}  Timmerman responded that the boat could sail with or against wind and at Peter's direction sought out another Dutch seaman, Karshten Brandt, to restore it.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{rp|41–42}} Peter learned to sail the ship on waters near [[Moscow]].{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{rp|42}}{{r|St. Petersburg Encyclopedia}}

===Peter the Great===
In 1701, Peter had the ''botik'' stored in the [[Kremlin]]'s [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition Cathedral]].{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{r|Hughes2004}}{{rp|178}}  Peter referenced the boat in a draft [[preface]] to his 1720 ''[[Naval Statute]]''.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  The published preface was written by Archbishop [[Feofan Prokopovich]] who wrote that &quot;the ''botik'' served him not only as a childhood pastime, but became the cause of his building a navy, as we now see with wonder&quot;{{r|Cracraft Revolution}} and illustrated this with the [[metaphor]], &quot;great oaks from little acorns grow&quot;.{{r|Hughes2004}}{{rp|22}}  In September of the same year, Prokopovich gave a &quot;Sermon in Praise of the Russian Fleet&quot; where he stated that the boat was &quot;to the navy what the seed is to the tree&quot;{{r|Cracraft Revolution}} and that the boat was &quot;worthy of being clad in gold&quot;.{{r|Hughes2004}}{{rp|178}}

Peter the Great ordered that the boat be displayed in the Kremlin in 1722 in honor of the [[Peace of Nystad]].{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  It was moved from there to the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]] in May 1723.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{r|St. Petersburg Encyclopedia}}  Peter sailed the boat down the [[Neva River]] on his birthday, 30 May 1723, along with a convoy of yachts and other ships of the Admiralty.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  In August of the same year, Peter sailed the boat in a [[regatta]] of the [[Baltic Fleet]] from St. Petersburg to [[Kronshtadt]].{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  The boat was placed in the [[kronverk]] of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] on a [[plinth]], inscribed with the words &quot;From the amusement of the child came the triumph of the man&quot;.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{r|St. Petersburg Encyclopedia}}  After the boat took part in ceremonies on the third anniversary of the Peace of Nystad,  30 August 1724, Peter ordered that it be sailed or rowed to the Alexander Nevsky Monastery every year on 30 August.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}

===Later Russian monarchs===
The ''botik'' was used in many state ceremonies by later Russian monarchies.  The boat appeared in a regatta during the 1745 wedding of [[Peter III of Russia]] and [[Catherine the Great]].{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  Wearing naval uniform, [[Empress Elizabeth]] escorted the ''botik''.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  Catherine had a boathouse built inside the fortress to house the ''botik'' in the 1760s.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{r|St. Petersburg Encyclopedia}}  The boathouse became a major tourist attraction.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}} In 1803, during the centennial celebration of St. Petersburg under [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the boat was featured in a flotilla on the Neva; it was referred to as the &quot;grandfather of the Russian navy&quot;{{r|Анисимов2011}} a name originally given to it by Peter I.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}

In 1872, the boat was brought to Moscow in a cortege led by a brother of [[Alexander II of Russia]] for the bicentennial celebration of Peter's birth.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  It was received by a [[gun salute|101-gun salute]] and displayed in the great Moscow fair.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}

===Soviet era===
The importance of the boat, like most other memorials from [[Imperial Russia]], was reduced in the early Soviet era.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  Guidebooks to [[Leningrad]] at the time did not reference the boat.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  The boat was moved to [[Petergof|Peterhof]] in 1928 and remained there until [[World War II]].{{r|St. Petersburg Encyclopedia}}  During the outbreak of World War II, patriotism related to Peter the Great resurfaced.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  He was referenced as conqueror of Germans and the founder of what became the [[Soviet Navy]].{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}  The importance of the boat increased with him, and it was moved to the [[Central Naval Museum]] of the [[St. Petersburg Bourse]] in September 1940.{{r|Cracraft Revolution}}{{r|St. Petersburg Encyclopedia}}

===Post-Soviet era===
The boat made its first foray outside Russia in 1997 when it was displayed in the [[Winter Garden Atrium]] of the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]] in [[New York City]].{{r|Martin}}  While being displayed as part of the &quot;St. Petersburg: A Cultural Celebration&quot; festival, the boat was attended to by two [[preservationist]]s.{{r|Martin}}  The preservationists attempted to identify the species of [[oak]] used in the boat so that the country of origin could be determined in addition to scraping off dirt and patching cracks.{{r|Martin}}
