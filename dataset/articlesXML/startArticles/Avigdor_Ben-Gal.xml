==Life==

===Early life===
He was born in 1936, in [[Łódź]], Poland, as Janusz Ludwig Goldlust. When he was three years old, World War II broke out with Germany invading Poland. His family left Poland for the [[USSR]], and finally arrived in [[Siberia]]. After his parents disappeared, he eventually arrived in [[Tel Aviv]] with his sister on the [[Children of Zion|Tehran transport]]. They were taken in and raised by a distant cousin.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web|last=Avrech |first=Mira |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20070523,00.html |title=At 3, He Walked Across Russia; Still Tough, General Ben-Gal Commands the Drive into Lebanon |website=People.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military career===
A few years after Israel became independent and won the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], Ben-Gal was drafted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). His first combat experience came during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis|Suez War]] with Egypt. Despite having dreamed of being a doctor, he decided to stay in the army after his mandatory military service was finished. In an interview, he explained his reasons:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I never intended to turn the army into a career, but I remained because I liked it. I loved the Negev, the desert, the fields. I loved speeding in jeeps. Later I got used to the army, and it became a part of me. And maybe also, I was afraid to make a new start in life.&quot;&lt;ref name=people/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, he was the operations chief of a brigade that broke through Egyptian fortifications in the Sinai. He lost half his right foot when his jeep struck a mine. By 1972, he had been appointed commander of a brigade.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

During the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, Ben-Gal commanded the [[7th Armored Brigade (Israel)|7th Armored Brigade]] and oversaw the defense of the [[Golan Heights]] against [[Syria]]n attack. Ben-Gal had foreseen the war two weeks before it started, and had begun preparing his brigade. As the threat of war wasn't being taken seriously in Israel at the time, he had been branded a &quot;madman&quot;. However, when the war broke out, his brigade was the only IDF unit in a state of full readiness.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

The heroic stand of the 7th Armored Brigade and Yanush Ben-Gal's personal heroism and leadership are believed by many to be decisive factors in the Israeli victory over the Syrians.&lt;ref name=epic_encounter&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_9gIR6Fi3UC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Avigdor+Ben-Gal&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Avigdor%20Ben-Gal&amp;f=false |title=The Yom Kippur War: The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East |author=Abraham Rabinovich |page=96 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqehogMZbTwC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Avigdor+Ben-Gal&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=Avigdor%20Ben-Gal&amp;f=false |title=The Yom Kippur War 1973 (1): The Golan Heights |author=Simon Dunstan |page=53 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_s6_k8ngccC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;dq=Avigdor+Ben-Gal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4__sS0LAjl&amp;sig=V0AClsdKJcFBau6qZ18J9DxdT28&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tiemS-CGAsGAlAfi_ZjHCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Avigdor%20Ben-Gal&amp;f=false |title=A Portrait of the Israeli Soldier |author=Reuven Gal |page=179 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eze33.com/pazan/seventh03.htm |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710213107/http://www.eze33.com/pazan/seventh03.htm |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Ben-Gal was appointed head of the [[Northern Command (Israel)|Northern Command]]. He served in this position until late-summer 1981, when he was replaced by General [[Amir Drori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7890 |title=Israel: Lawsuit claims corruption in Congo diamonds for arms deal |website=Minesandcommunities.org |date=2004-02-18 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
In June 1997 he was called to testify in a libel suit that [[Ariel Sharon]] brought against the Israeli newspaper ''[[Ha'aretz]]'' for their claim that he had concealed his plans for an operation into [[Lebanon]] in 1982 - during which Ben Gal was still leading the Northern Command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z99HgBsKp3sC&amp;pg=RA1-PA171&amp;dq=Avigdor+Ben-Gal&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Avigdor%20Ben-Gal&amp;f=false |title=Israel's Lebanon War |author1=Ze'ev Schiff |author2=Ehud Ya'ari |page=171 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His testimony, however, contradicted earlier statements he had made at [[Tel Aviv University]], where he had stated that the greatest problem with the Lebanon War was the &quot;secret, unapproved plan of the defense minister and chief of staff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC&amp;pg=PA724&amp;lpg=PA724&amp;dq=Avigdor+Ben-Gal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X0DdShciu4&amp;sig=EgXhF5jy54nejXDZ3iPPR_zz5m8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6SGmS4PhIcyUtgeAzKX1CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Avigdor%20Ben-Gal&amp;f=false|title=Righteous Victims|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, ''Ha'aretz'' requested that the Attorney General investigate the possibility that Ben-Gal had given false testimony in court in exchange for business favours from Sharon. The complaint noted that shortly before his appearance at the trial, Ben-Gal was sent by Sharon to explore the possibility of a large [[natural gas]] deal in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/10209/ariel-sharon-denies-accusation-of-influencing-witness/ |title=Ariel Sharon denies accusation of influencing witness &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |website=Jweekly.com |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Ben-Gal reportedly submitted an application to train the [[Armed Forces of the Republic of the Congo|Congo Army]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cncblog.congonewschannel.net/2009/07/out-of-africa.html |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727030047/http://cncblog.congonewschannel.net/2009/07/out-of-africa.html |archivedate=July 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;highbeam.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3594610.html |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103074713/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3594610.html |archivedate=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 2002, he was chairman of the board of directors for [[Israel Aerospace Industries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;highbeam.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%201144.html |title=cessna aircraft &amp;#124; klm &amp;#124; north american &amp;#124; 1996 &amp;#124; 1144 &amp;#124; Flight Archive |website=Flightglobal.com |date=1996-05-14 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25978467_ITM|title=Apps - Access My Library - Gale|website=Accessmylibrary.com|accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the board for the [[International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism]].

During a 2007 military conference in [[Latrun]], Ben-Gal sharply criticized what he viewed as a deterioration in the battle readiness of the IDF, and claimed that the IDF's technological revolution has turned soldiers into &quot;bionic machines&quot; and sown fear among senior officers that open criticism would hamper advancement in their own careers. He expressed the view that all the new technologies being introduced were useless, and claimed that it had gotten to the point where commanders prefer to email each other instead of interacting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3471424,00.html|title='IDF chief told me army is full of politicians'|website=Ynet.com|accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 until his death, he served as chairman of the board of directors for N.S.O Group Technologies. Ben-Gal died on February 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3680902,00.html |title=אלוף במיל' אביגדור (יאנוש) בן-גל הלך לעולמו |website=Calcalist.co.il |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
