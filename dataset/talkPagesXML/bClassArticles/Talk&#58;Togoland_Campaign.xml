== Map of Togo ==

{{ping|Keith-264}} I see you have reverted my edit - I do not wish to engage in an edit war over a map, so let's talk it through here. My belief is the fact that &quot;Togo is a colonial artefact&quot; has very little bearing on a modern map being placed at such a prominent position - and the modern state of Togo would not come into place until half a century later, more directly through [[French Togoland]] rather than German Togoland. Isn't parts of Ghana also a colonial artefact? Does a modern map of Ghana not also warrant a place there? The partition map below is far more detailed, might have been a better map to explain the situation - and also corresponds better with the &quot;Aftermath&quot; section, where the future independence of Togo is mentioned.

One more thing - you have also reverted my reformatting efforts, through which I placed several images under more appropriate sections. You could have easily added back the modern Togo map - that is, unless you do not agree with reformatting either.

:Thank you for asking, The war was the origin of modern Togo and the map isn't prominent but like you, I'm constrained by the maps available. I'd prefer a map at the top of the infobox, rather than the photo too. What were the images? I didn't see them.

::Thank you for your response. I would not disagree with the significance of the war to the state of Togo. The issue here is as the first map to appear in the article, it ''is'' more prominent than it should be. A modern map of Togo does little to help the reader understand the war and its aftermath better, and it may even border on being misleading - the campaign, after all, took place not only within the modern borders of Togo, and led to the creation of more than just what eventually evolved into the modern state of Togo. I thought of moving the partition map up to right below the infobox, but then I realized it was rather counter-intuitive to put the result of the war near the top - it probably belongs under the aftermath section. In fact, a modern map of Togo - regardless of its quality - would not easily fit into anywhere in this article. Does one belong under the aftermath header?

::The &quot;images&quot; I was talking about can be seen in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Togoland_Campaign&amp;oldid=742084650 this version], the one you reverted - in which I moved the 1914 Togoland map to the background section, the Kamina radio mast image slightly further up to accommodate the partition map, which I had moved to the aftermath section. I believe those places are where they belong. [[User:Morningstar1814|Morningstar1814]] ([[User talk:Morningstar1814|talk]]) 19:09, 1 October 2016 (UTC)
:::Sorry about that, move them back by all means. Is there a way of getting one of the commons outline maps so show the 1914 colony and Anglo-French partition? Regards [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 21:24, 1 October 2016 (UTC)
::::I do not believe we have a locator map for Togoland yet - which is arguably the case for most former countries/regions. For now I'm leaving the modern Togo map up there before a better solution can be worked out. [[User:Morningstar1814|Morningstar1814]] ([[User talk:Morningstar1814|talk]]) 21:34, 1 October 2016 (UTC)
{{od}}If you ''really'' want to take it out or move it, I'll be happy to wait for something better. Regards [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 21:44, 1 October 2016 (UTC)</text>
