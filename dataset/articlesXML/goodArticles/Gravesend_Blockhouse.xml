'''Gravesend Blockhouse''' was an [[blockhouse|artillery fortification]] constructed as part of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Device Fort|Device plan]] of 1539, in response to fears of an imminent invasion of England by [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It was built at [[Gravesend]] in [[Kent]] along a strategic point along the [[River Thames]] and was operational by 1540. A two-storey, D-shaped building built from brick and stone, it had a circular [[bastion]] overlooking the river and gun platforms extending out to the east and west. It functioned in conjunction with [[Tilbury Fort]] on the other side of the river, and was repaired in 1588 to deal with the threat of [[Spanish Armada|Spanish invasion]], and again in 1667 when the [[Naval history of the Netherlands|Dutch navy]] raided the Thames. A 1778 report recommended alterations to the blockhouse and its defences, leading to the remodelling of the gun platforms and the construction of the new, larger [[New Tavern Fort]] alongside it. In the 1830s the government decided to rely entirely on the newer fort and the old blockhouse was demolished in 1844. Its remains were uncovered in [[archaeological excavation]]s between 1975 and 1976.

==16th century==

===Background===
Gravesend Blockhouse was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the final years of the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Traditionally [[the Crown]] had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1987|p=111}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modest defences, based around simple [[blockhouse]]s and towers, existed in the south-west and along the [[Sussex]] coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1533, Henry then broke with Pope [[Paul III]] in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]] and remarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was the aunt of [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of England now appeared certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Device of 1539===
Henry issued an order, called a &quot;[[Device Fort|device]]&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this programme of work the [[River Thames]] was protected with a mutually reinforcing network of blockhouses at Gravesend, [[Milton Blockhouse|Milton]], and [[Higham Blockhouse|Higham]] on the south side of the river, and [[Tilbury Fort|Tilbury]] and East Tilbury on the opposite bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortifications were strategically placed. London and the newly constructed royal dockyards of [[Deptford Dockyard|Deptford]] and [[Woolwich Dockyard|Woolwich]] were vulnerable to seaborne attacks arriving up the Thames estuary, which was then a major maritime route, with 80 percent of England's exports passing through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1980|p=342}}; {{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Milton and the adjacent town of Gravesend, only {{convert|500|m}} apart, formed a particularly important communications point along the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Kent Council|2004|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the centre for the &quot;Long Ferry&quot; traffic of passengers into the capital, and for the &quot;Cross Ferry&quot; over the river to Tilbury, resulting in the local riverbank becoming lined with [[wharf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|1989|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Kent Council|2004|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first point that an invasion force would be able to easily disembark along the Thames, as before this point the [[mudflat]]s along the sides of the estuary would have made landings difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:Device fort plans black and white Gravesend, Kent.png|thumb|Plan of the blockhouse, after 1715 diagram]]
Gravesend Blockhouse was designed by the [[Office of Works|Clerk of the King's Works]], James Nedeham, and the [[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master of Ordnance]], [[Christopher Morice]], with Robert Lorde serving as the paymaster for the project and Lionel Martin, John Ganyn and Mr Travers acting as the local overseers.&lt;ref name=Smith1980P344&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1980|p=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown bought the land for the fort, along with the space for Gravesend Blockhouse, from William Burston for £66; it is uncertain how much the building work cost, but earlier estimates in 1539 had suggested that it would cost £211 to build such a blockhouse, including the 150,000 bricks and quantities of stone, chalk, lime, timber and labour that would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1980|p=344}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC|Comparing 16th century costs and prices with those of the modern period is challenging. £66 in 1539 could be equivalent to between £37,200 and £16,940,000 in 2014, depending on the price comparison used. £211 in 1539 could equate to between £118,900 and £54,140,000, while £304 in 1553 to between £109,200 and £44,580,000. For comparison, the total royal expenditure on all the Device Forts across England between 1539–47 came to £376,500, with St Mawes, for example, costing £5,018, and Sandgate £5,584.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biddle|Hiller|Scott|Streeten|2001|p=12}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ | title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present| author1 = Lawrence H. Officer | author2= Samuel H. Williamson| postscript =none | mode = cs2|date = 2014| accessdate=29 May 2015 | publisher=MeasuringWorth}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The work was quickly completed, and by 1540 the blockhouse was fully operational.&lt;ref name=Smith1980P344/&gt;

It was approximately {{convert|28|by|21|m}} in size, two storeys tall, forming a D-shape, with a circular bastion at the front, extending into the Thames; another circular [[bastion]] jutted out from the side of the fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Smith|1977|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the building was made of brick, faced with [[ashlar]] stone, with external walls {{convert|2|m}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Smith|1977|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two walls ran alongside either side of the blockhouse, parallel with the river, forming part of the adjacent platforms for mounting additional guns; in 1600, the east platform was described as being {{convert|100|ft}} long and {{convert|14|ft}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Smith|1977|p=153}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear of the blockhouse was overlooked by higher ground and would have been hard to defend.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P19&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort was initially commanded by Captain James Crane, with a garrison of ten men, including his second in command, a porter, six gunners and two soldiers.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P147&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, not all of the gunners worked full-time at the fort, some living and working in the town itself.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P147/&gt; It is uncertain how many artillery pieces the blockhouse was initially equipped with, although it is known that the five blockhouses along the Thames had 108 [[brass]] and [[iron]] guns in total between them in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use===
[[File:Gravesend defences 1588 Thamesis Descriptio.png|thumb|300px|Engraving from 1588 showing the defences along the River Thames, including Gravesend Blockhouse (centre) and the boom]]
In 1553, orders were issued for the artillery pieces to be removed from Gravesend Blockhouse and taken to the [[Tower of London]], although the historian Victor Smith casts doubt on whether this was actually carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1588, however, there was a renewed threat of invasion, this time from Spain; the Spanish Armada sailed from [[A Coruña]], while a separate invasion force was prepared in [[Flanders]], threatening London; [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Rober Dudley]], the [[Earl of Leicester]] was put in charge of the defences along the Thames.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P19/&gt;

When Dudley inspected the blockhouse, Gravesend was found to be in poor condition.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P19/&gt; The gun platforms were unable to bear the weight of cannons, and the defences needed additional artillery and gunpowder; the permanent garrison by now only comprised five gunners.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P19/&gt; One estimate that summer suggested that {{convert|1000|ft}} of structural timber, 300 iron spikes and 10 cartloads of smaller pieces of timber were needed for the repairs.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P151&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans were made to seal off the river with a chain or a boom stretching between the blockhouse and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished at a cost of £305.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC}} Further work was carried out on the defences, possibly including raising earthworks and establishing watch-houses.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P151/&gt; Fears of an invasion persisted for many years afterwards and in 1598 [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard]], the [[Lord High Admiral (United Kingdom)|Lord High Admiral]], expressed his concerns about the effectiveness of the Gravesend Blockhouse in protecting the Thames.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P151/&gt;

==17th century==
[[File:Cornelis Bol. The Blockhouse in Gravesend.png|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Blockhouse in the 17th century]]
A 1600 survey showed 10 pieces of artillery to be ineffective, while the gun platforms on either side of the fort were in bad condition and {{convert|2828|ft}} of planking, 650 joists and over 19 cartloads of other timber was needed for the repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little investment was forthcoming under [[James I of England|James I]] or [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and by 1630 the garrison's pay was in arrears, with the fort was in need of repairs estimated at £1,248.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|pp=152–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money17thC|Comparing 17th century costs and prices with those of the modern period is difficult. £1,248 in 1630 could be equivalent to between £182,300 and £58,720,000 in 2014 terms, depending on the price comparison used. £400 in 1667 could be equivalent to between £56,140 and £11,330,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ | title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present| author1 = Lawrence H. Officer | author2= Samuel H. Williamson| postscript =none | mode = cs2|date = 2014| accessdate=29 May 2015 | publisher=MeasuringWorth}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1631 the blockhouse was equipped with two brass [[demi-culverin]]s and [[saker (cannon)|saker]]s, and an iron [[culverin]], six demi-culverins, four sakers and one [[Minion (cannon)|minion]]; the brass guns, which were needed for naval units, were exchanged for iron weapons in 1635.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1642 [[English Civil War|civil war]] broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and those of [[Roundheads|Parliament]]. Gravesend was controlled by Parliament, who placed it under the command of a military governor who oversaw both this fort and Tilbury, and was used to control traffic entering London and to search for spies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] [[English Restoration|regained the throne]] in 1660 and was petitioned by several royalists who claimed that they should be restored to the command of the blockhouse; William Leonard was ultimately successful.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P154&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defences were repaired and may have been occasionally used by the King as a banqueting hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith1974P154&quot;/&gt;

The Dutch fleet raided up the Thames in June 1667, but did not approach Gravesend Blockhouse due to the threat posed by its guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fort, under the command of Sir John Griffith, was in reality not well prepared for war.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P155&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; £400 was spent on upgrading the blockhouse, artillery was sent from the Tower of London to reinforce the local guns and four infantry companies were detached to guard the site.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P154/&gt;{{efn|name=Money17thC}} The risk of attack ended with the signing of the [[Peace of Breda]] that July, and the blockhouse did not see action.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P155/&gt; Shortly after the Dutch raids, Sir John was removed from his post for apparently demanding payments from ships passing by the blockhouse, a complaint which was repeated in later years under subsequent captains.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P155/&gt;

==18th–19th centuries==
[[File:Captain Sir Thomas Hyde Page (1746–1821) by James Northcote.jpeg|thumb|Sir [[Thomas Hyde Page|Thomas Page]]]]
By the start of the 18th century a complex of building had grown up around the original blockhouse, which now had a [[pier]], a [[dock (maritime)|dock]] and two wharfs alongside it, and a large house built by the King's brother, [[James II of England|James]] the [[Duke of York]], after his return to England, as well as the two lines of approximately 20 guns stretching on either side along the river; it had a garrison of a sergeant, 20 soldiers and a gunner on loan from Tilbury Fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blockhouse itself was no longer used to mount guns but instead acted as the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] for the wider fortification, being able to store 2,500 barrels of gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|pp=156, 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the [[Peace of Utrecht]] in 1713, the number of artillery pieces was reduced to ten, and a survey in 1766 reported that Gravesend was in good condition and equipped with ten 9 lb guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid rising concerns over the threat of a French invasion, Sir [[Thomas Hyde Page|Thomas Page]] surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together and that they could not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Tavern Fort]] was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|pp=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P161&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns continued to be raised that the blockhouse's guns could not fire downriver and by the 1830s it had been decided to focus investment on the New Tavern and Tilbury forts.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P161/&gt; The blockhouse itself fell out of use as a magazine in 1834, being briefly used as a government store, and the adjacent gun platforms were sold off in 1835.&lt;ref name=Smith1974P161/&gt; The blockhouse building was subsequently demolished in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1974|p=161}}; {{cite web|url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1005120|title=Gravesend Blockhouse|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|accessdate = 16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th–21st centuries==

The site of the former Gravesend Blockhouse was excavated in 1975 and 1976 by the Kent Archaeological Society, uncovering parts of the original building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Smith|1977|p=154}}; {{cite web|url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1005120|title=Gravesend Blockhouse|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|accessdate = 16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, which lies in the grounds of the Clarendon Royal Hotel, was protected under UK law as a [[scheduled monument]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1005120|title=Gravesend Blockhouse|publisher=Historic England|mode=cs2|accessdate = 16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
