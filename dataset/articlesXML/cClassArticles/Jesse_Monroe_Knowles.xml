'''Jesse Monroe Knowles''' (July 23, 1919 â€“ April 23, 2006) was a [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], [[businessman]], civic leader, former member of both houses of the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] from [[Calcasieu Parish]], and a survivor of the [[Bataan Death March]] in [[World War II]].

He was born in [[Merryville, Louisiana|Merryville]] in [[Beauregard Parish]] but had resided in Lake Charles since 1935. Knowles graduated from Lake Charles [[High School]] (renamed Lake Charles Boston High School after consolidation).

==A veteran's veteran==
In 1939, Knowles enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]]. He was captured by the [[Japan]]ese army at [[Bataan]] and held in a number of prison camps for 1,228 days. He was in the camp in [[Mukden]], [[Manchuria]], until he was liberated on August 15, 1945.  The Death March was featured in a [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] in 1982 entitled &quot;The Forgotten Hell&quot;.

As a president of the Mayor's Armed Forces Committee, he had regular contact with the [[Fort Polk]] staff in [[Leesville, Louisiana|Leesville]], the seat of [[Vernon Parish]], and urged members of the military to visit Lake Charles. He was a well-known speaker at school programs and veterans' ceremonies.

Knowles was a past commander of his area and district [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. He was a past legislative officer and a past junior vice commander of the VFW Post 2130. He was also a member of W. B. Williamson [[American Legion]] Post 1, the Disabled American Veterans, and the [[American Ex-Prisoners of War]]. He was a past national president of the 27th Bombardment Group Association and was cited as &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by that group. He was a member of the American Defenders of [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor]].

After he returned from the service, he went to work as a draftsman for [[Amoco Oil Company]] and became a fee land supervisor. He retired with thirty-eight years of service from Amoco in 1984 and was thereafter employed by the Lake Charles River Pilots.

==Entering Louisiana politics==
Knowles was first elected to the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the 1959-1960 election cycle. In 1964, Knowles was elected again as a Democrat to the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senate]], in which he served for four terms. He was once named &quot;Outstanding Legislator&quot; by the Lake Charles [[Junior Chamber International]].

In 1969, Senator Knowles emerged as a leading critic of [[sex education]] in public schools. He referred to the organization, the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]], which prepared much of the sex education curriculum then under consideration, as &quot;a [[Communism|communist]] conspiracy&quot;. Speaking against a measure which, had it passed, would have withdrawn state funds from school districts following the SIEUS curriculum, Senator [[Edgar G. &quot;Sonny&quot; Mouton, Jr.]], of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], called sponsors of the legislation, including the Bataan Death March survivor Knowles, &quot;storm troopers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sex Education Bill Killed in Senate by Vidrine Talk&quot;, ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', June 10, 1969, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1979 [[nonpartisan blanket primary]], Knowles did not seek a fifth state Senate term but instead ran for [[lieutenant governor]] in a bid to succeed [[Jimmy Fitzmorris|James E. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Fitzmorris, Jr.]], of [[New Orleans]], who was running instead, unsuccessfully, for governor. Knowles lost, and fellow Democrat [[Bobby Freeman (politician)|Bobby Freeman]] became lieutenant governor for the first of two terms.

Knowles supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[gubernatorial]] candidate [[David C. Treen]] in the 1979 [[general election]]. Early in 1980, Knowles, with just a few weeks remaining in his senate term, switched his party affiliation to Republican. Governor Treen then appointed Knowles, a past chairman of the Louisiana Wildlife Commission, as secretary of the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. However, a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused him to resign the post after only twelve days. Treen later named him to the Louisiana [[Rice]] Promotion Board. He was also elected to the board of directors of the Louisiana Rice Council and served thereafter as president of that group.
