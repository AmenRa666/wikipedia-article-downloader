[[Major]] '''Norman Frederick Hastings''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (14 July 1879 &amp;ndash; 9 August 1915) served as [[Officer Commanding]] New Zealand's 6th (Manawatu) Squadron, [[Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment]].  After serving with British military units during the [[Second Boer War|Second Anglo-Boer War]] in [[South Africa]], he worked as an engineering fitter with the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] workshops at [[Petone]].  He enlisted in the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] at the outbreak of [[World War I]], and served with distinction before dying of wounds after the attack on [[Battle of Chunuk Bair|Chunuk Bair]], [[Gallipoli]], in August 1915. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (second only to the [[Victoria Cross]] for officers), was [[Mentioned in Despatches]], and was one of only 14 members of the [[New Zealand Army]] to receive the French [[Legion of Honour]] decoration during the war.  The memorial flagstaff at Petone railway station appears to have been erected in his honour, and was the site of New Zealand's first public [[Anzac Day]] ceremony on 25 April 1916.

==Early life==
Norman Hastings was born in [[Auckland]] on 14 July 1879, the son of Frederick and Fanny Hastings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=New Zealand Defence Force Personnel File Norman Frederick HASTINGS, New Zealand Archives Reference: AABK 18805 W5515 0006343 | publisher=Archives New Zealand | url =http://www.archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewFullItem.do?code=20524539&amp;digital=yes | work = | pages = | accessdate =25 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=New Zealand Defence Force Personnel File Norman Frederick HASTINGS, New Zealand Archives Reference: AABK 18805 W5539 0052011 | publisher=Archives New Zealand | url =http://www.archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewFullItem.do?code=16792906&amp;digital=yes | work = | pages = | accessdate =25 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Hastings' date of birth is widely disputed and listed differently in three separate locations within his service file.  The widely published 12 July 1885 date would have made Hastings only 14 years old on enlistment in the British Army so is most likely incorrect.  Hastings also gives his date of birth as 12 July 1880 on his enlistment into the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in August 1914, but his date of birth is listed three times in his Territorial Force service file as 14 July 1879 and that is the one listed here.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} He was raised in Brooklyn, [[Wellington]], and his military service began in the 1890s when he served as a [[Private (rank)|private]] for two and a half years with the Wellington City Rifles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;/&gt;

==Boer War==
Hastings took part in the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, serving with British troops despite his New Zealand roots. He enlisted into 34 [[Company (military unit)|Company]] [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] on 10 August 1900. Holding the rank of [[Conductor (Army)|conductor]], he remained with the company until 19 February 1901 when he was transferred at his own request to a mounted unit, [[Rimington's Guides|Rimington's Scouts and Guides]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;/&gt; Shortly before Hastings had arrived, [[Major]] Frederick Damant had taken over command of the unit and it later became known as Damant's Horse. Working with [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] (later [[General]]) [[Bruce Hamilton (British Army officer)|Bruce Hamilton's]] 21st Brigade in [[Cape Colony]] to drive out Boer forces led by [[Christiaan de Wet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Damant'sHorse1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Biggins |authorlink= | title=Damant's Horse| date=13 September 2010 | publisher=AngloBoerWar.com | url =http://www.angloboerwar.com/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=463 | work = | pages = | accessdate =19 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hastings gained the rank of [[sergeant]] and was [[wounded in action]] twice while serving with the unit. For a six-month period, he was detached from Damant's Horse, serving in Hamilton's [[Military intelligence|field intelligence]] unit, during which time he commanded a group of native scouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;/&gt;

==Between the wars==
After the conclusion of the Boer War, Hastings returned to New Zealand. In 1905, he recommenced his military service by enlisting in the [[Karori]] Defence Rifle Club.  He served with the Club until 1908 when he married Hilda May Barr of Masterton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Bryan | last=Curran |authorlink= | title=NEW-ZEALAND-L Archives | date=23 May 2001 | publisher=Rootsweb, Ancestry.com | url =http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/NEW-ZEALAND/2001-05/0990567569 | work = | pages = | accessdate =19 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 June 1909, Hastings was appointed [[Commander]] of the Dominion Scouts, E Squadron 2nd [[Mounted infantry|Mounted Rifles]] [[Regiment]], a volunteer unit in Wellington, holding the rank of acting [[lieutenant]]. He later passed a promotion examination and was formally commissioned as a lieutenant with effect 1 December 1909. In 1911 he tried unsuccessfully to gain an appointment to the permanent staff of the [[New Zealand Army]] as an adjutant or instructor. During a period of significant reorganisation of the [[New Zealand Military Forces]], Hastings was instead posted to A Squadron, [[6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles]], which was established as a new unit on 17 March 1911. Serving in a part-time capacity, he then successfully passed the examination for promotion to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and was granted that rank with effect 16 October 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= | last=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |authorlink= | title=6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles | date=16 March 2011 | publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage | url =http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/6th-manawatu-mounted-rifles | work = | pages = | accessdate =19 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Hastings settled in Petone where he commenced working for the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] as an engineering fitter and foreman, and with his wife raised two children: Francis Norman and Marjory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWMM&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Armoury Information Centre |authorlink= | title=Auckland War Memorial Museum Cenotaph, Norman Frederick Hastings | year=2011 | publisher=Auckland War Memorial Museum | url =http://muse.aucklandmuseum.com/databases/general/Cenotaph/6562.detail?Ordinal=1&amp;c_surname_search=hastings&amp;c_firstname_search=n | work = | pages = | accessdate =18 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Petone&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Karen | last=Astwood |authorlink= | title=ANZAC Memorial Flagpole | date=10 February 2011 | publisher=New Zealand Historic Places Trust | url =http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=9438&amp;m=advanced | work = | pages = | accessdate =18 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
After the [[New Zealand Government]] declared war on [[Germany]] it decided to establish the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] for overseas service. As a part of this force, the [[Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment]] was formed and began concentrating at Awapuni racecourse in [[Palmerston North]] from 12 August 1914. Hastings joined the unit in the Manawatu and was [[:wikt:attested|attested]] on 13 August 1914, enlisting into the 6th Squadron as second-in-command under Major Charles Dick.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMRHistory1&quot;&gt;Wilkie, Alexander, ''Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment'', Wellington, Whitcombe &amp; Tombs Ltd, 1924, pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The unit formed part of the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]] commanded by Brigadier-General [[Andrew Hamilton Russell]], and departed New Zealand on board the troopship [[RMS Tahiti|''Tahiti'']] on 15 October 1914.  This vessel was one of twelve troop ships that carried the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in a convoy escorted by Allied warships. After departing New Zealand, the convoy stopped at [[Hobart]], [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] and [[Colombo]] before arriving at the [[Suez Canal]] on 1 December 1914. In Egypt, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force established a training camp at [[Zeitoun, Cairo|Zeitoun]], with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade remaining behind as the [[New Zealand Infantry Brigade]] participated in [[First Suez Offensive|British operations]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Suez Canal area in February 1915, before taking part in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula]] in late April 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard, ''Tribe of the War God: Ngati Tumatauenga'', Napier, NZ: Heritage, 1996, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service at Gallipoli===

[[File:Battle of Sari Bair, first phase.jpg|thumb|220px|A map depicting the August Offensive|alt=A map depicting the movement of military forces]]
The Gallipoli landings were strongly resisted by Ottoman forces, and reinforcements were required. Thus, in early May the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment was advised to prepare for embarkation for Gallipoli to join the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. On 12 May 1915, Hastings arrived at [[Anzac Cove]] and the following day his regiment occupied Walker's Ridge. From then on, Hastings displayed strong leadership as the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment anchored the brigade's position in defence of the [[ANZAC]] perimeter. On 19 May, the Ottomans launched a major offensive that saw 42,000 Ottomans attack the 17,000 ANZACs holding the beachhead. In response, the 6th Squadron prepared to take part in a counterattack, but this was subsequently called off.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMRHistory2&quot;&gt;Wilkie, Alexander, ''Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment'', Wellington, Whitcombe &amp; Tombs Ltd, 1924, pp.14–26.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment]] attacked and seized a new outpost (initially called No. 3 Outpost) on 28 May, the 6th Squadron relieved them and began digging defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pugsley&quot;&gt;Pugsley, Christopher, ''Gallipoli: The New Zealand Story'' (2nd ed.), Auckland: Reed, 1998, p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; The outpost was then handed over to another squadron who came under a sustained attack throughout 29 May and were forced to withdraw on 30 May, while the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment continued the battle without rest for 28 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinloch&quot;&gt;Kinloch, Terry, ''Echoes of Gallipoli: In the words of New Zealand's Mounted Riflemen'', Auckland: Exisle, 2005, p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; The unit history noted that during this time, Hastings &quot;... performed most useful and hazardous work ...&quot; closely reconnoitring the enemy's position and furnishing &quot;... a most accurate report on the situation, which proved of great value&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMRHistory3&quot;&gt;Wilkie, Alexander, ''Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment'', Wellington, Whitcombe &amp; Tombs Ltd, 1924, pp.33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the outpost was relinquished around midnight on 30 May the Ottomans aggressively followed up the withdrawing troops until Hastings led an advance along the ridge that enabled heavy fire to be brought down on the enemy's position. Hastings' men then launched a &quot;most effective&quot; attack with bayonets that &quot;... broke the Turkish onrush&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMRHistory3&quot;/&gt; The ANZACs subsequently established a new outpost closer to the existing line, No. 3 Outpost, with the position now held by the enemy referred to as the Old No. 3 Outpost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stowers&quot;&gt;Stowers, Richard, ''Bloody Gallipoli: The New Zealanders' Story'', Auckland: David Bateman, 2005, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===August Offensive===
In early August 1915, Hastings was heavily involved in the Allied offensive that attempted to break the deadlock of the Gallipoli campaign through the simultaneous push for the heights above Anzac and lodgement of a new British force at [[Suvla Bay]]. After dark on 6 August the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade commenced its task of clearing the Ottomans from the lower slopes of the [[Battle of Sari Bair|Sari Bair]] range beginning with the Old No. 3 Outpost. During this attack Hastings led two platoons of [[New Zealand (Māori) Pioneer Battalion|Maori Pioneers]] in destroying barbed-wire entanglements in the Sazli Beit Dere before the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment stormed Destroyer Hill and Table Top.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, David W., ''Australian Army Campaigns Series&amp;nbsp;– 10: The August Offensive at ANZAC, 1915'', Canberra, ACT Australia: Australian Army History Unit, Commonwealth of Australia, 2001, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Hastings' party assisted the [[Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment]] by attacking trenches in the Old No. 3 Outpost and took some prisoners on the northern end of the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMRHistory5&quot;&gt;Wilkie, Alexander, ''Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment'', Wellington, Whitcombe &amp; Tombs Ltd, 1924, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; Hastings subsequently assumed command of the 6th Squadron after the [[Officer Commanding]], Major Charles Dick, was wounded in the assault on Destroyer Hill, which opened the way to Table Top and allowed the New Zealand Infantry Brigade to seize Rhododendron Ridge in preparation for the attack on [[Battle of Chunuk Bair|Chunuk Bair]]. The [[Wellington (City of Wellington's Own) and Hawke's Bay Regiment|Wellington Infantry Battalion]] under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[William George Malone]] managed to secure the summit of Chunuk Bair in the early hours of 8 August, and took heavy casualties throughout the day until reinforced by the [[Otago and Southland Regiment|Otago Infantry Battalion]] and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment in the evening. Promoted in the field to major, Hastings commanded the 6th Squadron on Chunuk Bair on 8 and 9 August as the New Zealanders attempted to hold the position against fierce Ottoman counterattacks. Casualties were heavy and on the morning of 9 August Hastings was wounded when a bomb exploded, shattering his leg.  His evacuation was significantly delayed by the terrain and congested approaches to the heights, and the dangers encountered by his stretcher bearers, but he was successfully admitted to the [[Casualty Clearing Station|casualty clearing station]] down on the beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMRHistory6&quot;&gt;Wilkie, Alexander, ''Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment'', Wellington, Whitcombe &amp; Tombs Ltd, 1924, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
It is unclear what happened to the wounded Hastings, and there appears to have been confusion at the time as he was subsequently reported as &quot;missing, presumed dead&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;/&gt; Hastings had been evacuated to North Beach into the care of the 16th (British) Casualty Clearing Station, near Embarkation Pier, which had been constructed for the purpose of evacuating wounded during the August Offensive but had been abandoned when it came under heavy rifle and shell fire after just two days.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery Details Embarkation Pier Cemetery | publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission | url =http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/66802/EMBARKATION%20PIER%20CEMETERY | work = | pages = | accessdate =19 August 2012 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he could not be evacuated to a hospital ship it is likely that Hastings died while at the casualty clearing station and was buried in haste due to the massive number of Allied casualties. Despite his missing-in-action status Hastings was [[The_London_Gazette#.22Gazetted.22|gazetted]] as a [[Temporary rank|temporary]] major on 16 December 1915, and subsequently confirmed as a [[War substantive|substantive]] major on 11 February 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;/&gt;  In the meantime, following the evacuation of the Allied force from Gallipoli, a court of inquiry was initiated at Zeitoun on 17 January 1916. The inquiry was concluded at Serapeum on 3 March 1916, where the [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] of the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment determined that Hastings had probably died of wounds received in action on 9 August 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServiceFile1&quot;/&gt; This deduction was later confirmed when Hastings' assumed burial place in the Embarkation Pier Cemetery was marked with a special memorial by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGCI&quot;&gt;{{cwgc|id=605853|name=Hastings, Norman Frederick|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and decorations==
[[File:New Zealand Railways WWI Roll of Honour.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand Railways memorial tablet|alt=A list of names on a stone memorial tablet]]
In recognition of Hastings' outstanding bravery and leadership the award of the [[Distinguished Service Order]] was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 14 January 1916 for distinguished service in the field on Gallipoli.&lt;ref name=&quot;LG1&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29438|date=14 January 1916|startpage=576|supplement=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;&gt;Haigh, Bryant &amp; Polaschek, Allan, ''New Zealand and the Distinguished Service Order'', Christchurch: John.
