'''William Augustus Wellman'''  (February 29, 1896 &amp;ndash; December 9, 1975) was an American [[film director]] notable for his work in [[Crime film|crime]], [[Adventure film|adventure]] and [[Action film|action]] genre films, often focusing on [[aviation]] themes, a particular passion. He also directed several well-regarded satirical comedies. Beginning his film career as an actor, he went on to direct over 80 films, at times co-credited as producer and consultant. In 1927, Wellman directed ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'', which became the first film to win an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] at the [[1st Academy Awards]] ceremony.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008823.html?categoryId=25&amp;cs=1 &quot;Dorothy Wellman dies at 95.&quot;] ''[[Variety Magazine]]'', September 17, 2009.

==Early life==
Wellman's father, Arthur Gouverneur Wellman, was a [[New England]] [[Boston Brahmin|Brahmin]] of English-Welsh-Scottish and Irish descent. William was a great-great-great-great-great-grandson of [[Puritan]] [[Thomas Wellman]] who immigrated to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] about 1640.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Joshua Wyman ''Descendants of Thomas Wellman'' (1918) Arthur Holbrook Wellman, Boston pp. 69-72&amp;441-442&lt;/ref&gt;  William was a great-great-great grandson of [[Francis Lewis]] of New York, one of the signatories to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. His much beloved mother was an Irish immigrant named Cecilia McCarthy.

Wellman was expelled from Newton High School in [[Newton Highlands, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;filmref&quot;&gt;FilmReference.com [http://www.filmreference.com/Directors-Ve-Y/Wellman-William.html William Wellman]&lt;/ref&gt; for dropping a [[stink bomb]] on the principal's head.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;[http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm &quot;Wild Bill: William A.

Maréchal des Logis (Sergeant) Wellman received a medical discharge from the Foreign Legion and returned to the United States a few weeks later. He spoke at War Savings Stamp rallies in his French uniform. In September 1918 his book about French flight school and his eventful four months at the front, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A-7HAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Go Get 'Em!&quot;] (written by Wellman with the help of Eliot Harlow Robinson) was published. He joined the [[United States Army Air Service]] but too late to fly for America in the war. Stationed at [[Rockwell Field]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], he taught combat tactics to new pilots.

==Film career==
While in San Diego, Wellman would fly to Hollywood for the weekends in his [[SPAD S.VII|Spad]] fighter, using Fairbanks' polo field in Bel Air as a landing strip.&lt;ref name= &quot;World War I&quot;/&gt; Fairbanks was fascinated with the true-life adventures of &quot;Wild Bill&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;World War I&quot;/&gt; and promised to recommend him for a job in the movie business; he was responsible for Wellman being cast in the juvenile lead of ''The Knickerbocker Buckaroo'' (1919).&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;/&gt; Wellman was hired for the role of a young officer in ''[[Evangeline (1919 film)|Evangeline]]'' (1919), but was fired for slapping the leading lady, the actress [[Miriam Cooper]], who happened to be the wife of director [[Raoul Walsh]].&lt;ref name=imdbbio /&gt;

[[File:William Wellman flight instructor.jpg|thumb|left|William Wellman as a flight instructor at [[Rockwell Field]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] (1919)]]
Wellman hated being an actor, thinking it an &quot;unmanly&quot; profession,&lt;ref name=tcmbio&gt;TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/204015|156757/William-A-Wellman/ &quot;William A. Wellman Biography.&quot;] TCM Retrieved: September 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and was miserable watching himself on screen while learning the craft.&lt;ref name=WellmanJr /&gt; He soon switched to working behind the camera, aiming to be a director, and progressed up the line as &quot;a messenger boy, as an assistant cutter, an assistant property man, a property man, an assistant director, second unit director and eventually... director.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;/&gt; His first assignment as an assistant director for [[Bernard Durning|Bernie Durning]] provided him with a work ethic that he adopted for future film work. One strict rule that Durning enforced was no fraternization with screen femme fatales, which almost immediately Wellman broke, leading to a confrontation and a thrashing from the director. Despite his transgression, both men became lifelong friends, and Wellman steadily progressed to more difficult first unit assignments.&lt;ref name= &quot;World War I&quot;/&gt;

Wellman made his uncredited directorial debut in 1920 at Fox with ''The Twins of Suffering Creek''. The first films he was credited with directing were ''The Man Who Won'' and ''Second Hand Love'', released on the same day in 1923. After directing a dozen low-budget 'horse opera' films (some of which he would rather forget),&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;/&gt; Wellman was hired by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1927 to direct ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'', a major war drama dealing with fighter pilots during World War I that was highlighted by air combat and flight sequences. The film culminates with the epic [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]]. In the [[1st Academy Awards]] it was one of two films to win Best Picture (the other was ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans|Sunrise]])'', although, due to tensions within the studio regarding time and budget overages, Wellman wasn't invited to the event.&lt;ref name=WellmanJr&gt;Wellman, William, Jr. (2015). ''Wild Bill Wellman - Hollywood Rebel,'' pp. 71, 191, 230, 357. Pantheon Books, New York. ISBN 978-0307377708.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellman's other notable films include ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' ([[1931 in film|1931]]), the first version of ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' ([[1937 in film|1937]]), ''[[Nothing Sacred (film)|Nothing Sacred]]'' (1937), the [[1939 in film|1939]] version of ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'' starring [[Gary Cooper]], ''[[Thunder Birds (1942 film)|Thunder Birds]]'' ([[1942 in film|1942]]), ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' ([[1943 in film|1943]]), ''[[Lady of Burlesque]]'' (1943), ''[[The Story of G.I. Joe]]'' ([[1945 in film|1945]]), ''[[Battleground (film)|Battleground]]'' ([[1949 in film|1949]]) and two films starring and co-produced by John Wayne, ''[[Island in the Sky (1953 film)|Island in the Sky]]'' ([[1953 in film|1953]]) and ''[[The High and the Mighty (film)|The High and the Mighty]]'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]).

While he was primarily a director, Wellman also produced ten films, one of them uncredited, all of which he also directed. His last film was ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'' ([[1958 in film|1958]]), which he produced, directed, wrote the story for and narrated. He wrote the screenplay for two other films that he directed, and one film that he did not direct, [[1936 in film|1936]]'s ''[[The Last Gangster]]''. He also wrote the story for ''A Star Is Born'' and received a story credit for both remakes in [[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|1954]] and [[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|1976]].

Wellman initially worked fast, usually satisfied with a shot after one or two takes.&lt;ref name=WellmanJr /&gt; And despite his reputation of not coddling his leading men and women, he coaxed Oscar-nominated performances from seven actors: [[Fredric March]] and [[Janet Gaynor]] (''A Star Is Born''), [[Brian Donlevy]] (''Beau Geste''), [[Robert Mitchum]] (''The Story of G.I. Joe''), [[James Whitmore]] (''Battleground''), and [[Jan Sterling]] and [[Claire Trevor]] (''The High and Mighty''). Regarding actors, Wellman stated in a 1952 interview, &quot;Movie stardom isn't about acting ability - it's personality and temperament,&quot; and added, &quot;I once directed [[Clara Bow]]. She was mad and crazy but ''what'' a personality!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Erskine. (April 27, 1952) ''[[The Sun (Lowell)|The Lowell Sunday Sun]],'' Lowell, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovations===
''Wings'' led to several firsts in filmmaking including newly invented camera mounts that could be secured to plane fuselages and motor-driven cameras to shoot actors while flying as the cameramen ducked out of frame in their cockpits. Star [[Richard Arlen]] had some flying experience but co-star [[Buddy Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]] had to learn to fly for the film, as stunt pilots could not be used during close-up shots. Towers up to a hundred feet tall were used to shoot low-flying planes and battle action on the ground.&lt;ref name=WellmanJr /&gt;

During the filming of ''Beggars for Life'', a silent film starring [[Wallace Beery]], Richard Arlen and [[Louise Brooks]], sound was added to Beery's introductory scene at the behest of Paramount Studio. Wellman reportedly hung a microphone from a broom so Beery could walk and talk within the scene, avoiding the static shot required for early sound shoots.&lt;ref name=WellmanJr /&gt;

===Awards===
In his career, Wellman won a single Academy Award, for the story of ''A Star Is Born''. He was nominated as best director three times, for ''A Star Is Born'', ''Battleground'' and ''The High and Mighty'', for which he was also nominated by the [[Directors Guild of America]] as best director. In 1973, the DGA honored him with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Wellman also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], at 6125 Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref&gt;All Movie [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:116375~T3 Awards], IMDB [http://imdb.com/name/nm0920074/awards Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Several filmmakers have examined Wellman's career. [[Richard Schickel]] devoted an episode of his PBS series ''The Men Who Made the Movies'' to Wellman in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;IMDB [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070922/ &quot;The Men Who Made the Movies: William A. Wellman]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1996, Todd Robinson made the feature-length documentary ''Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick''.&lt;ref&gt;IMDB [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114939/ &quot;Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick&quot;] ''imdb.com''.

==Family==
Wellman revealed near the end of his life that he had married a French woman named Renee during his time in The Lafayette Flying Corps. She was killed in a bombing raid during the war.&lt;ref name=WellmanJr /&gt; He was married four times in the U.S.:

Dorothy starred in Wellman's 1933 film ''[[Wild Boys of the Road (1933 film)|Wild Boys of The Road]]'' and had seven children with Wellman,&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; including actors Michael Wellman, William Wellman Jr., Maggie Wellman, and Cissy Wellman. His daughter Kathleen &quot;Kitty&quot; Wellman married actor [[James Franciscus]], although they later divorced. His first daughter is Patty Wellman, and he had a third son, Tim Wellman.

William Wellman, Jr. wrote two books about his father, ''The Man And His Wings: William A. Wellman and the Making of the First Best Picture'' (2006), and ''Wild Bill Wellman - Hollywood Rebel'' (2015). Wellman Jr. has been a guest-host on [[Turner Classic Movies]] to introduce films made by his father.

William Wellman died in 1975 of [[leukemia]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Find a Grave [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6755218 William Wellman]&lt;/ref&gt; His widow, [[Dorothy Wellman]], died on September 16, 2009, in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood, California]], at the age of 95.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;
