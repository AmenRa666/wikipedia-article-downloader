==Military career in the American Civil War==
McDonald enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army]] on April 27, 1861 and served initially as a [[Lieutenant]] [[Engineer Officer]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Blume&quot;/&gt; and [[inspector general]] of the staff of his former professor, [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General]] Stonewall Jackson.&lt;ref name = &quot;Leslie1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams3&quot;/&gt; McDonald later served as a [[Staff (military)|staff officer]] for [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Major general|Major General]] [[Martin Luther Smith]] and as an engineer officer for Lieutenant General [[John C.

Known as the Davis History House, McDonald's childhood home serves as an [[American Civil War]] museum maintained by the Hampshire County Public Library.]]
While serving as chief engineer under Pemberton, McDonald was taken as a [[prisoner of war]] by the [[Union Army]] at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]] in 1863.&lt;ref name = &quot;Davis1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams3&quot;/&gt; During the war, McDonald and other former cadets returned to the Virginia Military Institute to instruct pupils while on [[parole]] or recuperating from injuries.&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wise1&quot;/&gt; In 1864 while McDonald was on parole,&lt;ref name = &quot;Davis1&quot;/&gt; one of his students, [[John Sergeant Wise]], recounted of having McDonald as a professor: 'Marshall McDonald hobbles in to point with his [[crutch]] at the problems on the [[Chalkboard|black-board]], until he can once more point with his [[sword]] towards &quot;the looming bastion fringed with fire.&quot;'&lt;ref name = &quot;Wise1&quot;/&gt; Of the professors at the institute during the war, Wise remarked, &quot;they taught with a zest and freshness as we seldom see.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wise1&quot;/&gt;

McDonald was further promoted to the rank of [[Major (United States)|Major]] in command of engineers on the staff of [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#General (Full general)|General]] [[Braxton Bragg]] and was to be promoted to the ranks of Colonel and Brigadier General when the war ended.&lt;ref name = &quot;Leslie1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Davis1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; While serving as an officer in an engineer corps, McDonald saw &quot;much active service.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt; McDonald and his four brothers served with distinction in the Confederate States Army, but only three of his brothers survived the war.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt; McDonald's father was one of the first Hampshire County residents to volunteer to fight for the Confederacy in 1861 and was [[Commission (document)|commissioned]] as a Colonel in command of [[Cavalry in the American Civil War|cavalry]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; McDonald's father died in battle in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia in 1864.&lt;ref name = &quot;Munske1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt;

== Return to Virginia Military Institute ==
Following the war in 1865, McDonald returned to the Virginia Military Institute where he was appointed a professor with the rank of Colonel instructing and serving as chair of the subjects of chemistry, [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[metallurgy]].&lt;ref name = &quot;CLSC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Leslie1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;VMI1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Virginia Military Institute|1869|p=13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald was appointed by the Board of Directors to replace Colonel Gilham as chair of the subjects of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology, who had in turn been appointed to replace [[George Washington Custis Lee]] the previous year.&lt;ref name = &quot;Leslie1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1890|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1911|p=227.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the Virginia Military Institute, McDonald established the institution's first museum.&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams4&quot;/&gt; During the 1867–1868 academic year, McDonald's chair was further subdivided as new lecture halls were being completed within [[Barracks, Virginia Military Institute|the restored barracks]] with McDonald retaining the subjects of mineralogy, geology, and metallurgy.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith1&quot;/&gt; McDonald's colleagues among the faculty included Superintendent [[Francis Henney Smith]] and professors [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], [[Scott Shipp]], [[John Mercer Brooke]], and George Washington Custis Lee.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith1&quot;/&gt; Toward the end of his tenure at the Virginia Military Institute, McDonald occupied the chair of geology and [[mining engineering]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt;

In 1875, McDonald developed an interest in [[fish farming]] and became administrator of the Virginia state fish hatchery at [[Wytheville, Virginia|Wytheville]].&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt; He was appointed as the sole Fish Commissioner of Virginia shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Leslie1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt; It was during his tenure as the Fish Commissioner of Virginia that McDonald invented the [[fish ladder]] that was named for him.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; In 1877, McDonald was commissioned by Virginia to conduct a survey of [[mineral resource]]s within the [[James River]] basin, the findings of which he reported to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1879.&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt; McDonald continued to instruct at the Virginia Military Institute until 1879, when he was invited by his former professor Spencer Fullerton Baird to a position at the [[United States Fish Commission|United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Blume&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Leslie1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; McDonald accepted the position with the Fish Commission and submitted his resignation from the Virginia Fish Commission to [[Governor of Virginia]], [[Fitzhugh Lee]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Leslie1&quot;/&gt;

==United States Fish Commission==
McDonald was appointed to an assistant position within the United States Fish Commission where he was a special agent under Baird and responsible for compiling and publishing fishery statistics related to the [[1880 United States Census]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; Following the census, he then served as superintendent of the [[shad]] hatcheries of the [[Potomac River]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt; During his subsequent years at the Fish Commission, McDonald was responsible for the distribution of &quot;young fishes&quot; and of &quot;food-fishes&quot; and later served as Chief of the Division of Fish Culture.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt; In 1885, McDonald was appointed Chief Assistant Commissioner of the Fish Commission.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blume&quot;/&gt; He continued in that capacity until he was appointed by [[United States President]] [[Grover Cleveland]] in January 1888 to replace Dr. [[George Brown Goode]] as the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blume&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;CLSC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Taylor1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2001|p=83.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown had been temporarily filling the position of Fish Commissioner following Baird's death.&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore1&quot;/&gt; McDonald took his [[oath of office]] on February 18, 1888.&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; His appointment was widely recognized as an &quot;excellent&quot; choice due to the breadth of his experience, organizational and leadership abilities, and sense of duty and responsibility to the American people.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; McDonald was also viewed as one of the &quot;most accomplished&quot; fish culturists in the United States at the time of his appointment.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; As Fish Commissioner, McDonald was initially paid [[United States dollar|$]]5,000 per annum&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt; and had at his disposal three [[yacht]]s and 22 fishing stations to conduct research and carry out the commission's efforts.&lt;ref name = &quot;CLSC1&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Medals Bestowed Upon Marshall McDonald for His Inventions in Pisiculture.jpg|thumb|right|250px|McDonald was awarded medals ''(pictured)'' from international fishery exhibitions at [[Berlin]] and [[London]] and from the Société d’Acclimation in [[Paris]] for his inventions and improvements in the field of fish farming.]]
As Fish Commissioner, one of McDonald's most important works was his plan to undertake a biological and physical survey of American fisheries and fish culture more thorough than any previously undertaken.&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1895|p=1042.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald believed the first step toward building &quot;a comprehensive knowledge of the conditions of greatest productiveness&quot; of American fisheries was to understand the primary food supply of fish, which McDonald termed &quot;aquatic pastorage.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Moore2&quot;/&gt; McDonald also initiated controversial changes in the Fish Commission imposing a bureaucratic structure inspired by his previous military career and solidifying the commission's emphasis on fish culture.&lt;ref name = &quot;Taylor1&quot;/&gt;

In 1893, McDonald warned [[Oregon]] [[Governor of Oregon|governor]] [[Sylvester Pennoyer]] of &quot;the disastrous outlook for the future of the salmon fisheries of the [[Columbia River|Columbia]].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Taylor2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2001|p=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his tenure at the Fish Commission, McDonald invented and designed a number of innovative [[fish hatchery|fish hatching]] apparatuses and appliances.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bowers1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowers|1902|p=317.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's most prominent apparatus was a [[fish ladder]] that enabled salmon and other migrating fish species to ascend the rapids of watercourses, thus increasing the extent of their spawning grounds.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blume&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;CLSC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT1&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = | first =| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Death of Marshall McDonald; The United States Fish Commissioner Dies After Long Suffering from Pulmonary Disease. | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | date = September 2, 1895 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F40915FE3A5E10738DDDAB0894D1405B8585F0D3 | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, McDonald devised &quot;automatic hatching jars&quot; which revolutionized the field of fish farming and were widely utilized by the United States Fish Commission, several state commissions, and commissions in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; The hatching jar apparatus enabled the &quot;vast extension&quot; of the propagation of [[shad]] accomplished in the 1880s and 1890s and rendered the work of the Fish Commission practicable commercially.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; In 1880, he designed a [[cod]] box that produced the tidal motion necessary for the hatching of floating [[Egg (biology)#Fish eggs|eggs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers1&quot;/&gt; McDonald further perfected his design of the cod box in 1888.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bowers1&quot;/&gt; In the winter of 1883, McDonald developed a tidal apparatus for the hatching of floating [[halibut]] eggs and those of other marine species.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; The vast production and distribution of fish eggs by the Fish Commission was possible through the utilization of this tidal apparatus.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; Through the usage of this apparatus, the process of hatching eggs was made cheaper and increased the fish farming output capacity of the commission.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;

===Awards and honors===
Prior to his appointment as Fish Commissioner, McDonald was awarded [[gold medal]]s and [[diploma]]s from international fishery exhibitions at [[Berlin]] and [[London]] and a [[silver medal]] from the Société d’Acclimation in [[Paris]] for his inventions and improvements in the field of fish farming.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; In addition, he received a &quot;special medal&quot; from the Société d’Acclimation for a fish ladder he devised for the [[Vienne (river)|River Vienne]] in southwestern [[France]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MDR1&quot;/&gt;

In his ''[[Forest and Stream]]'' [[magazine]] following McDonald's death in 1895, [[Charles Hallock]] recounted &quot;the record of [McDonald's] administration is an honorable one. By the death of Commissioner McDonald the country loses a public officer who has served faithfully honestly and well.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; &quot;The closing of his life is a loss to fish culture and to the public interests.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruette1&quot;/&gt; [[Marcus Benjamin]], in his remembrance of McDonald for the District of Columbia Sons of the American Revolution, remarked: &quot;His articles and reports on the fishing industries of the world are of great interest and his efforts in behalf of the [[oyster]] have resulted in much good.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt; Benjamin further stated, &quot;McDonald's bearing was always kind and generous to a fault, and his tread and manner carried for him a remembrance of his long line of military ancestry.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;SAR3&quot;/&gt;
