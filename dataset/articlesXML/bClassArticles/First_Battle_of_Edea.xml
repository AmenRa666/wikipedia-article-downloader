The '''First Battle of Edea''' involved the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French Third Republic|French]] assault on [[German Empire|German]] forces stationed in the village of [[Edéa|Edea]] during the [[Kamerun Campaign]] of the [[First World War]]. [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces from Duala launched their advance on 20 October. Following stiff resistance along the southern railway line between Duala and Edea, German forces withdrew from the town to [[Yaounde|Jaunde]], allowing Allied troops to finally occupy Edea on 26 October 1914.

==Background==
After British and French forces had landed in and occupied the major port city of [[Douala|Duala]] in September 1914, the German garrison that had once protected it retreated inland. One group withdrew along the northern rail line to [[Dschang]], while another traveled up the [[Wouri River|Wuri River]] to [[Yabassi|Jabassi]]. The largest group which included [[Kamerun]]'s governor, [[Karl Ebermaier]] and commandant, [[Carl Heinrich Zimmermann|Major Zimmermann]], had moved southeast along the southern railway line to the village of [[Edéa|Edea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;S36&quot;&gt;Strachan 2004, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; During their retreat, German forces damaged or destroyed much of the railway. [[Charles Macpherson Dobell|General Dobell]], the British commander at Duala feared that the German forces that had retreated could pose a threat to his new acquisitions, prompting attacks on Jabassi and Edea in October 1914.

After the German defeat at the [[Battle of Jabassi]] in early October, river vessels and manpower became available for an assault on Edea which lay on the [[Sanaga River]] to the southeast of Jaunde.&lt;ref name=&quot;S36&quot;/&gt;

===French assault on the Japoma Bridge===
During the retreat to Edea, German forces damaged the railway bridge at Japoma, just outside Duala. A small German detachment remained entrenched on the far side of the [[Dibamba River]] at the damaged bridge while the majority of the force had retreated to Edea. The German control of the bridge was seen as a great danger to the Allied occupation of Duala due to Japoma's close proximity to the town. On 6 October, a French force of 400 [[tirailleurs]] under Colonel Mayer assisted by British naval bombardment made an assault on this position.&lt;ref name=&quot;O49&quot;&gt;O'Neill 1918, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The French troops crossed the bridge under severe fire from the entrenched German force who withdrew. Securing the partially damaged railway bridge made a push to Edea, further to the southeast, possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;B29&quot;&gt;Burg 1998, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assault on Edea==
With Japoma  and Jabassi secured, Dobell initiated the assault on Edea. On 20 October he launched an expedition up the [[Nyong River|Njong River]] to the village of Dehane which lay to the south of Edea. A track through the jungle connected the two settlements. The British force that had sailed up the Njong arrived in Dehane on 21 October and began to march north to Edea.&lt;ref name=&quot;B31&quot;&gt;Burg 1998, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; A second British column under Commander L. W. Braithwaite would move up the [[Sanaga River]]. Colonel Mayer's French force would advance eastward along the railway line from Japoma.&lt;ref name=&quot;D174&quot;&gt;Dane 1919, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; One French and two British officers were killed among others when their boat capsized on the Njong river early in the operations. The Sanaga River flotilla had great difficulty navigating because of the many natural obstacles such as sand bars that lay below the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobell&quot;&gt;Dobell 1916, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The columns moving north from Dehane and up the Sanaga did not experience significant resistance from German forces but did face disease. Zimmerman chose to focus the defense of Edea on the southern railway line. The French column under Mayer that had moved east along the railway line from Japoma encountered heavy resistance throughout their advance and suffered severe casualties as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;D174&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobell&quot;/&gt; Realizing that the Japoma column continued to advance despite their resistance and that other columns were closing in from Dehana and the Sanaga, German forces including the governor and commandant withdrew to Jaunde, approximately 100 miles to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;O50&quot;&gt;O'Neill 1918, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October British and French forces entered and occupied Edea, finding the Germans fled.&lt;ref name=&quot;S36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B31&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the capture of Edea, Allied troops moved 20 miles further inland to Kopongo.&lt;ref name=&quot;D174&quot;/&gt; A German attempt to recapture Edea would fail at the [[Second Battle of Edea]] in early January 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;B43&quot;&gt;Burg 1998, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success at Jabassi and now Edea, the only remaining German unit that had withdrawn from Duala in September was the one which moved north towards the fort at [[Dschang]]. In December 1914 a British force under Colonel Edmund H. Georges would begin its march toward Dschang. On 2 January 1915 George's force reached Dschang and began a bombardment of the German fort there, which forced the garrison's surrender. The British force destroyed the fort before withdrawing to more secure lines of communication at the railhead at [[Baré, Cameroon|Bare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O51&quot;&gt;O'Neill 1918, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B41&quot;&gt;Burg 1998, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;
