'''Robert Henry Maxwell (Bobby) Gibbes''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] and [[medal bar|Bar]], [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (6 May 1916&amp;nbsp;– 11&amp;nbsp;April 2007) was a leading Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&amp;nbsp;II, and the longest-serving wartime commanding officer of [[No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron RAAF]]. He was officially credited with 10¼ aerial victories, although his score is often reported as 12, including two shared. Gibbes was also credited with five aircraft probably destroyed, and a further 16 damaged. He commanded No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in North Africa from February 1942 to April 1943, apart from a brief period when he was injured.

Born in rural [[New South Wales]], Gibbes worked as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]] and salesman before joining the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in February 1940. Posted to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre|Middle East]] in April 1941, he flew with No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in the [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign]], and became commanding officer during the [[Western Desert Campaign]], where his leadership and fighting skills earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar]]. Subsequently posted to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], he served with [[No. 80 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;80 Wing]] of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]], and took part in the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; of April 1945. After the war he spent many years in New Guinea developing local industry, for which he was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 2004. He continued to fly until the age of 85, and died five years later in 2007.

==Family and early career==
The only son of Henry and Cora Gibbes, Robert Henry Maxwell (Bobby) Gibbes was born on 6&amp;nbsp;May 1916 in [[Young, New South Wales|Young]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;News&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/78449829 |title=The &quot;Fighting Gibbes&quot; of the RAAF |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] |location=Perth  |date=30 July 1943 |accessdate=18 September 2013 |page=5 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WW47&gt;Chisholm, ''[[Who's Who in Australia]] 1947'', p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a family that had long been active in the government and military.

Gibbes handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron to Squadron Leader [[Brian Eaton]] on 19&amp;nbsp;April 1943.&lt;ref name=Thomas45/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; With his rank of squadron leader confirmed the same month, Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at [[RAAF Overseas Headquarters]], London, until October.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; While in England he converted to [[de Havilland Mosquito]] night fighters and was slated to command [[No.&amp;nbsp;464 Squadron RAAF]], but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada.&lt;ref name=WW47/&gt; There, according to Gibbes, he gave a series of morale-building lectures on air combat to [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] students: &quot;So I, you know, went round and lied like hell. I said that it was all a [[wikt:piece of cake#Noun|piece of cake]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbes; Stokes, &quot;Gibbes, Robert Henry Maxwell 'Bobby'&quot;, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1944, he joined [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]] (OTU) at [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]], Victoria, becoming chief flying instructor in March.&lt;ref name=WW47/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; He worked with [[Clive Caldwell]], Australia's top-scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No.&amp;nbsp;2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', pp. 139, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbes was promoted to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1&amp;nbsp;July. In October he was posted to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the Northern Territory, flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s as wing leader of [[No. 80 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;80 Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Caldwell166&gt;Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', pp. 166, 272&lt;/ref&gt; The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer.&lt;ref name=Caldwell166/&gt; Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;AirForceNews&quot;/&gt; In December he met, in his own words, &quot;a little dark-haired popsy&quot; named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the [[Red Cross]] who had nursed him in hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; They married on 23&amp;nbsp;January 1945.&lt;ref name=WW47/&gt;

No. 80 Wing had begun transferring to the [[Dutch East Indies]] in December 1944, and the main body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on [[Morotai]], where it came under the control of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 TAF), until 9&amp;nbsp;March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', pp. 166–168, 178&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces [[Wilfred Arthur|Wilf Arthur]] and [[John Lloyd Waddy|John Waddy]], who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070400--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 443–445]&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbes later declared that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service.&quot; As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: &quot;I felt horrible about it, being an ex [[The bush|bushy]]&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs.

In January 1948, he formed Gibbes Sepik Airways using, among other types, three German [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;52]]s, one of which was said to have been the personal transport of senior ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' commander [[Albert Kesselring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;/&gt; He was joined briefly in this venture, headquartered at [[Wewak]], by Nicky Barr.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan, ''Nicky Barr'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbes also established a tea and coffee plantation at [[Mount Hagen]], New Guinea, in 1950, and served as a member of the RAAF Active Reserve, based in [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland, from 1952 until 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;AirForceNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=WW1955&gt;Alexander, ''Who’s Who in Australia 1955'', p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he sold his share in Gibbes Sepik Airways to Mandated Airlines, which was later bought out by [[Ansett Australia]]. He continued to develop coffee plantations in New Guinea, and built a large chain of hotels beginning with the Bird of Paradise in [[Goroka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt;

Gibbes sold his interests in New Guinea in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;/&gt; He spent most of the remainder of the decade in the Mediterranean, aboard his [[catamaran]] ''Billabong''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;/&gt; In his 60s, he sailed ''Billabong'' from England to Australia by himself, braving heavy seas and Malaysian pirates along the way.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; By 1979 he was living in Sydney and had begun building his own twin-engined plane, which he eventually took to the air in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;/&gt; In 1994, Gibbes published his autobiography, ''You Live But Once''.
