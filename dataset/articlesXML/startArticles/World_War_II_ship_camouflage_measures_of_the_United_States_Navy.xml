In 1935, the [[United States Navy]] [[Naval Research Laboratory]] began studies and tests on low visibility [[ship camouflage]]. Research continued through [[World War II]] to (1) reduce visibility by painting vertical surfaces to harmonize with the horizon and horizontal surfaces to blend with the sea, or (2) confuse identity and course by painting obtrusive patterns on vertical surfaces. Some camouflage methods served both purposes.  American captains exercised less freedom of interpretation with these schemes (other than Measure 12 Modified) than their British Commonwealth counterparts applied to [[Admiralty]] camouflage schemes.&lt;ref name=&quot;raven&quot;&gt;Raven, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early measures==

With the likelihood of the United States entering the war, and after experiments with various paint schemes conducted in association with the 1940 Fleet Problem (exercise), the [[Bureau of Ships]] (BuShips) directed in January 1941 that the peacetime color of overall #5 Standard Navy Gray, a light gloss shade with a linseed-oil base, be replaced with matte Dark Gray, #5-D, a new paint formulation with a synthetic alkyd resin base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Keuren Jan 41&quot;/&gt;  Rather than waste the large quantities of Standard Gray already in inventory and aboard ships, BuShips directed the issuance of a black tinting paste (5-BP) which when mixed in stated proportions with Standard Gray would yield a close approximation of 5-D, with issue of the new paint in pre-mixed form to follow. BuShips also issued ''Ship Camouflage Instructions'' (SHIPS-2), laying out 9 painting schemes to be used throughout the Navy. Rather than issue premixed quantities of the less-used new shades, Light Gray (5-L) and Ocean Gray (5-O), yards and supply depots were directed to issue an untinted base paint (5-U) together with a blue-black tinting material (5-TM) which when mixed according to instructions would turn 5-U into either Light or Ocean Gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1941MarchNewPaints.html | title=Outside Gray Paint -- Change in Manufacturing Formulas. | publisher=Navy Department (USA) | date=March 21, 1941 | accessdate=April 11, 2013 | author=Ingram, H.

The adoption of the new measures was very slow, however: as of late May the Navy's paint factories had yet  to receive the ingredients needed for the new alkyd-based paints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1941MayNewPaints.html | date=May 21, 1941 | author=Ingram, H.

Measure 1A was an experimental scheme in overall Sea Blue, later adopted as [[#Measure 11|Measure 11]].

Measure 1B was another experimental scheme using overall Sapphire Blue.

Measure 1C similarly used Navy Blue, later adopted as [[#Measure 21|Measure 21]].

Horizontal surfaces were as Measure 1, Dark Gray except for wooden decks.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt; This measure was also widely used by the [[Royal Navy]] where it became known as the emergency scheme or Admiralty alternative scheme when there was insufficient time or where required pigments were unavailable to apply an Admiralty disruptive scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;raven&quot;/&gt;

The camouflage was polished off by painting two huge Carley rafts on each side.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steelnavy.com/CombrigMinneapolis.htm|author=Backer, Steve|title=USS Minneapolis (CA-36)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}|| &lt;!--image--&gt;

By the summer of 1941 it had become apparent that Dark Gray (5-D) was unacceptably visible under all conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1941JulyBuShipsPotentialPaintChange.html | title=Low Visibility Gray Paints - Potential Change in Formula | author= Ingram, H.

A. (Chief, BuShips) | publisher=US Navy Department | accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tinting paste was altered to contain somewhat less black and more blue than before; this meant that Ocean Gray also became somewhat more bluish in cast at this time and all the 5-series paint colors now were categorized as [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] 5 Purple-Blue. Until 1945 all USN &quot;gray&quot; and almost all &quot;blue&quot; shades were produced using this same blue-black tint (5-TMa), so that the paints represented different tones of what was effectively a single blue-gray hue.&lt;ref name= &quot;IngramJul41&quot;/&gt;

In September, Measures 1 through 8 were abolished and four new schemes promulgated in a revised edition of SHIPS-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1941OctoberSHIPS2Rev1.html | title=Ship Camouflage Instructions, First Revision | author=US Navy Bureau of Ships | date=September 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July Measure 12 had been prescribed for the entire Atlantic Fleet, and on 13 September Measure 11 for the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1941SeptemberBuShipsNewConstPainting.html | title=Camouflage Painting of New Construction and Conversions | publisher=Navy Department (USA) | date=Sep 27, 1941 | accessdate=April 6, 2013 | author=Van Keuren, A. H. (Assistant Chief, BuShips)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was considerable time lag between the issuance of new instructions, and paint being manufactured and distributed and ships actually being repainted; at the time of the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] on December 7 most of the Pacific Fleet was still wearing dark gray Measure 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;USN dazzle&quot;/&gt;

In November aircraft carriers began applying a dark blue-gray flight deck stain (#250) approximately the same color as Deck Blue, together with a stain approximately Ocean Gray for flight deck markings (#251).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1941DecemberNorfolkFlightDeckPaint.html | title=Low Visibility Flight Deck Stain (Norfolk No. L-81-3M) and Low Visibility Flight Deck Marking Paint - Formulas. | publisher=Norfolk Navy Yard | date=Dec 15, 1941 | accessdate=April 10, 2013 | author=Britt, F.

All visible canvas boat covers, tarpaulins and windscreens to be dyed in a color to match Deck Blue. It was used in the Pacific and Mediterranean for concealment from aircraft. Royal Navy submarines operating in the Mediterranean used a similar scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;raven&quot;/&gt; During the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and the [[Battle of Midway]], ships wearing Measure 11 came under attack less often than ships wearing Measure 12.

Horizontal surfaces painted Deck Blue. Canvas dyed blue. Sea Blue was later darkened to Navy Blue (Measure 12A).&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/13CL-41.html | title=Camouflage Painting of Ships | publisher=Navy Department (USA) | date=Nov 4, 1941 | accessdate=April 10, 2013 | author=King, Ernest J.

In Measure 12 (Modified), irregular patches or splotches were added to break up the ship's profile: Haze Gray splotches on Sea Blue (later Navy Blue) and vice versa, and Sea Blue (later Navy Blue) splotches on Ocean Gray. &quot;These splotches should be obtained by extending the Navy Blue paint into the designated Ocean Gray paint area and vice versa. They should be about 1/3 the area of a rectangle 12 feet high by 20 feet long.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;/&gt; There were no specific instructions on the positioning or shape of the splotches, which were left up to individual captains, yards or maintenance facilities, and the recommended size was frequently disregarded, so that no two ships looked alike.  Measure 12 (Mod) was used extensively in both fleets during 1942. Unfortunately the splotches in most cases were too small to break up the ship's outline effectively, and at any distance resolved into simple gray.

|- id=&quot;Measure 13&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Measure&amp;nbsp;13 || Haze Gray (5-H) overall, with horizontal surfaces Deck Blue. This was the least used solid color measure during [[World War II]]. &quot;Low visibility to surface observers in hazy or foggy weather especially when it is accompanied with periods of weak sunlight... Useful in submarine infested areas, where periscopic observers will see a vessel entirely against a sky background. High visibility under searchlight, and down-moon at close ranges. Very low visibility on moonless nights and at twilight&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Ships2r2&quot;/&gt;

This was found to provide reasonable protection in the widest range of conditions, and became a standard paint scheme after the war under assumed conditions of [[radar]] observation, with Deck Gray substituted for Deck Blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt; 
| &lt;!--image--&gt;
|- id=&quot;Measure 14&quot;  valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Measure&amp;nbsp;14 || Ocean Gray overall. Used on many small craft, including minesweepers, PTs, SCs, PCS, and some coast guard vessels as well as several escort carriers (CVEs) throughout 1942, 1943, and 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;raven&quot;/&gt; &quot;Useful for Protection against Submarine attack, where aerial observation is a lesser factor... In Atlantic or Pacific Coastal waters where weather is generally sunny, visibility is high, and bright moonlight is common at night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ships2r2&quot;/&gt;

'''Asiatic Fleet:''' The Asiatic Fleet, based in distant Manila, was unable to obtain the new paint colors and so in November painted its ships overall in a color procured from local sources midway between Sea Blue and Ocean Gray, dubbed &quot;Cavite Blue.&quot;

Within the first six months of combat, the United States Navy modified Measures 11 and 12 to meet the needs of Pacific Ocean operations. Sea Blue was found to be too light, and it was ordered replaced by new color Navy Blue (5-N),{{efn| In fact the Atlantic Fleet had ordered the substitution of 5-N for 5-S as early as November 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;/&gt;}} which used 50% more of the same tinting paste as Sea Blue and was correspondingly darker.

| Measure&amp;nbsp;22 || [[#Measure 12|Measure 12]] was reworked following recognition of the ineffectiveness of small splotches of paint, and the relatively low contrast between the shades used. Replacement measure 22 used Navy Blue low on the hull below the first continuous deck, with Haze Gray above that. Measure 22 used a straight horizontal boundary between the two colors rather than following the [[Sheer (ship)|sheer]] of the main deck, making a characteristic gray &quot;wedge&quot; at the bow. This bold contrast at a horizontal line near the horizon reduced visibility to surface observers and created the illusion of greater range. This measure largely replaced Measure 12 where aerial observation was unlikely. &quot;Useful for combatant ships operating in areas where greatest danger might be expected from gunnery action either from shore batteries or from enemy surface ships. Moderately high visibility to aerial observation at close ranges.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ships2r2&quot;/&gt; This measure was used in the Atlantic and European coastal waters from the end of 1942 through the end of [[World War II]], and was often referred to as &quot;Atlantic two-tone.&quot; It was worn by shore bombardment ships in the Pacific from late 1944 after the destruction of Japanese naval aviation capability at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;

Measure 12 remained in use, but amended so as to be identical to Measure 22 save for the use of Ocean Gray rather than Haze Gray.

'''Tropic Green system:''' Through 1942 the Camouflage Section had issued no instructions for landing craft, [[PT boat]]s, [[Landing Ship, Tank|Tank Landing Ships]] (LSTs) and other vessels expected to operate close inshore in Pacific jungle conditions, so individual commands resorted to overall green, or ad-hoc camouflage patterns in whatever green or brown paints could be obtained. In early 1943 BuShips began the development a green series parallel to the blue-gray series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1943MarchGreenPaint.html|author=BuShips|title=Paint, Camouflage, Green|date=March 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the process was slow and therefore the South Pacific Command as an expedient ordered its amphibious vessels to be repainted in Dark Tropic Green with &quot;tiger stripes&quot; in Light Tropic Green, both of which could be created by mixing standard 5-TMa blue tinting medium with yellow zinc chromate primer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1943AprilTropicGreenSystem.html |title=Camouflage Instructions | publisher=Navy Department (USA) | date=April 21, 1943 | author=Turner, R.

==Late wartime measures==

[[File:Camouflage pattern sheet for Benson-class destroyer.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.9|Pattern sheet, [[#Measure 32|Measure 32/3D]] for [[Benson-class destroyer|''Benson''-class destroyers]]]]

The [[Royal Navy]] established an [[Admiralty]] camouflage section in October 1940. Initial Admiralty disruptive camouflage schemes employed polygons of multiple shades of gray, blue and green so at least two of the colors would blend with background sea or sky under different light conditions. Experience showed the polygons were too small to be differentiated at effective camouflage ranges. Simplified Admiralty light and dark disruptive schemes were promulgated in 1942 to use larger and simpler polygons with no more than four colors.

Artist [[Everett Warner]], who had headed up the design section of Navy Camouflage during the First World War, returned to that post during the Second. On the basis of Warner's interpretations of recent Admiralty experience, BuShips issued a supplement to SHIPS-2 in March 1943 laying out multiple dazzle patterns under Measures 31 (dark), 32 (medium) and 33 (light) to conceal identity and confuse submarine torpedo fire control. Each measure included multiple pattern designs for ship classes so the pattern would not identify the class of ship. These measures represent the final evolution of [[dazzle camouflage]].

Warner's office issued over 300 pattern sheets for Measures 31-33. Specific patterns in the dazzle measures were designated as, e.g., MS-32/3D, meaning the '''3'''rd '''D'''estroyer pattern under Measure 32; an A indicated an aircraft carrier pattern, B for battleships, C for cruisers and so on.  Often a pattern designed for one ship type would be adapted to another, so that, for example, the battleship ''[[USS North Carolina (BB-55)|North Carolina]]'' wore an adaptation of Measure 32/18D, originally a destroyer pattern.&lt;ref name=&quot;USN dazzle&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usndazzle.com/1Web/Articles/Camo.html | title=A Short History of US Naval Camouflage in WWII | author=Johnson, C.

On 15 September 1943 the South Pacific command adopted the dazzle measures for all ships;{{efn|Dark Measure 31 was prescribed for all vessels of the following types: ABD, ABSD, AFD, AGP, AGS, APc, APD, AR, ARB, ARD, ARG, LCI, LCT, LSD, LST, PF, PG, PT, PY, YFD, YMS, YN, YP, ARL, ARS, ASR, ATR, YAG, together with the battleships ''Tennessee, Colorado'' and ''Maryland''.

| Measure&amp;nbsp;31 &lt;br&gt;(Disruptive system, dark)|| Dark pattern Measure 31 was a series of irregular geometric patterns using large polygonal and striped patterns of Black and Ocean Gray, or Black, Ocean Gray and Haze Gray. The patterns and tones were designed to resolve at a distance to an average low reflectivity of 10-20%. Horizontal surfaces also carried irregular patterns in Ocean Gray and Deck Blue. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. Undersides of horizontal elements were [[Countershading|countershaded]] in Pale Gray (5-P) or White (5-U) to reduce self-shadowing. This measure was based on the [[World War I]] dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific.

In 1944 revised Measure 31a substituted Navy Blue for Black and eliminated countershading

For landing craft and amphibious vessels, BuShips promulgated patterns under Measure 31/L, which was based on Measure 31 but used the colors Haze Green, Ocean Green, Navy Green, Brown 4A and Black with Deck Green. In mid-1944 the color range was simplified (Measure 31/20L) to Green #1, #2 and #3 and Brown #4.{{efn|MS-31/20L was a &quot;universal&quot; design, a large rectangular camouflage pattern on which the outline of any ship class could be overlaid.}}

Measure 31/5P for PT boats used a base color of MTB Green with large patches of Navy Green (5-NG). Measure 31/4P combined Ocean Green (5-OG) with Navy Blue.

Measure 31/T for amphibious transports was identical to base Measure 31 but used Ocean Green, Navy Green and Black.

The patterns and tones were designed to resolve at a distance to an average medium reflectivity of 20-30%. Measure 32 was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944, but in 1945 the Pacific Fleet reverted to [[#Measure 12|Measure 12]], [[#Measure 21|21]] or [[#Measure 22|22]] in the revised 1945 colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;proceedings&quot;/&gt;

Measures 32/3SS and 32/9SS were submarine patterns that used a multiplicity of carefully shaded grays to counteract light and shadow and reduce the visibility of a submarine on the surface.

In January 1945 BuShips revised its paint formulations due to a shortage of blue pigment, and the realization that tone was far more important than hue in camouflage effect, eliminating the blue-purple shades which had characterized nearly all Navy ship colors whether called &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;gray.&quot;  The new paints were neutral grays, Navy Gray replacing Navy Blue (but confusingly receiving the designation &quot;5-N&quot; while Navy Blue became &quot;5-NB&quot;), and Deck Gray replacing Deck Blue. Ocean Gray and Haze Gray retained their names but lost their bluish cast. However, the new paints (which were shipped pre-mixed, not as tinting paste) were generally only available in stateside yards, while ships repainted at forward bases continued to use the older bluish colors. Moreover, for Measure 22 (but not 12 or 21), Navy Blue was still prescribed until existing stocks were exhausted.&lt;ref name=&quot;brand&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/S19-7/1945_S19_631Application.html| title=Camouflage Instructions - Carriers, Cruisers, Destroyers, Destroyer Escorts, Assigned to the Pacific Fleet | publisher=Navy Department Bureau of Ships | date=February 26, 1945 | accessdate=April 8, 2013 | author=Brand, C.

In February the Pacific Fleet, deciding that the primary threat to its ships was now [[kamikaze]], directed that all ships be repainted in [[#Measure 12|Measure 12]], [[#Measure 21|21]] or [[#Measure 22|22]], and dazzle schemes began to disappear again. All auxiliaries and ''odd''-numbered cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons and destroyer-escort divisions were to be painted in Measure 21, and all ''even''-numbered CA/CL divisions, DD squadrons and DE divisions in Measure 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;brand&quot;/&gt; Ironically, the Atlantic Fleet did not get the memo, and during 1945 ships scheduled for Pacific transfer were repainted in dazzle, only to be painted again in Measure 21 or 22 on arrival at the West Coast or Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;raven&quot;/&gt;
