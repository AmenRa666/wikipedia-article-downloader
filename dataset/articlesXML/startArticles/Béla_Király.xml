Dr. '''Béla Király''' (14 April 1912 – 4 July 2009) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]  army officer before, during, and after [[World War II]].  After the war, he was sentenced to life in prison under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied regime, but was later released.  After his release, he commanded the National Guard in the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. He then fled to the [[United States]], where he became an academic historian. He returned to Hungary after the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet Bloc]] and was elected a member of [[Parliament of Hungary|Hungarian Parliament]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Kaposvár]], [[Hungary]], the son of a station master.  As a youth he bred [[pigeons]], a lifelong interest.  His ambition to be a veterinary surgeon foundered because his family could not afford the fees.  [[Color blindness]] barred his employment by the railroad.  In 1930, military service became compulsory - two years for conscripts but only one year for volunteers.  He joined the army, found it interesting, finished the Ludovika Military Academy in the top 5% of his class, and was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] a second lieutenant 20 August 1935. As a student at the General Staff Academy he was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] of in  December 1942.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hnet/&gt;

==World War II &amp; Post-war Imprisonment==
Hungary joined the [[Axis powers]] and declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941. Király saw combat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern front]] and was twice wounded.  In 1943 he commanded 400 men guarding a Jewish [[Labour service (Hungary)|labor battalion]] in the [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]] valley. Contrary to orders, he provided them with warm clothing, decent food, and medical attention. In 1993, [[Yad Vashem]] named him one of the “[[Righteous Among the Nations]]”, recognizing his humane treatment of the Jewish prisoners.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 1945 Király commanded the [[Kőszeg#World War II and the Holocaust|defense of Kőszeg]]. Upon surrendering the city to the [[Red Army]], he was arrested and sent to [[Siberia]] as a [[prisoner of war]]. He returned home following the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]], and joined the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] and the new [[Hungarian Defence Force#Warsaw Pact|Hungarian People's Army]].

Communist officials warned him against his 1947 marriage to the widowed niece of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] former prime minister [[Gyula Gömbös]], who was, for much of his career, [[Anti-Semitism|Anti-Semitic]]. He expected to be sacked when General [[György Pálffy]] summoned him, but instead was appointed to command the Training Department. He was promoted to general in 1950, and later to the rank of major general. In 1950, he was put in command of the [[infantry]]. He was expected to command the Hungarian component of a planned Soviet invasion of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] following the [[Tito–Stalin Split]]. [[Stalin]] ceased the operation, however, discouraged by the success of American intervention in the [[Korean War]]. According to Király, the situation in Korea &quot;&quot;nipped Stalin's pet project in the bud&quot;.&lt;ref name=schindler/&gt;

In 1951, the [[Mátyás Rákosi]] regime arrested him on charges of subversion, sedition, and espionage. He was sentenced on January 15, 1952 to death by hanging. His wife was detained by the [[ÁVH]] from August 1951 until August 1953. She divorced him in 1955. He then learned that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment at hard labor. In September 1956 the government of [[Imre Nagy]] paroled him along with other prisoners, a measure intended to soften public unrest.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hnet/&gt;

==Role in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution==
The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] began shortly after his release from prison. He was ill and recovering from surgery, but he escaped the hospital to join the Hungarian revolutionaries and accept appointment as commander-in-chief of the military guard and military commander of Budapest against the Soviets.

{{Quotation|“I was skin and bones coming out of five years of imprisonment,” Agence France-Presse quoted him as saying in 2006. “I was far from being healed, so I had to slip out of the hospital because the doctors would not let me go.”|Béla Király|Agence France-Presse 2006|&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;}}

Violence broke out in Budapest on October 23, 1956. Soviet troops, unprepared for the strength of the revolutionary forces, arranged a ceasefire on October 28, and began to retreat from the city. The violence subsisted, however, as pro-Nagy communists and various nationalist factions engineered purges of pro-Soviet party members in the city. Király, sensing a chaotic fragmentation of the revolutionary forces, sought to unite various anti-Soviet factions into a National Guard. On October 30, 1956, Király-led revolutionaries attacked the building of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The revolutionaries detained dozens of suspected pro-Soviets, executing many on the spot. Similar purges continued throughout the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;berecz&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/1956Counter-revolutionInHungary | title=1956 Counter-Revolution in Hungary: Words and Weapons | publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó | author=Berecz, János | year=1986 | pages=116 | isbn=978-9630543705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;filimonov&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polit.ru/article/2006/10/30/mify_vengr/ | title=Мифы о восстании | publisher=Polit RU | date=October 30, 2016 | accessdate=October 27, 2016 | author=Filimonov, Olef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the continued violence directed against pro-Soviet communists, Soviet correspondent [[Anastas Mikoyan]] advised against a Soviet invasion, wishing for the Hungarian communists to suppress the &quot;counter-revolution&quot; themselves. This inaction led many pro-Soviets to question their loyalties. As [[Nikita Khrushchev]] lost confidence in the ability of the Hungarian communists the suppress the uprising, he directed the Soviet army to invade Budapest on November 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;khrushchev&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=http://kiatipis.org/Writers/N/Nikita.Khrushchev/Memoirs-of-Nikita-Khrushchev[Vol3].pdf | title=Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev | publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press | author=Khrushchev, Nikita | authorlink=Volume 3 | year=2007 | location=University Park | pages=665 | isbn=978-0-271-02935-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Király recognized his forces, loyal to Nagy, had no hope of victory over the Soviet army. However, he resented Soviet ambassador [[Yuri Andropov]]'s concealing of the imminent invasion, which [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had officially decided upon 3 days prior.
{{Quotation|''Here was this man Andropov who clearly understood what was going on,'' Mr. Kiraly said bitterly, ''yet he pretended until the last moment to me and to the Prime Minister and to others that everything was business as usual. Even pirates, before they attack another ship, hoist a black flag. He was absolutely calculating.''|Béla Király|1982 interview with R.W. Apple, Jr.|&lt;ref name=Apple_1982/&gt;}}

After the Soviets successfully suppressed the revolution, Király fled to later the United States through Austria to avoid capture. He was, however, sentenced to death ''[[in absentia]]'' back in the Soviet Union (a fate which other revolutionary leaders like Nagy did not escape).&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Time in the United States==
Király was well regarded in the United States, as the U.S. had been supportive of the Nagy-led government to which Király had been loyal. He arrived speaking good English, having taught himself through an English-Hungarian dictionary while in prison. He enrolled in [[Columbia University]] earned a graduate degree in history. From 1964 he taught Military History at [[Brooklyn College]], and became chairman of the history department. He retired as Professor Emeritus in 1982.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent_obit/&gt; During his tenure he served as director of the Society In Change Program on East Central Europe, supervised Brooklyn College Press (the College's Publishing House), and was an adviser to the Brooklyn College Military History Club. The Brooklyn College Bela K. Kiraly Award, awarded to undergraduate students for outstanding work in modern history, bears his name.

==Return to Hungary==
After the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet Bloc]], he was an invited guest at [[Imre Nagy]]'s funeral and re-interment, June 1989. He moved back to Hungary later that year, and was elected to the [[Hungarian National Assembly]], representing his birthplace Kaposvár. He served from May&amp;ndash;November 1990 as an independent deputy, then joined the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) parliamentary group,&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt; later assuming the role of a government adviser. In 2004, he was made an associate member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

Király died in his sleep in [[Budapest]] on 4 July 2009, aged 97.&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt;
