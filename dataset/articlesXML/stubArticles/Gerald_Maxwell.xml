'''Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MC|DFC|AFC|DL|sep=yes}} (8 September 1895 – 18 December 1959)  was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[First World War]] [[flying ace]] credited with twenty-six aerial victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaerodrome&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/scotland/maxwell1.php |title=Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Maxwell was born in [[Beauly]] near [[Inverness]], [[Scotland]] to the Honourable Bernard Constable-Maxwell (son of William Constable-Maxwell, 10th [[Lord Herries of Terregles]]) and the Honourable Alice Fraser (daughter of [[Simon Fraser, 13th Lord Lovat]]), both of whom were scions of notable Scottish [[Recusancy|recusant]] families. He was educated at [[Downside School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt;

==World War I service==
Maxwell was [[Commissioned officers|commissioned]] in the [[Lovat Scouts]] on 4 August 1914 and fought at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].  He then served in [[Egypt]] before returning to the UK, where he transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in September 1916. Maxwell completed final pilot training at [[Central Flying School]], [[RAF Upavon|Upavon]] and joined [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|No. 56 Squadron]] in [[London Colney]] in March 1917.  He was attached to 'A' Flight, commanded by Captain [[Albert Ball]], flying [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|SE5]] aircraft.  In April 1917, Maxwell's squadron was sent to France and he achieved a victory on his first patrol.&lt;ref&gt;Shores ''et.al.'' (1990), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later he was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed unhurt.

On 26 July 1917 Maxwell was appointed a [[flight commander]], by which time he had been credited with eight victories.  He was awarded the Military Cross on 18 October&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=16 October 1917 |supp=yes |issue=30340 |startpage=10710 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was posted back to the UK. After instructing at the School of Aerial Fighting at [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry]], he returned to No. 56 Squadron, where in six weeks he claimed six more victories.

His confirmed 26 victories consisted of 12 enemy aircraft destroyed (including two shared wins), and 14 &quot;out of control&quot; victories, six of which were shared. In scoring the shared victories, he teamed with such other aces as [[Cecil Arthur Lewis|Cecil Lewis]], [[Edric Broadberry]], [[Charles Jeffs]], and [[Cyril Crowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Shores ''et.al.'' (1990), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell was granted a permanent commission as a captain in the Royal Air Force on 1 August 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=1 August 1919 |issue=31486 |startpage=9867 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; relinquishing his commission in the 1st Lovat's Scouts, Territorial Force, the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=21 November 1919 |supp=yes |issue=31652 |startpage=14267 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 August 1919 he was appointed a temporary Staff Officer, 3rd Class (Air), to serve at the [[Air Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=9 September 1919 |issue=31543 |startpage=11356 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was placed on the [[half-pay]] list between 1 February&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=3 February 1920 |issue=31765 |startpage=1429 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1 April 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=27 April 1920 |issue=31879 |startpage=4853 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 14 February 1921 resigned his permanent commission, and was granted the rank of major.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=15 March 1921 |issue=32257 |startpage=2095 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He later became a director of Maxwell-Chrysler Motors.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt;

==Honours and awards==
;Military Cross
:Captain Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell, Yeomanry and R.F.C.
::&quot;For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on many occasions. He has taken part in forty-three offensive patrols, in fourteen of which he acted as leader. He has destroyed at least three enemy aircraft, and driven down nine others completely out of control. He has consistently shown great skill in aerial combats, and his fearlessness and fine offensive spirit have been a splendid example to others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |date=5 March 1918 |supp=yes |issue=30561 |startpage=2925 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Distinguished Flying Cross
:Captain Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell, M.C.
::&quot;This officer has at all times shown exceptional skill and gallantry and on numerous occasions has fought against greatly superior numbers. During the last six weeks he had brought down five enemy aeroplanes. Recently, he approached unobserved to within ten yards of three Fokker triplanes, one of which he shot down. He was chased for about nine miles by the remaining two until he met a formation of six Camels, these he led to attack some enemy aircraft, although he had only twenty-five minutes' petrol left.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dfc&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |date=2 August 1918 |supp=yes |issue=30827 |startpage=9202 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
