The '''Consolidated P-30 (PB-2)''' was a 1930s [[United States]] two-seat [[fighter aircraft]]. An attack version called the '''A-11''' was also built, along with two '''Y1P-25''' prototypes and '''YP-27''', '''Y1P-28''', and '''XP-33''' proposals. The P-30 is significant for being the first fighter in [[United States Army Air Corps]] service to have retractable landing gear, an enclosed and heated cockpit for the pilot, and an exhaust-driven turbosupercharger for altitude operation.

==Design and development==
In 1931, the [[Detroit Aircraft Corporation]], parent company of the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Company]] built a two-seat single-engined fighter aircraft based on the [[Lockheed Altair]] high-speed transport as a private venture. The prototype, the Detroit-Lockheed XP-900, flew in September 1931 and was purchased by the [[United States Army Air Corps]] as the [[Lockheed YP-24]]. Its performance was impressive, being faster than any fighter then in service with the Air Corps, and an order for five Y1P-24 fighters and four Y1A-9 attack aircraft was placed for the new aircraft, despite the loss of the prototype on 19 October 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frnclock p114-5&quot;&gt;Francillon 1982, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;angel p262&quot;&gt;Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The Detroit Aircraft Corporation went into [[bankruptcy]] eight days later, however, leading to the cancellation of the contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frnclock p114-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg p68&quot;&gt;Wegg 1990, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
When the Detroit Aircraft Corporation failed, the chief designer of the YP-24, [[Robert J. Woods]] was hired by [[Consolidated Aircraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg p68&quot;/&gt; Woods continued to develop the YP-24, the design becoming the Consolidated Model 25, with all-metal wings replacing the wooden wings of the YP-24 and a larger tail. The Army Air Corps ordered two prototypes as the Y1P-25 in March 1932, to be powered by a [[Curtiss V-1570]]-27, fitted with a [[turbo-supercharger]] on the port side of the forward fuselage. The order for the second prototype was quickly changed to a Y1A-11 attack aircraft, omitting the supercharger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p2&quot;&gt;Pelletier 2000, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Angel p95-6&quot;&gt;Angelucci and Bowers 1987, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

First to fly was the Y1P-25, which was delivered to the Air Corps on 9 December 1932. It demonstrated promising performance, reaching a speed of {{convert|247|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|15000|ft|m}}, but was destroyed in a crash on 13 January 1933, killing its pilot, Hugh M. Elmendorf (whose name was later given to [[Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson|Elmendorf Air Base]] in Alaska).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr p51&quot;&gt;Dorr and Donald 1990, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Y1A-11, armed with four forward-firing machine guns instead of the two of the Y1P-25 and racks for 400&amp;nbsp;lb (182&amp;nbsp;kg) of bombs was delivered to [[Wright Field]] on 5 January 1933. On 20 January 1933 the Y1A-11 disintegrated in midair, killing pilot Irvin A. Woodring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p2-3&quot;&gt;Pelletier 2002, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the loss of both prototypes in a week, on 1 March 1933, the Air Corps placed an order for four P-30 fighters and four A-11 attack aircraft. These production variants differed from the prototypes in having stronger fuselages, simplified undercarriages and more powerful engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg p68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p3&quot;&gt;Pelletier 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The first P-30 was delivered in January 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p3&quot;/&gt; Testing showed that the gunner's cockpit was uncomfortable and cold at the high altitudes where the P-30 was intended to fight, while the rearward facing gunners were liable to black out when the aircraft was maneuvered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr p57&quot;&gt;Dorr and Donald 1990, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these concerns, on 6 December 1934, the U.S. Air Corps placed an order for a further 50 P-30As, with more powerful V-1570-61 engines driving a three-bladed [[variable-pitch propeller]] and with oxygen supplies for the crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg p68-9&quot;&gt;Wegg 1990, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p5&quot;/&gt;

Three of the four P-30s were delivered to the [[94th Pursuit Squadron]] at [[Selfridge Field]] in 1934. The first P-30A, by this time redesignated PB-2A (Pursuit, Biplace), made its maiden flight on 17 December 1935, with deliveries to service units starting on 28 April 1936. The last of the 50 PB-2As were completed by August that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p5&quot;/&gt;

While intended as a high altitude fighter, the PB-2 flew relatively few high altitude flights, partly because of the discomfort for the crew. One exception took place in March 1937, when a PB-2A was flown to {{convert|39300|ft|m}} before being forced to return to lower altitudes when the aircraft's controls froze.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p10&quot;&gt;Pelletier 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 1936, a PB-2A flown by Lt. [[John M. Sterling]] won the [[Mitchell Trophy]] [[air race]] with a speed of {{convert|217.5|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg p69&quot;&gt;Wegg 1990, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the PB-2A was one of the few aircraft at the time to have retractable landing gear, they were frequently damaged in &quot;wheels-up&quot; landings when the pilots forgot to extend the landing gear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p9&quot;&gt;Pelletier 2002, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

One PB-2A was modified to a single-seat configuration as the PB-2A Special, to compete in a 1936 Air Corps competition for a new fighter to replace the [[Boeing P-26 Peashooter]]. It was larger and heavier than the other competitors and was much more expensive. It crashed during testing, with the [[Seversky P-35]] being ordered into production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angel p97&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sever p11&quot;&gt;Green and Swanborough 1979, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; One A-11 was converted to the XA-11A testbed with the new 1,000&amp;nbsp;hp (746&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Allison V-1710|Allison XV-1710-7]] engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg p69&quot;/&gt;

While the PB-2 was sturdy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p9&quot;/&gt; the two-seat fighter concept was obsolete by the time the aircraft entered service,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegg p69&quot;/&gt; and by 1939, all had been replaced in frontline service by [[Seversky P-35]] and Curtiss [[P-36 Hawk]] aircraft. The survivors remained in use as training aircraft until after the start of [[World War II]], with the last being withdrawn from use on 2 June 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pell p11&quot;&gt;Pelletier 2002, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
