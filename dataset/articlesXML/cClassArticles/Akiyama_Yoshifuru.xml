{{Japanese name|Akiyama}}
{{nihongo|'''Akiyama Yoshifuru'''|秋山 好古||extra= February 9, 1859 – November 4, 1930}} was a general in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and is considered the father of modern Japanese [[cavalry]]. He was Vice Admiral [[Akiyama Saneyuki]]'s older brother.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born as the third son to a poor ''[[samurai]]'' in the [[Iyo-Matsuyama Domain|Matsuyama Domain]], [[Iyo Province]] (modern [[Ehime Prefecture]]), Akiyama's family was so poor in his childhood that he was forced to work as a fire stoker and janitor in a local public bathhouse for a pittance each day.

Akiyama entered the ''Rikugun shikan gakkō'' (the forerunner of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]]) in 1877.  He went on to attend the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]], and was sent as a [[military attaché]] to [[France]] to study cavalry tactics and techniques. He was the only Japanese officer sent to study at the [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] at a time when the rest of the Japanese Army had turned to the [[Imperial German Army]] as its model and was being taught by instructors from Germany.

Akiyama had very pale skin and large eyes (for a person of Japanese descent in that era). He was often mistaken for a European student by many foreign instructors such as [[Jakob Meckel]] while at the Japanese Army Academy, and developed a reputation as a “ladies' man,” much to the envy of his colleagues during his stay in France, whereas he himself disliked his attractive looks. He was an impartial man who had a bowl of rice with slices of pickles for his meal. However, he spent his money on ''[[sake]]'' and had a reputation as a heavy drinker.

===Military career===
[[Image:Akiyama Yoshifuru.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General Akiyama]]
Akiyama was active in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894-1895 as a cavalry regimental commander in the [[IJA 1st Division]], and served with Japanese expeditionary forces in the subsequent [[Boxer Rebellion]] with the [[IJA 5th Division]]. In the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, he led his troops in the [[Battle of Shaho]], [[Battle of Sandepu]], and in the [[Battle of Mukden]] against the [[Cossack]] cavalry divisions of the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. In April 1906, he was awarded the [[Order of the Golden Kite]] (2nd class).

Akiyama became commander of the [[IJA 13th Division]] in 1913, and after his promotion to full [[General officer|general]] in 1916, was given command of the [[Imperial Guard of Japan|Imperial Guards Division]]. The following year, he was assigned command of the [[Chosen Army of Japan|Chōsen Army]]. In 1920, he became [[Inspectorate General of Military Training|Director General for Military Education]].

After he retired from active military service in 1923, declining promotion to [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]], he returned to his native island of [[Shikoku]] and became the principal of the Hokuyō Junior High School (present-day Matsuyama High School). Akiyama died of complications from [[diabetes]] at the Army Medical School Hospital in Tokyo in 1930, and his grave is in the city of Matsuyama.

==Portrayals in fiction==
Akiyama is one of the main characters of ''[[Saka no ue no kumo]]'' (&quot;Clouds over the slope&quot;), a novel by [[Shiba Ryotaro]], adapted  as a [[taiga drama|historical drama]] on the Japanese television network [[NHK]] from 2009-2011. Akiyama was portrayed by actor [[Hiroshi Abe (actor)|Hiroshi Abe]].

Akiyama inspired the character Dot Pixis in the manga series ''[[Attack on Titan]]''. This caused an Internet [[Flaming (Internet)|flame war]] about the general's military actions in specifically, but not exclusively, in Korea. The 2013 controversy included death threats to the manga's creator [[Hajime Isayama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Thousand Death Threats Against a Popular Anime Creator|url=http://kotaku.com/a-thousand-death-threats-against-a-popular-anime-creato-631792221|accessdate=July 1, 2013|newspaper=[[io9]]|date=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
