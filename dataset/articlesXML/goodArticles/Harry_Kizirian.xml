'''Harry Kizirian''' ({{lang-hy|Հէրի Գիզիրեան}}; July 13, 1925 – September 13, 2002) was an [[Armenian American]] member of the [[United States Marine Corps]] who served during World War II. Kizirian's service lasted from February 1944 to February 1946, during which he spent seventeen months overseas. Kizirian took part in the [[Battle of Okinawa]], where he landed during the first assault wave while heading a Marine [[fire team]].

Having been awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], the [[Awards and decorations of the National Guard#Rhode Island|Rhode Island Cross]], the [[Bronze Star]] with [[V Device|Combat &quot;V&quot;]], and the [[Purple Heart]] twice, Kizirian is considered one of the most decorated marines of World War II.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=133}}&lt;ref name=Journal1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tashjian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tashjian|first=James H.|title=The Armenian American in World War II|date=July 1952|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygJnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q|publisher=Harenik Assoc|quote=Harry Kizirian is one of the only three Rhode Islanders to receive the Rhode Island Cross.

==Life==
Kizirian, a first generation [[Armenian American]], was born in his home on July 13, 1925 at 134 Chad Brown St. [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name=gelenian&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelenian|first=Ara Arthur|title=The Armenians in Rhode Island: Ancient Roots to Present Experiences|year=1985|publisher=Published jointly by the Rhode Island Heritage Commission and the Rhode Island Publications Society|location=Providence|isbn=978-0-917012-73-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcLWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; He was the only son of Toros and Hripsime Kizirian, who were born in Goydun (Govdun), near [[Sivas]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=133-134}} Kizirian's mother came to the United States in the 1920s after losing her first husband and seven children during the [[Armenian Genocide]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=133}}&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; His father was employed by the Rhode Island Tool Company and his mother was a housewife.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=133}}

Kizirian, who was active in sports, was offered a scholarship to LaSalle Academy.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=134-135}} He declined the offer so that he could attend the local Mt. Pleasant High School and be closer to his friends. Kizirian became a top athlete in his class; he played on the football team for three years and became captain in his senior year.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=135}}

When Kizirian was 15 years old, his father died.&lt;ref name=Beloved /&gt;&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; Harry became responsible for the care of himself and his mother.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=135}} To take care of the family's immediate needs, Kizirian worked at a meat packing plant unloading sides of beef from freight cars.&lt;ref name=Beloved /&gt;&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; He then got a temporary position at the Providence post office for two years while finishing high school.&lt;ref name=Beloved /&gt;&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt;

On February 23, 1944—the day after his graduation from high school—Kizirian enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He was sent overseas on October 6, 1944 and was assigned to the [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]]&lt;ref name=JackReed&gt;{{cite web|title=In Memory of Harry Kizirian|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-10-02/html/CREC-2002-10-02-pt1-PgS9828.htm|work=United States Government Printing Office|publisher=United States Congressional Records|location=Washington D.C.|format=Volume 148, Number 127|date=October 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=135}}

After spending seventeen months overseas, Kizirian returned to Providence, where he married Hazel Serabian of [[Massena (town), New York|Massena]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; For the first four years after his return, Kizirian underwent treatment for wounds he suffered during battle.&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; In spite of undergoing several major surgeries, Kizirian was left with permanent disabilities.&lt;ref name=retired&gt;{{cite news|title=RIC bestows honorary degree on retired Postmaster Kizirian|newspaper=The Providence Journal|date=May 24, 2002|page=C-03|quote=Therefore, by the authority vested in me and with the concurrent action of the Board of Governors for Higher Education and the faculty of Rhode Island College, I confer upon you the honorary degree of Doctor of Public Service with all of its associated rights, privileges and honors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After recovering from a life-threatening illness in which surgeons removed 95 percent of his stomach, Kizirian entered a career in the Postal Service. He first returned to the Providence post office as a substitute clerk. In 1954, he was appointed foreman, the first of several promotions he received throughout his life.&lt;ref name=International /&gt; In 1961, he was made Postmaster of Providence by President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Congress unanimously confirmed the appointment. At age 36, Kizirian was one of the youngest postmasters in the country. During his tenure, Kizirian was instrumental in establishing the first automated post office.&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; The Providence post office would be an exemplary model for post offices around the world. Kizirian later remarked, &quot;There is no nation on this earth that didn't send representatives to see the new post office.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hazell&gt;{{cite news|last=Hazell|first=Edward|title=Automation of Post Office has earned stamp of approval|newspaper=The Providence Journal|date=October 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Kizirian was removed from his position amid opposition from Senators [[John Chafee]] and [[Claiborne Pell]].&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; Despite protests from the employees who wore pins that said &quot;We Love Harry&quot;, Kizirian's position was eliminated and he subsequently retired.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt;

Kiziran and his wife had five children: Joanne, Thomas, Janice, Shakay, and Richard.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt;

Kizirian died on September 13, 2002 at age 77. His funeral procession was held at the Saint Vartanants Armenian Apostolic Church in Providence and he is buried at the [[Swan Point Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt;

==World War II==

===Battle of Okinawa===
Krrizian joined the Marine Corps on February 23, 1944. He was sent overseas after training and assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, [[22nd Marine Regiment (United States)|22nd Marines]], [[6th Marine Division]] on [[Guadalcanal]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Serving as a fire team leader, he participated in the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]] on April 1, 1945, landing with the first assault wave. On May 11, he charged an enemy machine gun position that had pinned down members of another unit of his platoon and forced the enemy to withdrawal so the other Marine unit could continue its advance on the enemy. Wounded during his attack on the enemy, he and his fire team joined up with the other Marine unit in its advance on the Japanese. Company E moved east the same day toward Shuri Ridge.&lt;ref name=International /&gt; On May 14, Company E attacked and seized the Japanese air strip, then stopped for a short rest. Kizirian's injuries on May 11 included shell fragments in his shoulders and arms. Despite his wounds he continued fighting.&lt;ref name=JackReed /&gt; He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with [[V Device|Combat &quot;V&quot;]] and the Purple Heart Medal for his actions on May 11. His Bronze Star citation reads:{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=135}}

{{quotation|For heroic achievement in connection with operations against the Japanese enemy on Okinawa Shima, Ryukyu Islands, on May 11, 1945. While serving as a fire team leader in a Marine rifle company, Corporal Kizirian, seeing a unit of his advancing platoon pinned down by enemy machine gun fire, courageously charged the enemy emplacement, thus enabling the trapped unit to continue to advance. Although painfully wounded, he fearlessly closed in on the emplacement, firing rapidly into the embrasure and succeeded in driving the enemy from their weapon. Meanwhile, men of the trapped unit continued to move out in the assault, and Corporal Kizirian, still leading his fire team, joined them. By this prompt and heroic action, Corporal Kizirian assisted materially in the continued advance of his platoon. His actions were at all time in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|[[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.]], Major General, U.S. Marine Corps}}

[[File:Marines land on Okinawa shores.jpg|thumb|Kizirian was among the U.S. Marine reinforcements that waded ashore to support the beachhead in Okinawa on 1 April 1945.]]

After a month to recover from his wounds, Kizirian rejoined his unit, which was assigned to Sugar Loaf Hill.&lt;ref name=International /&gt; The Marines battled over one ridge after another toward [[NaHa]], the capital city. On three separate occasions Kizirian was tossed in the air by Japanese artillery and mortar fire while he provided covering fire for other members of his unit, who were retreating down a slope.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=136}} Kizirian's company moved to a burial ground where Japanese soldiers were hiding in holes dug in the nearby hillsides. During the operation, someone yelled, &quot;Two over your head!&quot; Kizirian responded by killing both of the enemy combatants with his [[carbine]].&lt;ref name=International /&gt;  Kizirian would later recall, &quot;I must have shot four clips into those guys, I got them before they got me.&quot; Moments later, an enemy rushed towards Kizirian with a sword. Kizirian managed to kill the enemy with a pistol and took the sword.&lt;ref name=International /&gt;

The battalion commander was killed, and soon afterwards, orders arrived to seek and destroy any enemy combatants around NaHa. On June 11, 1945, Kizirian was assigned the special task of patrolling to locate elements of an enemy reserve platoon.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=136}} His unit moved to attack Japanese soldiers entrenched along a ridge line. Through the smoke and dust, he noticed six stretcher bearers and a wounded Marine that were under heavy machine gun fire. Disregarding his own safety, Kizirian placed himself in the line of fire and single-handedly attacked the enemy emplacement. The [[Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces]] that confronted Kizirian shot him in the legs and abdomen. Unable to walk, he still managed to make his way forward using his elbows to a position where he was able to shoot and kill all 12 soldiers manning the machine gun.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; Due to these actions, Kizirian was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], the second highest medal in the United States military. The citation provides details about the event:{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=137-138}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=7783 |title=Valor awards for Harry  Kizirian |publisher=[[Military Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The Navy Cross is presented to Harry Kizirian, Corporal, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism while serving as an Automatic Rifleman of Company E, Second Battalion, Twenty-second Marines, Sixth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, on 11 June 1945. Returning from an assigned mission of locating elements of a reserve platoon, Private First Class Kizirian observed a stretcher party of Marines pinned down and suffering casualties while attempting to evacuate the wounded of an adjacent unit. Determined to reach a more advantageous position to deliver accurate fire on the enemy, he unhesitatingly moved forward. Immediately exposed to additional hostile fire which wounded him in both legs and abdomen, he continued to drag himself forward by pressure of his elbows, alternately firing and advancing until he had killed all twelve of the Japanese in the emplacement. By his outstanding courage and aggressive fighting spirit, Private First Class Kizirian enabled the stretcher party to advance and evacuate the wounded. His gallant devotion to duty throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|Roy S. Geiger'', Lieutenant General, U.S. Marine Corps}}

After making a recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took the capital city of NaHa and were preparing for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=138}} When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=138}}

During a break in fighting at Okinawa, Kizirian was photographed by a member of the press. The picture that later appeared on the cover of the June 24, 1945 issue of ''[[The New York Times Sunday Magazine]]''. The photograph became the face of the battle for thousands of Americans.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=133}}

After serving seventeen months overseas, Kizirian received discharge from the Marine Corps on February 11, 1946.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=138}}

In 1987, the Rhode Island Chapter of the [[American Society for Public Administration]] (ASPA) presented him with its John O.
