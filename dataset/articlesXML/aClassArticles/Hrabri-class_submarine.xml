The '''''Hrabri'' class''' consisted of two submarines built by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]], on the [[River Tyne]], in the United Kingdom, for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia). Launched in 1927, the vessels were named ''[[Yugoslav submarine Hrabri|Hrabri]]'' (Brave) and ''[[Yugoslav submarine Nebojša|Nebojša]]'' (Fearless). Their design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and they were built using parts originally assembled for L-class submarines that were never completed. The ''Hrabri''-class were the first submarines to serve in the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and the class was joined by the two smaller French-made {{sclass-|Osvetnik|submarine}}s to make up the pre-war Yugoslav submarine force. They were armed with six bow-mounted {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[torpedo tubes]], two {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} guns and one [[machine gun]], and could dive to {{convert|60|m|ft}}.

Prior to [[World War II]] both submarines participated in cruises to [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ports. ''Hrabri'' was captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] forces in April 1941 during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. She was never commissioned by the Italians and was subsequently scrapped. ''Nebojša'' evaded capture, and served with British submarine forces in the Mediterranean as an [[anti-submarine warfare]] training boat until the end of the war. Following the war, she served in the [[Yugoslav Navy]] as ''Tara'' in a training role until 1954, when she was stricken.

==Description and construction==
Yugoslav naval policy in the [[interwar period]] lacked direction until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=732}} although it was generally accepted that the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of [[submarine]]s, coastal [[torpedo boat]]s, [[torpedo bomber]]s and conventional [[bomber]] aircraft to perform this role. The ''Hrabri''-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=779}}

The ''Hrabri''-class was built for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]] on the [[River Tyne]] in the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Their design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and they were built using parts originally assembled for the Group III boats HMS ''L-67'' and HMS ''L-68'', which were never completed due to the end of the war. The L-class were designed for operations in the [[North Sea]], but during the interwar period the [[Royal Navy]] had deployed them around the world, including in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from 1929 onward.{{sfn|Akermann|2002|pp=168–169}} The two Yugoslav boats had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|72.05|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|7.32|m|ftin|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, and a surfaced [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.96|m|ftin|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Their surfaced [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|975|LT}} or {{convert|1164|LT}} submerged, and their crews consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men. They had a [[Submarine depth ratings|diving depth]] of {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=171}}

They had two shafts driven by two [[diesel engine]]s (when surfaced) or two [[electric motor]]s (when submerged). The diesel engines were rated at {{convert|2400|bhp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and the electric motors at {{convert|1600|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}, and they were designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|15.7|kn|lk=in}} under diesel power while surfaced, and {{convert|10|kn}} on their electric motors when submerged. The ''Hrabri''-class were armed with six bow-mounted {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[torpedo tubes]] and carried twelve torpedoes.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}} They were also equipped with two {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} guns (one forward and one [[aft]] of the [[conning tower]]), and one [[machine gun]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Their radius of action was {{convert|3800|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Akermann|2002|p=166}}

==Service history==
Both submarines were [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in 1927,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} and left the Tyne in late January 1928.{{sfn|Hood|1928|p=154}} In company with the Yugoslav [[submarine tender]] {{ship|Yugoslav submarine tender|Hvar||2}}, the submarines arrived in the [[Bay of Kotor]] on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928.{{sfn|Luković|6 April 2013}} In May and June 1929, ''Hrabri'', ''Nebojša'', ''Hvar'' and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'' on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the [[Ionian Sea]], and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. According to the British naval [[attaché]], the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In June and July 1930, ''Hrabri'', ''Nebojša'' and the fleet auxiliary ''Sitnica'' again cruised the Mediterranean, visiting [[Alexandria]] and [[Beirut]].{{sfn|Radio Tivat|9 July 2014}} In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}} In 1933, the attaché reported that the naval policy of Yugoslavia was strictly defensive, aimed at protecting her more than {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} of coastline.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=453}}

===''Hrabri''===
{{main|Yugoslav submarine Hrabri}}
The first of the class, ''Hrabri'' was involved in a series of visits to Mediterranean ports during the interwar period.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=544, 641, 838}} She was captured in port by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]],{{sfn|Terzić|1982|pp=267, 374, 457}}{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}} but was not commissioned by them and was [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] later that year due to her poor condition.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}}

===''Nebojša''===
{{main|Yugoslav submarine Nebojša}}
''Nebojša'' was the second and last of the class. After repairs following an accident in 1930, she participated in several cruises in the Mediterranean during the interwar period.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=247, 453, 738}} She evaded capture during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941,{{sfn|Willmott|2010|p=311}} and was used by the Royal Navy as an [[anti-submarine warfare]] training vessel. After the war she was overhauled by the Yugoslavs and renamed ''Tara'',{{sfn|Novosti|2011}} continuing in a training role until she was stricken in 1954.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}}
