'''No. 78 Wing''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) operational training [[Wing (air force unit)|wing]], headquartered at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales. It comprises [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|Nos. 76]] and [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|79 Squadrons]], operating the [[BAE Systems Hawk|BAE Hawk 127]] lead-in fighter, and [[No. 278 Squadron RAAF|No. 278 Squadron]], a technical training unit. No.&amp;nbsp;79 Squadron, located at [[RAAF Base Pearce]], Western Australia, is responsible for converting new pilots to fast jets, while No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron at Williamtown conducts introductory fighter courses; both units also fly support missions for the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Australian Army]].

Formed as a fighter wing in November 1943, No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing comprised three flying units, [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]], [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF|78]] and [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|80 Squadrons]], operating [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawks]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. After the war, it re-equipped with [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] at Williamtown. During the early 1950s, the wing was based at [[Malta]] on [[garrison]] duties with the [[Royal Air Force]], operating two squadrons of [[De&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] jet fighters. Re-equipped with [[CAC Sabre]]s, it deployed with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;3]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]] to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] in 1958–59, flying [[sortie]]s against communist insurgents in the final years of the [[Malayan Emergency|Emergency]]. In the 1960s, it was tasked with providing regional air defence during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] between Indonesia and Malaysia, and supplied the equipment and personnel for the [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|RAAF contingent]] operating from [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base|Ubon Air Base]] in Thailand. No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing was disbanded in November 1967, and re-formed for its present role as an operational training wing in February 2000.

==History==

===World War II===
No. 78 Wing was formed on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1943 at [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland, under the command of [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] (later [[Group Captain]]) [[Wilfred Deakin Brookes|W.D. Brookes]].&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[No. 77 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing]], it came under the control of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group, a mobile strike force supporting the Allied armies as they advanced in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]]. No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing's flying units were originally to have consisted of [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;80 Squadron]], operating [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, and [[No. 452 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;452]] and [[No. 458 Squadron RAAF|457 Squadrons]], operating [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. The Spitfire squadrons could not be released from duty in the [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]] as planned, and [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]] and [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF|78 Squadrons]] took their place, making the formation an all-Kittyhawk force.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 182–184]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing flew combat air patrols and ground-attack missions during [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|Operation Reckless]], the assault on [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and [[Aitape]], [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], in April 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 206–213]&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the year, the wing's flying hours in New Guinea were consistently higher than those of its counterparts in the US [[Fifth Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 194]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/14.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 227]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:78 Sqn (AWM AC0070).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|No. 78 Squadron Kittyhawks in late 1944|alt=Row of single-engined fighter aircraft parked on airfield]]
When No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group was re-formed as the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 TAF) in October 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing constituted its fighter contingent along with the recently arrived [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing]], which also operated Kittyhawks.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 298–299]&lt;/ref&gt; The relegation of No.&amp;nbsp;1 TAF to areas of operations bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale in late 1944 and early 1945. In April 1945, the newly appointed [[Officer Commanding]] No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing, Group Captain [[Wilfred Arthur]], helped bring about the so-called &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; in protest at the employment of Australian fighter squadrons for apparently worthless ground-attack missions. A subsequent inquiry cleared the pilots involved, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur retained command of No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing for the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]], which commenced on 1&amp;nbsp;May. Augmented by No.&amp;nbsp;452 Squadron's Spitfires, the wing was a last-minute replacement for No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing—which had been delayed while moving its aircraft forward from [[Noemfoor]] and northern Australia—and had only ten days to prepare for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 453]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as its flying squadrons, No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing's complement included [[No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;114 Mobile Fighter Control Unit]] (No.&amp;nbsp;114 MFCU), No.&amp;nbsp;29 Air Stores Park, No.&amp;nbsp;28 Medical Clearing Station, and No.&amp;nbsp;11 Repair and Servicing Unit.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;May 1945, Arthur was succeeded by Wing Commander [[Alan Rawlinson]].&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 75–85&lt;/ref&gt; In June and July, the wing took part in the [[Battle of North Borneo|assaults on Labuan]] and [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Balikpapan]], undertaking convoy escort in the former and, joined once more by No.&amp;nbsp;452 Squadron, ground-attack missions and close support of the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Water, ''Oboe'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/29.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 482–488]&lt;/ref&gt; During July it flew 858 [[sortie]]s, dropping over {{convert|250000|lb|kg}} of bombs and expending almost 350,000 rounds of ammunition, for the loss of six aircraft and four pilots killed or missing.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early post-war period===
[[File:No. 78 Wing RAAF Mustang 1948 (AWM P01254.024).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Wing Commander Dick Cresswell flying a {{nowrap|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing}} Mustang, January 1948|alt=Overhead shot of single-engined fighter aircraft in flight]]
Following the end of hostilities, No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing, comprising Nos.&amp;nbsp;75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, and No.&amp;nbsp;114 MFCU, departed Tarakan for Australia. Arriving in December 1945, the formation was based initially at [[Deniliquin]], New South Wales, where its squadrons were reduced to [[En cadre|cadre]] status; No.&amp;nbsp;80 Squadron was disbanded there in July 1946.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 97–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighter Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', pp. 44, 68, 77&lt;/ref&gt; The wing and its remaining squadrons relocated in May and June to [[RAAF Station Schofields]], New South Wales, and then in August to [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]], where they re-equipped with [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]].&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 105–108&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlinson, now a [[group captain]], completed his appointment as officer commanding in December 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Wing Commander [[Dick Cresswell]] held command of the wing—as well as the Williamtown base—from March 1947 to March 1948.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 117, 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', pp. 169–171&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;378 (Base) Squadron was formed under the aegis of No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing at Williamtown in June 1947; base squadrons were administrative and logistical units intended to make their wings self-supporting and mobile, in case of deployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;478 (Maintenance) Squadron formed the same month to take responsibility for all aircraft and equipment operated by No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 59–62&lt;/ref&gt; Nos.&amp;nbsp;75 and 78 Squadrons were disbanded in March and April 1948, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighter Units&quot;/&gt; Nos.&amp;nbsp;478 and 378 Squadrons also disbanded in April, the latter re-forming as Station Headquarters Williamtown.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; For the remainder of the year, No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing's aircraft and staff were gradually transferred to other units; by December the formation had been reduced to a strength of four airmen and no officers, and was declared &quot;non-operative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 149–159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta garrison===
No. 78 Wing was re-established in January 1949, comprising Nos.&amp;nbsp;75, [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]], and 478 Squadrons, and No.&amp;nbsp;114 MFCU.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first wing in the RAAF to equip with jet aircraft, when its flying units took delivery of [[De&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] F.30 fighters between 1949 and 1951; it was also allocated Mustangs and [[CAC Wirraway]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Vampire, Macchi and Iroquois'', pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; The wing subsequently re-equipped with Vampire FB.9s leased from the [[Royal Air Force]], in exchange for Australia's commitment to support RAF operations in the [[Middle East]]. Comprising Nos.&amp;nbsp;75 and 76 (Fighter) Squadrons, No.&amp;nbsp;378 (Base) Squadron and No.&amp;nbsp;478 (Maintenance) Squadron, No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing was deployed to [[Malta]] on [[garrison]]ing duties under Wing Commander (later Group Captain) [[Brian Eaton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens 221-223&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 180–182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MALTA0206.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|No. 78 Wing Vampires at Ħal Far, Malta, 1952|alt=Row of single-engined fighter aircraft with twin tail booms, parked on airfield]]
As the RAAF's presence was essentially a symbolic gesture to demonstrate the Commonwealth's solidarity in the midst of the [[Cold War]], the combat squadrons were half-strength only, operating eight aircraft each. In addition to the Vampires, two [[Gloster Meteor]] trainers were provided. Personnel departed Australia in July 1952; the posting overseas being a minimum of two years, families were permitted to make the journey as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OddJobs&quot;&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 173–175&lt;/ref&gt; Although under the operational control of the RAF's [[No. 205 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;205 Group]], the wing was under no circumstances to be used in combat without the express permission of the Australian government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens 221-223&quot;/&gt; The airmen participated in many [[NATO]] exercises while stationed at Malta, and one year took first and second place in the Middle Eastern Gunnery Contest for the [[Ernest Mason|&quot;Imshi&quot; Mason Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally based at the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Ħal Far]] airfield, in south-east Malta, the wing moved in June 1953 to the centrally located [[Ta' Qali|RAF Station Ta'Kali]], command of which was given to Group Captain Eaton.&lt;ref name=&quot;OddJobs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo204&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 204–207&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, with plans afoot to form a [[Far East Strategic Reserve]] to contain communist aggression in South East Asia, the British and Australian governments began to discuss withdrawing No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing from the Middle East when its planned two-year garrison was complete. Eaton handed over command to Wing Commander Geoff Newstead in September 1954. The wing flew its last sorties in December, and returned to Australia the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its tour in the Mediterranean, No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing was reorganised at Williamtown. On 16&amp;nbsp;March 1955, the wing headquarters was re-formed, and Nos.&amp;nbsp;76 and 378 Squadrons were disbanded. No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron remained with the wing, augmented on 21&amp;nbsp;March by [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;3]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]]. On 1&amp;nbsp;April, No.&amp;nbsp;478 Squadron absorbed the maintenance functions of No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, pp. 372–373&lt;/ref&gt; Nos.&amp;nbsp;75 and 77 Squadrons initially operated Meteors from Williamtown and No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron was based at [[Fairbairn, Canberra|RAAF Station Canberra]], where it flew P-51D Mustangs. By November 1956 the wing had re-equipped with [[CAC Sabre]]s and all of its units were stationed at Williamtown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabre&quot;&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A94.htm CAC Sabre] at [[RAAF Museum]].

Group Captain [[Glen Cooper (RAAF officer)|Glen Cooper]] took command of the wing in 1957, deploying it between October 1958 and February 1959 to [[RMAF Base Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]] in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], where its flying units consisted of Nos.&amp;nbsp;3 and 77 Squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cooper-glen-albert-12352 Cooper, Glen Albert] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].

Between October and December 1965, a detachment of six Sabres, initially from No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron and later from No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron, was based at Labuan to conduct combat patrols over the Indonesian–Malaysian border on Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=505 RAAF Sabres began Borneo patrols] at Air Power Development Centre.

For the next six years this squadron operated from [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base|Ubon Air Base]] in Thailand and was manned by personnel from No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing serving on six-month to one-year rotations. The RAAF was careful to not acknowledge any connection between the two units, however, as Malaysia had a policy of neutrality towards war in South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 10–16&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron was disbanded in July 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron, equipped with [[Dassault Mirage&amp;nbsp;III]] supersonic fighters, relieved No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron at Butterworth in May 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirage&quot;&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A3.htm Dassault Mirage III] at RAAF Museum.
