==Retirement==
The documentary film &quot;Azorian: The Raising of the K-129&quot;, directed by Michael White, indicated that the deck log of the Swordfish was shared with the Soviets as evidence that the Swordfish was not involved in the sinking of the K-129 (the article states the logs were not shared).  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.122.186.222|99.122.186.222]] ([[User talk:99.122.186.222|talk]]) 02:12, 6 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Untitled==
The statement that &quot;K-129 sank about 150 miles (240 km) northwest of Oahu&quot; does not seem to be consistent with what's stated in the Wikipedia page on K-129 itself.

== re: final casualty ==

I don't know where you received the information regarding our casualty in Nov 85 but whoever gave it to you obviously wasn't there nor did they talk to anyone who was. I was the radio watch stander when the whole casualty started and if you would like the true story then you can email me at the address I provided.

Regarding this flooding caused by the inability of the crew to get the replacement drain pump working, having been on the sister ship USS Skate (SSN-578), my memory is that the trim pump and the drain pump could be cross-connected so that either pump could perform the role of the other. Since both pumps are vital to submarine operation, this cross-connect feature provided the required redundancy for critical functions. Can anyone explain why the engine room bilges could not be pumped out by switching valves to cross-connect the trim pump?--[[User:Tvbanfield|Tvbanfield]] ([[User talk:Tvbanfield|talk]]) 17:13, 12 September 2011 (UTC)


The whole section lack any references. Can anyone prove that this a declassified incident/operations ? [[User:Wfoj2|Wfoj2]] ([[User talk:Wfoj2|talk]]) 01:03, 29 December 2012 (UTC)

== Inaccuracies ==

The following was a comment made directly to the article by {{user|Rhasty}} on 06:16, April 19, 2008 and moved to the talk page by [[User:Neil916|Neil916]] ([[User Talk:Neil916|Talk]]) 06:37, 19 April 2008 (UTC)

:''Although the incident recorded is at least mostly accurate in account some of the details and the time frame are inaccurate. The actual incident occured in 1985. I arrived on the boat in 1985 following the majority of the repairs from the above incident. The swordfish did however set to sea several more times following the drain pump incident. Although the incident time and some details may be inaccurate the actions of at least the engineering officer, the reactor operator, the electricl operator, and the throttleman can be truley commended. This I received from individuals who survived the ordeal. The decommissioning did occur in 1989 from the Pearl Harbor Naval shipyard.''

== Swordfish Historical: 1963 - 1967 ==

≤Since I was serving aboard the Swordfish during the subject years, I found a few, significant, errors in your recorded data. Regardless of where your data was obtained, it is in error. I submitted factual data changes and you decided your entries were verifyable. How much more verifyable can you become if not by having lived the expierence? Please Respond.

Respectfully,
Didntcomeasy  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Didntcomeasy|Didntcomeasy]] ([[User talk:Didntcomeasy|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Didntcomeasy|contribs]]) 03:58, 12 January 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I was aboard the Swordfish in 1962 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard.  She had a fire in the reactor compartment due to welding by shipyard personnel. Myself and two other crew members donned breathing masks and descended into the reactor compartment, without anti containment clothing and put the fire out. We were scrubbed by ships crew, assigned to monitor radiation, with heavy brushes designed to remove the top layer of skin, to remove surface  contamination. The total contamination was never known to us do to the film badges and dosimeters being pegged to the limit. I have suffered some residual problems from this incident._ _ _ _ J.E.
