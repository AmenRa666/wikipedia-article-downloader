'''SMS ''Vineta''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the {{sclass-|Victoria Louise|cruiser|4}}, built for the German [[Imperial German Navy|Imperial Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine'') in the 1890s. ''Vineta'' was laid down at the [[AG Vulcan]] shipyard in 1895, launched in April 1897, and commissioned into the Navy in July 1898. The ship, named for the semi-legendary medieval town of [[Vineta]], was armed with a battery of two 21&amp;nbsp;cm guns and eight 15&amp;nbsp;cm guns and had a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}.

''Vineta'' served abroad in the American Station for the first several years of her career. While on station in the Americas, she participated in the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903]] and bombarded several Venezuelan fortresses. She returned to Germany in 1905 and was used as a torpedo training ship in 1908. She was modernized in 1909&amp;ndash;1911, after which she was used as a [[school ship]] for naval cadets. In November 1912, she participated in an international naval protest of the [[First Balkan War]]. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''Vineta'' was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a [[barracks ship]] after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1920.

''Vineta'' was ordered under the contract name &quot;M&quot; and was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Danzig]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=G47&gt;Gröner, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 9 December 1897, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 13 September 1899.&lt;ref name=G48&gt;Gröner, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was {{convert|110.60|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.40|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.58|m|ftin|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|6491|t|LT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4-cylinder  [[triple expansion engine]]s powered by twelve coal-fired [[Belleville boiler]]s. Her engines provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn}} and a range of approximately {{convert|3412|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. She had a crew of 31&amp;nbsp;officers and 446&amp;nbsp;enlisted men.&lt;ref name=G478&gt;Gröner, pp. 47&amp;ndash;48&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with two [[21 cm SK L/40 gun|21&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/40]] guns in single turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns were supplied with 58&amp;nbsp;rounds of ammunition each. They had a range of {{convert|16300|m|abbr=on}}. ''Vineta'' also carried eight [[15 cm SK L/40|15&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/40]] guns. Four were mounted in turrets amidships and the other four were placed in [[casemate]]s. These guns had a range of {{convert|13700|m|abbr=on}}. She also carried ten [[8.8 cm SK L/35]] guns.&lt;ref name=G47/&gt; The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns.&lt;ref name=G254&gt;Gardiner, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; She was also equipped with three {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the [[broadside]] and the third was in the bow, all below the waterline.&lt;ref name=G47/&gt;

==Service history==
Following her commissioning in 1899, ''Vineta'' was sent overseas.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt; Her commander was ''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) Da Fonseca-Wollheim.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes'', p. 691&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was assigned to the American Station, along with the small cruiser {{SMS|Geier||2}} and the [[gunboat]] {{SMS|Luchs||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes'', p. 693&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1900, ''Vineta'' inspected [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]] for its potential as a naval base, but the Germans determined the port was insufficient for their purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1901, ''Vineta'' and the small cruiser {{SMS|Falke||2}} were sent to [[Venezuela]] in a show of force to compel the Venezuelan government to make reparations for grievances related to internal conflicts in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in December 1902, ''Vineta'' participated in the German naval contingent in the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903]]. A British merchant ship had been boarded and its crew arrested by Venezuelan forces on 13 December; in response, British forces bombarded the forts at [[Puerto Cabello]], and enlisted ''Vineta'' in the attack. ''Vineta'' was tasked with shelling the fortresses ''Libertador'' and ''Vigia''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1903, the gunboat {{SMS|Panther||2}} attacked [[Fort San Carlos]] in [[Maracaibo]], but was repulsed. ''Vineta'' therefore was sent to silence the guns on 21 January. During the [[Bombardment of Fort San Carlos|bombardment of the fort]], ''Vineta'' set it afire and destroyed the fortress&lt;ref name=NYT23011903&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 January 1903, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F7081FF93B5412738DDDAD0A94D9405B838CF1D3 GERMAN COMMANDER BLAMES VENEZUELANS; Commodore Scheder Says That Fort San Carlos Fired First.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, one of ''Vineta''{{'}}s 15&amp;nbsp;cm ammunition magazines exploded, but did not cause major damage to the ship. The accident had significant long-term consequences, however, as it exposed the volatility of German propellant charges. The Germans therefore reworked the composition of the propellant, which was in service by 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 369&amp;ndash;370&lt;/ref&gt; This new, more stable propellant saved several German battlecruisers from destruction when their magazines were penetrated by British shells during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 373&amp;ndash;374&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1904, the ship visited [[New Orleans]] with the rest of the American Squadron, which at that time included ''Falke'', ''Panther'', and {{SMS|Gazelle||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Witte, pp. 230&amp;ndash;231&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vineta'' was detached from the American Squadron and returned to Germany in 1905.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt; She was used as a torpedo training ship starting in 1908. In 1909, she went to dry dock at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig for a refit, during which she was re-boilered. ''Vineta'' originally had three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished by 1911, at which point ''Vineta'' became a cadet training ship.&lt;ref name=G478/&gt;

The ship cruised in the western Mediterranean in the autumn of 1912, along with her sister {{SMS|Hertha||2}}. The old cruiser {{SMS|Geier||2}} was also in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Vego, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; As the Bulgarian army was poised to march on [[Constantinople]] during the [[First Balkan War]], the Great Powers deployed a naval force to ensure the safety of foreign nationals in the Ottoman Empire. ''Vineta'' and the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben||2}} were sent to Constantinople as part of this force. The international fleet sent ashore a force of around 3,000 officers and men. The force was withdrawn to [[Crete]] after a ceasefire seemed imminent, but by February fighting again broke out, and the island was seized by Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 1914, ''Vineta'' was in [[Haiti]], when [[Michel Oreste]] abdicated from the presidency. He sought refuge aboard the ship, which landed marines along with the American cruiser {{USS|Montana|ACR-13|6}} in [[Port-au-Prince]] to prevent rioting in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Colby, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vineta'' had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the [[Baltic Sea]]. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service.&lt;ref name=GG142&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a [[barracks ship]] at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] in Kiel. She was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship-breakers in [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]]. She was scrapped the following year.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt;
