'''HMS ''Revenge''''' was one of seven [[Royal Sovereign-class battleship|''Royal Sovereign''-class]] [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the 1890s. She spent much of her early career as a [[flagship]] for the [[Flying Squadron (1896)|Flying Squadron]] and in the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean]], [[Home Fleet|Home]] and [[Channel Fleet]]s. ''Revenge'' was assigned to the [[International Squadron (Cretan Uprising)|International Squadron]] blockading [[Crete]] during the revolt there against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] upon her return home in 1900, and was then briefly assigned as a [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coast guard ship]] before she joined the Home Fleet in 1902. The ship became a gunnery [[training ship]] in 1906 until she was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1913. 

''Revenge'' was [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] the following year, after the start of [[World War I]], to bombard the coast of [[Flanders]] as part of the [[Dover Patrol]], during which she was hit four times, but was not seriously damaged. She had [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s fitted in early 1915, the first ship to be fitted with them operationally.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 87, 90&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was renamed ''Redoubtable'' later that year and was refitted as an [[accommodation ship]] by the end of the year. The last surviving member of her class, the ship was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in November 1919.

==Design and description==
The design of the ''Royal Sovereign''-class ships was derived from that of the {{sclass2-|Admiral|ironclad}} battleships, greatly enlarged to improve [[seakeeping]] and to provide space for a [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] as in the preceding {{sclass-|Trafalgar|ironclad|2}} battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 116; Parkes, pp. 359&lt;/ref&gt; The ships [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|14150|LT|t|lk=on}} at normal load and {{convert|15580|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. They had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|380|ft|m|1}} and an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|410|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|75|ft|m|1}}, and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|27|ft|6|in|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=ck0&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; As a flagship, ''Revenge''{{'}}s crew consisted of 695 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 66&quot;&gt;Burt, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Royal Sovereign''s were powered by a pair of three-cylinder, vertical [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft. Their [[Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes|Humphrys &amp; Tennant]] engines&lt;ref name=ck0/&gt; were designed to produce a total of {{convert|11000|ihp|lk=in}} and a maximum speed of {{convert|17.5|kn|lk=in}} using steam provided by eight [[Scotch marine boiler|cylindrical boilers]] with [[forced draught]]. The ships carried a maximum of {{convert|1420|LT|t|0}} of coal which gave them a range of {{convert|4720|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 66&quot;/&gt;

Their main armament consisted of four [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading (BL)]] [[BL 13.5 inch naval gun Mk I - IV|{{convert|13.5|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} guns]] mounted in two twin-gun [[barbette]]s, one each fore and aft of the [[superstructure]].&lt;ref name=p5&gt;Parkes, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; Each gun was provided with 80 [[Cartridge (firearms)|rounds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 66&quot;/&gt; Their secondary armament consisted of ten [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 6 inch Mk I - III naval gun|{{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} guns]].&lt;ref name=ck0/&gt; 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 66&quot;/&gt; Sixteen [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|QF 6-pounder ({{convert|57|mm|in|abbr=on|1|disp=flip}})]] and a dozen [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|QF 3-pounder ({{convert|47|mm|abbr=on|disp=flip}})]] [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were fitted for defence against [[torpedo boat]]s. The two 3-pounders in the upper [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]] were removed in 1903–04, and all of the remaining light guns from the lower fighting tops and main deck followed in 1905–09. The ''Royal Sovereign''-class ships mounted seven 14-inch (356&amp;nbsp;mm) [[torpedo tube]]s, although ''Revenge'' had four of hers removed in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 73, 85, 87, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Royal Sovereign''s' armour scheme was similar to that of the ''Trafalgar''s, as the [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[compound armour]] only protected the area between the barbettes. The {{convert|14|-|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} belt and transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] {{convert|14|-|16|in|0}} thick closed off the ends of the belt. Above the belt was a [[strake]] of {{convert|4|in|0|adj=on}} nickel-steel armour closed off by {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} transverse bulkheads.&lt;ref name=ck0/&gt;

The barbettes were protected by compound armour, ranging in thickness from {{convert|11|to|17|in|mm|0}} and the casemates for the 6-inch guns had a thickness equal to their diameter. The thicknesses of the armour [[deck (ship)|deck]] ranged from {{convert|2.5|to|3|in|mm|0}}. The walls of the forward [[conning tower]] were {{convert|12|-|14|in|0}} thick and the aft conning tower was protected by 3-inch plates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 66&quot;/&gt;

==Construction and career==
[[File:The work of Samuel Franklin Cody in Airship, Kite and Aircraft Aeronautics 1903 - 1913 in England. RAE-O480.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of ''Revenge'' taken by [[Samuel Cody]] during naval trials of observation [[box kite|kites]] in 1908.]]
''Revenge'' was the ninth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy&lt;ref name=c3&gt;Colledge, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; and was ordered under the Naval Defence Act Programme of 1889. The ship was [[laid down]] by [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]] at their [[shipyard]] in [[Jarrow]] in [[Tyne and Wear]], England, on 12 February 1891. She was [[Ship naming and launching|floated out]] of the [[drydock]] on 3 November 1892,&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 73, 94&lt;/ref&gt; and completed on 22 March 1894&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of [[pound sterling|£]]954,825.&lt;ref name=p5/&gt; Upon completion, ''Revenge'' was placed in reserve at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]]. Almost two years later, she mobilised there on 14 January 1896 as flagship of the Particular Service Squadron, soon renamed the Flying Squadron, which was formed in response to rising tensions in Europe following the [[Jameson Raid]] and Germany's [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s [[Kruger telegram|telegram of support]] to the [[South African Republic|Boer government]]. The squadron was briefly attached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in the middle of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, 94; Stilwell, pp. 147–49&lt;/ref&gt; When it was disbanded on 5 November, ''Revenge'' relieved the [[battleship]] [[HMS Trafalgar (1887)|''Trafalgar'']] as the flagship of the [[second-in-command]] of the Mediterranean Fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 83&quot;&gt;Burt, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 1897 to December 1898, ''Revenge'' served in the International Squadron blockading Crete during the uprising there that led to the establishment of the [[Cretan State]]. During this time, she landed a force of [[Royal Marines]] on Crete to seize [[Fort Tzeddin]], and, in September 1898, she went to [[Heraklion|Candia]] to support the British garrison there after it had been attacked by rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 83&quot;/&gt; Sometime in 1899, she suffered a [[cordite]] explosion in one of her 6-inch (152-mm) [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s due to spontaneous combustion, but the damage was not very severe because only three cartridges detonated.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1900, the battleship {{HMS|Victorious|1895|2}} replaced her and she returned home, paying off into Fleet Reserve at [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham Dockyard]]. During this time the ship had a [[wireless telegraph]] installed.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 85, 94&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 1901, ''Revenge'' was recommissioned at Chatham by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Frederic Fisher]] to relieve [[HMS Alexandra (1875)|''Alexandra'']] as both the coast guard ship at [[Portland, England|Portland]] and the flagship of [[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] [[Gerard Noel (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Gerard Noel]], [[Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |date=19 April 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36433| }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1902, she arrived at [[Portsmouth]] for a refit that included the provision of casemates for her upper-deck six-inch guns, and her crew was temporarily transferred to the elderly [[ironclad]] {{HMS|Hercules|1868|2}}, which also took on her duties at Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |date=17 March 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36717| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Fisher and his crew were back on board ''Revenge'' in early June 1902, following gun trials after the repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |date=16 May 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36769| }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the refit, she commissioned in October 1902 to serve as flagship of the [[Home Fleet]] upon its creation.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;Parkes, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Revenge Orion Collision Portsmouth 1912 01 12.png|thumbnail|''Revenge'' (background) collided with the battleship {{HMS|Orion|1910|2}} (foreground) in Portsmouth in 1912.]]
In April 1904, ''Revenge'' and her sister ship {{HMS|Royal Oak|1892|2}} both struck a submerged wreck off the [[Scilly Isles]] while serving with the Home Fleet, damaging their bottoms. In July 1905, the ship participated in maneuvers with the Reserve Fleet and was then transferred to the [[Portsmouth Reserve Division]] on 1 September 1905. In June 1906, she relieved the battleship [[HMS Colossus (1882)|''Colossus'']] as the gunnery training ship at Portsmouth and was assigned to the gunnery school [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']].&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 92, 94&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 1908, ''Revenge'' was struck by the merchant ship {{SS|Bengore Head}} when the latter was cut loose by her [[tugboat]] during a sudden [[squall]] in Portsmouth Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCIDENTS IN PORTSMOUTH HARBOUR|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1908/jul/01/accidents-in-portsmouth-harbour|website=House of Lords Debates|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=1 July 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1909, she conducted gunnery tests on the obsolete battleship {{HMS|Edinburgh|1882|2}} to evaluate the effects of shells against varying thicknesses of armour.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 116, 118–19; Burt, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 January 1912, the ship was badly damaged when, during a [[gale]] at Portsmouth, she broke loose from her [[wikt:mooring|moorings]] and drifted onto the bow of the [[dreadnought]] {{HMS|Orion|1910|2}}.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; Later that year, her guns were relined down to 10 inches (254 mm) for testing;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1982, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; the liners were removed in October 1912.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; ''Revenge'' was relieved as a gunnery training ship by the battleship {{HMS|Albemarle|1901|2}} and paid off on 15 May 1913. She was laid up at [[Motherbank]], awaiting disposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 83&quot;/&gt;

===World War I===
''Revenge'' was given a reprieve from the scrapyard by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914. The Admiralty decided to bring her back into service for use in coastal bombardment duties off the coast of [[Flanders]]. In September and October 1914, she was refitted at Portsmouth for this mission, which included relining her 13.5-inch (343-mm) guns down to 12&amp;nbsp;inches (305&amp;nbsp;mm),&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 83&quot;/&gt; improving their range by about 1,000 yards (914 meters).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1981, pp. 96, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Her refit completed, she was ordered on 31 October 1914 to stand by to relieve the battleship {{HMS|Venerable|1899|2}} as flagship of the [[Dover Patrol]]. ''Revenge'' was declared ready for service on 5 November 1914, and was assigned to the Channel Fleet′s new [[6th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|6th Battle Squadron]] along with the battleships ''Albemarle'', {{HMS|Cornwallis|1901|2}}, {{HMS|Duncan|1901|2}}, {{HMS|Exmouth|1901|2}}, and {{HMS|Russell|1901|2}}. Plans for the squadron to participate in an attack on German [[submarine]] bases were cancelled due to bad weather on 14 November 1914, and instead ''Revenge'' and the battleship {{HMS|Majestic|1895|2}} departed [[Dover, England|Dover]], England, for [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burt, p. 83&quot;/&gt;

[[File:RevengeBombarding1915.jpg|thumb|''Redoubtable'' bombarding the [[Flanders|Flemish coast]] in 1915. She has a deliberately induced [[list (watercraft)|list]] to increase the range of her guns.]]
''Revenge'' participated in her first action of the war when she joined the [[gunboat]] {{HMS|Bustard||2}}, six British and four French [[destroyer]]s, and a French [[torpedo boat]] in bombarding German troops from off [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]], [[Belgium]], on 22 November 1914. On 15–16 December 1914, ''Revenge'' bombarded German heavy [[artillery batteries]], during which time she received two 8-inch (203-mm) shell hits, one of which penetrated her hull below the waterline and caused her to be withdrawn for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 94, 99; Corbett, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1915, the ship participated in experiments using aircraft to observe and control her gunfire, but these were only partially successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, pp. 77, 79&lt;/ref&gt; In April and May 1915 she underwent a refit at [[Chatham Dockyard]] in which she had anti-[[torpedo]] bulges fitted.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 87, 90, 99&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, ''Revenge'' conducted trials using sea-based observers on off-shore platforms to direct the bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 1915, she was renamed '''''Redoubtable'''''.&lt;ref name=c3/&gt;

On 7 September 1915, she returned to combat, joining the gunboats ''Bustard'' and {{HMS|Excellent||2}} in bombarding German barracks and gun positions at [[Westende]], inflicting much damage on the Germans. One of her anti-torpedo bulges was deliberately flooded to give her a [[list (watercraft)|list]] that would increase the range of her guns. The ship was hit by a pair of 6-inch (152-mm) shells during the action.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, p. 89; Burt, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; ''Redoubtable'' underwent another refit from October to December 1915. Afterwards, she was not recommissioned, instead serving as an [[accommodation ship]] at Portsmouth until February 1919. She was sold to [[Thos W Ward]] for scrapping for £42,750&lt;ref name=b9&gt;Burt, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 November 1919, and subsequently broken up at [[Swansea]] and [[Briton Ferry]].&lt;ref name=c3/&gt;
