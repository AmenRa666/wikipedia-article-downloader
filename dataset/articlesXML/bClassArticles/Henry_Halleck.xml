'''Henry Wager Halleck''' (January 16, 1815 &amp;ndash; January 9, 1872) was a [[United States Army]] officer, scholar, and lawyer. A noted expert in military studies, he was known by a nickname that became derogatory, &quot;Old Brains.&quot; He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer. Early in the [[American Civil War]], he was a senior [[Union Army]] commander in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] and then served for almost two years as [[General-in-Chief#USA|general-in-chief]] of all U.S. armies. Halleck became chief of staff to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]], when he assumed the position of general-in-chief.

Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick, aggressive action. He was a master of administration, logistics, and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy, but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington, D.C. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] once described him as &quot;little more than a first rate clerk.&quot;

==Early life==
Halleck was born on a farm in [[Westernville, New York|Westernville]], [[Oneida County, New York]], third child of 14 of Joseph Halleck, a lieutenant who served in the [[War of 1812]], and Catherine Wager Halleck. Young Henry detested the thought of an agricultural life and ran away from home at an early age to be raised by an uncle, [[David Wager]] of [[Utica, New York|Utica]].&lt;ref&gt;Marszalek, pp. 6&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Hudson Academy and Union College, then the [[United States Military Academy]]. He became a favorite of military theorist [[Dennis Hart Mahan]] and was allowed to teach classes while still a cadet.&lt;ref name=Fred&gt;Fredriksen, pp. 908&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1839, third in his class of 31 cadets, as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] of engineers.&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending a few years improving the defenses of [[New York Harbor]], he wrote a report for the [[United States Senate]] on seacoast defenses, ''Report on the Means of National Defence'', which pleased General [[Winfield Scott]], who rewarded Halleck with a trip to Europe in 1844 to study European fortifications and the [[French military]].&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning home a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]], Halleck gave a series of twelve lectures at the [[Lowell Institute]] in Boston that were subsequently published in 1846 as ''Elements of Military Art and Science''.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.militarymuseum.org/Halleck.html California State Military Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; His work, one of the first expressions of American military professionalism, was well received by his colleagues and was considered one of the definitive tactical treatises used by officers in the coming Civil War. His scholarly pursuits earned him the (later derogatory) nickname &quot;Old Brains.&quot;&lt;ref name=Fred/&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Hamilton - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Hamilton]]

During the [[Mexican-American War]], Halleck was assigned to duty in California. During his seven-month journey on the transport [[USS Lexington (1825)|USS ''Lexington'']] around [[Cape Horn]], assigned as aide-de-camp to Commodore [[William Shubrick]], he translated [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Henri Jomini]]'s ''Vie politique et militaire de [[Napoleon]]'', which further enhanced his reputation for scholarship. He spent several months in California constructing fortifications, then was first exposed to combat on November 11, 1847, during Shubrick's capture of the port of [[Mazatlán]]; Lt. Halleck served as lieutenant governor of the occupied city. He was awarded a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to captain in 1847 for his &quot;gallant and meritorious service&quot; in California and Mexico. (He would later be appointed captain in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] on July 1, 1853.)&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; He was transferred north to serve under General [[Bennet Riley]], the governor general of the [[History of California to 1899|California Territory]]. Halleck was soon appointed military secretary of state, a position which made him the governor's representative at the 1849 convention in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] where the [[California Constitution|California state constitution]] was written. Halleck became one of the principal authors of the document. The California State Military Museum writes that Halleck &quot;was [at the convention] and in a lone measure its brains because he had given more studious thought to the subject than any other, and General Riley had instructed him to help frame the new constitution.&quot; He was nominated during the convention to be one of two men to represent the new state in the [[United States Senate]], but received only enough votes for third place. During his political activities, he found time to join a law firm in San Francisco, [[Halleck, Peachy &amp; Billings]], which became so successful that he resigned his commission in 1854. The following year, he married Elizabeth Hamilton, granddaughter of [[Alexander Hamilton]] and sister of Union general [[Schuyler Hamilton]]. Their only child, Henry Wager Halleck, Jr., was born in 1856.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

Halleck became a wealthy man as a lawyer and land speculator, and a noted collector of &quot;Californiana.&quot; He obtained thousands of pages of official documents on the Spanish missions and colonization of California, which were copied and are now maintained by the [[Bancroft Library]] of the [[University of California]], the originals having been destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire. He built the [[Montgomery Block]], San Francisco's first fireproof building, home to lawyers, businessmen, and later, the city's [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] writers and newspapers. He was a director of the [[Almaden Quicksilver County Park|Almaden Quicksilver]] ([[mercury (element)|mercury]]) Company in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], president of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]], a builder in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], and owner of the 30,000 acre (120&amp;nbsp;km²) [[Rancho Nicasio]] in [[Marin County, California]]. But he remained involved in military affairs and by early 1861 he was a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of the [[California Militia]].&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

==Civil War==

===Western Theater===
As the Civil War began, Halleck was nominally a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and was sympathetic to the South, but he had a strong belief in the value of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].&lt;ref name=Fred/&gt; His reputation as a military scholar and an urgent recommendation from [[Winfield Scott]] earned him the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the regular army, effective August 19, 1861, making him the fourth most senior general (after Scott, [[George B. McClellan]], and [[John C. Frémont]]).&lt;ref name=Warner/&gt; He was assigned to command the [[Department of the Missouri]], replacing Frémont in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on November 9, and his talent for administration quickly sorted out the chaos of fraud and disorder left by his predecessor.&lt;ref name=Fred/&gt; He set to work on the &quot;twin goals of expanding his command and making sure that no blame of any sort fell on him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nevin, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Currier &amp; Ives - The champions of the Union 1861.jpg|thumb|left|Gen. Halleck in ''The champions of the Union'', lithograph by Currier &amp; Ives, 1861]]
Historian [[Kendall Gott]] described Halleck as a department commander:&lt;ref&gt;Gott, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|Although he had impressive credentials, Henry Halleck was not an easy man to work for. The nature of his job and his personality often provoked antagonism, hatred, and contempt. Halleck's strengths were organizing, coordinating, planning, and managing. He could also advise and suggest, and he sometimes ordered subordinates where and when to make a move, but he never was comfortable doing it himself. Halleck seldom worked openly, and as a department commander, he was always at headquarters, separated and aloof from the men. His decisions were the result of neither snap judgments nor friendly discussion, but calculated thinking. He was also prone to violent hatred and never cultivated close relationships. Overall, he generated no love, confidence, or respect.|Kendall D. Gott|Where the South Lost the War}}

Halleck established an uncomfortable relationship with the man who would become his most successful subordinate and future commander, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. The pugnacious Grant had just completed the minor, but bloody, [[Battle of Belmont]] and had ambitious plans for amphibious operations on the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers. Halleck, by nature a cautious general, but also judging that Grant's reputation for alcoholism in the prewar period made him unreliable, rejected Grant's plans. However, under pressure from President Lincoln to take offensive action, Halleck reconsidered and Grant conducted operations with naval and land forces against Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] in February 1862, capturing both, along with 14,000 [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevin, pp. 60&amp;ndash;95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant had delivered the first significant Union victory of the war. Halleck obtained a promotion for him to major general of volunteers, along with some other generals in his department, and used the victory as an opportunity to request overall command in the Western Theater, which he currently shared with Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]], but which was not granted. He briefly relieved Grant of field command of a newly ordered expedition up the [[Tennessee River]] after Grant met Buell in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], citing rumors of renewed alcoholism, but soon restored Grant to field command (pressure by Lincoln and the War Department may have been a factor in this about-face). Explaining the reinstatement to Grant, Halleck portrayed it as his effort to correct an injustice, not revealing to Grant that the injustice had originated with him.&lt;ref&gt;Many authors see presidential pressure behind Grant's reinstatement to field command. See, e.g., Gott, pp. 267&amp;ndash;68; Nevin, p. 96. However, Smith, p. 176, states that Halleck's &quot;reinstatement of Grant preceded by one day the bombshell that landed on his desk from the adjutant general [on behalf of the President and Secretary of War] in Washington.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When Grant wrote to Halleck suggesting &quot;I must have enemies between you and myself,&quot; Halleck replied, &quot;You are mistaken. There is no enemy between you and me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halleck's department performed well in early 1862, driving the Confederates from the state of [[Missouri]] and advancing into [[Arkansas]]. They held all of [[West Tennessee]] and half of [[Middle Tennessee]]. Grant, not yet aware of the political maneuvering behind his back, regarded Halleck as &quot;one of the greatest men of the age&quot; and Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] described him as the &quot;directing genius&quot; of the events that had given the Union cause such a &quot;tremendous lift&quot; in the previous months.&lt;ref&gt;Hattaway and Jones, pp. 149&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; This performance can be attributed to Halleck's strategy, administrative skills, and his good management of resources, and to the excellent execution by his subordinates&amp;mdash;Grant, Maj. Gen. [[Samuel R. Curtis]] at [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]], and Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] at [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island Number 10]]. Military historians disagree about Halleck's personal role in providing these victories. Some offer him the credit based on his overall command of the department; others, particularly those viewing his career through the lens of later events, believe that his subordinates were the primary factor.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 196, for example, states that his subordinates allowed Halleck to &quot;shine in reflected glory.&quot; Fredriksen, p. 909, credits Halleck (not Grant) with devising the scheme to drive up the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers and to orchestrate a concerted effort between Grant, Pope, Buell in a large-scale offensive. Hattaway and Jones, p. 149, balances the credit between Halleck's strategy and execution and those of his subordinates.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 1862, Halleck's command was enlarged to include [[Ohio]] and [[Kansas]], along with Buell's [[Army of the Ohio]], and was renamed the [[Department of the Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 833. The Department of the Mississippi comprised Kansas, Nebraska Territory, Colorado Territory except for Fort Garland, Dakota Territory, and the Indian Territory from the Department of Kansas; Wisconsin, Missouri, Illinois, Western Kentucky, Western Tennessee, Arkansas, Minnesota, and Iowa from the Department of Missouri; and Western Michigan, Indiana, and Western Ohio from the Department of the Ohio. The relevant portions of Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, and Michigan were the areas west of a north-south line drawn through Knoxville, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's [[Army of the Tennessee]] was attacked on April 6 at [[Pittsburg Landing]], Tennessee, in the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. With reinforcements from Buell, on April 7 Grant managed to repulse the Confederate Army under [[Full General (CSA)|Generals]] [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] and [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], but at high cost in casualties. Pursuant to an earlier plan, Halleck arrived to take personal command of his massive army in the field for the first time. Grant was under public attack over the slaughter at Shiloh, and Halleck replaced Grant as a wing commander and assigned him instead to serve as second-in-command of the entire 100,000 man force, a job which Grant complained was a censure and akin to an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;On May 11, Grant wrote Halleck privately that he considered his second-in-command position to be &quot;anomylous,&quot; to constitute a &quot;sensure,&quot; and his position to differ &quot;but little from that of one in arrest.&quot; ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 5:114; see Smith, p. 209; Schenker, &quot;Ulysses in His Tent,&quot; passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Halleck proceeded to conduct operations against Beauregard's army in [[Corinth, Mississippi]], called the [[Siege of Corinth]] because Halleck's army, twice the size of Beauregard's, moved so cautiously and stopped daily to erect elaborate field fortifications; Beauregard eventually abandoned Corinth without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 141&amp;ndash;211; Fredriksen, p. 909.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General in chief===
In the aftermath of the failed [[Peninsula Campaign]] in Virginia, President Lincoln summoned Halleck to the East to become [[General-in-Chief]] of all the Union armies, as of July 23, 1862.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; Lincoln hoped that Halleck could prod his subordinate generals into taking more coordinated, aggressive actions across all of the theaters of war, but he was quickly disappointed, and was quoted as regarding him as &quot;little more than a first rate clerk.&quot;&lt;ref name=Fred/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;Warner, pp. 195&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant replaced Halleck in command of most forces in the West, but Buell's Army of the Ohio was separated and Buell reported directly to Halleck, as a peer of Grant's. Halleck began transferring divisions from Grant to Buell; by September, four divisions had moved, leaving Grant with 46,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Wager Halleck - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|General Henry Wager Halleck]]
In Washington, Halleck continued to excel at administrative issues and facilitated the training, equipping, and deployment of thousands of Union soldiers over vast areas. He was unsuccessful, however, as a commander of the field armies or as a grand strategist. His cold, abrasive personality alienated his subordinates; one observer described him as a &quot;cold, calculating owl.&quot; Historian [[Steven E. Woodworth]] wrote, &quot;Beneath the ponderous dome of his high forehead, the General would gaze goggle-eyed at those who spoke to him, reflecting long before answering and simultaneously rubbing both elbows all the while, leading one observer to quip that the great intelligence he was reputed to possess must be located in his elbows.&quot; This disposition also made him unpopular with the Union press corps, who criticized him frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen, p. 910; Woodworth, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halleck, more a bureaucrat than a soldier, was able to impose little discipline or direction on his field commanders. Strong personalities such as George B. McClellan, John Pope, and [[Ambrose Burnside]] routinely ignored his advice and instructions. A telling example of his lack of control was during the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] of 1862, when Halleck was unable to motivate McClellan to reinforce Pope in a timely manner, contributing to the Union defeat at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]. It was from this incident that Halleck fell from grace. Abraham Lincoln said that he had given Halleck full power and responsibility as general in chief. &quot;He ran it on that basis till Pope's defeat; but ever since that event he has shrunk from responsibility whenever it was possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halleck's defense, his subordinate commanders in the Eastern Theater, whom he did not select, were reluctant to move against General [[Robert E. Lee]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. Many of his generals in the West, other than Grant, also lacked aggressiveness. And despite Lincoln's pledge to give the general in chief full control, both he and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] micromanaged many aspects of the military strategy of the nation. Halleck wrote to Sherman, &quot;I am simply a military advisor of the Secretary of War and the President, and must obey and carry out what they decide upon, whether I concur in their decisions or not. As a good soldier I obey the orders of my superiors. If I disagree with them I say so, but when they decide, is my duty faithfully to carry out their decision.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief of staff===
On March 12, 1864, after [[Ulysses S. Grant]], Halleck's former subordinate in the West, was promoted to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] and general in chief, Halleck was relegated to [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]], responsible for the administration of the vast U.S. armies. Grant and the War Department took special care to let Halleck down gently. Their orders stated that Halleck had been relieved as general in chief &quot;at his own request.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that there was an aggressive general in the field, Halleck's administrative capabilities complemented Grant nicely and they worked well together. Throughout the arduous [[Overland Campaign]] and [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] of 1864, Halleck saw to it that Grant was properly supplied, equipped, and reinforced on a scale that wore down the Confederates. He agreed with Grant and Sherman on the implementation of [[total war]] toward the Southern economy and endorsed both [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] and Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]'s destruction of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Shenandoah Valley]]. However, the 1864 [[Red River Campaign]], a doomed attempt to occupy Eastern Texas, had been advocated by Halleck, over the objections of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], who commanded the operation. When the campaign failed, Halleck claimed to Grant that it had been Banks' idea in the first place, not his  -  an example of Halleck's policy of deflecting blame.

Still, his contributions to military theory had encouraged a new spirit of professionalism in the army, and it is reasonable to name Halleck as one of the fathers of modern warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen, p. 910.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postbellum career==
After Grant forced Lee's surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], Halleck was assigned to command the Military Division of the James, headquartered at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. He was present at Lincoln's death and a pall-bearer at Lincoln's funeral. He lost his friendship with General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] when he quarreled with him over Sherman's tendency to be lenient toward former Confederates. In August 1865 he was transferred to the [[Military Division of the Pacific|Division of the Pacific]] in California, essentially in military exile.&lt;ref name=Fredriksen91011&gt;Fredriksen, pp. 910&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; While holding this command he accompanied photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to the newly purchased [[Russian America]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alaska's Heritage.&quot; [http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=184 ''Alaska History and Cultural Studies'']. Alaska Humanities Forum. 2011. Retrieved September 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Senator [[Charles Sumner]] are credited with applying the name &quot;[[Alaska]]&quot; to that region.&lt;ref&gt;Borneman, Walter.

Retrieved online from Google Books September 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1869, he was assigned to command the [[Military Division of the South]], headquartered in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Fredriksen91011/&gt;

Henry Halleck died at his post in Louisville. He is buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]], [[Brooklyn, New York]], and is commemorated by a street named for him in San Francisco and a statue in [[Golden Gate Park]]. He left no memoirs for posterity and apparently destroyed his private correspondence and memoranda. His estate at his death showed a net value of $474,773.16 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|474773.16|1872|r=2}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars). His widow, Elizabeth, married Col. [[George Washington Cullum]] in 1875. Cullum had served as Halleck's chief of staff in the Western Theater and then on his staff in Washington.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;
