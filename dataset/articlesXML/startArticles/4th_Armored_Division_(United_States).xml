The '''4th Armored Division''' of the [[United States Army]] was an [[Division (military)|Armored Division]] that earned distinction while spearheading for [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] in the [[European theater of World War II]].

The 4th Armored, unlike most other U.S. armored divisions during World War II, didn't officially adopt a nickname for the division during the war. However, their  unofficial nickname [[Nicknames of United States Army divisions|&quot;Name Enough&quot;]] came to be years after the war due to the 4th Armored Division commander who trained them during the war having stated back then, that, &quot;Fourth Armored Division was name enough&quot;; &quot;They shall be known by their deeds alone&quot;. The 4th Armored was named the [[Nicknames of United States Army divisions|&quot;Breakthrough&quot;]] division in 1954, but that name was eventually discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;The Armored Sentinel, Fort Hood, Texas, 15 April 1954 [http://www.hood.army.mil/history/1950/4th_armored_division_to_be_activ.htm] Retrieved 30 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II service==
The 4th Armored Division was activated during [[World War II]] on 15 April 1941 with 3,800 men (10,000 by end of May 1941) from various other units, at [[Pine Camp]] (Camp Drum, 1951; [[Fort Drum]], 1974), [[New York (state)|New York]] under Henry W. Baird. The division was fitted out as a full Armored Division in May and June 1942 under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[John Shirley Wood]]. It left Pine Camp for [[Camp Forrest]] for the [[Tennessee]] maneuvers in the [[Cumberland Mountains]] held in September and October. In Mid-November, it was transferred to the [[Desert Training Center]] (DTC) in the California-Arizona maneuvers area and was the first Armored Division to occupy Camp Ibis near [[Needles, California]] in the [[Mojave Desert]], which was close to the Arizona and Nevada borders. On 3 June, the 4th AD arrived at [[Camp Bowie]], Texas, an armored training center located at the southern end of the [[Piute Valley]], for more maneuvers until 11–18 July when it departed for [[Camp Myles Standish]] in [[Massachusetts]] for winter training. On 29 December, the 4th AD departed Boston to conduct training in [[England]] in preparation for the [[invasion of Normandy]].

===France===
After training in England from January to July 1944, the 4th Armored Division landed at [[Utah Beach]], on 11 July, over a month after the initial [[Normandy landings]] which took place on 6 June, and first entered combat on 17 July; 28 July, battle action as part of the [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] exploitation force for [[Operation Cobra]], the 4th AD secured the [[Coutances]] area. The 4th AD then swung south to take [[Nantes]], cutting off the [[Brittany]] Peninsula, 12 August 1944. Turning east, it drove swiftly across France north of the [[Loire]], smashed across the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] 11–13 September, flanked [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Nancy]] and captured [[Lunéville]], 16 September. The 4th AD fought several German [[panzergrenadier]] [[brigade]]s in the Lorraine area including the [[SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 49]] and [[SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 51]] at this time, [[Battle of Arracourt|defeating a larger German force]] through superior tactics and training.&lt;ref name=vanguard&gt;{{cite book |title=Patton's Vanguard: The United States Army Fourth Armored Division |last=Fox |first=Don M. |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=0-7864-1582-7 |oclc=52766067 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrD_sZmIaocC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After maintaining a defensive line, [[Chambrey]] to [[Xanrey]] to [[Hénaménil]], from 27 September to 11 October, the 4th AD rested briefly before returning to combat 9 November with an attack in the vicinity of [[Viviers, Moselle|Viviers]]. The 4th AD cleared [[Bois de Serres]], 12 November, advanced through [[Dieuze]] and crossed the [[Saar River]], 21–22 November, to establish and expand bridgehead and took [[Gros-Réderching|Singling]] and [[Bining]], then [[Baerendorf]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.dday-overlord.com/forum/etait-aout-1944-t2469-220.html#p50357 www.dday-overlord.com La 4e Division Blindée le 24 novembre 1944.]&lt;/ref&gt; 24 November, before being relieved 8 December.

The 4th Armored Division received the following unit awards from France: [[Croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France)|Croix de Guerre with Palm]] (27–29 July 1944), Croix de Guerre with Palm (12–29 September 1944), and [[Fourragere|French Fourragere]] in the colors of the Croix de guerre.

===Battle of the Bulge===
Two days after the Germans launched their [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes Offensive]], the 4th AD entered the fight (18 December 1944), racing northwest into [[Belgium]], covering 150 miles in 19 hours.&lt;ref name=vanguard/&gt; The 4th AD, spearheading for General Patton's Third Army, attacked the Germans at [[Bastogne]] and on 26 December, the 4th AD was the first unit ([[37th Armor Regiment (United States)|Company C, 37th Armored Battalion]]&lt;ref&gt;'Cobra King' led 4th Armored Division column that relieved Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, 25 February 2009. [http://www.army.mil/article/17393/] Retrieved 10 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;) to breakthrough at Bastogne and relieve the besieged [[101st Airborne Division]]. Six weeks later the 4th AD jumped off from [[Luxembourg City]] in an eastward plunge that carried it across the [[Moselle River]] at [[Trier]], south and east to [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and across the [[Rhine]], 24–25 March 1945. Advancing all night, the 4th AD crossed the [[Main River]] the next day, south of Hanau, and continued to push on. [[Lauterbach (Hesse)|Lauterbach]] fell 29 March, [[Creuzburg]] across the [[Werra]] on 1 April, [[Gotha]] on 4 April ... where the 4th AD liberated [[Ohrdruf concentration camp]], and by 12 April the 4TH AD was across the [[Saale River]]. Pursuit of the enemy continued and by 6 May the division had crossed into [[Czechoslovakia]], established a bridgehead across the [[Otava River]] at [[Strakonice]], with forward elements at [[Pisek]]. The 4th AD was reassigned to the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on 30 April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Order of Battle of the United States Army World War II European Theater of Operations: Divisions  |url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/eto-ob/etoob-toc.htm |chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/ETO-OB/4AD-ETO.htm |chapter=4th Armored Division |last1=Office of the Theater Historian |location=Paris |date=December 1945 |publisher=Office of the Theater Historian |pages=448–459 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th AD's first commander Major General John Shirley Wood, (known as &quot;P&quot; Wood to his contemporaries, the &quot;P&quot; standing for &quot;Professor&quot;) who took over the division officially on 18 June 1942, trained the 4th Armored Division for two years before he personally led it into combat in France, on 28 July 1944, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. On 1 August, [[General (United States)|General]] [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]] became operational and the 4th AD became the spearhead of the Third Army. The [[British Armed Forces|British military]] armor theorist and historian, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[B. H. Liddell Hart|Basil Henry Liddell Hart]], once referred to General Wood as &quot;the [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] of the American armored forces.&quot; Like Rommel, Wood commanded from the front, and preferred staying on the offensive, using speed and envelopment tactics to confuse the enemy. General Wood often utilized a light [[L-4 Grasshopper|Piper Cub]] liaison aircraft flown by his personal pilot, [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Charles Carpenter (lieutenant colonel)|Charles &quot;Bazooka Charlie&quot; Carpenter]], to keep up with his rapidly moving division, sometimes personally carrying corps orders from headquarters directly to his advancing armored columns.&lt;ref&gt;Kerns, Raymond C., ''Above the Thunder: Reminiscences of a Field Artillery Pilot in World War II'', Kent State University Press, ISBN 978-0-87338-980-8, ISBN 0-87338-980-8 (2009), pp. 23-24, 293-294&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th AD was commanded by Major General [[Hugh Gaffey]] during the Battle of the Bulge and after General Wood was ordered back to the United States on 3 December by General Patton. Major General [[Archibald R. Kennedy]] commanded the division after the war. One of its most famous members and leaders of the 4th AD during World War II was [[Creighton Abrams]], who commanded the [[37th Armor Regiment (United States)|37th Tank Battalion]]. Abrams later rose to command all U.S. forces in Vietnam and served as U.S. Army Chief of Staff in the 1970s. The current U.S. [[M-1 tank]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/weapons/m1.html |title=m-1 abrahms |work=The Gulf War, [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Presidential Unit Citation
The 4th Armored Division was the first U.S. Armored Division to be awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]], for its actions 22 December 1944 through 27 March 1945 (cited; WD GO 54, 1945).

==Postwar Service==
After a tour of occupation duty, the 4th AD returned to the United States for inactivation. Most of its elements, however, remained as occupation forces in Germany after redesignation as the [[United States Constabulary|First Constabulary Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Armored Sentinel'', Fort Hood, Texas,  15 April 1954&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, it was redesignated the 4th Armored Division and inactivated on 20 May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cookebarracks.com/john_francis/john_francis.html ''Cooke Barracks: A Chronology, 1945-2005'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th AD was reactivated on 15 June 1954 at [[Fort Hood]] in [[Killeen, Texas]] with the name '''4th Armored &quot;Breakthrough&quot; Division'''&lt;ref&gt;''The Armored Sentinel'', Fort Hood Texas, 15 April 1954 [http://www.hood.army.mil/history/1950/4th_armored_division_to_be_activ.htm] Retrieved 27 Sept. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;Breakthrough&quot; was discontinued some years afterwards) and was deployed to Germany in 1957 with headquarters at Cooke Barracks in [[Göppingen]]. The division appears to have been part of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] for most of this period.

On 30 June 1958 Combat Command &quot;A&quot; was at Wiley Barracks, [[Neu-Ulm|New Ulm]], It comprised 2nd Medium Tank Battalion (MTB), [[66th Armored Regiment]] (Leipheim), 2nd Armored Rifle Battalion (ARB), [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st Infantry]] (Neu Ulm), and 2nd Armored Rifle Battalion, [[51st Infantry Regiment (United States)|51st Infantry Regiment]]. CCB was at Ferris Barracks, [[Erlangen]], comprising the 1st MTB, [[35th Armor Regiment]] (Ferris Barracks), 2nd MTB, [[67th Armor Regiment]] (Fürth), 2nd ARB, 50th Inf (Ferris Barracks), and 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron, 15th Cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;4th Armored Division Yearbook 1958 via usarmygermany.com&lt;/ref&gt; CCC was at McKee Barracks, [[Crailsheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usarmygermany.com/Units/4th%20Armd%20Div/USAREUR_4th%20Armd%20Div.htm|title=4th Armored Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised 1st MTB, [[37th Armor Regiment]] (McKee Barracks) and 1st ARB, [[54th Infantry Regiment (United States)|54th Infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;4th Armored Division Yearbook 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th AD remained in Germany until final inactivation in May 1971, when it was redesignated the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].
