'''''Talthybius''''' was a {{GRT|10,224}} [[Cargo liner]] that was built in 1911 by [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co Ltd]], [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire]], United Kingdom for a British shipping line. She was sunk at [[Singapore]] in an air raid in 1942. Salvaged by the Japanese, she was renamed '''''Taruyasu Maru''''', serving with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] until 1945 when she either struck a [[naval mine|mine]] off [[Sado Island]] and sank or was sunk in an attack by aircraft of [[Task Force 38]]. She was salvaged by the British, passed to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] (MoWT) and renamed '''''Empire Evenlode'''''. She served until 1949, when she was scrapped.

==Description==
The ship was built in 1911 by [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co Ltd]], [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire]]. She was yard number 436.&lt;ref name=Clydesite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=19092 |title=Launched 1911: ss TALTHYBIUS |publisher=Clydesite |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was {{convert|506|ft|0|in|m|2}} long, with a beam of {{convert|60|ft|3|in|m|2}}. She had a depth of {{convert|39|ft|5|in|m|2}}, and a draught of {{convert|22|ft|3|in|m|2}}. She was assessed at {{GRT|10,224}}, {{NRT|6,514}}&lt;!--, x,xxx [[deadweight tonnage|DWT]]--&gt;.&lt;ref name=Talthybius30&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b1165.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, STEAMERS &amp; MOTORSHIPS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was propelled by a 586 [[nominal horsepower|nhp]] six-cylinder [[triple expansion steam engine]], which had three pairs of cylinders of {{convert|28|in|cm}} inches, {{convert|38+1/2|in|cm}} and {{convert|65|in|cm}} diameter by {{convert|48|in|cm}} stroke. The engine was built by Scotts and drove twin screw [[propeller (ship)|propellers]].&lt;ref name=Talthybius30/&gt; It could propel the ship at a speed of {{convert|12|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=OS9/&gt;

==History==
''Talthybius'' was launched on 7 November 1911,&lt;ref name=Clydesite/&gt; and completed in 1912.&lt;ref name=Ships&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mitchell |first1=W.H. |last2=Sawyer |first2=L.A. |year=1995 |title=The Empire Ships |page=not cited |publisher= Lloyd's of London Press Ltd |location= London, New York, Hamburg, Hong Kong |isbn=1-85044-275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom Official Number 131411 and [[Code Letters]] HVDQ were allocated.

With the changes to Code Letters in 1934, ''Talthybius'' was allocated the letters GPZN.&lt;ref name=Talthybius37&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=37b0854.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VAPEUR ET A MOTEURS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a couple of years in the 1930s, ''Talthybius'' was used as an accommodation ship at [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref name=Stanworth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/00/a6021000.shtml |first=Rob |last=Stanworth |title=J W Stanworth - Memoirs part 1 |publisher=BBC People's War |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 1939, ''Talthybius'' suffered an explosion in one of her coal bunkers which blew off two hatches and injured four [[Stoker (occupation)|firemen]]. She anchored in the Royal Roads off [[San Francisco, California]], United States, for inspection. She was allowed to continue her voyage from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada to [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=Times130439&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Casualty Reports |day_of_week=Thursday |date=13 April 1939 |page_number=22 |issue=48278 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, and again in 1940, ''Talthybius'' carried [[gold bullion]] worth [[Pound Sterling|£1,000,000]] from [[Hong Kong]] to Canada.&lt;ref name=Pingwo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navyhistory.org.au/ping-wos-golden-secret/ |title=Ping Wo’s Golden Secret |first=James |last=Eagles |publisher=Naval Historical Society of Australia |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Talthybius'' was a member of Convoy HX 102, which departed from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada on 11 January 1941 and arrived at Liverpool on 29 January.

''Talthybius'' was carrying general cargo and [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. She also carried the [[Convoy Commodore]], who described the ship as &quot;efficient and well manned&quot; with &quot;a good fighting spirit&quot;. She was only able to fly a [[kite]] when the wind was from the starboard due to only having one fitting for kites. The commodore recommended that she be equipped to fly kites from both sampson posts.&lt;ref name=HX136&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warsailors.com/convoys/hx136.html |title=CONVOY HX 136 |publisher=Warsailors |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Talthybius'' was a member of Convoy BM 10, which departed from [[Bombay]], [[British India|India]] on 8 January 1942 and arrived at [[Singapore]] on 25 January. She was carrying a cargo described as &quot;stores&quot;,&lt;ref name=BM10&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/bm/index.html?bm.php?convoy=10!~bmmain |title=Convoy BM.10 |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[lorry|lorries]] and [[tank]]s. On 3 February 1942, two direct hits were scored on ''Talthybius'' during a Japanese air raid on [[Singapore]] and she was set on fire. She was declared to be unseaworthy and abandoned, sinking in the Empire Dock, to where she had been moved following the raid.&lt;ref name=Cofepow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cofepow.org.uk/pages/ships_list.html |title=LIST OF SHIPS INVOLVED IN SE ASIA |publisher=COFEPOW |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officers and European crew from ''Talthybius'' formed part of the crew of {{HMAS|Ping Wo}}, which took 600 refugees form Singapore to [[Java]], Indonesia and then towed {{HMAS|Vendetta|D69|6}} from [[Tanjung Priok]], Indonesia to [[Fremantle]], Australia. The Chinese crewmembers decided to take their chances in Singapore.&lt;ref name=Pingwo/&gt;
