The '''''La Galissonnière''-class ironclads''' were a group of wooden-hulled, armored [[corvette]]s built for the [[French Navy]] during the 1870s, meant as a heavier armed and faster version of the {{sclass-|Alma|ironclad|1}}s. While all three ships were begun before the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, the construction of the last two ships was delayed for years. The navy took advantage of the extended construction time of the latter ships to upgrade their armament. {{ship|French ironclad|La Galissonnière||2}} bombarded [[Sfax]] in 1881 as part of the [[French occupation of Tunisia]]. She and her [[sister ship|half-sister]] {{ship|French ironclad|Triomphante||2}} participated in a number of battles during the [[Sino-French War]] of 1884–85. Their sister {{ship|French ironclad|Victorieuse||2}} had a much quieter career. All three ships were decommissioned in the 1890s.

==Design and description==
The ''La Galissonnière''-class [[ironclad]]s were designed as faster, more heavily armed versions of the {{sclass-|Alma|ironclad|1}}s by [[Henri Dupuy de Lôme]]. They used the same [[Central battery ship|central battery]] layout as their predecessors, although the [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] was lengthened {{convert|4|m|ftin|sp=us}} to provide enough room to work the larger {{convert|240|mm|adj=on|1|sp=us}} guns. A two-[[propeller]] layout was adopted in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the ship's draft.&lt;ref name=w9/&gt; The two later ships were designed by Sabattier who reduced the number of screws from two to one to improve their sailing qualities, added an {{convert|194|mm|1|sp=us|adj=on}} [[bow chaser]] under the [[forecastle]] and increased the caliber of the secondary armament.&lt;ref name=d27/&gt;

''La Galissonnière'' measured {{convert|76.62|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.84|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She had a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|6.55|m|ftin|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=d26/&gt; and displaced {{convert|4654|t|LT|sp=us}}. The ship had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|.926|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=w9&gt;Wright, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; ''Victorieuse'' and ''Triomphante'' were {{convert|76.85|m|ftin|sp=us}} between perpendiculars and had a beam of {{convert|14.88|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The two ships had a mean draft of {{convert|6.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|4150|t|LT|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=d26/&gt; The crew of all three ships numbered between 352 and 382 officers and men.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Gardiner, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
''La Galissonnière'' had two Wolf [[Marine steam engine#Compound|vertical compound steam engines]],&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; each driving a single {{convert|3.8|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} propeller.&lt;ref name=w0&gt;Wright, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Her engines were powered by four oval [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; On [[sea trial]]s the engines produced a total of {{convert|2370|ihp|lk=in}} and the ship reached {{convert|13.08|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=d26/&gt; ''La Galissonnière'' carried {{convert|500|MT|LT}}&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; of coal which allowed the ship to steam for {{convert|3240|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=w0/&gt; She was [[Ship rig|ship-rigged]] with three masts&lt;ref name=d26/&gt; and had a sail area around {{convert|1707|sqm|sqft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=w0/&gt;

''Victorieuse'' and ''Triomphante'' had a single vertical compound steam engine driving a single propeller and the same boilers as ''La Galissonnière''. During trials their engines produced {{convert|2214|ihp}} and the ships reached {{convert|12.75|kn}}.&lt;ref name=d26/&gt; They only carried  {{convert|330|MT|LT}}&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; of coal which allowed the ships to steam for {{convert|2740|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. They were also ship-rigged with three masts, but had a sail area of {{convert|1730|sqm|sqft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=d26&gt;de Balincourt and Vincent-Bréchignac 1976, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
All three ships mounted four of their six 240-millimeter Modèle 1870 guns in the central battery on the battery deck. The other two 240-millimeter guns were mounted in [[barbette]]s on the upper deck, [[sponson]]ed out over the sides of the ship. In ''La Galissonnière'' the sponsons were positioned abaft the funnel, but the two later ships had theirs just forward of the funnel.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Galissonnière''{{'}}s secondary armament of four {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns was also mounted on the upper deck. They were replaced by six {{convert|100|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns in 1880.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;

The [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] shell of the 19-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] 240-millmeter gun weighed {{convert|317.5|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|15.41|LT|t}}. It had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1624|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|14.4|in|mm|0}} of [[wrought iron]] armour at the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. The guns could fire both [[Round shot|solid shot]] and explosive shells.&lt;ref name=b7&gt;Brassey, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship received four {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]]&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; in 1878.&lt;ref name=d28&gt;de Balincourt and Vincent-Bréchignac, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|500|g|lb|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|610|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a range of about {{convert|3200|m|yd|sp=us}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46&quot; (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=22 December 2009|publisher=Navweps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Galissonnière'' also received several towed [[Ironclad warship#Torpedoes|Harvey torpedoes]].&lt;ref name=d28/&gt;

While ''Victorieuse'' and ''Triomphant'' were on the stocks, their armament was reinforced by an additional 194-millimeter chase gun and the secondary armament was increased to six {{convert|138|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. They also received the Hotchkiss guns and Harvey torpedoes as per ''La Galissonnière'' before completion.&lt;ref name=d28/&gt; The 20-caliber 194-millimeter gun fired an [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]], {{convert|165.3|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} shell while the gun itself weighed {{convert|7.83|LT|t}}. The gun fired its shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1739|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|12.5|in}} of [[wrought iron]] armour at the muzzle. The 138-millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed {{convert|2.63|LT|t}}. It fired a {{convert|61.7|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} [[Shell (projectile)|explosive shell]] that had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1529|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=b7/&gt;

===Armor===
The ''La Galissonnière''-class ships had a complete {{convert|150|mm|in|sp=us|1|adj=on}} [[wrought iron]] waterline [[Belt armor|belt]], approximately {{convert|2.4|m|ft|sp=us|1}}&lt;ref name=d27/&gt; high laid over {{convert|650|mm|in|sp=us}} of wood.&lt;ref name=w9/&gt; The sides of the battery itself were armored with {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wrought iron backed by {{convert|520|mm|in|sp=us}} of wood and the ends of the battery were closed by bulkheads of the same thickness. The barbette armor was {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us}} thick.&lt;ref name=d27&gt;de Balincourt and Vincent-Bréchignac 1976, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The unarmored portions of their sides were protected by thin iron plates.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

==Service==
''La Galissonnière''{{'}}s initial commissions were in the Pacific and in the Caribbean, but she was assigned to the Levant Squadron ({{lang-fr|Division Navale du Levant}}) when she bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1882 ''La Galissonnière'' was the flagship of the Levant Squadron under [[Rear Admiral]] [[Alfred Conrad]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''La Galissonnière'' and ''Triomphante'' were assigned to the [[Far East Squadron]] in 1884, under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amédée Courbet]], and participated in several actions during the Sino-French War of 1884–85. Both ships fought in the [[Battle of Fuzhou]], destroying a small Chinese fleet and coastal defenses defending the [[Min River (Fujian)|Min River]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 4–12&lt;/ref&gt; They supplied landing parties during the [[Battle of Tamsui]] in October 1884, but they were forced to retreat by Chinese troops, although suffering few casualties (11 killed and 4 wounded between the two ships).&lt;ref name=d312&gt;de Balincourt and Vincent-Bréchignac 1976, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of any further participation by ''La Galissonnière'' in the war, but ''Triomphante'' helped to capture the [[Penghu|Pescadore]] Islands in March 1885 during the [[Pescadores Campaign (1885)|Pescadores Campaign]].&lt;ref name=d32/&gt;

''Victorieuse'' was placed into reserve after she finished her sea trials in 1876. She had two commissions as [[flagship]] of the Pacific and China Squadrons and was relieved as the flagship of the latter by ''La Galissonnière'' in April 1884. She became flagship of the Levant Squadron after she arrived in France, but was in bad shape and soon placed in reserve at Cherbourg.&lt;ref name=d312/&gt; ''Victorieuse'' was on summer maneuvers off the [[Iberia]]n coast in July 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=4 July 1893|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9503E0DB143EEF33A25757C0A9619C94629ED7CF|title=France's Naval Manoeuvres|journal=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|location=New York|accessdate=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was initially condemned in May 1897, but this was reversed so she could convoy [[torpedo boat]]s to [[Bizerte]]. That plan was later cancelled and ''Victorieuse'' was [[paid off]] in 1899, becoming guardship of the outer harbor at Brest until finally condemned the following year.&lt;ref name=d312/&gt;
