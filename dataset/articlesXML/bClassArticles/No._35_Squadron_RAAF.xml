'''No. 35 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) transport unit. Formed in 1942, No. 35 Squadron operated during [[World War II]], transporting cargo and passengers around Australia, New Guinea and the [[Netherlands East Indies]], equipped with a variety of aircraft including the [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]]. It was disbanded after the war, but was re-raised in the 1960s for service during the [[Vietnam War]], flying transportation and resupply operations with [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|DHC-4 Caribous]] in support of Australian and US forces. The squadron was subsequently augmented with rotary-wing aircraft, operating [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]] in both the transportation and gunship roles. In the late 1980s, the squadron returned to a solely fixed-wing transport role. It ceased operations in 2000, but was re-raised in January 2013. It began re-equipping with [[Alenia C-27J Spartan|C-27 Spartan]] transports in 2015.

==History==
===World War II===
No. 35 Squadron was formed at [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, on 11 March 1942, under the command of [[Flight Lieutenant]] Percival Burdeu, as a transport unit.&lt;ref name=Eather71&gt;{{harvnb|Eather|1995|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to [[Maylands Airport|Maylands]], the squadron's operations were restricted to flying only within Western Australia as it was equipped with just one [[de Havilland Dragon]] and a [[de Havilland Fox Moth]]. Later in the year, the squadron was augmented with an assortment of aircraft including [[de Havilland Moth Minor]]s, [[Fairey Battle]]s, [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s, an [[Avro Anson]], a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]] and a [[Northrop Delta]].&lt;ref name=Eather71/&gt; In August 1943, the squadron was moved back to Pearce, where it was re-equipped with [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakotas]]; following this its operations were extended to cover all of Australia.&lt;ref name=Eather71/&gt;

During the later years of the war the squadron provided air transport to the Australian military throughout the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific area]], operating out of [[Guildford, Western Australia]], [[Brisbane, Queensland]], and [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]]. In the final years of the war, detachments operated out of [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], [[Townsville, Queensland]], and later [[Morotai Island]].&lt;ref name=Eather71/&gt; Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, No. 35 Squadron flew Australian soldiers and ex-prisoners of war home. In early 1946, it supported the movement of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No. 81 (Fighter) Wing]] to Japan as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. The squadron was disbanded at Townsville on 10 June 1946.&lt;ref name=Eather71/&gt;

===Vietnam and after===
On 1 June 1966, the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (RTFV), which had been formed for operations in Vietnam in July 1964, was redesignated No. 35 Squadron at [[Vung Tau]] in [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Eather71/&gt; Assigned to the [[834th Air Division]],  [[Seventh Air Force]], and operating [[De Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|DHC-4 Caribous]], the re-formed squadron flew cargo, passenger and medevac flights throughout South Vietnam in support of Australian, South Vietnamese and United States forces. During its time in Vietnam the squadron was nicknamed &quot;Wallaby Airlines&quot;, in reference to its callsign &quot;Wallaby&quot;.&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11075vietnam.asp |title=35 Squadron RAAF, Vietnam |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite not being employed in an offensive role, the squadron's aircraft were regularly called upon to fly into dangerous areas of the conflict zone, often at low level, and on several occasions the Caribous were fired upon and aircrew wounded.&lt;ref name=Eather72&gt;{{harvnb|Eather|1995|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1971, the squadron's complement of aircraft was reduced from seven to four as a part of the drawdown of Australia's forces in Vietnam; as a result of requirements for maintenance, however, only two aircraft were operational at any one time after this.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; No. 35 Squadron flew its last mission on 13 February 1972 and departed South Vietnam for [[RAAF Base Richmond]] in Australia on 19 February 1972; it was the last RAAF unit to leave following the decision to withdraw.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; During the five years that it was deployed, the squadron lost two aircraft destroyed in accidents, the result of poor weather and the difficult nature of some of the landing grounds that the Caribous were required to use when supporting isolated garrisons. Another aircraft was destroyed from Viet Cong mortar fire, struck while conducting a resupply mission at That Son in 1970.&lt;ref name=Eather72/&gt;

Although its work was not glamorous, the squadron developed a good reputation among the US air commanders as an efficient and effective unit, achieving a record that prompted US commanders to send personnel to the squadron to study their techniques.&lt;ref name=Eather72/&gt; For their involvement in operations in Vietnam, members of the squadron received several honours and decorations including two appointments to the [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of British Empire]], eight [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Crosses]], one [[Distinguished Flying Medal]], one [[British Empire Medal]], and 36 [[Mentioned in Despatches|Mentions in Despatches]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

In 1974, No. 35 Squadron was relocated north to [[RAAF Base Townsville]], where it operated in support of Army units based in [[Northern Australia]]. In early 1977 the squadron's role was expanded when it was equipped with four [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters as well as its Caribous, making it the only RAAF squadron to ever be simultaneously equipped with rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft.&lt;ref name=Eather72/&gt; These aircraft were employed in a multitude of roles including support to the local community in the form of flood relief, medevac and search and rescue operations. No. 35 Squadron's role was further expanded in November 1986 when it was issued with [[Helicopter gunship|gunship]] variants of the UH-1, which it received when [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF]] converted to flying [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]].&lt;ref name=Eather72/&gt;

In November 1989, No. 35 Squadron reverted to a purely fixed-wing role when responsibility for flying the UH-1 helicopters was transferred to the Australian Army. Operating eight Caribous, the squadron continued to provide tactical transport to Army units based in Northern Australia until 2000, when it was reduced to &quot;paper only&quot; status and its aircraft transferred to [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No. 38 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/35sqn.htm |title= No 35 Squadron |publisher=RAAF Museum |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2013, No. 35 Squadron was re-raised under the command of Wing Commander Brad Clarke as an element of [[No. 84 Wing RAAF|No. 84 Wing]]. A skeleton organisation, the squadron was expected to expand to approximately 250 personnel by 2015, when it was scheduled to begin operating the RAAF's ten [[Alenia C-27J Spartan]] transport aircraft. The squadron is based at RAAF Base Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite media release |url=http://news.defence.gov.au/2013/01/14/wallaby-airlines-returns-to-air-force/ |title=Wallaby Airlines Returns to Air Force |publisher=Department of Defence |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF C-27J buy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=RAAF C-27J buy confirmed|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2012/05/raaf-c-27j-buy-confirmed/|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Australian Aviation|date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 2014 No. 35 Squadron was temporarily transferred from No. 84 Wing to the C-27J Transition Team.
