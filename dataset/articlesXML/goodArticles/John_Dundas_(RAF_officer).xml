'''John Charles Dundas''', [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]] (19 August 1915 – 28 November 1940) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Second World War]] fighter pilot and [[flying ace]] (a title awarded to a pilot credited with shooting down at least five enemy aircraft in [[Aerial warfare|aerial combat]]) with 12 victories.

Born in [[West Yorkshire]] in 1915, the son of an aristocrat, Dundas was an able student and academic. After his graduation at the age of 21, and the completion of his studies, he became a [[journalist]] and joined a newspaper in his home county. After two years, Dundas tired with life as a reporter, Dundas joined the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] (RAuxAF) in July 1938 being commissioned as pilot officer in No. 609 (West Riding) Squadron &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34544/page/5420&lt;/ref&gt; and trained as a pilot at his own expense. His pilot training was complete in 1939.

In May 1940 his unit, [[No. 609 Squadron RAF]], took part in the [[Battle of France]] during which Dundas claimed his first two victories. Dundas remained with his squadron throughout the [[Battle of Britain]] claiming nine German aircraft shot down. On 9 October he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) for 10 victories.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34976/page/6134&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his last battle Dundas had been credited with 12 aircraft destroyed, two shared destroyed, four probably destroyed and five damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 193–195&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 193–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a battle over the English Channel on 28 November 1940, Dundas is believed to have engaged and shot down [[Helmut Wick]], the highest scoring ace of the ''Luftwaffe'' at that time. Moments later Dundas was also shot down into the sea. Both pilots vanished and remain [[missing in action]].

==Early life==
John Charles Dundas was born in [[West Yorkshire]] in 1915. He was related to two aristocratic families in the region; he was the grandson of the Scottish Liberal politician [[John Dundas (1845–1892)|John Dundas]] and the great grandson of [[Lawrence Dundas, 1st Earl of Zetland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bishop 2004, p.76&quot;&gt;Bishop 2004, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; Dundas was also related to the [[Earl of Halifax|House of Halifax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 178.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 178.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dundas won a scholarship to [[Stowe School]] at the age of 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 178.&quot;/&gt; At the age of 17 he won a second scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. Dundas graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class degree]] in [[Modern History]] before winning a further award that allowed him to study at both [[Sorbonne]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 178.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1999, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dundas subsequently became a journalist for the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' and its editorial staff. Another who worked on the paper at the time, [[Richard Pape]],&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Pape later served in RAF Bomber Command. He was taken prisoner by the Germans, but escaped by feigning illness and being repatriated during a [[prisoner exchange]]. His post-war account of his wartime career, '' Boldness Be My Friend'' (1953), was very successful.&lt;/ref&gt; recalled him as a man indifferent to his personal appearance, who wore frayed trousers, frequently had ink-stained hands and would spill beer over himself when drinking, yet who was also popular with the newspaper's younger, female staff members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 178.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/609photos/Letter%20From%20Pape.htm | title=A Letter From Richard Pape | publisher=609 (West Riding) Squadron Archives | accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper sent him to [[Czechoslovakia]] during the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Crisis]] as apart of [[Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s entourage in 1938 before travelling to [[Rome]] to report on a meeting between [[Benito Mussolini]], Chamberlain and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], to whom Dundas was related.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bishop 2004, p.76&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 178.&quot;/&gt;

In July 1938, at the age of 23, Dundas was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] in [[No. 609 Squadron RAF]], a [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34544|startpage=5420|date=23 August 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh and John's [[Godparent|godfather]] had set up the unit.&lt;ref&gt;Bungat 2000, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the squadron was manned by part-time civilians and was equipped with [[Hawker Hind]] bombers. It was converted from a bomber to a [[fighter aircraft]] squadron and later, in August 1939, re-equipped with the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. John Dundas was well respected by his peers and he frequently flew his commanding officer's Hind.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 1971, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dundas' younger brother [[Hugh Dundas]] was also a fighter pilot. Hugh was wounded in August 1940 but recovered and eventually rose to the rank of [[group captain]]. Hugh survived the war and died in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Franks 1980, pp. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

===Battle of France===
Dundas was promoted to the rank of [[flying officer]] in January 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34794|startpage=1006|date=20 February 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; 609 Squadron was positioned on the south coast of [[England]] in May 1940, and was part of [[RAF Fighter Command]] operations to provide air cover for the [[Royal Navy]] and civilian vessels that were taking part in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]]. On 30 May, he flew his first patrol. The following day his squadron was put on 30 minutes readiness at [[RAF North Weald]] from 12:30 pm. At 14:00 His squadron took off, headed for Dunkirk at {{convert|20000|ft|m|-2}} and engaged the enemy for the first time. In the next patrol, flying ''L1096'', Dundas engaged a German bomber formation and destroyed a [[Heinkel He 111]] and a [[Dornier Do 17]]. Dundas did not score again during the [[Battle of France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 181.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Britain===
[[File:DO17FLAMETHROWER.jpg|thumb|right|Rudolf Heitsch's Dornier, shot down by Dundas and his wingman on 15 September 1940. The machine carried a flame throwing device which is just visible on the aft fuselage (see victory list for details). ''Feldwebel'' Pfeiffer is being carried on a stretcher.]]
Over the next few weeks 609 Squadron had moved from [[RAF Northolt]] to [[RAF Middle Wallop]]. It was from here Dundas gained his first victory of the [[Battle of Britain]], in a phase known as the ''[[Kanalkampf]]''. On 13 July, as section leader, Dundas led a patrol over a convoy. Failing to find the convoy the Spitfires engaged German aircraft at {{convert|15000|ft|m|-2}} near [[Portland, England]]. Flying in ''R6634'' Dundas led a diving attack out of the sun against [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s. Dundas claimed a Bf 110 destroyed though the damaged aircraft and its wounded pilot, ''[[Leutnant]]'' Krebitz, made it back to France, where the Bf 110 was severely damaged in a crash-landing. In late July while night-flying Dundas narrowly escaped with his life; coming into land, his wing struck an artillery emplacement. He landed without injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 181.&quot;/&gt;

Over the next few days, Dundas fought continuous battles with German formations. He noted the growing intensity of the air battles and assumed responsibility for the unit's [[war diary]] in August. In this diary he remarked;

&lt;blockquote&gt;So far as 609 was concerned, the Nazi blitz began on the 8th August...Four pilots engaged and accounted for five huns.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 1971, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 11 August 1940 Dundas flew ''R6769''. Taking off at 09:45 am he led yellow section out to sea near the [[Isle of Wight]] at {{convert|24000|ft|m|-2}}. Dundas and two other Spitfires (including his wingman) lost contact with his squadron. He saw nine [[Hawker Hurricane]]s below and in mid-Channel but also noticed contrails above and climbed up to investigate. The aircraft were Bf 110s, with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s providing top cover. Dundas led an attack, but lost the other Spitfires and attacked alone. He shot down a Bf 110 but received hits from German rear gunners. The Bf 110 was likely from I./''[[Zerstörergeschwader 2]]'' (&quot;destroyer wing 2&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 181.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spitfire pilots of No. 19 Squadron RAF gather at Manor Farm, Fowlmere, near Duxford in Cambridgeshire, September 1940. CH1370.jpg|thumb|left|Hugh Dundas (smoking) with No. 19 Squadron aircrew at Manor Farm near [[RAF Duxford]], September 1940.]]
On 12 August the battle was repeated against Bf 109s and Bf 110s over the same area. Dundas shot down another Bf 110. Shaking off a Bf 109, he damaged another but was forced to disengage as more German fighters closed in and fuel and ammunition had run low.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, pp. 181–182.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, pp. 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; His fifth victory now made him a flying ace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 182.&quot;/&gt;

A major effort was made by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' on 13 August 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 182.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Christened ''[[Adlertag]]'' (&quot;eagle day&quot;), the Germans began a series of heavy air attacks. At 15:30 NO. 609 Squadron was scrambled, with Dundas flying in ''R6690'' as number four in red section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 182.&quot;/&gt; At {{convert|10000|ft|m|-2}} he spotted German fighters. Red leader could not see the enemy and instructed Dundas to take the lead. Climbing into the sun at {{convert|18000|ft|m|-2}}, Dundas saw [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bombers below him. Attacking he shot down one of the Ju 87s from ''[[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2]]'' (&quot;dive bombing wing 2&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 182.&quot;/&gt; Dundas damaged another before being hit. He made a &quot;[[Deadstick landing|dead-stick]]&quot; landing at [[RAF Warmwell]]. The German unit that 609 attacked was badly hit. One ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (&quot;squadron&quot;) of II./StG 2 lost six out of nine Ju 87s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bungay 2000, p. 210&quot;&gt;Bungay 2000, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, 14 August 609 was patrolling [[Boscombe Down]] at {{convert|15000|ft|m|-2}}. Flying Spitfire ''R6961'', Dundas damaged a Bf 110 before it escaped into cloud. Directed onto a formation of Do 17s soon after he damaged one bomber before taking hits from defensive fire. Returning to base, Dundas spotted a He 111 with its wheels down and made a brief attack that caused it to crash {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} south-west of his airfield.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Flight Lieutenant J.H.G McArthur witnessed the crash.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine belonged to the ''Stab Staffel'' from ''[[Kampfgeschwader 55]]'' (&quot;bomber wing 55&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 183.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dundas did not make another claim until 15 September, a date known as [[Battle of Britain Day]]. In the morning, piloting ''R6922'', he damaged a Do 17, knocking out one of its engines. Flying another Spitfire, ''X4107'', he shared a Do 17 with his wingmen, Pilot Officer Mike Appleby, and the American pilot [[Vernon Keogh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, pp. 185–186.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 24 September, he damaged a Do 17 while destroying a Bf 110 in ''X4472''. In the same Spitfire Dundas claimed a Bf 109 shot down on 26 September and damaged another Do 17. The following day he claimed a Bf 110 destroyed near [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 186.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven days later Dundas claimed a probable victory against a Bf 110, after a battle with German aircraft six miles north of RAF Warmwell at 16:30. Despite firing a 12–14 second burst at the enemy fighter, he did not see it crash. During the battle Dundas was hit in the leg when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew again the next day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, ''R6915'', still exists, having been preserved by the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name=iwm/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 187.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;price&quot;/&gt;

A week later on 15 October 1940 Dundas destroyed another Bf 110 in ''P9503'' at {{convert|14000|ft|m|-2}} over [[Christchurch, Dorset]]. Evading a Bf 109 attack, Dundas' radio failed and he was unable to re-group his section. Noticing Bf 110s above at {{convert|18000|-|20000|ft|m|-2}} he climbed to attack; his victim crashed at [[Bournemouth]]. He was then chased by a pair of Bf 109s but evaded them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 181.&quot;/&gt; His victory was 609s 99th aerial victory. &lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Frankie Howell DFC, claimed a [[Junkers Ju 88]] as the unit's 100th victory on 21 October. Howell's Spitfire, ''X4590'', can be seen at the [[Royal Air Force Museum London]]. ''See: Franks 1980, p. 188''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spitfire Imperial War Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Spitfire ''R6915'', Imperial War Museum (2005). Dundas made a probable claim against a Bf 110 on 9 October 1940 in this machine.]]

===Channel Front and last battle===
By now Dundas was recognised as the highest scoring pilot of the unit, he was highly regarded by his comrades and was well-liked. He passed on experience to younger pilots and was always willing to discuss tactics, particularly with [[Squadron Leader]] Michael Robinson. Dundas, even by this early stage in the war, was the only member of the original 'A' (Auxiliary) pilots still with 609.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 188.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Dundas lamented the few who remained were the &quot;sole champions of the Auxiliary attitude&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 1971, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November, a Ju 88 was reported near [[Southampton]]. Dundas asked permission to intercept but was refused. Approaching his squadron leader, Dundas asked to take his section up for a practice flight; Robinson did not expecting anything untoward and gave permission. At {{convert|22000|ft|m|-2}} Dundas' section made contact, chasing the German over the [[Isle of Wight]] at full throttle – reaching 2,600 revs. The Ju 88 had a healthy head start. But Dundas closed with it and got to within {{convert|400|yd|m}}, {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} off [[Cherbourg, France]]. Dundas fired ''X4586's'' guns for five seconds while the German gunners put up a determined defence. The Ju 88's port engine caught fire and it dived down steeply, out of control. Now in sight of an airfield filled with Bf 109s, Dundas decided to retreat. He was credited with a probable victory upon his return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, pp. 188–189.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, 28 November, was busy for 609 Squadron. Several scrambles and alerts came through against Bf 109s. The last came at approximately 15:30 [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. Dundas was once again piloting ''X4586''. Two squadrons, [[No. 152 Squadron RAF|152 Squadron]] and 609 made contact with Bf 109s from ''[[Jagdgeschwader 2]]'' (&quot;fighter wing 2&quot;), led by the most successful German ace of the war thus far — [[Helmut Wick]]. Minutes after contact had been made and the battle joined, Flight Lieutenant Fieldsend heard the familiar voice of Dundas shout &quot;I've finished a 109—Whoopee!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw 2008, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Squadron Leader Robinson congratulated Dundas but nothing was heard from Dundas, or his wingman [[Pilot Officer]] Paul A. Baillon, flying ''R6631''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 190.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed Wick had shot down Baillon in a diving attack for his 56th aerial victory. Baillon managed to bail out, but was never recovered. Momentarily distracted, Wick flew across Dundas' path.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 1996, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Dundas fired a short burst, hitting Wick's Bf 109 at around 17:00 German time, over the sea near the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 190.&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that Wick fell victim to Pilot Officer Eric Marrs, who also made a claim in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Michulec 2002, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Wick was seen to bail out of his aircraft, but he was not rescued and his body was never found.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Moments later Dundas was probably shot down by Wick's wingman, [[Rudolf Pflanz]] who claimed a victory and saw the Spitfire crash into the sea with the pilot still inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;price&quot;&gt;Price 1996, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 1971, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Wick, Dundas' body was never found.&lt;ref name=&quot;needlesbattery&quot; /&gt; On 24 December 1940, Dundas was posthumously awarded a second DFC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks 1980, p. 191.&quot;&gt;Franks 1980, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 7 January 1941 in the ''[[London Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35037|startpage=150|date=7 January 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the citation :

:&quot;Flight Lieutenant Dundas has continued to engage the enemy with outstanding success and has now destroyed at least twelve of their aircraft and damaged many more. On one occasion he pursued an enemy aircraft from Winchester to Cherbourg, finally destroying it. He has shown a magnificent fighting spirit which has inspired the other members of his flight&quot;.

===Memorial and ''R6915''===
As an airman who has no known grave, he is commemorated on the [[Air Forces Memorial]] at [[Runnymede]] (Panel 4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2322567/DUNDAS,%20JOHN%20CHARLES] CWGC Casualty Record.&lt;/ref&gt;
A small memorial to Dundas is on a cliff-top path east of [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater Bay]] on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref name=&quot;needlesbattery&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theneedlesbattery.org.uk/ww1ww2.php | title=The Needles Batteries at War | publisher=The Needles Battery Website | accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; close to the point where his final battle took place. It was installed in November 2000, on the 60th anniversary of his death.

|Third share Dornier Do 17&lt;br&gt;Dornier Do 17 damaged
|The Do 17 belonged to ''8 Staffel'' (Squadron), ''[[Kampfgeschwader 76]]'' (KG 76—Bomber Wing 76).&lt;ref&gt;Goss 2011, pp. 335–336.&lt;/ref&gt; The Do 17, Code F1+FS, flown by ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) [[Rudolf Heitsch]], was found in a field near [[Shoreham, Kent]]. The Dornier was found to be fitted with a flamethrower, installed in the tail. Oil, nitrogen, and hydrogen cylinders were found in the fuselage, while the external pipe was fitted with a jet. Initially, it was concluded that it was a smoke producing device to feign damage. But it was discovered that it was a device that was triggered by one of the rear gunners to destroy a fighter pursuing the bomber from line astern. However, the lack of oxygen meant that the device failed to function, and only a continual spray of oil was emitted.&lt;ref&gt;Goss 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Heitsch survived, along with a ''Feldwebel'' Pfeiffer and Sauter. ''Feldwebel'' Stephan Schmidt was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1969, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;
