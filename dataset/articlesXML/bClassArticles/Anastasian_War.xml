{{Campaignbox Roman-Persian Wars}}
{{Campaignbox Anastasian War}}
The '''Anastasian War''' was fought from 502 to 506 between the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]]. It was the first major conflict between the two powers since 440, and would be the prelude to a long [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|series of destructive conflicts]] between the two empires over the next century.

==Prelude==
Several factors underlay the termination of the longest period of peace the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] ever enjoyed. The Persian king [[Kavadh I]] needed money to pay his debts to the [[Hephthalites]] who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes in the flow of the [[Tigris]] in lower Mesopotamia, sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius. ''History of the Wars'', I.7.1-2; {{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War==
In 502, Kavadh quickly captured the unprepared city of [[Theodosiopolis (Armenia)|Theodosiopolis]], perhaps with local support; the city was in any case undefended by troops and weakly fortified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kavadh then besieged the fortress-city of [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]] through the autumn and winter (502-503). The siege of the city proved to be a far more difficult enterprise than Kavadh expected; the defenders, although unsupported by troops, repelled the Persian assaults for three months before they were finally beaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The year 503 saw much warfare without decisive results: the Romans attempted an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the Persian-held Amida while Kavadh invaded [[Osroene]], and laid siege to [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with the same results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|pp=69–71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NE 500ad.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Roman and Persian Empires in 500, also showing their neighbors, many of whom were dragged into wars between the great powers.]]

Finally in 504, the Romans gained the upper hand with the renewed [[investment (military)|investment]] of Amida leading to the hand-over of the city. That year, an armistice was agreed as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the [[Hun]]s from the Caucasus. Negotiations between the two powers took place, but such was the distrust that in 506 the Romans, suspecting treachery, seized the Persian officials; once released, the Persians preferred to stay in [[Nisibis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 506, a treaty was finally agreed, but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were. [[Procopius]] states that peace was agreed for seven years, and it is likely that some payments were made to the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius. ''History of the Wars'', I.9.24; {{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Roman generals blamed many of their difficulties in this war on their lack of a major base in the immediate vicinity of the frontier, a role filled for the Persians by Nisibis (which until its secession in 363 had served the same purpose for the Romans), and in 505 Anastasius therefore ordered the building of a great fortified city at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]]. The dilapidated fortifications were also upgraded at Edessa, [[Batnae]] and Amida.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no further large-scale conflict took place during Anastasius's reign, tensions continued, especially while work continued at Dara. This construction project was to become a key component of the Roman defenses, and also a lasting source of controversy with the Persians, who complained that its construction violated the treaty agreed in 422, by which both empires had agreed not to establish new fortifications in the frontier zone. Anastasius, however, pursued the project, deflecting Kavadh's complaints with money. The Persians were in any case unable to stop the work, and the walls were completed by 507/508.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77&quot;/&gt;
