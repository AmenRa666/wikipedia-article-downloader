Since 2004, the [[United States government#Executive branch|United States government]] has attacked thousands of targets in [[Northwest Pakistan]] using [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (drones) controlled by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Special Activities Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The CIA's Silent War in Pakistan&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1900248,00.html|title=The CIA's Silent War in Pakistan|work=TIME|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=16 December 2011|first=Bobby|last=Ghosh|first2=Mark|last2=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these attacks are on targets in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] along the [[Durand Line|Afghan border]] in Northwest Pakistan.

These strikes began during the [[George W. Bush administration|administration]] of [[United States President]] [[George W. Bush]], and have increased substantially under his successor [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Greg

The US administration and Pakistani authorities have publicly claimed that civilian deaths from the attacks are minimal. Leaked military documents reveal that the vast majority of people killed have not been the intended targets, with approximately 13% of deaths being the intended targets, 81% being other militants, and 6% being civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Operation Haymaker|url=https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/15/operation-haymaker/|publisher=[[The Intercept]]|date=15 October 2015|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DevereauxManhunting&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Strikes often kill many more than the intended target|url=https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush|publisher=[[The Intercept]]|date=15 October 2015|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identities of collateral victims are usually not investigated by US forces, who systematically count each male military-age corpse as an &quot;enemy killed in action&quot; unless there is clear proof to the contrary, as long as the male was in a militant facility at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;DevereauxManhunting&quot;/&gt; Estimates for civilian deaths range from 158 to 965.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOIJ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casualties&quot;/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] found that a number of victims were unarmed and that some strikes could amount to [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=US drone strike killings in Pakistan and Yemen 'unlawful'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24618701|work=[[BBC News]]|date=22 October 2013|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan's Prime Minister, [[Nawaz Sharif]], has repeatedly demanded an end to the strikes, stating: &quot;The use of drones is not only a continual violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve and efforts at eliminating terrorism from our country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GulPM&quot;&gt;Ayaz Gul, 22 October 2013, &quot;[http://www.voanews.com/content/us-accused-of-unlawful-killings-pakistan-drone-strikes/1774276.html Pakistani PM Urges US to Stop Drone Strikes]&quot;, ''Voice of America''. Retrieved 23 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peshawar High Court]] has ruled that the attacks are illegal, inhumane, violate the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and constitute a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Buncombe, 9 May 2013, &quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/pakistani-court-declares-us-drone-strikes-in-the-countrys-tribal-belt-illegal-8609843.html Pakistani court declares US drone strikes in the country's tribal belt illegal]&quot;, ''The Independent''. Retrieved 23 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Obama administration]] disagrees, contending that the attacks do not violate international law and that the method of attack is precise and effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;GulPM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seth G.

==Overview==
Pakistan's government publicly condemns these attacks.&lt;ref name=nyt11Dec2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/world/asia/12drone.html|title=Qaeda Planner in Pakistan Killed by Drone|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 December 2009|accessdate=16 December 2011|first=Mark|last=Mazzetti|first2=Souad|last2=Mekhennet}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also allegedly allowed the drones to operate from [[Shamsi Airfield]] in Pakistan until 21 April 2011.&lt;ref name=austrailian19Feb2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/pakistan-permits-cia-base-for-strikes/story-e6frg6t6-1111118893683|title=Pakistan allowing CIA to use airbase for drone strikes|newspaper=Australian|date=19 February 2009|accessdate=6 December 2011|first=Amanda|last=Hodge}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to secret diplomatic cables leaked by [[Wikileaks]], Pakistan's Army Chief [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]] not only tacitly agreed to the drone flights, but in 2008 requested that Americans increase them.&lt;ref name=reuters20May2011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/20/us-pakistan-wikileaks-idUSTRE74J3UV20110520|title=Pakistan army chief sought more drone coverage in '08: Wikileaks|last=Allbritton|first=Chris|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pakistan's Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] said, &quot;drone missiles cause collateral damage. A few militants are killed, but the majority of victims are innocent citizens.&quot;&lt;ref name=hindustan23April2011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/F-16-jets-knock-down-CIA-drones/Article1-688705.aspx |title='F-16 jets knock down CIA drones' |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=23 April 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831181743/http://www.hindustantimes.com/F-16-jets-knock-down-CIA-drones/Article1-688705.aspx |archivedate=31 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strikes are often linked to [[anti-American sentiment in Pakistan]] and the growing questionability of the scope and extent of [[CIA activities in Pakistan]].

Reports of the number of militant versus civilian casualties differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;C.I.A. Is Disputed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=C.I.A. Is Disputed on Civilian Toll in Drone Strikes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/asia/12drones.html?_r=1|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the CIA and other American agencies have claimed a high rate of militant killings, relying in part on a disputed estimation method that &quot;counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants (...) unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecretKillList&quot;&gt;Jo Becker &amp; Scott Shane, 29 May 2012, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=0 Secret 'Kill List' Proves a Test of Obama's Principles and Will]&quot;, ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 23 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the CIA has claimed that strikes conducted between May 2010 and August 2011 killed over 600 militants without any civilian fatalities, a claim that many have disputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;C.I.A. Is Disputed&quot;/&gt; The [[New America Foundation]] has estimated that 80 percent of those killed in the attacks were militants.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Economist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Out of the blue|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21524916|date=30 July 2011|accessdate=16 December 2011|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, several experts have stated that in reality, far fewer militants and many more civilians have been killed. In a 2009 opinion article, Daniel L. Byman of the [[Brookings Institution]] wrote that [[unmanned combat air vehicle|drone strikes]] may have killed &quot;10 or so civilians&quot; for every militant that they killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;brookings1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Byman|url=http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0714_targeted_killings_byman.aspx?|title=Do Targeted Killings Work?|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=14 July 2009|accessdate=16 December 2011|quote=Critics correctly find many problems with this program, most of all the number of civilian casualties the strikes have incurred. Sourcing on civilian deaths is weak and the numbers are often exaggerated, but more than 600 civilians are likely to have died from the attacks. That number suggests that for every militant killed, 10 or so civilians also died.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani military has stated that most of those killed were Al-Qaeda and [[Taliban]] militants.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn20110309&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/03/09/most-of-those-killed-in-drone-attacks-were-terrorists-military.html|title=Most of those killed in drone attacks were terrorists: military|last=Sherazi|first=Zahir Shah|date=9 March 2011|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] found that 423 to 965 civilians were killed out of a total of 2,497 to 3,999 including 172 to 207 children. The Bureau also claimed that since Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in strikes on funerals and mourners, a practice condemned by legal experts.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebureauinvestigates.comRescuers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/|title=Obama terror drones: CIA tactics in Pakistan include targeting rescuers and funerals|first=Chris|last=Woods|first2=Christina|last2=Lamb|date=4 February 2012|accessdate=7 February 2012|work=Bureau of Investigative Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/11/more-than-160-children-killed-in-us-strikes/|title=Over 160 children reported among drone deaths|first=Chris|last=Woods|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=27 December 2011|work=Bureau of Investigative Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thebureauinvestigates.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/10/most-complete-picture-yet-of-cia-drone-strikes/|title=Drone War Exposed – the complete picture of CIA strikes in Pakistan|last=Woods|first=Chris|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=16 December 2011|work=Bureau of Investigative Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Elias-Sanborn has also claimed that, &quot;as much of the literature on drones suggests, such killings usually harden militants' determination to fight, stalling any potential negotiations and settlement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137077/barbara-elias-sanborn/the-pakistani-talibans-coming-divide|last=Elias-Sanborn|first=Barbara|date=2 February 2012|title=The Pakistani Taliban's Coming Divide|journal=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, analysis by the [[RAND Corporation]] suggests that &quot;drone strikes are associated with decreases in the incidence and lethality of terrorist attacks&quot; in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Patrick B., and Anoop Sarbahi, [http://patrickjohnston.info/materials/drones.pdf The Impact of U.S. Drone Strikes on Terrorism in Pakistan], [[RAND Corporation]], 25 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A motive that the [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt|2010 Times Square car bomber]] [[Faisal Shahzad]] stated was the repeated CIA drone attacks in Pakistan, his native country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/08/nation/la-na-bomb-motive-20100508 Bomb motive], LA times 8 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drone strikes were halted in November 2011 after NATO forces killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in the [[Salala incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ken Dilanian|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/23/world/la-fg-pakistan-cia-drone-20111224|title=CIA has suspended drone attacks in Pakistan, U.S. officials say|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2011-12-23|accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamsi Airfield was evacuated of Americans and taken over by the Pakistanis December 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamsi Airfield taken by FC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Pak forces take control of Shamsi airbase|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/pak-forces-take-control-of-shamsi-airbase/210683-56.html|newspaper=IBNLive|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident prompted an approximately two-month stop to the drone strikes, which resumed on 10 January 2012.

In March 2013, [[Ben Emmerson]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] led a U.N. team that looked into civilian casualties from the U.S. drone attacks, and stated that the attacks are a violation of the sovereignty of Pakistan. Emmerson said government officials from the country clearly stated Pakistan does not agree to the drone attacks, which is contradicted by U.S. officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN says US drones violate Pakistan's sovereignty |url=http://www.chron.com/news/world/article/UN-says-US-drones-violate-Pakistan-s-sovereignty-4356752.php |newspaper=The Houston Chronicle |date=15 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321015705/http://www.chron.com/news/world/article/UN-says-US-drones-violate-Pakistan-s-sovereignty-4356752.php |archivedate=21 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, [[Amnesty International]] brought out a detailed study of the impact of drone strikes that strongly condemned the strikes. The report stated that the number of arbitrary civilian deaths, the tactics used (such as follow-up attacks targeting individuals helping the wounded) and the violation of Pakistani sovereignty meant that some of the strikes could be considered war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amnesty International|title=&quot;Will I be next?&quot; US Drone Strikes in Pakistan|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/asa330132013en.pdf|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the targeted killing program was described as &quot;basically over,&quot; with no attack having occurred since December 2013. The lull in attacks coincided with a new Obama Administration policy requiring a &quot;near certainty&quot; that civilians would not be harmed, a [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan|reduced]] US military and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] presence in [[Afghanistan]], a reduced [[al-Qaida]] presence in Pakistan, and an increased military role (at the expense of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]) in the execution of drone strikes.&lt;ref name=ZBeauchamp&gt;{{cite news|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|title=The drone war may be over in Pakistan|url=http://www.vox.com/2014/5/29/5761634/has-america-stopped-killing-pakistanis-with-drones|accessdate=29 May 2014|newspaper=Vox|date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KDilianian&gt;{{cite news|last=Dilanian |first=Ken |title=CIA WINDS DOWN DRONE STRIKE PROGRAM IN PAKISTAN |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cia-drone-strike-program-pakistan-winding-down |accessdate=29 May 2014 |newspaper=AP |date=29 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530043633/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cia-drone-strike-program-pakistan-winding-down |archivedate=30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] estimates the following cumulative statistics about U.S. drone strikes (as of 22 February 2016):&lt;ref name=&quot;BOIJ&quot;/&gt;
* Total strikes: 423
* Total killed: 2,497 - 3,999
* Civilians killed: 423 - 965
* Children killed: 172 - 207
* Injured: 1,161 - 1,744
* Strikes under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]: 51
* Strikes under the [[Obama Administration]]: 372
* 84 of the 2,379 dead have been identified as members of al-Qaeda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serle|first1=Jack|title=Only 4% of drone victims in Pakistan named as al Qaeda members|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/namingthedead/only-4-of-drone-victims-in-pakistan-named-as-al-qaeda-members/?lang=en|publisher=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formerly classified Pakistani government report obtained in July 2013 by the BIJ shows details of 75 drone strikes that occurred between 2006-09. According to the 12-page report, in this period, 176 of the 746 reported dead were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Chris &quot;[http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/07/22/exclusive-leaked-pakistani-report-confirms-high-civilian-death-toll-in-cia-drone-strikes/ Leaked Pakistani report confirms high civilian death toll in CIA drone strikes]&quot; ''Bureau of Investigative Journalism''. 22 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Long War Journal, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and the New America Foundation, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 had some of the highest [[civilian casualty ratio]]s of any years.

The US government cited the inability of states to control and keep track of terrorist activities as a characteristic of a [[failed state]], represented by the lack of military and governmental control in Pakistan’s [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], and was operating within the states’ right of self-defense according to Article 51 in [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]]. In President Obama’s 2013 speech at the National Defense University, he stated “we act against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people, and when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The United States Covert War in Pakistan: Drone Strikes an Infringement on National Sovereignty|journal=Journal of Applied Environmental and Biological Sciences|year=2014|last=Khalil|first=Jehanzeb|last2=Perveen|first2=Saima|volume=4|issue=8|pages=209–215|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2010 US State Department legal advisor [[Harold Koh]] stated that the drone strikes were legal because of the right to self-defense. According to Koh, the US is involved in an armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their affiliates and therefore may use force consistent with self-defense under international law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]], &quot;U.S. offers argument for drone strikes&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 March 2010, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA officials state that the agency uses a careful screening process in making decisions on which individuals to kill via drone strikes. The process, carried out at the agency's counterterrorist center, involves up to 10 lawyers who write briefs justifying the targeting of specific individuals. According to the former officials, if a brief's argument is weak, the request to target the individual is denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek1&quot;&gt;McKelvey, Tara, &quot;[http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-killing-machine.html Inside the Killing Machine]&quot;, ''[[Newsweek]]'', 13 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 the CIA has relied less on its list of individuals and increasingly targeted &quot;signatures,&quot; or suspect behavior. This change in tactics has resulted in fewer deaths of high-value targets and in more deaths of lower-level fighters, or &quot;mere foot soldiers&quot; as the one senior Pakistani official told the ''Washington Post''.&lt;ref name='wapo20110221'&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Miller|title=Increased U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan killing few high-value militants|date=21 February 2011|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/20/AR2011022002975.html?sid=ST2011022104355|work=Washington Post|accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signature strikes there must be supported by two sources of corroborating intelligence. Sources of intelligence include information from a communication intercept, a sighting of millitant training camps or intelligence from CIA assets on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-glyn-williams/nside-the-murky-world-of-_b_3367780.html Inside the Murky World of 'Signature Strikes' and the Killing of Americans With Drones by Brian Glyn Williams] The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Signature targeting&quot; has been the source of controversy. Drone critics argue that regular citizen behaviors can easily be mistaken for militant signatures.

US officials stated in March 2009 that the [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] strikes had killed nine of al Qaeda's 20 top commanders. The officials added that many top Taliban and al Qaeda leaders, as a result of the strikes, had fled to [[Quetta]] or even further to [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, David E., and Eric Schmitt, &quot;U.S. Weighs Taliban Strike Into Pakistan&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', 18 March 2009, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US politicians and academics have condemned the drone strikes. [[US Congress]]man [[Dennis Kucinich]] asserted that the United States was violating [[international law]] by carrying out strikes against a country that never attacked the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/09/14/top17.htm|title=US warned against sending troops to Pakistan: Congressman terms Bush's decision an election issue -DAWN – Top Stories; September&amp;nbsp;14,&amp;nbsp;2008|work=Dawn|location=Pakistan|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgetown University]] professor [[Gary D. Solis]] asserts that since the drone operators at the CIA are civilians directly engaged in armed conflict, this makes them &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; and possibly subject to prosecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek1&quot;/&gt;

US military reports asserted that [[al Qaeda]] is being slowly but systematically routed because of these attacks, and that they have served to sow the seeds of uncertainty and discord among their ranks. They also claimed that the drone attacks have addled and confused the [[Taliban]], and have led them to turn against each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-predator22-2009mar22,0,1530442,full.story U.S. missile strikes take heavy toll on al Qaeda, officials say], [[The Los Angeles Times]], 22 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 it was reported that (according to US officials) [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s son [[Saad bin Laden]] was believed to have been killed in a drone attack earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8164763.stm Bin Laden son 'probably killed'], [[BBC]], 23 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] (AP) noted that Barack Obama apparently expanded the scope and increased the aggressiveness of the drone campaign against militants in Pakistan after taking office. According to the news agency, the US increased strikes against the Pakistani Taliban, which earned favor from the Pakistani government, resulting in increased cooperation from Pakistani intelligence services. Also, the Obama administration toned down the US government's public rhetoric against [[Islamic terrorism]], garnering better cooperation from other Islamic governments. Furthermore, with the drawdown of the war in Iraq, more drones, support personnel, and intelligence assets became available for the campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since Obama took office, according to the AP, the number of drones operated by the CIA over Afghanistan and Pakistan doubled.&lt;ref&gt;Apuzzo, Matt, ([[Associated Press]]), &quot;Obama strategy widens assault on Pakistani, Afghan militants&quot;, 12 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some current and former counterterrorism officials, the Obama administration's increase in the use of drone strikes is an unintended consequence of the president's executive orders banning secret CIA detention centers and his attempt to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, and capturing prisoners has become a &quot;less viable option&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Entous, Adam, [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64H5SL20100518 &quot;Special Report: How the White House learned to love the drone&quot;], ''[[Reuters]]'', 18 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia alleged that, &quot;Their policy is to take out high-value targets, versus capturing high-value targets (...) They are not going to advertise that, but that's what they are doing.&quot; Obama's aides argued that it is often impossible to capture targets in the tribal areas of Pakistan and Yemen, and that other targets are in foreign custody thanks to American tips. Obama's counter-terrorism adviser, [[John O. Brennan]], said that, &quot;The purpose of these actions is to mitigate threats to U.S. persons' lives&quot;, and continued, &quot;It is the option of last recourse. So the president, and I think all of us here, don't like the fact that people have to die. And so he wants to make sure that we go through a rigorous checklist: The infeasibility of capture, the certainty of the intelligence base, the imminence of the threat, all of these things.&quot; In response to the concerns about the number of killings, Jeh C. Johnson stated, &quot;We have to be vigilant to avoid a no-quarter, or take-no-prisoners policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Secret 'Kill List' Proves a Test of Obama's Principles and Will]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study called &quot;The Year of the Drone&quot; published in February 2010 by the [[New America Foundation]] found that from a total of 114 drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and early 2010, between 834 and 1,216 individuals had been killed. About two thirds of these were thought to be militants and one third were civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casualties&quot;/&gt;

On 28 April 2011, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed General [[David Petraeus]] as director of the [[CIA]] overseeing the drone attacks. According to Pakistani and American officials this could further inflame relations between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/world/29petraeus.html|work=The New York Times|first1=Jane|last1=Perlez|first2=Eric|last2=Schmitt|title=Petraeus Appointment Could Inflame Relations With Pakistan|date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', as of September 2011, around 30 Predator and Reaper drones were operating under CIA direction in the Afghanistan/Pakistan area of operations. The drones are flown by [[United States Air Force]] pilots located at an unnamed base in the United States. US Department of Defense armed drones, which also sometimes take part in strikes on terrorist targets, are flown by US Air Force pilots located at [[Creech Air Force Base]] and [[Holloman Air Force Base]]. The CIA drones are operated by an office called the Pakistan-Afghanistan Department, which operates under the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (CTC), based at CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. As of September 2011, the CTC had about 2,000 people on staff.&lt;ref name=wapo1Sept2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Julian E., &quot;U.S. Expands Drone Flights To Take Aim At East Africa&quot;, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 21 September 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]]'s insistence, beginning in early 2010 staffs of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] and [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] have begun reviewing each CIA drone strike. The staff members hold monthly meetings with CIA personnel involved with the drone campaign, review videos of each strike, and attempt to confirm that the strike was executed properly.&lt;ref&gt;Dilanian, Ken, &quot;Congress Zooms In On Drone Killings&quot;, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 25 June 2012, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leading critics of drones in the US Congress is Senator [[Rand Paul]]. In 2013, he performed a thirteen-hour filibuster to try to achieve a public admission from U.S. President Obama that he could not kill an American citizen with a drone on American soil, who was not actively engaged in combat. Attorney General Eric Holder responded soon after, confirming that the president had no authority to use drones for this purpose.

[http://polisci.columbia.edu/people/profile/319 Eric M. Blanchard], assistant professor of Political Science at Columbia University, notes that, &quot;the use of drones reflects several on-going historical military developments that, in turn, reflect the culture and values of American society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Eric M.|title=The technoscience question in feminist IR|year=2011|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group|location=London|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he alludes to technological idealism (the pursuit of a &quot;decisive&quot; technology to end war) and the need to seize the moral high ground, by delivering more &quot;humane&quot; approaches to warfare. Military support for the drones remains strong for a host of reasons: expansion of battlespace, extension of an individual soldiers capabilities, and a reduction of American casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard|title=The technoscience question in feminist IR|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support has also been noted across the political spectrum as focus in the Middle East shifted from [[Stabilization (warfare)|stabilization]] in Afghanistan to antiterrorist strikes aimed at al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan.

Blanchard also points to a shift in how gender is viewed in terms of warfare with the advent of technology in place of human soldiers. Fighters often represent an idealized masculinity, portraying strength, bravery, and chivalry, but during the Gulf War of 1990-91 the focus had changed. The computer programmers, missile technologists, high-tech pilots, and other servicemen who were centred around technology were now the focal point of news coverage, removing the warrior-soldier from the conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanchard 160&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard|title=The technoscience question in feminist IR|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For at least some of the initial drone strikes, in 2004 and 2005, the US operated with the approval of Pakistan's ISI. Former Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]] told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2014 that he allowed the CIA to fly drones within Pakistan and that in exchange the US supplied helicopters and night-vision equipment to the Pakistanis. Musharraf wanted the drones to operate under Pakistani control, but the US wouldn't allow it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/unblinking-stare The Unblinking Stare] ''The New Yorker'', 24 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 the [[General Officer Commanding]] of [[7th Infantry Division (Pakistan)|7th division]] of [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani Army]], Major General Ghayur Mehmood delivered a briefing &quot;Myths and rumours about US predator strikes&quot; in Miramshah. He said that most of those who were killed by the drone strikes were Al-qaeda and Taliban terrorists. Military's official paper on the attacks till 7 March 2011 said that between 2007 and 2011 about 164 predator strikes had been carried out and over 964 terrorists had been killed. Those killed included 793 locals and 171 foreigners. The foreigners included Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Chechens, Filipinos and Moroccans.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn20110309&quot;/&gt;

On 9 December 2011, Pakistan's Army Chief [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]] issued a directive to shoot down US drones. A senior Pakistani military official said, &quot;Any object entering into our air space, including U.S. drones, will be treated as hostile and be shot down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/12/10/9352886-pakistan-says-us-drones-in-its-air-space-will-be-shot-down |title=Pakistan says U.S. drones in its air space will be shot down |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=29 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212032204/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/12/10/9352886-pakistan-says-us-drones-in-its-air-space-will-be-shot-down |archivedate=12 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily Indian newspaper [[The Hindu]] reported that Pakistan reached a secret agreement with United States to readmit the attacks of guided airplanes on its soil. According to a high western official linked with the negotiations, the pact was signed by ISI chief Lieutenant General Shuja Ahmad Pasha, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency general David Petraeus during a meeting in Qatar January 2012. According to The Hindu, Lieutenant General Pasha also agreed to enlarge the CIA presence in Shahbaz air base, near the city of Abbottabad, where Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2929240.ece|title=In secret deal, ISI allows U.S. drone war to resume|author=The Hindu|date=25 February 2012|accessdate=25 September 2012|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to unnamed US government officials, beginning in early 2011 the US would fax notifications to Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] agency (ISI) detailing the dates and general areas of future drone attack operations. The ISI would send a return fax acknowledging receipt, but not approving the operation. Nevertheless, it appeared that Pakistan would clear the airspace over the area and on the dates designated in the US fax. After the May 2011 [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid that killed bin Laden]], the ISI ceased acknowledging the US faxes, but Pakistani authorities have appeared to continue clearing the airspace in the areas where US drones are operating. According to an unnamed Pakistani government official, the Pakistan government believes that the US sends the faxes primarily to support legal justification for the drone attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Entous, Adam, &quot;U.S. Unease Over Drone Strikes&quot;, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 26 September 2012, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, it was reported that the US had drastically scaled back drone attacks in order to appease the Pakistani military, which was under growing pressure to move to end American &quot;airspace violations&quot;. The CIA was instructed to be more &quot;cautious&quot; and limit the drone strikes to high-value targets, to cut down on so-called signature strikes (attacks that target a group of militants based purely on their behavior). Pakistani military officials had earlier stated that these drone attacks cannot continue at the tempo they are going at, and that civilian casualties in these strikes are spawning more militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US scales back drone attacks in Pakistan|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/582200/us-scales-back-drone-attacks-in-pakistan-report/|accessdate=26 July 2013|work=[[The Express Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reporting from other countries==
The British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' stated on 18 February 2009 that the CIA was using Pakistan's [[Shamsi Airfield]], {{convert|190|mi|km}} southwest of [[Quetta]] and {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the Afghan border, as its base for drone operations. Safar Khan, a journalist based in the area near Shamsi, told the ''Times'', &quot;We can see the planes flying from the base. The area around the base is a high-security zone and no one is allowed there.&quot;&lt;ref name=TheTimes2009-02-18&gt;

Top US officials confirmed to [[Fox News Channel]] that Shamsi Airfield had been used by the CIA to launch the drones since 2002.&lt;ref name=FoxNews2009-02-19/&gt;

==Al Qaeda response==
Messages recovered from [[Osama bin Laden]]'s home after [[Death of Osama bin Laden|his death]] in 2011, including one from then al Qaeda No. 3, [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] reportedly, according to the [[Agence France-Presse]] and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', expressed frustration with the drone strikes in Pakistan. According to an unnamed U.S. government official, in his message al-Rahman complained that drone-launched missiles were killing al Qaeda operatives faster than they could be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], &quot;Bin Laden was trying to rebuild drone-decimated terror network&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 3 July 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DM20110702&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2010617/Bin-Ladens-fears-Al-Qaedas-future-revealed-emails.html|title=Al Qaeda hit by credit crunch: Bin Laden emails reveal terror group is running out of cash|date=2 July 2011|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=4 July 2011|location=London|first=John|last=Stevens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Greg, &quot;Bin Laden Files Show Al-Qaeda Under Pressure&quot;, ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2 July 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 2011, law enforcement authorities found messages on al Qaeda-linked websites calling for attacks against executives of drone aircraft manufacturer [[AeroVironment]]. Law enforcement believed that the messages were in response to calls for action against Americans by [[Adam Yahiye Gadahn]].&lt;ref&gt;Winton, Richard, [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/02/local/la-me-threats-20110702 &quot;Al Qaeda-Linked Website Threatens Monrovia Company That Makes Military Drones&quot;], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 2 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations human rights concerns==
On 3 June 2009, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) delivered a report sharply critical of US tactics. The report asserted that the US government has failed to keep track of civilian casualties of its military operations, including the drone attacks, and to provide means for citizens of affected nations to obtain information about the casualties and any legal inquests regarding them.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_un_probe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/06/04/drone.attacks/|title=U.N. envoy calls for probe into U.S. drone attacks|publisher=CNN|date=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any such information held by the U.S. military is allegedly inaccessible to the public due to the high level of secrecy surrounding the drone attacks program.&lt;ref name=&quot;harpers_secrecy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverstein|first=Ken|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2009/06/hbc-90005193|title=Is Secrecy on Drone Attacks Hiding Civilian Casualties?|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US representative at UNHRC has argued that the UN investigator for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions does not have jurisdiction over US military actions,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_un_probe&quot;/&gt; while another US diplomat claimed that the US military is investigating any wrongdoing and doing all it can to furnish information about the deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_un_probe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=MacInnis|first=Laura|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL31016477|title=UN envoy seeks more U.S. openness on war deaths|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2009 UNHRC investigator [[Philip Alston]] called on the US to demonstrate that it was not randomly killing people in violation of international law through its use of drones on the Afghan border. Alston criticized the US's refusal to respond to date to the UN's concerns. Said Alston, &quot;Otherwise you have the really problematic bottom line, which is that the Central Intelligence Agency is running a program that is killing significant numbers of people and there is absolutely no accountability in terms of the relevant international laws.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|title=U.S. Use of Drones Queried by U.N.|work=New York Times|date=28 October 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/world/28nations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2010 Alston's team released a report on its investigation into the drone strikes, criticizing the United States for being &quot;the most prolific user of [[targeted killings]]&quot; in the world. Alston, however, acknowledged that the drone attacks may be justified under the right to self-defense. He called on the US to be more open about the program. Alston's report was submitted to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cloud|first=David, S.|title=U.N. report faults prolific use of drone strikes by U.S.|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 June 2010|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/03/world/la-fg-cia-drones-20100603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2012, after a four-day visit to Pakistan, [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navanethem Pillay|Navi Pillay]] called for a new investigation into US drone strikes in Pakistan, repeatedly referring to the attacks as &quot;indiscriminate,&quot; and said that the attacks constitute human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN wants investigation into drone attacks inside Pakistan|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=7 June 2012|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/07/un-wants-investigation-into-drone-attacks-in-pakistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report issued on 18 June 2012, Christof Heyns, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, called on the Obama administration to justify its use of targeted assassinations rather than attempting to capture al Qaeda or Taliban suspects.&lt;ref&gt;Nebehay, Stephanie, &quot;U.N.

==Reactions from people in Pakistan==
According to a report by researchers at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[New York University]] law schools in 2012, civilians in Waziristan interviewed for the report believed &quot;that the US actively seeks to kill them simply for being Muslims, viewing the drone campaign as a part of a religious crusade against Islam.&quot;&lt;ref name=lud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Stanford-NYU-Living-Under-Drones.pdf|title=Living Under Drones: Death, Injury and Trauma to Civilians from US Drone Practices in Pakistan|author1=International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic, Stanford Law School|author2=Global Justice Clinic, NYU School of Law|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6C1NZMGYJ|date=September 2012|archivedate=8 November 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many professionals working in Waziristan believe that drone strikes encourage terrorism.&lt;ref name=lud/&gt; The report notes similar conclusions reached by reporters for ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[CNN]].&lt;ref name=lud/&gt;

According to ongoing surveys of public opinion conducted by the [[New America Foundation]], 9 out of 10 of civilians in Waziristan &quot;oppose the U.S. military pursuing al-Qaeda and the Taliban&quot; and nearly 70% &quot;want the Pakistani military alone to fight Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in the tribal areas.&quot;&lt;ref name=naf2&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen|first=Peter|title=Drone Strikes: Do you support or oppose United States military drone strikes by air inside FATA today?|url=http://pakistansurvey.org/question/drone-strikes|publisher=New America Foundation|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a public opinion survey conducted between November 2008 and January 2009 by the Pakistani [[Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy]], approximately half of the respondents considered drone strikes in [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] accurate and approximately the same number of respondents said that the strikes did not lead to anti-American sentiment and were effective in damaging the militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airra.org/newsandanalysis/droneattacksurvey.php |title=Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy |publisher=AIRRA |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2013-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807030801/http://www.airra.org/newsandanalysis/droneattacksurvey.php |archivedate=7 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that &quot;the popular notion outside the Pakhtun belt that a large majority of the local population supports the Taliban movement lacks substance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312040744/http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=165781 |date=12 March 2009 |title=Drone attacks – a survey }}{{Dead link|date=August 2015}}, [[The News International]], 5 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Farhat Taj a member of AIRRA the drones have never killed any civilians.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has reported that in North Waziristan a militant group called Khorasan Mujahedin targets people suspected of being informants. According to the report, the group kidnaps people from an area suspected of selling information that led to the strike, tortures and usually kills them, and sells videotapes of killings in street markets as warnings to others.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Alex, [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-death-squads-20111228,0,3614850.story &quot;Death Squads Target Informants&quot;], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 29 December 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian casualties==
{{See also|Civilian casualties from US drone strikes}}
According to unnamed counterterrorism officials, in 2009 or 2010 CIA drones began employing smaller missiles in airstrikes in Pakistan in order to reduce civilian casualties. The new missiles, called the [[Small Smart Weapon]] or Scorpion, are reportedly about the size of a violin case (21&amp;nbsp;inches long) and weigh 16&amp;nbsp;kg. The missiles are used in combination with new technology intended to increase accuracy and expand surveillance, including the use of small, unarmed surveillance drones to exactly pinpoint the location of targets. These &quot;micro-UAVs&quot; (unmanned aerial vehicles) can be roughly the size of a pizza platter and meant to monitor potential targets at close range, for hours or days at a time. One former U.S. official who worked with micro-UAVs said that they can be almost impossible to detect at night. &quot;It can be outside your window and you won't hear a whisper,&quot; the official said.&lt;ref&gt;Warrick, Joby, and Peter Finn, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/25/AR2010042503114.html Amid outrage over civilian deaths in Pakistan, CIA turns to smaller missiles], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The drone operators also have changed to trying to target insurgents in vehicles rather than residences to reduce the chances of civilian casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Economist&quot;/&gt;

The New York Times reported in 2013 that the Obama Administration embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties, which in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants, giving partial explanation to the official claims of extraordinarily low collateral deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret 'Kill List' Proves a Test of Obama's Principles and Will|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 May 2012|first1=Jo|last1=Becker|first2=Scott|last2=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2011 report by ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' stated that civilian casualties in the strikes had apparently decreased. According to the report, the U.S. government believed that 1,300 militants and only 30 civilians had been killed in drone strikes since mid-2008, with no civilians killed since August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Capaccio, Tony, and Jeff Bliss, &quot;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-31/u-s-said-to-reduce-civilian-deaths-after-increasing-cia-pakistan-strikes.html U.S. Said to Reduce Civilian Deaths After Increasing CIA Pakistan Strikes]&quot;, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2009, Daniel L. Byman of the [[Brookings Institution]] stated that although accurate data on the results of drone strikes is difficult to obtain, it seemed that ten civilians had died in the drone attacks for every militant killed. Byman argues that civilian killings constitute a humanitarian tragedy and create dangerous political problems, including damage to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government and alienation of the Pakistani populace from America. He suggested that the real answer to halting al-Qaeda's activity in Pakistan will be long-term support of Pakistan's [[counterinsurgency]] efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;brookings1&quot;/&gt;

United States officials claim that interviews with locals do not provide accurate numbers of civilian casualties because relatives or acquaintances of the dead refuse to state that the victims were involved in militant activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes9&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dilanian|first=Ken|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-drone-strikes-20110222,0,5033756.story|title=CIA drones may be avoiding Pakistani civilians|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=22 February 2011|accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA reportedly passed up three chances to kill militant leaders, including [[Sirajuddin Haqqani]], with drone missiles in 2010 because women and children were nearby. The [[New America Foundation]] believes that between zero and 18 civilians have been killed in drone strikes since 23 August 2010 and that overall civilian casualties have decreased from 25% of the total in prior years to an estimated of 6% in 2010. The Foundation estimates that between 277 and 435 non-combatants have died since 2004, out of 1,374 to 2,189 total deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes9&quot;/&gt;

According to a report of the Islamabad-based Conflict Monitoring Center (CMC), as of 2011 more than 2000 persons have been killed, and most of those deaths were civilians. The CMC termed the CIA drone strikes as an &quot;assassination campaign turning out to be revenge campaign&quot;, and showed that 2010 was the deadliest year so far regarding casualties resulting from drone attacks, with 134 strikes inflicting over 900 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=4731&amp;Cat=13&amp;dt=19 March 2011|title=Army trying to cover up bad deal on Davis|publisher=thenews.com.pk|date=19 March 2011|accessdate=19 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Long War Journal]]'', as of mid-2011, the drone strikes in Pakistan since 2006 had killed 2,018 militants and 138 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Roggio, Bill, and Alexander Mayer, &quot;[http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php Charting the data for US airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004 – 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218080812/http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php |date=18 February 2015 }}&quot;, ''[[Long War Journal]]'', 5 July 2011.

The Foundation stated that 95% of those killed in 2010 were militants and that, as of 2012, 15% of the total people killed by drone strikes were either civilians or unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Economist&quot;/&gt; The foundation also states that in 2012 the rate of civilian and unknown casualties was 2 percent, whereas the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] say the rate of civilian casualties for 2012 is 9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/02/counting_civilian_casualties_in_cia_s_drone_war Counting civilian casualties in CIA's drone war]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}, Foreign Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]], based on extensive research in mid-2011, claims that at least 385 civilians were among the dead, including more than 160 children.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebureauinvestigates.com&quot;/&gt;

The CIA has claimed that the strikes conducted between May 2010 and August 2011 killed over 600 militants and did not result in any civilian fatalities; this assessment has been criticized by [[Bill Roggio]] from the ''Long War Journal'' and other commentators as being unrealistic. Unnamed American officials who spoke to the ''New York Times'' claimed that, as of August 2011, the drone campaign had killed over 2,000 militants and approximately 50 non-combatants.&lt;ref name=&quot;C.I.A. Is Disputed&quot;/&gt;

An independent research site ''Pakistan Body Count'' run by Dr. Zeeshan-ul-hassan, a Fulbright scholar keeping track of all the drone attacks, claims that 2179 civilians were among the dead, and 12.4% children and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistanbodycount.org/drone_attack|title=Drone Attacks in Pakistan|publisher=PakistanBodyCount.org|date=|accessdate=2013-06-09}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]], released 4 February 2012, stated that under the Obama administration (2008–2011) drone strikes killed between 282 and 535 civilians, including 60 children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamb, Christina 2012, page 28&quot;&gt;Lamb, Christina, Chris Woods, and Rahimullah Yusufzai, &quot;Covert CIA Drones Kill Hundreds Of Civilians&quot;, ''[[London Sunday Times]]'', 5 February 2012, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British human rights group [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] filed a case with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], based on [[affidavit]]s by 18 family members of civilians killed in the attacks – many of them children. They are calling on the UNHRC &quot;to condemn the attacks as illegal human rights violations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2012_02_22_PUB_drones_UN_HRC_complaint.pdf |title=COMPLAINT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE KILLING OF INNOCENT CITIZENS OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN |format=PDF |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910131815/http://reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2012_02_22_PUB_drones_UN_HRC_complaint.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2012 [[Associated Press]] investigation found that militants were the main victims of drone strikes in [[North Waziristan]] contrary to the &quot;widespread perception in Pakistan that civilians (...) are the principal victims.&quot; The AP studied 10 drone strikes. Their reporters spoke to about 80 villagers in North Waziristan, and were told that at least 194 people died in the ten attacks. According to the villagers 56 of those were either civilians or tribal police and 138 were militants. Thirty-eight of the civilians died in a single attack on 17 March 2011. Villagers stated that one way to tell if civilians were killed was to observe how many funerals took place after a strike; the bodies of militants were usually taken elsewhere for burial, while civilians were usually buried immediately and locally.&lt;ref&gt;Abbot, Sebastian, [[Associated Press]], [http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/02/26/20120226study-drone-strikes.html &quot;Study: Militants, Not Civilians, Are Primary Victims Of Drone Strikes&quot;], ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', 26 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2012 report by researchers from [[Stanford University]] and [[New York University]] criticized the drone campaign, stating that it was killing a high number of civilians and turning the Pakistani public against the United States. The report, compiled by interviewing witnesses, drone-attack survivors, and others in Pakistan provided by a Pakistani human rights organization, Foundation for Fundamental Rights, concluded that only 2% of drone strike victims are &quot;high-level&quot; militant leaders. The report's authors did not estimate the numbers of total civilian casualties, but suggested that the February 2012 Bureau of Investigative Journalism report was more accurate than the ''Long War Journal'' report (both detailed above) on civilian casualties. The report also opined that the drone attacks were violations of international law, because the US government had not shown that the targets were direct threats to the US.&lt;ref&gt;Zucchino, David, &quot;Study Slams Drone Use In Pakistan&quot;, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 25 September 2012, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The report further noted the US policy of considering all military-age males in a strike zone as militants following the air strike unless exonerating evidence proves otherwise. Media outlets were also urged to cease using the term &quot;militant&quot; when reporting on drone attacks without further explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livingunderdrones.org/ Living under Drones]. ''[[Stanford University]] &amp; [[NYU]].'' Retrieved on 6 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in October 2013, one former drone operator described events suggesting that child casualties may go unrecognized in some mission assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Jethro Mullen|date=23 October 2013|title=Report: Former drone operator shares his inner torment|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/23/us/drone-operator-interview/index.html|accessdate=24 October 2013|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Pakistan's Ministry of Defense stated that 67 civilians had been among the 2,227 people killed in 317 drone strikes since 2008. The Ministry said that the remainder of those killed were Islamic militants.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Declan, &quot;Pakistan cuts its estimate of civilian drone deaths&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'' (International Edition), 1 November 2013, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Research published by [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] in 2014 suggested that U.S. drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan have had an unknown person to target casualty ratio of 28:1 with one attack in the study having a ratio of 128:1 with 13 children being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/24/-sp-us-drone-strikes-kill-1147|title=41 men targeted but 1,147 people killed: US drone strikes – the facts on the ground|author=Spencer Ackerman|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US hostage [[Warren Weinstein]] and [[Italia]]n hostage Giovanni Lo Porto were killed in a January 2015 US-led drone strike on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, as announced by [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] at a [[White House]] press conference on April 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=ADI|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/23/politics/white-house-hostages-killed/|title=President Obama Comments on Death of Hostages|publisher=CNN.com|date=|accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming the Dead==
A UK-based independent group [[The Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] launched a project &quot;Naming the Dead&quot; on 24 September 2013, to prepare list of those individuals (civilians and militants) killed in the strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oldroyd|first=Rachel|date=24 September 2013|title=A new project: Naming the Dead|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/blog/2013/09/24/naming-the-dead/|publisher=[[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]]|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is based on the bureau's two years research and data collection on drone strikes and their casualties. At launch they published names of 550 people killed in those strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=UK-based group releases list of drone victims|url=http://dawn.com/news/1045276/uk-based-group-releases-list-of-drone-victims|date=25 September 2013|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|dawn.com]]|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dedicated website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naming the Dead|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/namingthedead/?lang=en|publisher=[[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]]|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created that will contain the names and bio-data of those who have been reported killed by U.S. drones.

==Pakistan Peace March==
[[Imran Khan]], chairman [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] political party in Pakistan, announced a Peace March to [[South Waziristan]] on 6–7 October 2012 to create global awareness about innocent civilian deaths in US drone attacks. He proposed to take a rally of 100,000 people from [[Islamabad]] to South Waziristan. The South Waziristan administration denied the group permission for the rally on the grounds that they can not provide security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2012/10/02/pti-denied-permission-for-s-waziristan-rally/|title=PTI denied permission for S. Waziristan rally|publisher=Dawn.com|date=2012-10-02|accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but PTI has maintained that they will go ahead with the Peace March. Many International human rights activists and NGOs have shown their support to the Peace March, with former US colonel [[Ann Wright]] and [[Reprieve (organisation)|British NGO Reprieve]] joining the Peace March. [[Pakistani Taliban]] have agreed to not attack the Peace rally and offered to provide security for the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crilly|first=Rob|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9579223/Pakistan-Taliban-offers-Imran-Khan-protection.html|title=Pakistani Taliban offers Imran Khan security|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=2013-06-09|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Two Pakistani novels have been written about U.S. drone attacks on Pakistan, namely: 1) [[Bullets and Train]]; and 2) [[The Scriptwriter]]. Bullets and Train specifically deals with the drone attacks and their aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22814735-bullets-and-train|title=Bullets and Train|author=Adeerus Ghayan|work=Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt; In The Scriptwriter, drone attacks are a part of the central plot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/Scriptwriter-Adeerus-Ghayan-ebook/dp/B00NDOL6SU/ Amazon.com: The Scriptwriter eBook: Adeerus Ghayan: Kindle Store&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
