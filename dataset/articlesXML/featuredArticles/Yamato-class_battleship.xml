The {{Nihongo|'''''Yamato''-class battleships'''|大和型戦艦|Yamato-gata senkan}} were [[battleship]]s of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) constructed and operated during World War II. Displacing {{convert|72000|LT|MT}} at full load, the vessels were the heaviest battleships ever constructed. The class carried the largest [[naval artillery]] ever fitted to a warship, nine [[40 cm/45 Type 94 naval gun|460-millimetre (18.1 in) naval guns]], each capable of firing {{convert|1460|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}} shells over {{convert|42|km|abbr=on}}. Two battleships of the class ({{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}) were completed, while a third ({{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}}) was converted to an [[aircraft carrier]] during construction.

Due to the threat of American submarines and aircraft carriers, both ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' spent the majority of their careers in naval bases at [[Brunei]], [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]]—deploying on several occasions in response to American raids on Japanese bases—before participating in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in October 1944, as part of Admiral Kurita's Centre Force. ''Musashi'' was sunk during the battle by American carrier airplanes. ''Shinano'' was sunk ten days after her commissioning in November 1944 by the submarine {{USS|Archerfish|SS-311|6}}, while ''Yamato'' was sunk by US naval air power in April 1945 during [[Operation Ten-Go|Operation ''Ten-Go'']].

==Background==
The design of the ''Yamato''-class battleships was shaped by expansionist movements within the Japanese government, Japanese industrial power, and the need for a fleet powerful enough to intimidate likely adversaries.&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt;

[[File:1938 Japan Navy battleship.jpg|thumb|left|''Musashi'', August 1942, taken from the bow.]]
After the end of the First World War, many navies—including those of the United States, the United Kingdom, and [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]—continued and expanded construction programs that had begun during the conflict. The enormous costs associated with these programs pressured their government leaders to begin a disarmament conference. On 8 July 1921, the United States' Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] invited delegations from the other major maritime powers—France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom—to come to Washington, D.C. and discuss a possible end to the naval arms race. The subsequent [[Washington Naval Conference]] resulted in the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. Along with many other provisions, it limited all future battleships to a [[displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]] of {{convert|35000|LT|t ST}} and a maximum gun caliber of {{convert|16|in|mm|0}}. It also agreed that the five countries would not construct more capital ships for ten years and would not replace any ship that survived the treaty until it was at least twenty years old.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the Japanese government began a shift towards [[ultranationalist]] militancy.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement called for the expansion of the [[Japanese Empire]] to include much of the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. The maintenance of such an empire—spanning {{convert|3000|mi|km}} from China to [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]]—required a sizable fleet capable of sustained control of territory.&lt;ref&gt;Schom, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Although all of Japan's battleships built prior to the ''Yamato'' class had been completed before 1921—as the Washington Treaty had prevented any more from being completed—all had been either reconstructed or significantly modernized, or both, in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 34; Gardiner and Gray, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; This modernization included, among other things, additional speed and firepower, which the Japanese intended to use to conquer and defend their aspired-to empire.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner and Gray, pp. 229–231, 234&lt;/ref&gt;  When Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 over the [[Mukden Incident]], it also renounced all treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Japan would no longer design battleships within the treaty limitations and was free to build warships larger than those of the other major maritime powers.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's intention to acquire resource-producing colonies in the Pacific and Southeast Asia would likely lead to confrontation with the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Schom, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; thus the U.S. became Japan's primary potential enemy. The U.S. possessed significantly greater industrial power than Japan, with 32.2% of worldwide industrial production compared to Japan's 3.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several leading members of the [[United States Congress]] had pledged &quot;to outbuild Japan three to one in a naval race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Fear is the Real Cause of Navy Treaty End | first = Elliott | last = Thurston | date = 2 January 1935 | work = The Washington Post | page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, as Japanese industrial output could not compete with American industrial power,&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt; Japanese ship designers developed plans for new battleships individually superior to their counterparts in the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these battleships would be capable of engaging multiple enemy capital ships simultaneously, eliminating the need to expend as much industrial effort as the U.S. on battleship construction.&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Musashi,Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The bridge of ''Musashi''.]]
Preliminary studies for a new class of battleships began after Japan's departure from the [[League of Nations]] and its renunciation of the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington]] and [[London Naval Treaty|London]] naval treaties; from 1934 to 1936, 24 initial designs were put forth. These early plans varied greatly in armament, propulsion, endurance, and armor. [[Main battery|Main batteries]] fluctuated between {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, while the secondary armaments were composed of differing numbers of {{convert|155|mm|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns. Propulsion in most of the designs was a hybrid [[diesel engine|diesel]]-[[steam turbine|turbine]] combination, though one relied solely on diesel and another planned for only turbines. Endurance in the designs had, at {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, a low of {{convert|6000|nmi|km|abbr=on}} in design A-140-J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a high of {{convert|9200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} in designs A-140A and A-140-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Armor varied between providing protection from the fire of 406&amp;nbsp;mm guns to enough protection against 460&amp;nbsp;mm guns.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 45–51&lt;/ref&gt;

After these had been reviewed, two of the original twenty-four were finalized as possibilities, A-140-F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and A-140-F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Differing primarily in their range ({{convert|4900|nmi|km|abbr=on}} versus {{convert|7200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}), they were used in the formation of the final preliminary study, which was finished on 20 July 1936. Tweaks to that design resulted in the definitive design of March 1937,&lt;ref name=Garzke49-50&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; which was put forth by Rear-Admiral Fukuda Keiji;&lt;ref name=cfrecord&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Hackett | first1 = Robert | last2 = Kingsepp | first2 = Sander | title = IJN YAMATO: Tabular Record of Movement | url = http://combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | date = 6 June 2006 | accessdate =8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; an endurance of 7,200&amp;nbsp;nm was finally decided upon, and the hybrid diesel-turbine propulsion was abandoned in favor of just turbines. The diesels were removed from the design because of problems with the engines aboard the submarine tender ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūhō|Taigei]]''.&lt;ref name=Garzke49-50/&gt; Their engines, which were similar to the ones that were going to be mounted in the new battleships, required a &quot;major repair and maintenance effort&quot;&lt;ref name=Garzke49&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; to keep them running due to a &quot;fundamental design defect&quot;.&lt;ref name=Garzke49/&gt; In addition, if the engines failed entirely, the {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} armor that protected that area would severely hamper any attempt to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The final design called for a standard displacement of {{convert|64000|LT|t}} and a full-load displacement of {{convert|69988|LT|t}},&lt;ref name=Garzke53&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; making the ships of the class the largest battleships yet designed, and the largest battleships ever constructed. The design called for a main armament of nine {{convert|460|mm|in|1|adj=on}} [[naval guns]], mounted in three, three-gun turrets—each of which weighed more than a 1930s-era destroyer.&lt;ref name=cfrecord/&gt;  The designs were quickly approved by Japanese Naval high command,&lt;ref name=johnston122&gt;Johnston and McAuley, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; over the objections of naval aviators, who argued for the construction of [[aircraft carrier]]s rather than battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Even as far back as 1933, Imperial Japanese Navy aviators, including Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], argued that the best defense against U.S. carrier attacks would be a carrier fleet of their own, not a battleship fleet. However, &quot;when controversy broke into the open, the older, conservative admirals held firm to their traditional faith in the battleship as the capital ship of the fleet by supporting the construction of the&amp;nbsp;...''Yamato''-class superbattleships.&quot; See: Reynolds, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; In all, five ''Yamato''-class battleships were planned.&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt;

==Ships==
[[File:YamatoClassBattleships.jpg|thumb|right|''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' anchored in the waters off of the [[Chuuk State|Truk Islands]] in 1943.]]
Although five ''Yamato''-class vessels had been planned in 1937, only three—two battleships and a converted aircraft carrier—were ever completed. All three vessels were built in extreme secrecy, to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications;&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt; indeed, the United States' [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] only became aware of ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' by name in late 1942. At this early time, their assumptions on the class's specifications were quite far off; while they were correct on their length, the class was given as having a beam of {{convert|110|ft|m}} (in actuality, it was about {{convert|127|ft|m}}) and a displacement of 40,000–57,000 tons (in actuality, 69,000&amp;nbsp;tons). In addition, the main armament of ''Yamato'' class was given as nine {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=on}} guns as late as July 1945, four months after ''Yamato'' was sunk.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston128&gt;Johnston and McAuley, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'' and the Western media also misreported the specifications of the ships. In September 1944, ''Jane's Fighting Ships'' listed the displacement of both ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' as 45,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = U.S. Navy Outnumbers Jap 10 to 1 | work = The Washington Post | first = Richard | last = Tobin | date = 1 October 1944 | page = B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, both the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the [[Associated Press]] reported that the two ships displaced 45,000 tons with a speed of 30 knots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 4 Carriers Sunk | work = The New York Times | first = George | last = Horneby | date = 30 October 1944 | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even after the sinking of ''Yamato'' in April 1945, ''[[The Times]]'' of London continued to give 45,000 tons as the ship's displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Japan's Biggest Warship Sunk |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 9 April 1945 | page = 3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the existence of the ships—and their supposed specifications—heavily influenced American naval engineers in the design of the {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|1}}s, all five of which were to be built to counter the firepower of the ''Yamato'' class.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Puleston, ''The Armed Forces of the Pacific: A Comparison of the Military and Naval Power of the United States and Japan'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1941), pp. 208–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} was ordered in March 1937, [[keel|laid down]] 4 November 1937, [[ship naming and launching|launched]] 8 August 1940, and commissioned 16 December 1941.&lt;ref name=cfrecord/&gt; She underwent training exercises until 27 May 1942, when the vessel was deemed &quot;operable&quot; by Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]].&lt;ref name=cfrecord/&gt; Joining the 1st Battleship Division, ''Yamato'' served as the flagship of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet]] during the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, yet did not engage enemy forces during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  The next two years were spent intermittently between [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Kure]] naval bases, with her sister ship ''Musashi'' replacing ''Yamato'' as flagship of the Combined Fleet.&lt;ref name=cfrecord/&gt;  During this time period, ''Yamato'', as part of the 1st Battleship Division, deployed on multiple occasions to counteract American carrier-raids on Japanese island bases. On 25 December 1943, she suffered major torpedo damage at the hands of {{USS|Skate|SS-305|6}}, and was forced to return to Kure for repairs and structural upgrades.&lt;ref name=cfrecord/&gt;

In 1944—following extensive antiaircraft and secondary battery upgrades—''Yamato'' joined the Second Fleet in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], serving as an escort to a Japanese Carrier Division.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1944, as part of Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force for the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], she used her naval artillery against an enemy vessel for the only time, helping sink the American escort carrier {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73|2}} and the destroyer {{USS|Johnston|DD-557|2}} before she was forced away by torpedoes from {{USS|Heermann|DD-532|2}}, which put her out of combat.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  Lightly damaged at Kure in March 1945, the ship was then rearmed in preparation for operations.&lt;ref name=cfrecord/&gt; ''Yamato'' was sunk 7 April 1945 by 386 American carrier aircraft during [[Operation Ten-Go]], receiving 10 torpedo and 7 bomb hits before capsizing; 2,498 of the 2,700 crew-members were lost, including Vice-Admiral [[Seiichi Itō]].&lt;ref name=Johnston128/&gt; The sinking of ''Yamato'' was seen as a major American victory, and [[Hanson W. Baldwin]], the military editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that &quot;the sinking of the new Japanese battleship ''Yamato''&amp;nbsp;... is striking proof—if any were needed—of the fatal weakness of Japan in the air and at sea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Okinawa's Fate Sealed: Sinking of Yamato Shows Japan's Fatal Air and Sea Weakness | first = Hanson | last = Baldwin | work = The New York Times | date = 9 April 1945 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japanese battleship Musashi cropped.jpg|thumb|right|''Musashi'' departing Brunei in October 1944.]]
{{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} was ordered in March 1937, laid down 29 March 1938, launched 1 November 1940, and commissioned 5 August 1942. From September to December 1942, she was involved in surface and air-combat training exercises at [[Hashirajima]]. On 11 February 1943, ''Musashi'' relieved her sister ship ''Yamato'' as flagship of the Combined Fleet. Until July 1944, ''Musashi'' shifted between the naval bases of Truk, Yokosuka, Brunei, and Kure. On 29 March 1944, she sustained moderate damage near the bow from one torpedo fired by the American submarine {{USS|Tunny|SS-282|2}}. After repairs and refitting throughout April 1944, ''Musashi'' joined the 1st Battleship Division in Okinawa.&lt;ref name=cfrecord2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Hackett | first1 = Robert | last2 = Kingsepp | first2 = Sander | title = IJN MUSASHI: Tabular Record of Movement | url = http://combinedfleet.com/musashi.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | date = 6 June 2006 | accessdate =8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1944, as part of the Second Fleet, the ship escorted Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.&lt;ref name=cfrecord2/&gt;  In October 1944, she left Brunei as part of Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Centre Force during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston and McAuley, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musashi'' was sunk 24 October during the [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], taking 17 bomb and 19 torpedo hits, with the loss of 1,023 of her 2,399-man crew.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Shinano'' ===
{{Main article|Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano}}
[[File:Shinano photo.jpg|thumb|right|''Shinano'' in November 1944.]]
''Shinano'', originally Warship Number 110, was laid down as the third member of the ''Yamato'' class, albeit with a slightly modified design. Most of the original armor values were slightly reduced, including the belt, deck, and turrets. The savings in weight this entailed meant that improvements could be made in other areas, including added protection for fire-control and lookout positions. In addition, the {{convert|12.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} secondary armament on the first two ''Yamato''s was to have been replaced by the {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}/65 caliber [[10 cm/65 Type 98 naval gun|Type 98 gun]]. Although smaller, this gun was superior to the 127&amp;nbsp;mm, possessing a significantly greater [[muzzle velocity]], maximum range, anti-aircraft ceiling and rate of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, following the Japanese defeat at Midway, construction of ''Shinano'' was suspended, and the hull was gradually rebuilt as an aircraft carrier.&lt;ref name=cfrecord3&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Tully | first1 = Anthony P. | title = IJN Shinano: Tabular Record of Movement | url = http://combinedfleet.com/Shinano.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | date = 7 May 2001 | accessdate =8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was designed as a 64,800-ton support vessel that would be capable of ferrying, repairing and replenishing the airfleets of other carriers.&lt;ref name=Reynolds61&gt;Reynolds, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Although she was originally scheduled for commissioning in early 1945,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; the construction of the ship was accelerated after the Battle of the Philippine Sea;&lt;ref name=Reynolds284&gt;Reynolds, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; this resulted in ''Shinano'' being launched on 5 October 1944 and commissioned a little more than a month later on 19 November. ''Shinano'' departed Yokosuka for Kure nine days later. In the early morning on 29 November, ''Shinano'' was hit by four torpedoes from {{USS|Archerfish|SS-311|6}}.&lt;ref name=cfrecord3/&gt; Although the damage seemed manageable, poor flooding control caused the vessel to list to starboard. Shortly before midday, she capsized and sank, taking 1,435 of her 2,400-man crew with her.&lt;ref name=cfrecord3/&gt; To this day, ''Shinano'' is the largest naval vessel to have been sunk by a submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warships Number 111 and 797 ===
Warship Number 111, never named, was planned as the fourth member of the ''Yamato'' class and the second ship to incorporate the improvements of ''Shinano''. The ship's [[keel]] was laid after ''Yamato''{{'}}s launch in August 1940 and construction continued until December 1941, when the Japanese began to question their ambitious [[capital ship]] building program—with the coming of war, the resources essential in constructing the ship would become much harder to obtain. As a result, the hull of the fourth vessel, only about 30% complete, was taken apart and scrapped in 1942; materials from this were used in the conversions of {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Ise||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hyūga||2}} to hybrid [[Ise-class battleship#Conversion to aircraft carriers|battleship/aircraft carriers]].&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston124&gt;Johnston and McAuley, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Although the hull was scrapped, the double bottom was not; later construction of four large submarines took place on top of it. See: Garzke and Dulin, p. 84. Available sources do not report when the double bottom was scrapped.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth vessel, Warship Number 797, was planned as an improved ''Shinano'' but was never laid down. In addition to the modifications made to that ship, 797 would have removed the two {{convert|155|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[wing turret]]s in favor of additional 100&amp;nbsp;mm guns; authors William Garzke and Robert Dulin estimate that this would have allowed for 24 of these weapons. ''Yamato'' was eventually modified in 1944 to something akin to this.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armament ===
[[File:Yamato model AA guns.jpg|thumb|''Yamato''{{'}}s port-side anti-aircraft armament as depicted in the model of the ship at the '[[Yamato Museum]]' in Kure.]]
Although the primary armament of the ''Yamato'' class was officially designated as the 40&amp;nbsp;cm/45 caliber (15.9&amp;nbsp;in) Type 94,&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps 18.1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = Japanese 40 cm/45 (18.1&quot;) Type 94, 46&amp;nbsp;cm/45 (18.1&quot;) Type 94 | url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_18-45_t94.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 23 April 2007| accessdate =23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it actually took the form of nine [[40 cm/45 Type 94|46 cm/45 caliber (18.1 in)]] guns—the largest guns ever fitted to a warship&lt;ref name=johnston123&gt;Johnston and McAuley, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;—mounted in three 3-gun turrets, each of which weighed 2,774 metric tons.&lt;ref name=jackson75&gt;Jackson, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Each gun was {{convert|21.13|m|ft}} long and weighed {{convert|147.3|MT|LT}}.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston and McAuley, p. 123; each of the three main turrets weighed more than a good-sized destroyer.&lt;/ref&gt; High-explosive armour-piercing shells were used which were capable of being fired {{convert|42.0|km|mi}} at a rate of 1½ to 2 per minute.&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps 18.1&quot;/&gt; The main guns were also capable of firing {{convert|1360|kg|lb|abbr=on}} &lt;!--''Sanshiki''--&gt;''[[Beehive (anti-aircraft shell)|3 Shiki tsûjôdan]]'' (&quot;Common Type 3&quot;) anti-aircraft shells.&lt;ref group=A&gt;These shells may have been nicknamed &quot;The Beehive&quot; while in service. See: {{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = Japanese 40 cm/45 (18.1&quot;) Type 94, 46&amp;nbsp;cm/45 (18.1&quot;) Type 94 | url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_18-45_t94.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 23 April 2007| accessdate =23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A time fuze was used to set how far away the shells would explode (although they were commonly set to go off {{convert|1000|m|yd}} away). Upon detonation, each of these shells would release 900 incendiary-filled tubes in a 20° cone facing towards incoming aircraft; a bursting charge was then used to explode the shell itself so that more steel splinters were created, and then the tubes would ignite. The tubes would burn for five seconds at about {{convert|3000|C|F|abbr=on}} and would start a flame that was around {{convert|5|m|ft}} long. Even though they comprised 40% of the total main ammunition load by 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps 18.1&quot;/&gt; ''3 Shiki tsûjôdan'' were rarely used in combat against enemy aircraft due to the severe damage the firing of these shells inflicted on the barrels of the main guns;&lt;ref name=steinberg54/&gt; indeed, one of the shells may have exploded early and disabled one of ''Musashi''{{'}}s guns during the [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps 18.1&quot;/&gt;  The shells were intended to put up a [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]] of flame that any aircraft attempting to attack would have to navigate through. However, U.S. pilots considered these shells to be more of a pyrotechnics display than a competent anti-aircraft weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps 18.1&quot;/&gt;

In the original design, the ''Yamato'' class' secondary armament comprised twelve [[15.5 cm/60 3rd Year Type naval gun|15.5 cm/60 Type 3]] guns mounted in four triple turrets (one forward, one aft, two midships),&lt;ref name=jackson75/&gt; and twelve [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|12.7 cm/40 Type 89]] guns in six double-turrets (three on each side amidships).&lt;ref name=jackson75/&gt; These had become available once the ''Mogami''-class cruisers were rearmed with [[20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun|{{convert|20.3|cm|adj=on}}]] guns.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; With a {{convert|55.87|kg|sp=uk|adj=on}} AP shell, the guns had a maximum range of {{convert|27400|m|yd|sp=uk}} at an elevation of 45 degrees. Their rate of fire was five rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 187–88&lt;/ref&gt; The two midships turrets were removed in 1944 in favor of additional {{convert|25|mm|in|adj=on}} light anti-aircraft guns.

Heavy [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defence]] was provided by a dozen 40-calibre [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|127-millimetre Type 89]] [[dual-purpose gun]]s in six twin turrets, three on each side of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of {{convert|14700|m|yd|sp=uk}}; they had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|9440|m|ft}} at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute; their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 192–93&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the ''Yamato'' class originally carried twenty-four [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25 mm Type 96]] anti-aircraft guns, primarily mounted amidships.&lt;ref name=jackson75/&gt; In 1944, both ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' underwent significant anti-aircraft upgrades in preparation for operations in Leyte Gulf&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson128&quot;/&gt; using the space freed up by the removal of both midships {{convert|15.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}  secondary battery turrets,&lt;ref name=johnston180&gt;Johnston and McAuley, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; and ended up with a complement of twenty-four {{convert|12.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns,&lt;ref name=johnston180/&gt; and one hundred and sixty-two {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} antiaircraft guns,&lt;ref name=johnston180/&gt; The 25&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns could tilt at 90-degree angles to aim at planes directly overhead, but their mountings' lack of protection made their gunnery crews extremely vulnerable to direct enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battleshipyamato.info/weapons.html]&lt;/ref&gt; These {{convert|25|mm|in|adj=on}} guns had an effective range of {{convert|1500|-|3000|m|yd|sp=uk}}, and an effective ceiling of {{convert|5500|m|ft}} at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II; it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and&amp;nbsp;... the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;.&lt;ref name=stille11&gt;Stille, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was also provided with two twin mounts for the licence-built [[13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun|13.2&amp;nbsp;mm Type 93]] anti-aircraft [[machine gun]]s, one on each side of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. The maximum range of these guns was {{convert|6500|m|yd}}, but the effective range against aircraft was only {{convert|1000|m|yd}}. The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute; the need to change 30-round [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]] reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The armament on ''Shinano'' was quite different from that of her sister vessels due to her conversion. As the carrier was designed for a support role, significant anti-aircraft weaponry was installed on the vessel: sixteen {{convert|12.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns,&lt;ref name=cfshinano&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Tully | first1 = Anthony P. | title = Shinano | url = http://combinedfleet.com/ship.php?q=shinan_c.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | accessdate =13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; one hundred and twenty-five {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft guns,&lt;ref name=cfshinano/&gt; and three hundred and thirty-six {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} anti-aircraft rocket launchers in twelve twenty-eight barrel turrets.&lt;ref name=preston84&gt;Preston, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; None of these guns were ever used against an enemy vessel or aircraft.&lt;ref name=preston84/&gt;

=== Armour ===
{{further information|Belt armor}}
[[Image:Yamato-armorsheme-DE - magazines cut.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Protection schematics of the class at the rear turret. Here is [[:Image:Yamato-armorsheme-DE.svg|another cut]] amidships.]]
Designed to engage multiple enemy battleships simultaneously,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schom, p. 270&quot;&gt;Schom, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Yamato''s were fitted with heavy armour plating described by naval historian Mark Stille as providing &quot;an unparalleled degree of protection in surface combat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stille, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The main belt of armour along the side of the vessel was {{convert|410|mm|in}} thick,&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt; with transverse bulkheads of the armoured citadel {{convert|355|mm|in}} thick.&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt; Furthermore, the top hull shape was very advanced, the peculiar sideways curving effectively maximizing armor protection and structural rigidity while optimizing weight. The armour on the main-turrets surpassed even that of the main-belt, with plating {{convert|650|mm|in}} thick.&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt; Armour plates in both the main belt and main turrets was made of Vickers Hardened, which was a face-hardened steel armor.&lt;ref name=Garzke96&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Main armoured deck—{{convert|200|mm|in}} thick—was composed of a nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy. Ballistics tests at the proving ground at Kamegabuki demonstrated the deck alloy to be superior to the homogeneous Vickers plates by 10–15%.&lt;ref name=Garzke96/&gt; Additional plating was designed by manipulating the chromium and nickel composition of the alloy. Higher contents of nickel allowed the plate to be rolled and bent without developing fracture properties.&lt;ref name=Garzke96/&gt; For underwater protection, the multi-layered torpedo defense system is designed to withstand {{convert|400|kg|lb}} TNT charge.&lt;ref name=USNTMJ&gt;http://www.fischer-tropsch.org/primary_documents/gvt_reports/USNAVY/USNTMJ%20Reports/USNTMJ-200H-0745-0786%20Report%20S-06-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively new procedure of [[arc welding]] was used extensively throughout the ship, strengthening the durability of the armour plating.&lt;ref name=fitzsimons2609&gt;Fitzsimons, Volume 24, p. 2609&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, the lower-side [[belt armour]], included in the ships as a response to gunnery experiments upon {{ship|Japanese battleship|Tosa||2}} and the new Japanese Type 91 shell which could travel great lengths underwater,&lt;ref name=Garzke94&gt;Garzke and Dulin, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; was used to strengthen the hull structure of the entire vessel.&lt;ref name=fitzsimons2609/&gt; In total, the vessels of the ''Yamato'' class contained 1,147 watertight compartments,&lt;ref name=fitzsimons2609/&gt; of which 1,065 were beneath the armoured deck.&lt;ref name=fitzsimons2609/&gt; The ships were also designed with a very large amount of reserve buoyancy to mitigate the effects of flooding.

However, the armour of the ''Yamato'' class still suffered from several major design flaws and shortcomings, many of which would prove fatal in 1944–45.&lt;ref name=underwaterarmour&gt;{{cite web | title = Best Battleship: Underwater Protection | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_underw.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | accessdate =25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The torpedo defense system performed worse than designed; in particular, very poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armour created a weak-point just below the waterline, causing the class to be susceptible to air-dropped torpedoes.&lt;ref name=steinberg54/&gt;&lt;ref name=USNTMJ/&gt; Other structural weaknesses existed near the bow of the vessels, where the armour plating was generally thinner.&lt;ref name=steinberg54&gt;Steinberg, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The hull of the ''Shinano'' was subject to even greater structural weaknesses, having been equipped with incomplete armour and no watertight compartments at the time of her sinking.&lt;ref name=cfshinano/&gt;

=== Propulsion ===
The ''Yamato'' class was fitted with 12 Kanpon Boilers, which powered quadruple [[steam turbine]]s.&lt;ref name=jackson74&gt;Jackson, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  These, in turn, drove four {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} propellers. This powerplant enabled the ''Yamato'' class to achieve a top speed of {{convert|27|knots|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt;  With an indicated horsepower of 147,948 ({{convert|147948|ihp|kW|disp=output only|abbr=on}}),&lt;ref name=johnston123/&gt; the ''Yamato'' class' ability to function alongside fast carriers was limited. In addition, the fuel consumption rate of both battleships was very high.&lt;ref name=jackson128&gt;Jackson, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, neither battleship was used in combat during the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] or the minor battles during the &quot;island hopping&quot; period of 1943 and early 1944.&lt;ref name=jackson128/&gt;  The propulsion system of ''Shinano'' was slightly improved, allowing the carrier to achieve a top speed of {{convert|28|knots|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=preston84/&gt;

== &quot;Super ''Yamato''&quot;-class battleships ==
{{Main article|Design A-150 battleship}}
Two battleships of an entirely new, and larger, design were planned as a part of the 1942 fleet replenishment program. Designated as Design A-150 and initially named Warship Number 178 and Warship Number 179, plans for the ships began soon after the design of the ''Yamato'' class was finished, probably in 1938–39. Everything was &quot;essentially completed&quot; sometime in 1941, but with war on the horizon, work on the battleships was halted to fill a need for additional warships, such as aircraft carriers and cruisers, to replace war losses of those vital ships. The Japanese loss in the [[Battle of Midway]], where four carriers were sunk (out of ten, to date, in the entire navy), made it certain that work on the ships would never begin. In the third volume of their ''Battleships'' series, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II'', the authors William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin asserted that these ships would have been the &quot;most powerful battleships in history&quot; because of their massive {{convert|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[main battery]] and extensive anti-aircraft weaponry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;&gt;Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garzke&gt;Garzake and Dulin, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the fate of papers relating to the ''Yamato'' class, most papers and all plans relating to the class were destroyed to prevent capture at the end of the war. It is known that the final design of the ships would have had an even greater firepower and size than the ''Yamato'' class—a main battery of six {{convert|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns in three twin turrets and secondary dual purpose armament consisting of twenty-four {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} dual mounted guns (similar to the {{sclass-|Akizuki|destroyer|1}}s). The [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was to be bigger than the ''Yamato''{{'}}s, and a side [[Belt armor|armor belt]] of {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} was planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garzke/&gt;

==Destruction of records==
[[File:Yamato1945.png|200px|left|thumb|A drawing of ''Yamato'', depicting her appearance circa 1945.]]
On the eve of the Allies' [[occupation of Japan]], special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the ''Yamato''-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' were those taken by [[United States Navy]] aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the ''Yamato'' class somewhat difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Muir | first = Malcolm | title = Rearming in a Vacuum: United States Navy Intelligence and the Japanese Capital Ship Threat, 1936–1945 | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 54 | issue = 4 |date=October 1990 | page = 485 | publisher = Society for Military History | issn = 1543-7795 | oclc = 37032245  | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/1986067#journalInfo | format = [[JSTOR]] access required | accessdate =7 March 2008 | doi=10.2307/1986067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skulski, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Warships of the World |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 5 November 1948 | page = 2D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in October 1942, based upon a special request from [[Adolf Hitler]], German Admiral [[Paul Wenneker]], attached to the German Naval Attache in Japan, was allowed to inspect a ''Yamato''-class battleship while it was undergoing maintenance in a dockyard, at which time Admiral Wenneker cabled a detailed description of the warship to Berlin. On 22 August 1943, Erich Groner, a German naval historian, and author of the book ''Die Deutschen Kriegschiffe, 1815–1945'', was shown the report while at the &quot;[[Führer Headquarters]]&quot;, and was directed to make an &quot;interpretation&quot; and then prepare a &quot;design sketch drawing&quot; of the Japanese battleship. The material was preserved by Erich Groner's wife, Mrs. H. Groner, and submitted to publishers in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jentschura p. 8 (not numbered; Preface)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
[[File:YAMATO　Moder.JPG|thumb| Visitors to the [[Yamato Museum]] examine the museum's 1:10 scale model of the battleship in 2006.]]
From the time of their construction until the present day, ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' have carried a notable presence in Japanese culture, ''Yamato'' in particular. Upon completion, the battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering. In addition, the two ships, due to their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the western powers, especially the United States. [[Shigeru Fukudome]], chief of the Operations Section of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], described the two ships as &quot;symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Peattie, pp. 298, 378&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yamato'', and especially the story of her sinking, has appeared often in [[Japanese popular culture]], such as the [[anime]] ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' and the 2005 film [[Yamato (film)|''Yamato'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appearances in popular culture usually portray the ship's last mission as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One of the reasons that the warship may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word &quot;Yamato&quot; was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship ''Yamato'' could serve as a metaphor for the end of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida and Minear, p. xvii; Evans and Peattie, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skulski, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
