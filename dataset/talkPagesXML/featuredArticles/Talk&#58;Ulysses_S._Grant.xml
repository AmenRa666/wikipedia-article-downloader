==&quot;Hero of Appomattox&quot;==
{{ec}} Regarding Cm's recent edit of Sept.21 ''':''' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ulysses_S._Grant&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=740515225&amp;oldid=740449286 ''Grant was lauded as the the Civil War &quot;Hero of Appomattox&quot; and given an unofficial ambassador status''], I'm not seeing any mention of &quot;the hero of Appomattox&quot; in Campbell, 2016, pp 2-3. Also, as the sentence is written it implies that  &quot;Appomattox&quot; had something definitive to do with Grant being a &quot;unofficial ambassador&quot;. Pages 2-3 relate Jesse's account of Grant's involvement, but doesn't go as far to say that he was an &quot;unofficial ambassador&quot;. Also, the source merely mentions that Grant's involvement in Britain was reported to the US gov, the source doesn't even imply that he was &quot;lauded&quot; as a hero, even though we know he was. We might want to align the statement with the source a bit more and rephrase the sentence. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 17:35, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
:Cambell was saying Europeans admired Grant's generalship during the American Civil War. His nickname is ''Hero of Appomatax''. He got better treatment then U.S. ministers and he was talking freely with heads of state like a modern President. He stopped war between Japan and China. I did not say Grant was an unofficial ambassador  but he had unofficial ambassador status. He talked with heads of states and dined with the Queen of England. There was no official title for Grant but he reprented the United States. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 02:31, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
::I rewrote the sentence and replaced Cambell with Smith reference.
:::I don't see on Smith p. 608 where &quot;unofficial ambassador status&quot; is mentioned, only that Grant was treated with respect by foreign leaders. I agree with Gwillhickers that the sentence is awkward. Not sure it adds anything that wasn't already there. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 06:01, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
::::Campbell on page 3 says President Hayes recognized Grant as a &quot;special ambassador&quot;. Smith on page 608 says Grant was &quot;accorded every honor imagninable&quot; linking his status that that of an ambassador. Maybe there is a better way of saying this by definately Grant got special treatment. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 15:50, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::Instead of trying to characterize it, I think it's best to tell the facts: that Grant was received by various heads of state and government. That already tells us he got respectful treatment far beyond that accorded the ordinary tourist, even though he held no office. That's also what we already do in that section! I have no objection to the other stuff sourced to Campbell--they were good additions--but this sentence adds nothing but unnecessary confusion. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 16:04, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::I removed the word &quot;ambassador&quot; from the section and replaced by given &quot;special honors&quot; from various heads of state. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 18:09, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::Better, but I still think it's unnecessary. Why say he was honored by heads of state and then list all the heads of state who honored him, beginning in the very next sentence? It's repetitive. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 18:43, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::I can remove that part. I sill believe the section needs tightening up. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 19:22, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::I agree. I'll see what I can condense. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 21:52, 22 September 2016 (UTC)

== World tour and ambassador section ==

I am not sure it is clear as to where Grant traveled and the dates of Grant's travels around the world. This may be confusing to the reader. Should all countries Grant traveled through be mentioned ? Should a new article be created on Grant's world travels and more on his diplomatic mission? President [[Rutherford B. Hayes|Hayes]] recognized Grant as an unofficial international U.S. Ambassador. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 17:15, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
:I think his itinerary is perfectly clear for the summary given here, but if you want to expand it in [[Post-presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]], I don't think anyone would object. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 05:56, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
:::It is not ''perfectly clear'' because all the countries Grant visited are not listed. I think the whole subject needs a seperate article. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 15:55, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
::::If you want to make one, have at it. You don't need consensus here for that, I don't think. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 16:05, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
:::That is another subject. It still is not clear concerning Grant's tour where he went and whom he met in this article. I have yet to find a map that shows Grant's tour around the world. For example he went to Ireland before leaving to the East. He was allowed to ride on U.S. naval ships and he received authorization to go to China from Hayes's Secretary of State. Hayes was keeping track of Grant's movements. This section seems to written in a peice meal fashion. I would have to find a book that gives Grant's entire world tour to get clarification on Grant's impact on diplomacy around the world. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 18:07, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
I believe these sources can offer better understanding on the extent of Grant's travels and his itinerary. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 18:25, 22 September 2016 (UTC)

::::::::Nice find! The author, [[John Russell Young]], accompanied Grant during his trip around the world, so I guess this makes these primary sources, but still very useful for citing the general and established issues. I'll go ahead and add these to the [[Bibliography of Ulysses S. Grant]]. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:02, 23 September 2016 (UTC)
:::I think they make up good back up sources especially where Grant went. The terminology and possible name of countries Grant traveled through are probably outdated. The current book by Campbell 2016 is best but I don't have a copy of the book. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 20:38, 23 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::This might add some perspective. Lyndon B. Johnson was the first sitting President to travel around the world in 1967, 88 years after Grant went around the world. Grant was ahead of 20th Century Presidents. [[List of international trips made by the President of the United States]] [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 20:47, 23 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::Just noticed something odd. Grant returned from his world tour on December 16, 1879. With only a couple of weeks remaining in that year I'm wondering how Young was able to write, edit and publish a two volume account with a publishing date also of 1879. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 01:45, 24 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::There wasn't a great deal of editing or fact-checking in those days. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 14:39, 24 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::::*It would seem no era was anymore better than the other in that regard. What about Grant's Memoirs, or [[Ulysses S. Grant#Biographical and political|Badeau, 1887]]? Imo, there was more attention and importance given to the historical issues that effected the lives of millions, rather than to social issues that are often presented with many of the facts missing, so as not to undermine the modern day conjecture/indignation [[Presentism|typical]] among various authors today. 'Jefferson the monster' is the product of 'modern day' analysis. As I've always maintained, sources should be judged on a per source basis. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 16:59, 24 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::::*The [[Ulysses S. Grant#World tour and diplomacy|''World tour and diplomacy'']] section doesn't say much about Grant's visit to Japan. Some of the basic stuff even. e.g.Grant stayed with the Emperor at his palace. Our article only says that Grant declined an interview with the Emperor. In Young's two volume account, the one subject of Japan takes up about a third of Vol.2 and covers this topic well. The section also doesn't mention the grand farewell celebration that was extended to Grant before he departed Japan. I'm not saying we should include mention  of these two topics simply because Young covers them well, but only because they're among the most notable events in Grant's world tour.  -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:04, 24 September 2016 (UTC)
{{od}}I agree with CmGuy's statement in the section above that the world tour section needs tightening, not loosening, but those facts would certainly be interesting in the proposed sub-article. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 13:04, 25 September 2016 (UTC)
:::My definition for tightening up means to say the most with the least words and historical accuracy. The Young book is a source for the chronology of Grant's travels and the places where Grant traveled to. Russell apparently gives all the places Grant traveled to. How he got the book published so fast is beyond me. I believe Coemgenus is correct of not fact checking. Actually Grant returned to the U.S. in September 1879 at San Francisco. The new book by Cambell 2016 is the best source for historical accuracy. Grant's world really does not exist anymore especially after WWI and WWII. I did not want to expand the section but to make it historically accurate. I put in the photo of Bismarck because I thought he was the most powerful person in Europe at the time. I apprciate Coemgenus agreeing with me. Additional information, Gwillhickers, in this case needs to be in a seperate article. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 15:55, 25 September 2016 (UTC)
::::* Accuracy. History is no place for prejudice. We can not judge the accuracy of any publication simply by the time period it was published. With all the omissions of fact and the distortions that come out of various modern publications, maintaining a one side and broad-brushed opinion about older publications is sort of ridiculous. There may be a simple explanation about how Young's book came to be published the same year Grant returned home. Cm' you said this source would offer &quot;better understanding on the extent of Grant's travels and his itinerary.&quot; What did you have in mind? Anything besides truncating some of the text?
::::*After condensing the section as you said, it would be appropriate to mention that Grant left Japan after the Grand celebration that was held in his honor, no doubt extended in great part for Grant's role in averting a war. This would fall nicely into place thusly: Proposed mention in bold:

::::::''Grant convinced China to accept the Japanese annexation of the islands, and the two nations&lt;br&gt;avoided war. '''Grant was given a grand farewell celebration and departed Japan in September 1779.'''''&lt;br&gt;-- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:46, 25 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::Gwillhickers. The Young book gives information on the places Grant traveled and gives the chronology of countries Grant visited. That is what I mean by historical accuracy. For example Grant went to the Netherlands before visiting Germany. We can't put every nation or place Grant visited to save space. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 22:01, 25 September 2016 (UTC)
:::You offered Young's book for &quot;better understanding&quot; of the topic, not just as a chronological reference. No one said anything about including 'everything', however we should cover the major and significant events. Brands says after staying with Hamilton Fish in New York for two months Grant departed from Philadelphia. The section mentions that England gave Grant a major send off -- and he didn't avert any war for them -- so we should also mention that a greatful Japan honored Grant with a major farewell celebration. Most readers interested in Grant would welcome brief mention of this major episode in Grant's visit to Japan. Let's give the readers a comprehensive narrative, not just a time line in paragraph form. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 22:56, 25 September 2016 (UTC)
:::::In this case I believe a &quot;comprehensive narrative&quot; would be needed in a seperate article. Campbell (2016) is the best source for this. In my opinion McFeely's 1981 negative view of Grant set research back on Grant for decades. Historians are starting to appreciate Grant's Presidency and his World Tour more. The modern research on Grant really began with Bruce Catton, who took a positive view of Grant in the 1960s, at least on his Civil War service. Grant's popularity in Europe was due to his successes as a General. Now Campbell (2016) is studying Grant's world wide tour and diplomacy unprecendented for an ex President. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 05:19, 26 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::Well, every section, no matter how short, should be in narrative form, and not merely presented as a timeline or a sting of events and dates, and should mention all the major events. Even outlines and timelines include these. Grant was the personal guests of the Emperor and Prince Dati. Grant prepared and read a farewell speech for them, as did they for him. Something he didn't do for any of his other hosts. Along with other U.S. fellow statesmen and officers, the U.S.Army band was present at this major event. Grant's stay in Japan was the longest and most involved, yet has the shortest coverage, one sentence, in the section. Even with a main article, this event should get more priority. We should at least mention Grant was given a farewell celebration by a greatful Japan, in so many words, following the statement about averting war. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 16:44, 26 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::::Even the &quot;avoided war&quot; bit is kind of an exaggeration. There was no war, true, but not because there was a peaceful resolution. Japan annexed he Ryukyus and China was too weak to do anything about it. (See [[History of the Ryukyu Islands]].) --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 17:08, 26 September 2016 (UTC)
:::Grant through diplomacy gave a &quot;cover&quot; for China not to respond even though Japan was the militarily stronger nation. But we might be forgetting that this was all new, an ex President in Japan and China, involved in their foreign policy. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 19:28, 26 September 2016 (UTC)

==Clarity==
The [[Ulysses S. Grant#World tour and diplomacy|''World tour and diplomacy'']] section says that Grant's trip around the world began in Liverpool, England. Obviously this isn't correct. It was the first stop during the tour, but it didn't begin there, so I clarified that point. Also, the section doesn't mention the point of departure, in the U.S., nor the date, or anything about the ceremonies that occurred before the Grants departed the U.S. Basic stuff. Along with any trimming, we should spend just as much effort on checking to see what else may need to be included. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:57, 25 September 2016 (UTC)
:::Grant left Philadelphia on May 16, 1877. He returned to Philadelphia December 16, 1879. He was gone for 2 years and seven months.

==Content for world tour==
*According to Brands, 2012, p. 593, reactionaries in Japan opposed to Grant's presence and the idea of Westernization, were plotting his assassination. Seems this should be mentioned also.

*I'm wondering about Grant's thoughts about visiting England. During the Civil War Britain supplied the Confederacy with the greater bulk of their firearms and other ordnance, received cotton shipments and other goods from them and had built specially designed ships for the purpose of [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade running]] and trading with Grant's arch enemy. It can easily be assumed that England was among those who were fundamental in prolonging the war. Yet when Grant arrives there everything was rosy and cheery, apparently. Of course the British Crown's position was that they were not involved, but at the same time they couldn't have been blind to the capacity and duration of this operation, trading with the Union's enemy. Odd. I don't know of any sources that cover Grant's feelings toward England in this regard, so of course we can't be adding anything about this idea, but it seems if there are sources (I'm searching) it would deserve mention along with the other items that remain missing in our somewhat incomplete account of Grant's tour. Someday, if someone actually creates a dedicated article for the tour, these items should be mentioned so we don't leave the inquisitive reader wondering.-- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 17:47, 30 September 2016 (UTC)
**Yes, if you guys create [[World tour of Ulysses S. Grant]] or whatever, that would certainly be an interesting topic to explore, assuming there are sources that cover it. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 21:04, 30 September 2016 (UTC)
:::I'm certainly tempted to click on that red link but would only do so if I was going to see the article to near completion within a seven day period for DYK purposes. A draft page, presumably in someone's sandbox, would probably be called for. I'm not ready to commit to that at this juncture. In any case, I've done a cursory search for dedicated works on Grant's tour and can only find Young, 1879, and Remlap, 1879, both linked here on the talk page. It's too bad Grant didn't cover the tour in his Memoirs. Had he the time he may have wrote perhaps the best account about the journey. Grant's tour presents a cross section view of the political world and attitude toward the United States in 1877, etc. and covered this way very nicely by both Young and Remlap. So far I haven't seen any modern sources that cover the tour with the same depth as did these two. In any case, a well done article on this subject would offer many dozens of links to other historical figures, places and events, and in turn would provide these (many) articles with links to Grant's [[World tour of Ulysses S. Grant|Tour]] and Biography, if not there already. Along with a DYK presentation the proposed article would no doubt result in a significant and permanent increase in views to the Grant biography itself.

:::On the title I would say ''World Tour and Diplomacy of Ulysses S. Grant''. Modern research tends to concentrate on his diplomacy representing the United States to contemporary world leaders. White (2016) calls him an &quot;''American Ambassador''&quot;. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 05:39, 4 October 2016 (UTC)
:::::Grant was warmly recieved in England for three reasons. He was the victor of the Civil War. Hamilton Fish foreign policy establishing England as an allie by the 1871 Treaty of Washington that peacefully resolved the Alabama Claims. The Minister to England was a Grant's former Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont who specialized in international law. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 05:46, 4 October 2016 (UTC)
:::::::Yes, during Grant's presidency Hamilton Fish was handling damage control with England, given its prolonged and profitable involvement with the Confederacy. While Grant was in England he no doubt had to remain silent on a number of issues, but, American relations with the other worldly power took precedence, and so Grant, like everyone else, smiled and ate cake. Upon his arrival to England Grant commented to wife Julia that he found the extent in which England went to receive his arrival odd, and that all the American flags and celebrations about the harbor were really aimed at appeasing the existing American government, of which Grant was no longer a part of. Grant functioned as a diplomat only in a couple of instances. If and when, we should simply use the [[World tour of Ulysses S. Grant|proposed title]]. Adding ''diplomacy'' to the title is undue, and suggests that Grant was acting in some sort of offical capacity. Using the term also suggests that the tour was intended to be a diplomatic mission. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 22:38, 6 October 2016 (UTC)

For example, on p.499 he mentions that Grant had urged China and Japan to come to the United States for anything they needed, and not the &quot;strong European powers&quot;. It would seem England must have been foremost in his mind when he made that comment. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 23:10, 6 October 2016 (UTC)
::::::::In my opinion it is best to focus on the modern research by Cambell (2016). The McFeely (2002) is actually his McFeely (1981) book on Grant.

::Cites to modern sources should be employed whenever possible. However, from what I've seen, most biographers and others only treat the tour with passing reference to the main events. Is that all we should do here? I haven't seen any source, including Brands and Mcfeely, that commit anymore than a few pages to this rather long and eventful chapter in Grant's life. Understandbly, most authors on Grant concentrate their coverage on his involvement in the Civil War and his presidency. I suppose it's sort of difficult to get up steam for writing about the peaceful tour when you've just finished writing about Appomatox or some such. If the modern sources don't cover the tour with much depth then it begs the question of whether we should do so and commit a separate article to the topic. If we're only going to reflect what the modern research says then why bother with the dedicated article? Modern research seems to ignore the topic comparatively. Only a couple of older sources cover the topic in real depth. A dedicated article I would hope cover the subject, not more than Young and Remlap have, but certainly more than e.g.Mcfeely has. As mentioned, Young was a renowned reporter and author who was asked by the Grants to accompany them and chronicle the events during the tour. His account, while offering an abundance of interesting details, is unique and almost entirely factual and chronological. Both Young and Remlap offer an abundance of chronological and eventful knowledge. They should be among the most cited sources if the article is ever launched. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:26, 8 October 2016 (UTC)
:::The modern focus and research on Grant, White (2016) and Campbell (2016), focuses on Grant's ex-Presidential diplomacy. That is what the article should focus on. White (2016) even calls Grant and &quot;ambassador&quot;. Campbell (2016) is just as valid just as much as McFeely (1981) (2002). [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 02:50, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
::::I can see a strong case for a separate article. The tour put America on the world map--for the first time major leaders in many nations in Europe, Asia etc got to know personally a top American leader in both politics and military. It was very rare for any top European leader to have ever visited USA or to meet anyone other than the US ambassador. Thousands of American admirers of Grant who snapped up Grant materials like his memoirs followed his travels and learned about Europe &amp; Asia.  In reviewing Young's ''Around the World with General Grant'' edited by Fellman in 2002, Waugh in ''Civil War History'' (Dec 2003) states: ''&quot;Young's dispatches for the Tribune chronicled the triumphant receptions for General Grant, first in England, then continuing in France, Switzerland, Denmark, Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia, Holland, Spain, and Portugal....his immense reputation and the backing of the U.S. government ensured him entry and access to the highest circles in every country.... Greeted everywhere with rapturous crowds, reviews, parades, and speeches, the widely admired Grant and his adoring wife were wined and dined by kings and queens, generals and prime ministers, chancellors and potentates.... Grant performed diplomatic duties, with good results. Readers who are expecting to find the stereotype of the apolitical, even ignorant general will be disappointed as Grant exhibits a mastery of the geopolitical situation.&quot;'' So yes let's give full coverage.

::::::The proposed article has great potential. Though most of modern research has largely covered the tour only in a cursory capacity, the subject regardless inherently offers a variety of insights into the social and political state of the world in relation to the United States at that time in Grant's later life and merits good coverage here at WP. While not an official diplomat, Grant, from my gathering, had a natural appeal, opened many doors and was fundamental in putting the United States 'on the map', much to the dismay of various European entities, sipping tea. While the modern sources are welcomed the article should not be constrained by any lack of depthness they only offer. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 07:12, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
:::The biographers probably could not have expanded on Grant's World tour because of editorial constraint, however, since McFeely (1981), Smith (2001), Brands (2012), and White (2016) all discuss his tour, that shows it is signifigant. Rjensen is right. The new research is that Grant is a diplomat or ambassador for the United States. What tourist has dinner with the queen of England or a conversation with Bismark. It is not &quot;sipping tea&quot;, it is who he is &quot;sipping tea&quot; with. Young wrote two books on Grant's diplomatic tour. Cambell (2016) wrote a book and Grant's diplomatic tour. As an ex President Grant, during his 1877 to 1879 tour, was doing what LBJ did during his 1967 world tour; that is diplomacy. I think that is why there is renewed interest in his tour and full article on the tour is appropriate. I agree with Rjensen.

He acted as a diplomat only in a couple of instances to speak of, and as such a title for the proposed article should be simple. In any case we should certainly cover Grant's diplomatic involvements, such that they were, and relate them to the given country's political relationship with the U.S. Don't recall anyone saying we shouldn't do this so I'm not sure what you mean when you say you agree with Rjensen only. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:11, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
::::::::I agree with Rjensen that this should be a seperate article. Modern research is focusing on the diplomatic efforts of Grant on his world tour. Rjensen mentions his immense popularity and dimplomatic duties. Grant put the U.S. on the world map. That is why &quot;diplomacy&quot; should be mentioned in the title. President Hayes knew of Grant's efforts and authorized him to travel around the world to India and Asia. This was both a public-private venture.

Modern research, along with Young and Remlap, have expounded on Grant's quasi diplomatic involvements, naturally, as these events certainly have historical significance, events we should cover well, so I'm inclined to agree that 'diplomat' belongs in the title. However, for reasons expressed above, we should keep the article title simple. Grant did not set out on a diplomatic mission. His tour simply came into this adventure in a happenstance fashion, much to his dismay sometimes. Again, Grant expressed to wife Julia that he felt his reception to his arrival to English shores was a bit pomp. Imo, article titles should be simple. We can emphasize Grant's unofficial diplomatic capacity in the lede and cover such involvements within the context of his tour. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 06:44, 11 October 2016 (UTC)

Well, I like to think that most of the history on Grant has been covered and that the established facts have already been presented as such. Let's not assume that a new source is any better simply because it's the newest. I've only read a handful of pages of White's book, on line, where viewable, so I can't say whether his book has presented hitherto unknown new facts that have significantly changed the biographical landscape on Grant. I am assuming at this point that White's book is par with the other established sources, yet welcome anything new it may have to offer, even new opinion, to a certain extent. We should also be mindful of placing too much weight on any one source, regardless if it may be the newest.

:Gwillhickers, you're right, it doesn't suggest anything new as far as the basic facts of Grant's life. The major departure is in interpretation, and we should certainly add a line to the historical reputation section. I can't think of anything that White wrote that would require significant changes to the main body of the article, though. And I agree with you that newer isn't always better.

And we don't know if all of White's 'new' facts haven't been covered by other historians, and there are many. For example, many details are found in Young's works ([https://archive.org/details/aroundworldwith01youngoog '''1'''], [https://archive.org/details/aroundworldwith03youngoog '''2''']) not found in most modern sources. e.g.Does White cover, or even mention, the assassination plot on Grant by Japanese hardliners while he was in Japan? Does he mention Grant's comments to his wife about the less than sincere political pomp he was greeted with upon his arrival to Liverpool? What does he have to say about Grant's feelings about visiting a country that supplied the Confederacy and reaped the fruits of slavery before and during the Civil War?

Grant had 'instructions'? This would suggest that Grant was ordered, was acting in an official capacity and that his tour was largely prompted by this prospect. Politics being what it was (and is) we can assume that various U.S. statesmen and such communicated the idea of 'while you're at it', to Grant, but let's not entertain the idea, too much, that Grant embarked on some sort of diplomatic &quot;mission&quot; with official instructions. Young's work largely lends itself to Grant's 'diplomatic' involvements, with numerous allusions to political situations, but from what I've read, any such engagements presented themselves to Grant in a happenstance manner. There doesn't seem to be anything in the sources that says Grant anticipated and was prepared to address any given situation. Having said that, it seems Grant's tour established or strengthened many political and diplomatic ties with the various countries involved and we should emphasize this in the section with a sentence or two. Presently the section only mentions that Grant's tour took on diplomatic proportions, which is an understatement. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 05:41, 26 October 2016 (UTC)
:Yes, I agree with Gwillhickers. There were no instructions, no commissions, no tasks assigned. Grant did, as Rjensen notes, perform a diplomatic service for the Chinese Empire, but even then he just passed on a message that he agreed with. He was not accredited, nor was the mission even successful. If you can find a reliable source that says Grant improved diplomatic relations between the U.S. and any country, I'd say let's add that. If not, I don't see how we can justify it. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 10:57, 26 October 2016 (UTC)
::Grant was not ordered. I have the Campbell book. It was instructions in a letter or telegram from Hayes' Secretary of Navy. Grant had to have permission to board the U.S. Naval Ships.

I can change the suggested edit: ''The Hayes Administration, who knew of Grant's popularity in Europe, convinced Grant to voyage around the world in order to bolster international commerce and American institutions abroad.''

The ironic thing is that Grant did not wait for the ''USS Richmond'' because the ''USS Richmond'' would have taken two weeks to arrive in England. Grant criticized the navy for being slow.

:::The edit is acceptable Gwillhickers.

His voyage would have had more diplomatic impact had the ''USS Richmond''' had taken him around the world. This only took place in Japan and Grant did actually help resolve the land crisis between China and Japan. Thompson said the Man-of-war and Grant combined would have a large impact on diplomacy, but for most of Grant's world tour he was on a private carrier, looking more like a tourist.

Cm', we know why Hayes offered the USS ''Richmond'' to Grant. We know Hayes' encouragement changed Grant's original tour plans.  Our article now mentions that the Hayes administration impacted Grant's tour without getting into all the many details.  What is in dispute here?  A dedicated section for Hayes' and the Navy's involvement has been added to the proposed article's TOC. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:36, 29 October 2016 (UTC)
:::Nothing is in dispute. Hayes deserves credit for shaping modern presidential diplomacy too along with Grant. But the Navy was slow and Grant took off on a private ship. Let's say a modern president comes to Japan on a commercial flight for an economic summit meeting flying in coach. Not much prestige. But a president flys in on Air Force One. Now that is prestige. Hayes realized diplomatic prestige counts concerning Grant using ''USS Richmond'' man-of-war. The ''USS Richmond'' was a kind of proto type for Air Force One. Unfortunately that only occured in Japan. But this concept was way ahead of its times. These are just my opinions.

==Language==
Coemgenus, in regards to changing 'advent' to 'event' it's my understanding that an 'advent' usually involves the initiation of a series of events involving a general idea or undertaking, like advancing diplomacy, whereas an 'event' usually refers to one particular happening, like a conference, concert or football game. In reference to Grant's series of diplomatic undertakings I believe we should use 'advent'. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:12, 25 October 2016 (UTC)

==White raises some issues==
(Thanks to our public library I finally have White's book in hand.) -- On p. 608 White states that Grant traveled aboard the British steamer ''Simla'' when he departed from India, en-route to Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, Siam and Hong Kong. From there White says Grant traveled to China aboard an American Gunboat [[USS Ashuelot|USS ''Ashuelot'']]. The ''Ashuelot'' article says however that it was the ''Irrawaddy'' that brought Grant to China and who was then received by a party aboard the ''Ashuelot'', which then took Grant to various points along the China coast, but that [[USS Ashuelot#1879–1880|section]] has no citations.

==Draft article==
All editors are equally welcomed to contribute what they can to the [[World tour of Ulysses S. Grant|proposed article]]. With POV, page length and lesser details not an issue this venture should go fairly easy if and when it's launched. I'd recommend that we get square on a few more ideas/questions before the draft-article is initiated, as we frequently seem to uncover new items every time we turn around, and various important questions remain. For example, I'm not sure what stops along the tour were originally planned and which were added to the itinerary for political reasons. How did Grant feel about turning his tour, originally meant as a restful vacation for himself and his wife, into a political undertaking with what appears to be numerous changes in ships.  How did Grant feel about visiting English royalty who since the Revolution had less than congenial designs on America? How did Julia feel about all the politics and pomp which were, once again, dominating much of Grant's time? Was Grant just going along with the program? Can't seem to find anything that covers important items like these, yet. Ultimately I'm hoping we can give the readers more than just a chronology of events. Don't mean to be the wet blanket here, but it seems we're not ready for the draft phase quite yet.  -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 16:30, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

:Maybe in a few days things will change. Regarding Grant's feelings with Britain and the tour overall, Fish seemed to patch things up with Britain regarding the ''[[Alabama Claims]]'', during Grant's terms. Seems unclear, to me, how that panned out. Britain was not very cooperative overall. Looking for sources of any type that expresses Fish's thoughts on the affair -- perhaps revealed in letters Fish and Grant may have exchanged during the months that preceded the tour. Seems Fish, or someone, out of concern for Grant's feelings as well as Queen Victoria's, gave Grant a proverbial list of things not to talk about when he arrived in England. Remlap also expresses some interesting ideas, saying unlike Sherman, Sheridan and Farragut who enjoyed restful vacations in Europe after the war, such rest was not afforded to Grant, who it seems felt duty bound to use his legacy and influence to secure U.S. relations with much of the world. Apparently when approached with the idea by Hayes and others Grant could not turn the other cheek, moreover, he seemed to welcomed the idea overall. However, Young gives us a perspective and mentions that Grant was not eager to shake hands and make appearances much of the time. Grant simply wanted a simple(r) vacation, but duty and honor seems to have prevailed and Grant was happy to rise to the occasion on top of it all. Like any U.S. president aware of his immediate surroundings, Hayes must have had Grant pegged well and duly seized on the prospect. We have the sources to present this sort of insight into Grant's feelings about such turn of events in his plans, esp with Young who spent many hours during the various cruises conversing with Grant about a variety of subjects, mostly political, as outlined well in his book. Young doesn't (need to) embellish or misrepresent the advent in any way imo. Still reading White and looking elsewhere for corroboration on these ideas. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 04:48, 31 October 2016 (UTC)

But if you want to know on a personal level why it is important, Woodrow Wilson thought it was, is that F. Ward was the only Grant ''swindler'' who got caught and prosecuted and spent time in prison. Babcock, Belknap, and Robeson were never convicted or served time. Additionally Grant never defended F. Ward. It was the first time Grant ever realized that a &quot;friend&quot; could also be a crook. I think the article has made great improvements and many of them have come from you Coemgenus.

I just think that the section needs more clarification for the reader and what Ward actually did to Grant and any others who had investment in ''Grant &amp; Ward''. Clarification maybe needed on the ''Grant'' in ''Grant &amp; Ward''. I believe the ''Grant'' was Buck Grant. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 08:01, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
::::I have to agree with Gwillickers here. I don't think White adds much about Grant's involvement. More details on Ward are interesting, but belong in Ward's article.

:::::::::In my opinon White does a better job then McFeely in explaining what Ward and Fish did to Grant. ''[[Hypothecation]]'' is two nice a word for what Ward did: grand larceny. White does not use the term ''Hypothecation'' nor ''Rehypothecation''. Why not just say that Ward and Fish illegally took out several loans on ''Grant &amp; Ward'' securities.

::::::::::::Hypothecation wasn't the crime, it was the tool. Fraud and larceny were the crimes, which is already mentioned in the closing sentence of the section. Adding legal details about how the crime was committed with Ward and Fish doesn't shed any direct light on Grant.

:::Well it is up to editors. I am not really pushing this but I think the section could be tightened up a bit using the White (2016) as reference. I do think that it is important to mention that Ward had a partner Fish, who was also indicted. To me this has everything to do with Grant because it bankrupted him. It also shows the brazeness of the Gilded Age, Ward lying directly to Grant telling him he needed $150,000 to cover ''Grant &amp; Ward'' bankruptsy, when Ward knew perfectly well it would do no good. Grant was devastated over the matter and his personal reputation was ruined. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 01:16, 5 November 2016 (UTC)

It also gets kind of lengthy to explain that Fish was a partner at Grant and Ward as well as President of the Marine Bank, etc. Maybe in Ward's article you could explain the details a bit better.

::::*Fish was perhaps not as notable as Ward but being president of the bank that was in the middle of a gigantic money scheme, collusion with Ward and his bank failure and indictment and conviction, I thought it wouldn't hurt if we gave J.D.Fish a contextual peep in the narrative.  Grant must have known what was going on by the time Ward and Fish were indicted. He still had his health in 1883, so it would seem obvious that Grant didn't defend them because of betrayed trust, treachery, grand larceny, etc. Ward disappeared the same day the Bank shut down on May 6th,&lt;White, pp. 630-631&gt;  so Grant must of had more than a clue about Ward at that point.

::::::::::When I realized that this would not be a one sentence fix, I decided to edit. I was using White as my source. In my opinion none of Grant's biographers adequately explains how Ward swindled ex-President Grant and other investors. I knew there would probably be some rough edges in my edits, but I felt the edits would give better understanding for the reader of what Ward  did. Basically Ward was stealing the securities behind Grant's back from the bank and this was approved by the bank president Fish. McFeely and White either use &quot;hypothecation&quot; or &quot;rehypothecation&quot;. White also connects what Ward did to a Ponzi scheme and I think there are simularities bewteen them, especially the part of promising abnormally high returns to enduce investors. I don't have an issue with using &quot;rehypothecation&quot; in the article. I took out &quot;hypothecation&quot; because I believed it was redundant. Both are antiquated terms.

That's not a Wikipedia policy, it's a basic rule of writing. As to hypothecation and rehypothecation. They're technical terms but are by no means antiquated. And it's not just in White's book. McFeely used it too (p. 492), and [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Hypothecation%2Crehypothecation&amp;year_start=1950&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=1&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2CHypothecation%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Crehypothecation%3B%2Cc0 it's about as common when he wrote it as it is now]. Beyond understanding the subject matter, we should endeavor to write about it correctly, using accurate terms. That's what McFeely and White did.

White (2016) uses the term &quot;rehypothecation&quot; on page 629 saying &quot;''In Grant's day, is was called &quot;rehypothecation&quot;.''&quot; It is best then just to keep &quot;rehypothecation&quot; in the article.

::I would keep the term ''rehypocathecation''. I just did not feel both ''hypocathecation'' and ''rehypocathecation'' needed to be mentioned. Grant did go after Ward and Fish after the company collapsed, but he completely trusted them even though there was reason to believe the two were crooks. Ward, in essense, was another Babcock. Ward had complete control of the ''Grant &amp; Ward'' firm. Grant can be criticized for lack of oversight in the company he and Buck invested in. Adding that Grant went after Ward and Fish might be undo weight in the article since he never questioned their integrity nor looked into how Ward operated the company.

Easily done with just a mention. Our account also fails to mention that Julia had also invested great amounts of money, which would of course caused Grant to hold that much more contempt for these characters.

The subsections can be added using the existing content.&lt;s&gt; I'll do this now, tentatively, so we can see and evaluate how it looks in the actual article / TOC.If there are any objections, feel free to restore, and we can discuss it.&lt;/s&gt;  -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:17, 12 November 2016 (UTC)
::::::I think his military career should begin with his commission. As White notes, cadets were not actually required to serve after graduation in those days. We could change the first sectrion to &quot;Early life and education&quot; if that makes more sense to you, although &quot;Early life&quot; usually includes education. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 20:20, 12 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::*Going to wait on making any section changes. We hardly cover West Point. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:27, 12 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::*Yes, cadets were not required to serve, but this education, and ''training'' I would think easily puts this idea under the heading of ''military career'', as W.P. is hand-in-glove with Grant's commencement of military life, being assigned to the 4th Infantry Regiment immediately following graduation. The Mexican American War soon followed. [add: The Mexican American War, where Grant received his first commission, would be better presented with its own subsection, imo. Again, there'd be no need for any additional content. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:36, 12 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::::As a USMA cadet Grant was in the military, or an officer in training. USMA was under the authority of the President and Secretary of War. I would say his service started in 1839 because he was required to wear a uniform. He was forced to attend Church. He was punished for not obeying military protocol. That too would mean he is the military. USMA was a federal school and was run by federal money. Tuition was free apparently. When he was commissioned he finally got a pay check. Grant was under authority of the military officers who ran USMA. Grant could not disobey their orders as if he was a civilian.

:::::Without checking this seems to make sense, though I would have to wonder about forcing someone to go to church. That seems completely un-American. Anyway, without belaboring the finer points, I'd recommend moving most of the last paragraph in the Early life section (where various military items are mentioned) to the ''Early military career and personal life'' section where ''West Point'' and ''Mexican American War'' have their own subsections. Seems both topics have enough notoriety to warrant it. I'll make a tentative change to see how this flies in the actual article. Needless to say, feel free to revert or tweak if there are issues. Presently things seem to be run together and somewhat disorganized as content and section headings go. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:32, 13 November 2016 (UTC)

:::I would do something like this: 
:::::''Early military career''
:::::::&lt;strike&gt;''United States Military Academy''&lt;/strike&gt; [''West Point'']
:::::::''Mexican American War''
:::::''Marriage and family'' [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 05:06, 14 November 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::The ''Marriage and family'' section does not even say when the Grant and Julia were married. Only says they were engaged. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 05:09, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

:::::::::::Yes, calling that section &quot;marriage and family&quot; doesn't make much sense, since his marriage is mentioned later. I combined it into &quot;West Point and early career,&quot; which should cover all bases and also avoid having such short sections (remember that an overlong table of contents was one of the things we had to fix to pass GA). --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 13:27, 14 November 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::::I like the way the article currently looks under Coemgenus edit. There are two mentions of Grant's career. I don't think that is necessary. Also, ''West Point'' is not accurate since the official name is ''United States Military Academy'' although it is located at the ''West Point'' of the Hudson River.

Okay, using ''USMA'' in the section title doesn't cut it. Few readers will know what this means when they view the TOC. ''West Point'' is the familiar term used by the majority of those who refer to the academy. We should use it in the section title and clarify things in the text, esp since ''United States Military Academy and first assignment'' is much too long for a subsection title. Therefore I restored the prior title. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 02:51, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

:::&lt;strike&gt;It's not officially called ''West Point''. Why do we keep perpetuating this myth.&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;Also&lt;/strike&gt; ''[C]areer'' is mentioned twice in the same title sections. &lt;strike&gt;That is sloppy and repetative. Titles are just as important as the article.&lt;/strike&gt; [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 04:37, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

:::::Correction: ''West Point'' does call itself [http://www.westpoint.edu/SitePages/Home.aspx|''West Point''] So it is good to call the school West Point in the article. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 06:19, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

== Colorization of photos ==

There is a website that can change black and white photos into colorized photos : [http://demos.algorithmia.com/colorize-photos/ Colorize Photos] Would it be worth to colorize photos in the Ulysses S. Grant article ? [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 07:32, 20 November 2016 (UTC)
:The [https://algorithmia.com/terms terms and conditions] suggest that the new work created by the process is not in the public domain or the creative commons, so I don't think it would be eligible for upload here. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 14:44, 20 November 2016 (UTC)
::Thanks Coemgenus. That why I put this in discussion. I had read through the terms and conditions and it was unclear to me if the colorized photo produced was public domain or creative commons. If there was a website or software that could produce a public domain or creative commons color photograph of a black and white photograph, is there any objection to having colorized photos in the article ?

:::That's a little too specific for the lede. The last part of the lede already mentions a number of ideas and that opinions of critics and admirers vary in so many words. We should keep things as generalized as possible in the lede, imo. In fact, I'm wondering if we already have too many specifics in that part of the lede. However, this idea would work well in the ''Historical reputation'' section. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 19:34, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
::::I agree. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 20:59, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::In the lede 'African-American' is mentioned four times, so along with removing this and other specifics, we may want to generalize and change the last sentence in the lede from this:

:::::::''His critics take a negative view of his defense of corrupt associates, deflationary financial policies, and his failed Dominican Republic annexation treaty, while admirers emphasize his concern for Native Americans, his enforcement of civil and voting rights for African-Americans and his administration's successful Treaty of Washington.''

:::::to this:

:::::::'''''While historians have generally praised Grant's efforts during the Civil War, they have both admired his efforts at reconstruction while often criticizing his handling of corruption in his administration while President.''''' -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 18:08, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::Let's see. Grant defeating a merciless hate group the KKK is admired by historians using the military. Grant used the military to stop illegal Whiskey mills in New York. Grant defeated the Whiskey Ring and oh yeah he started Civil Service Reform, the first President to do so. Grant also outlawed the Franking priviledge of Congressmen. He ended the moiety system and he defeated the Gold Ring in 1869. Grant had an anti-corruption team Bristow and Pierrepont who for over a year rooted out corruption in the Grant administration. What historians are critical of is his associations or protection of gilded age crooks i.e. Babcock, Gould &amp; Fisk. He shielded Delano, Belknap, and Robeson from prosecution. White notes that historians have ignored his replacements such as Chandler, Bristow, and Pierrepont who reformed their respected departments. Even McFeely admired Grant's replacing Richardson by Bristow. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 19:43, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
:::Rewrite: ''While modern historians have generally praised Grant's efforts during the Civil War, they have both admired his efforts at Reconstruction while often criticizing his protection of corrupt associates in his administration while President.'' [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 03:11, 23 November 2016 (UTC)

::::Changing the word ''handling'' to ''protection'' works fine also. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 19:58, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::::Almost every president has had some corruption scandal or scandals. Grant was slow at getting rid of Delano and Williams. He really protected Babcock. A lot of this stemmed from his stubborness in refusing to believe his personal friends could be involved in corruption. He was this way most of his life, except after Ward. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 20:04, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
::::::::I'd rather not. The existing sentence balances the historical criticisms of Grant with the recent improvement in his reputation. And whether we personally agree with it or not, most historians have noted corruption as a major theme of his administration. Saying that they generally admired his efforts at Reconstruction is not accurate, either; only the historians of the past few decades have done so, a revision of nearly a century of existing scholarship. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 20:32, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::Points well taken. We should try to reflect this without getting into all the specifics, one of which is redundant, as mentioned. e.g. ''Assessment of Grant's political life has varied among historians over the years'', which is covered in the ''Historical reputation'' section. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 20:51, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::I think of that as sort of an introductory sentence, but I guess we could cut it. I don't think to hurts to keep it. Everything in the lede is just a boiled down version of the article, after all. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 13:13, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
The lede has two passages that are somewhat redundant: -- In the 1st paragraph it says:
:::''His presidency has often come under '''criticism''' for shielding '''corrupt''' associates...''
In the last paragraph it says:
:::''...His '''critics''' take a negative view of his defense of '''corrupt''' associates'''..'' 

Also, ''African-American'' is mentioned four times, unlike any other topic. There's no content/pov issues but we should try to condense some of these things. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 19:44, 23 November 2016 (UTC)</text>
