Ashley, with respect I will revert your deleting of [[Operation Span]]. The source is the official US Army History (the ''Green Book'' series) on this operation. [[User:PaulinSaudi|Paul, in Saudi]] 16:47, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== correction ==

I use wikipedia alot, though this is my first time actually editing or suggesting something. I noticed the article said that the name change came form a quote from churchhill claiming he was &quot;Dragooned into it&quot;; in reality that was the common myth amoungst soldiers at the time but it turned out to be false. This is acourding to a reliable source, ''Airborne'' by E. M. Flanagan JR, Ballantine Books, Copyright 2002.

Since I'm new it would be apreciated if somebody else fixed this.

[[User:Lophoole|Lophoole]] 23:00, 1 October 2006 (UTC)Lophoole

OK, I figured out how to edit adn add the fact, but not how to site it. (It's proubably common knowledge and is only a minor fact, but if somebody could please site it that would be helpfull.)
: I've put the basic info into the para, surrounded by &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  It's not a complete citation, but it's best to capture the basic information as soon as you can.  Another editor can always clean up the citation style.  Welcome to editing![[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] 16:48, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

== Casualties? ==

There seem to be no sources to back up the casualties given. 2x4,500 versus 125,000 casualties also seems highly unlikely, US casualties were probably higher and German casualties lower. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/82.171.148.207|82.171.148.207]] ([[User talk:82.171.148.207|talk]]) 09:19, 12 April 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

Surely the casualties shouldn't be listed as &quot;unknown&quot; in the infobox.  That seems to imply that ''nobody'' knows, which I doubt is the case! -- [[User:SCZenz|SCZenz]] ([[User talk:SCZenz|talk]]) 18:16, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

I'd add that the casualties don't list the British or Canadian casualty lists, surely they must be available somewhere?  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.180.223.14|86.180.223.14]] ([[User talk:86.180.223.14|talk]]) 14:32, 18 February 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Rewrite ==

Note to any editors watching this page, though I doubt there are many. Please retain the books I've listed in the bibliography. I will come back to rewrite the article, but I feel that I need to gather more sources, particularly on the operations background. [[User:Skinny87|Skinny87]] ([[User talk:Skinny87|talk]]) 20:09, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

== No mention of Churchill's dismay? ==

Winston Churchill was very opposed to this operation and wished instead for the Allies to make landings in Greece and/or the Balkans (to prevent further Soviet influence) yet Roosevelt and Stalin had the final say. Shouldn't the article mention this briefly?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.76.80.178|173.76.80.178]] ([[User talk:173.76.80.178|talk]]) 13:56, 9 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Recent Additions ==

{{ping|Mwiki3101}} thanks for the work you're doing on this page, although having read some of the content I am not sure it's appropriate for Wikipedia. In particular suffering from issues of tone, sourcing and original research. Here's an example!
:''One would have expected the French to be overjoyed with &quot;Dragoon&quot; and many of the 230,000 French soldiers[33] and liberated civilians no doubt were, it was the largest French military action since 1940, but in the 1,000 page book of the WW2 Memoirs of De Gaulle, &quot;Dragoon&quot; has less than one page of coverage.[55]:626''
* &quot;[[WP:TONE|Wikipedia articles, and other encyclopedic content, should be written in a formal tone]]&quot;, and in  particular not in the first or second person. This sentence, as does some of the other content, suffers from informal tone and use of the incorrect narrative.
* &quot;[[WP:OR|Wikipedia articles must not contain original research]]&quot;; or in other words, avoid bringing in your own analysis. &quot;many of the 230,000 French soldiers[33] and liberated civilians no doubt were,&quot;; is this the opinion of a source? &quot; but in the 1,000 page book of the WW2 Memoirs of De Gaulle, &quot;Dragoon&quot; has less than one page of coverage&quot;; why is this significant? You do need sources to say this before it can be added.
* &quot;[[WP:PRIMARY|Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources]]&quot;; which ties to the past problem, reliable sourcing for your claim. It may certainly be factual that the De Gaulle memoirs only contains one page about Dragoon, however that this is significant, or unusual is not appropriate to cite to the book itself.
I hope this feedback is helpful, and I'm happy to answer questions! A lot of the content you are adding is fantastic, but there does seem to be a little bit of original research and opinion dispersed amongst the additions. --'''[[user:ErrantX|Errant]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:ErrantX|chat!]])&lt;/sup&gt; 13:30, 19 November 2015 (UTC)
: Thats OK, I was hoping I would come across something elsewhere to support it, but I have not yet found anything. I'll delete that para.
: Its nice to know someone has read the article. 
: By the way, is there any way of telling how many people access any particular article ?

== Need a translation ==

[This discussion copied from [[User talk:Natalie.Desautels#Need a translation]].] 

Hello, Natalie! I guess you are back home now and settling into your fall schedule. Welcome back to Wikipedia! It's nice to see you editing again. I'm just now finishing a copy-edit of [[Operation Dragoon]]. In that article there is a photo of a procession after the liberation of Marseilles in 1944. I see in the file description that the only description of the photo is in French. Since the officer Jean de Lattre de Tassigny is a key figure in the article, and there are a number of people in the photo, I think it would be nice to have the description also in English so that readers who do not know French can read it and see which one is de Tassigny. I wonder if you feel like translating the description and adding it (if that is permitted). I understand most of it but would not be able to do as good a job as you could. Here is the image: [[File:Liberation of Marseille, August 1944.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Marseille, August 1944]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Corinne|Corinne]] ([[User talk:Corinne#top|talk]]) 18:51, 25 October 2016 (UTC)

:Dear {{U|Corinne}}, {{smiley}}
:In her reply in the section immediately above, Natalie told me yesterday that she's currently in Paris for a few weeks. I hope she/you won't mind that I jumped in... {{wink}} 
:With kind regards;

:P.S. I have been thinking about your idea of adding the translation into the description of the file itself, but I don't know whether that's allowable. I would suggest the obvious: add a summary of the (long-ish) translation into the caption (see the article on the [[Yalta Conference]], for an example of a photo with a long caption). I have added such a summary in the third subsection below.
:Hope this helped some more. Best wishes, Corinne.

=== Original description ===
André Diethelm [Identifié par ressemblance avec le [http://www.senat.fr/sen4Rfic/diethelm_andre0218r4.html portrait disponible sur senat.fr]] passe en revue des troupes dans Marseille libérée en août 1944. On reconnaît, derrière Diethelm, le [[:fr:Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|général de Lattre de Tassigny]] (en pantalon et chemise d'uniforme, sans veste, regardant sur sa droite les soldats) et [[:fr:Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie|Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie]], à droite de la photo. Entre les deux précédents, derrière Diethelm, en képi à feuilles de chêne, le [[:fr:Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert|général de Monsabert]]. Photographie prise sur le quai de Rive-Neuve à l'angle avec le [[:fr:Cours Jean-Ballard|cours Jean-Ballard]]&lt;ref&gt;Localisation faite en reconnaissant [http://www.livresdeguerre.net/forum/contribution.php?index=27846 les traits des bâtiments], qui n'ont guère changé depuis.

=== Translation ===
André Diethelm [identified by resemblance with the portrait available at senat.fr] reviewing troops in Marseille, liberated in August 1944. Behind Diethelm are: general de Lattre de Tassigny (in uniform trousers and shirt, without jacket, looking at soldiers to his right) and Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie, far right in the photo. Between the latter two and behind Diethelm, is général de Monsabert (in kepi with oak leaf). Photo shot (by an unknown author) on the quay de Rive-Neuve at the angle with Cours Jean-Ballard. Location identified through recognition of local buildings, which have not changed much since then.

=== Suggested caption ===
André Diethelm reviewing troops in Marseille, liberated in August 1944. Behind Diethelm are: general de Lattre de Tassigny (in uniform trousers and shirt, without jacket, looking at soldiers to his right) and Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie, far right in the photo. Between the latter two and behind Diethelm, is général de Monsabert (in kepi with oak leaf).

:[[User:Pdebee|Patrick]], thank you so much for your reply and for undertaking the translation. This is well written and fine. I'm just wondering{{snd}}even though the phrase, &quot;liberated in August 1944&quot;, is a perfect translation of the phrase in the French description, it does not indicate at all that this review of the troops took place immediately following the liberation of Marseilles, which, given the subject matter of the article, would be more pertinent. I mean, can we not assume that that was when the photo was taken? Can we safely write:

:*André Diethelm reviewing troops in Marseille, following the liberation of the city in August 1944...., or

:*André Diethelm reviewing troops in Marseille, upon liberation of the city in August 1944....?

:Or do you prefer the original (i.e., your) wording?

:Also, when I was editing the article, I was struck by the spelling &quot;Marseille&quot;, so I looked at the WP article [[Marseille]], and I saw that &quot;Marseille&quot; is the French spelling and that &quot;Marseilles&quot; is generally used in English. That's why I paused at &quot;Marseille&quot;. I was used to seeing &quot;Marseilles&quot;. That's really interesting because it's the opposite of what one would expect. One would expect a silent final &quot;s&quot; (found on many French words), left off in the English spelling. I wonder how in the world an &quot;s&quot; found its way onto the English spelling of the name of the city. Do you think the English spelling, &quot;Marseilles&quot;, should be used throughout the article [[Operation Dragoon]] or the French spelling, &quot;Marseille&quot;?  &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Corinne|Corinne]] ([[User talk:Corinne#top|talk]]) 14:41, 26 October 2016 (UTC)

::Dear [[User:Corinne|Corinne]], {{smiley}}
::You're most welcome, of course; it's always a pleasure.
::Well, I simply translated the original description provided by the Wikipedian who uploaded the digital photo into the Wikipedia file. Your query addresses two different events:
::#the date of the liberation of Marseille, which an existing article records as taking place on [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny#Disembarking in Provence and ascending to the Rhône|29 August 1944]];
::#the date when the photograph was taken, which is not on record; so, we simply don't know.
::Therefore, what I would do in this case is to refine the date in the first sentence of the caption to:
:::André Diethelm reviewing troops in Marseille, liberated on [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny#Disembarking in Provence and ascending to the Rhône|29 August 1944]]. ...
::This would provide more precision, even though it does not address your suggestion to change the translation to &quot;following the liberation of the city&quot; or &quot;upon the liberation of the city&quot;, which is nonetheless very strongly implied. One could of course assume that these important and very busy officials would not have chosen to hang around in Marseille for very long. Therefore, one could further assume the photo to have been shot in late August (29, 30, 31) or in early September. However, we simply don't know. The article on [[:fr:André Diethelm]] does not provide a date for this parade either; so: we simply cannot date the photo without first searching for a verifiable source that provides the date of this parade, on the supposition that this specific event was ever recorded and documented by historians.
::As you already know, the article (at our en Wiki) does not have the final 's' in the spelling of [[Marseille]], but does mention the English spelling in the first sentence of the lead section. Therefore, both spellings are available to the reader in a single source, and I am happy to let you decide how to spell it in the caption: [[Marseille]] or [[Marseille|Marseilles]].
::With kindest regards, as always; {{smiley}}
