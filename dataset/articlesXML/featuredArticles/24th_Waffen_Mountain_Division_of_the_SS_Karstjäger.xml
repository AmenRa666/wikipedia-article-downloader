The '''24th ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Karstjäger''''' was a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Gebirgsjäger|mountain infantry]] [[Division (military)|division]] of the [[Waffen-SS|''Waffen''-SS]], the armed wing of the German [[Nazi Party]] that served alongside, but was never formally part of, the [[Wehrmacht]] during [[World War II]]. Named ''Karstjäger'', it was one of the 38 divisions fielded by the ''Waffen''-SS. Formed on 18 July 1944 from the '''SS Volunteer ''Karstwehr'' Battalion''', its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the '''''Waffen'' Mountain (''Karstjäger'') Brigade of the SS'''. Throughout its existence as a battalion, division and brigade, it was primarily involved in fighting [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] in the [[Karst Plateau]] on the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and [[Austria in the time of National Socialism|Austria]]; the mountainous terrain required specialised mountain troops and equipment.

Founded in 1942 as a [[company (military unit)|company]], the unit consisted mainly of [[Germans of Yugoslavia| Yugoslav ''Volksdeutsche'']] and recruits from [[South Tyrol]]. Although focused on [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operations]], it also saw action in the wake of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]] when it moved to disarm Italian troops in [[Tarvisio]] and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the [[British 6th Armoured Division]] on 9 May 1945.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-024-19, SS-Karstwehr-Bataillon, Lazarett.jpg|thumb|The training centre for the SS-''Freiwilligen-Karstwehr'' Battalion was located in [[Pottenstein, Bavaria]]|alt=a black and white photograph of a building with a mountain behind it]]

===Origins===
In mid-1942, the [[Waffen-SS|''Waffen''-SS]] formed a [[company (military unit)|company]] intended for [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operations]] in the rugged and high-altitude border region between [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Austria in the time of National Socialism|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] known as the ''[[Karst Plateau|Karst]]''.{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=4}} SS-''[[Standartenführer]]'' (Colonel) Hans Brand, a geologist and [[Speleology|speleologist]], suggested the creation of the unit.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=263}} The company was formed at the SS training centre in [[Dachau]] on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the [[23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian)|23rd ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Kama'' (2nd Croatian)]].{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=81}}

It was expanded to [[battalion]] strength of around 500 troops in November 1942, and as the SS-''Freiwilligen-Karstwehr'' Battalion,{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=84}} it spent the first six months of 1943 training in Austria.{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=4}} The unit drew its recruits mainly from among the [[Germans of Yugoslavia]] (''Volksdeutsche'') and [[South Tyrol]]ians,{{sfn|Bishop|Williams|2003|p=72}} with the officer [[cadre (military)|cadre]] being drawn from SS geological detachments.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=263}} The battalion-strength ''Waffen''-SS Geological Corps ({{lang-de|SS-Wehrgeologenkorps|links=no}}), from which such detachments were drawn, was formed in April 1941 and consisted mainly of engineers with a few geologists. They examined caves and natural obstacles, and determined whether off-road terrain was suitable for [[tank]]s.{{sfn|Häusler|Willig|2000|p=154}} They were also responsible for locating sources of fresh water.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=57}} Following the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, the battalion was tasked with disarming [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian troops]] around [[Tarvisio]] on the border between the three countries. It then moved on to protective duties for nearby ''Volksdeutsche'' communities. From October 1943 until June 1944, the battalion was based at [[Gradisca d'Isonzo]] in Italy, and participated in anti-partisan operations in the areas of [[Trieste]], [[Udine]] and the [[Istrian peninsula]].{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=4}} On 10 October, a column of the battalion was ambushed at the [[Predil Pass]], suffering three killed and eight wounded. The following day the battalion burned down the village of [[Strmec na Predelu|Strmec]] and killed 16 local men in retaliation. Up to 19 October 1943, the battalion suffered a total of 18 killed and 45 wounded in a series of engagements near the village of [[Bovec]] (Flitsch). During the same period, the battalion captured two Italian [[Obice da 75/18 modello 34|75 mm mountain guns]], which significantly increased its firepower.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=348}}

During late October and November 1943, the battalion was engaged in anti-partisan operations around [[Žaga, Bovec|Žaga]] (Saga) and [[Kobarid]] (Karfreit), including Operation ''Traufe'' (Eaves).{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=348}} In late November, it was placed under the command of the [[SS and police leader|Supreme SS and Police Leader, Italy]], ''[[Obergruppenführer|SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Karl Wolff]] for an operation.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|pp=348–349}} In February 1944, the battalion conducted Operation ''Ratte'' (Rat), during which it burned down the villages of [[Komen]] and [[Branik]] (Rihenberg), and interned the population of both villages in labour camps. Early in 1944, Brandt suggested that [[Slovenes|Slovene]] nationalists be recruited into the battalion, but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. At this stage, it was estimated that there were about 20,000 communist partisans operating in the [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia region]]. During March 1944, the battalion was involved in a rapid series of operations, including ''Zypresse'' (Cypress), ''Märzveilchen'' (Violet), ''Maulwurf'' (Mole) and ''Hellblau'' (Light Blue), resulting in significant guerrilla casualties, as well as executions of captured partisans. In March and April, Operation ''Osterglocke'' (Daffodil) was conducted over 12 days, followed by Operation ''Liane'' in late May, and the long-running Operation ''Annemarie'' which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=349}} In June 1944, a patrol from the battalion failed to return from a task in the vicinity of [[Cividale del Friuli]]. Two days later, they were found naked with their severed heads impaled on bayonets.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=348}} The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=263}} While engaged in anti-partisan work, the battalion grew to a strength of around 1,000.{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=4}}

===Expansion===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1991-068-33, SS-Karstwehr-Bataillons, Artillerie-Ausbildung.jpg|thumb|left|The SS-''Freiwilligen-Karstwehr'' Battalion conducting artillery training|alt=a soldier leading a team of two horses pulling a mountain gun up a hill]]
On 18 July 1944,{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=81}} ''[[Reichsführer-SS|Reichsführer]]''-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered that the battalion be expanded to [[division (military)|divisional]] size, although the authorised strength was only 6,600 troops. The 24th ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Karstjäger'' was to be established by the Higher SS and Police Leader ({{lang-de|links=no|Höherer SS-und Polizeiführer}}) for the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' (Major General) [[Odilo Globocnik]].{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=4}} The name ''Karstjäger'' was derived from a combination of ''Karst'', denoting the region of operations, and ''[[Jäger (infantry)|Jäger]]'', the German military term for light infantry. The division was to consist of two ''[[Gebirgsjäger]]'' (mountain infantry) regiments, with an artillery regiment, reconnaissance, ''[[Panzerjäger]]'' ([[anti-tank]]) and [[pioneer (military)|pioneer]] battalions, as well as replacement and supply troops.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|pp=85–86}} The division was supplied with 14 captured Italian [[Carro Armato P 40]] tanks, but these proved unreliable, with only half being serviceable at any one time.{{sfn|Cappellano|Battistelli|2012}} In August 1944, the under-strength division participated in Operation ''Dachstein'' under the command of the [[188th Reserve Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|188th Mountain Division]].{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|pp=349–350}} Between August and November 1944, the division continued performing anti-partisan duties in the same region, but its strength had only reached 3,000, less than half of its authorised establishment. It proved impossible to recruit sufficient troops for the division, and in December 1944 the division was downgraded to a [[brigade]].{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=86}}

During late 1944 and early 1945, the ''Waffen'' Mountain (''Karstjäger'') Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the [[Julian Alps]], and was then deployed to the coastal area around Trieste and the [[Marano-Grado Lagoon]]. In danger of being cut off by Allied forces, the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps, having to fight its way through the [[Tagliamento]] river valley between [[Osoppo]] and [[Gemona del Friuli|Gemona]]. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought [[British Army during the Second World War|British]] and [[Military history of New Zealand during World War II#Italy|New Zealand]] forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|pp=353–354}} The brigade replacement company, which had been sent to Cividale from its training centre at [[Pottenstein, Bavaria]], managed to destroy a number of British tanks with [[panzerfaust]]s and the assistance of a tank company.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=354}} In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a ''[[Kampfgruppe]]'' (battlegroup) commanded by SS-''[[Brigadeführer|Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen]]''-SS (Brigadier) [[Heinz Harmel]], which was ordered to keep the [[Karawanks]] passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The ''Kampfgruppe'' succeeded in its final task, and was one of the last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]] on 9 May 1945.{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=4}}

==Order of battle==
[[File:P26-40 tank.jpg|thumb|Fourteen captured Italian Carro Armato P 40 tanks were supplied to the newly formed division in July 1944, but they proved unreliable.|alt=a tank with riveted hull and turret]]
On paper, the division's final order of battle was to consist of:{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|pp=85–86}}
* 59th ''Waffen Gebirgsjäger'' (Mountain Infantry) Regiment of the SS (three battalions)
* 60th ''Waffen Gebirgsjäger'' Regiment of the SS (three battalions)
* 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment (four battalions)
* 24th SS Reconnaissance Battalion
* 24th SS ''Panzerjäger'' (Anti-tank) Battalion
* 24th SS Pioneer Battalion
* 24th SS Mountain Signals Battalion
* 24th SS Replacement Battalion

The division establishment also included supply units. However, only the 59th ''Waffen Gebirgsjäger'' Regiment, one battalion of the 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment, one company of the 24th SS Pioneer Battalion and a half-company of the divisional panzer company were ever established.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=86}}

==Commanders==
According to historian [[Gordon Williamson (writer)|Gordon Williamson]], three ''Waffen''-SS officers commanded the division and subsequently the brigade:{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=4}}
*SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' Karl Marx (Dec 1944)
*SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' Werner Hahn (Dec 1944{{spaced ndash}}Feb 1945)
*SS-''[[Oberführer]]'' Adolf Wagner (Feb{{spaced ndash}}May 1945)

In contrast, Roland Kaltenegger only lists Hahn as commanding the unit.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=86}}

==Uniform==
{{Commons|Category:SS-Karstwehr-Bataillon}}
The unit insignia was a stylised [[Tiwaz rune|Týr rune]] with arrows pointing to the left and right.{{sfn|Kaltenegger|2008|p=86}} A collar insignia was manufactured, but it is believed that these were never issued or worn, and the members of the division wore the standard SS [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|Sig runes]].{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=5}}
