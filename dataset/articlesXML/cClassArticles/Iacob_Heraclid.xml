'''Ioan Iacob Heraclid''' (or '''Eraclid''') (1511–1563), also known as '''Jacob Heraclides''', was a [[Greeks|Greek]] soldier and [[List of Moldavian rulers|ruler]] of [[Moldavia]] from November 1561 to November 1563, most notable for being the first officially [[Protestantism|Protestant]] monarch in [[Eastern Europe]].

==Early life==
Born either on [[Crete]] or [[Samos Island|Samos]]. He was educated at the Academy of [[Janus Lascaris]], where he befriended [[Dimitrije Ljubavić]], who became a well-known Serbian and Romanian printer. Heraclid travelled over much of Europe. He fought as a [[mercenary]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] armies of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], in his war against [[Henry II of France]] (the [[Italian War of 1551]]).

After their defeat in the [[Battle of Renty]] (1554), he passed through [[Brussels]] on his way to [[Wittenberg]]. He had already adhered to Protestantism, and was an acquaintance of [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and other religious leaders.

==In Moldavia==
He came to Moldavia in 1556, in service to [[Voivode]] [[Alexandru Lăpușneanu]], pretending to be a relative of Ruxandra's, Lăpușneanu's wife. Heraclid befriended the usurper [[Moțoc]] and was forced to flee, first to [[Brașov]], and then to the [[Transylvania]]n [[Estate (house)|estate]] of [[Albert Laski]]. Laski was soon convinced to aid Heraclid in his bid for the throne, and even to [[Pawnbroker|pawn]] his lands as a loan to Heraclid.

Heraclid gathered military support – we see mention of a [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] or Transylvanian mercenary named Anton Szekelyi, and a [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundian]] one named Roussel. His first attempt was obstructed by Lăpuşneanu's [[History of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish]] overlord, [[Sigismund II of Poland]]. With help from Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and the powerful [[Jew]]ish trader [[Joseph Nasi]], Heraclid managed to defeat the Moldavian forces in November 1561. Such a successful intervention was without precedent in Moldavian history, although it had been announced by the progressive decay of Princes' authority in the previous decade.

Manifestly breaking apart with tradition, Heraclid ruled as [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] of Moldavia, and it was the adoption of this unusual title that established his [[Romanian language|Romanian]] [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] [[moniker]] – '''Despot Vodă''' (''The Despot Voivode'' or ''Despot the Voivode'') and in some other annals referred to as John Vasilikos. He soon appeased the [[Ottoman Empire]], Moldavia's [[Suzerainty|suzerain]], by agreeing to pay a [[tribute]] that was raised to the sum of 50,000 [[scudi]], and maneuvered in [[Constantinople]]-proper by ensuring [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] support through the French [[ambassador]] to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]].

He made [[Lutheranism]] the state Church, offending the native [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]. They viewed him as an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] due to his rhetoric against images, even though he did not, in fact, destroy any [[icon]]s. This, together with Despot's decision to marry another foreigner (a Pole), new and increased taxes and the omnipotence of his foreign [[retinue]] led to a [[boyar]] [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] instigated by high dignitary (''[[hatman]]'') [[Ștefan Tomșa]]. In the meantime, his postponement of debt payments angered Albert Laski. Faced with a large-scale rebellion, Heraclid retreated to the fortress in [[Suceava]] and withstood a three-month [[siege]]. At the end of it, Despot was captured and was struck to death with a [[Mace (club)|mace]] by Tomșa himself.

===Schola Latina===
In 1562, Heraclid founded the [[Cotnari]] Latin School (''Schola Latina''), intended as a [[Renaissance]] [[academy]], led by the [[Transylvania]]n [[scholar]] [[Ioannes Sommerus]] (who was also to be his [[biographer]]). The institution did not survive Despot's overthrow.

==Legacy==
* Heraclid is the central figure of ''Despot-Vodă'', an 1879 [[tragedy]] by [[Vasile Alecsandri]].
