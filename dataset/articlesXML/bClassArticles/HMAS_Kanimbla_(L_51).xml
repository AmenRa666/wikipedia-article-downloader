'''HMAS ''Kanimbla'' (L 51)''' (formerly '''{{USS|Saginaw|LST-1188}}''') was the lead ship of the [[Kanimbla class landing platform amphibious|''Kanimbla'' class Landing Platform Amphibious]] ships. Laid down in 1969 for the [[United States Navy]] (USN) as [[Newport class tank landing ship|''Newport'' class]] tank landing ship USS ''Saginaw'', the ship was acquired by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) in 1994 for conversion into an [[amphibious warfare]] transport ship.

Since entering RAN service in 1999, ''Kanimbla'' participated in numerous worldwide deployments, including the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]], the response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], and in response to the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état]]. During the ship's career, two helicopters were lost in crashes. After a fire broke out aboard ''Kanimbla'' in late 2010, she and sister ship {{HMAS|Manoora|L 52|2}} were removed from active service because of extensive problems found aboard both ships. The intention was to repair ''Kanimbla'' and return her to service by 2012, but this was deemed uneconomical. The ship was decommissioned in 2011, and sold for [[ship breaking|breaking]] in 2013.

==Design and construction==
The ship was laid down by [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company]] at [[San Diego, California]] for the USN on 24 May 1969 as [[Newport class tank landing ship|''Newport'' class]] tank landing ship {{USS|Saginaw|LST-1188|6}}.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;''Saginaw-II'', in ''Directory of American Naval Fighting Ships''&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 7 February 1970, sponsored by the wife of [[R. James Harvey]], a Congressman and former mayor of [[Saginaw, Michigan]], and commissioned into the [[United States Navy]] on 23 January 1971.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt; She was named after the city of [[Saginaw, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

==USN operational history==
{{main|USS Saginaw (LST-1188)}}

==Transfer and conversion==
In the early 1990s, the RAN initiated a procurement project to replace {{HMAS|Jervis Bay|GT 203|6}} with a dedicated training and helicopter support ship.&lt;ref name=spurling275&gt;Spurling, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting the vague specifications of the project required a purpose built vessel at an approximate cost of A$500 million.&lt;ref name=spurling275/&gt; The high cost of the project led to its cancellation by the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] in 1993, with the instructions to find a cheaper alternative.

In 1994, the RAN was able to acquire the surplus ''Saginaw'' and her sister ship [[USS Fairfax County (LST-1193)|''Fairfax County'']] for the combined price of A$61 million (US$40 million).&lt;ref name=spurling275/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scherer1&gt;Scherer, ''Senate hampers sale of Navy ships to eager nations''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saginaw'' was to be renamed ''Kanimbla''. Prior to ''Saginaw''{{'}}s decommissioning and transfer, a RAN crew was sent to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], for several weeks training aboard the vessel, as they were to sail her to Australia after she was commissioned into the RAN.&lt;ref name=Place43&gt;''Put in our place'', in ''Australia and World Affairs'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saginaw'' was decommissioned on 28 June 1994, but instead of being immediately recommissioned as HMAS ''Kanimbla'', it was announced at the decommissioning ceremony that the [[United States Congress]] had decided not to release the ships into foreign service.&lt;ref&gt;''Put in our place'', in ''Australia and World Affairs'', pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; The last-minute move was part of a sale blockage for fifteen surplus ''Newport''s to nine nations, and was caused by the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]] in an attempt to pressure US President [[Bill Clinton]] on the perceived running-down of the USN's amphibious warfare capability, as well as the concerns of one Senator over [[human rights in Morocco]] (one of the other nations slated to acquire a ''Newport'' class ship).&lt;ref name=Scherer1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Place44&gt;''Put in our place'', in ''Australia and World Affairs'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was not approved until the start of August, with the ship commissioned into the RAN on 29 August 1994.&lt;ref name=USOKS&gt;''US OKs sale of 2 ships'', in ''Sun Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SPCKanimbla2/&gt;

[[File:Kanimbla LCM-8.jpg|thumb|left|''Kanimbla'' with a LCM-8]]
''Kanimbla'' sailed to Australia in October, after training and maintenance checks were completed.&lt;ref name=USOKS/&gt; ''Kanimbla'' and ''Manoora'' were docked at [[Forgacs Group|Forgacs]] Dockyard in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], where they underwent conversion from tank landing ships to [[amphibious warfare]] transports.&lt;ref name=NEHRForgacs&gt;''Forgacs part of naval history'', in ''Newcastle Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion required the bow ramp to be removed and the bow doors welded shut.&lt;ref name=Macey1&gt;Macey, ''Navy in $70M Copter Carrier deal''&lt;/ref&gt; A hangar for three [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] or four [[UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopters was added, while the aft helicopter deck was reinforced.&lt;ref name=Janes100thp30&gt;Sharpe (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships 1997–1998'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] helicopters are able to land and take off from the aft deck, but cannot be carried long-term.&lt;ref name=Macey1/&gt; The deck forward of the superstructure was converted to carry two [[LCM-8]] landing craft, which are launched and recovered by a single 70&amp;nbsp;ton crane.&lt;ref name=Janes100thp30/&gt; When the LCM-8s are deployed, the area functions as a third helicopter landing spot.&lt;ref name=Macey1/&gt; Accommodation was provided for up to 450 soldiers, while improved medical facilities and an upgraded galley were also installed.&lt;ref name=NEHRForgacs/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spurling276&gt;Spurling, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

The refit was planned to last from 1995 to 1996, but did not conclude until late 1999, after extensive corrosion was discovered in both ships.&lt;ref name=spurling275/&gt; The refit cost for the two ships increased A$400 million, with half of the funding taken from repair and refit allocations for other ships.&lt;ref name=spurling275/&gt; During ''Kanimbla''{{'}}s conversion, a small fire started aboard, when a cigarette butt was dropped on piping insulation.&lt;ref name=AAPfire&gt;Australian Associated Press, ''Small fire on board Navy vessel''&lt;/ref&gt; The fire, which occurred on 8 February 1999, was extinguished quickly, and only caused superficial damage.&lt;ref name=AAPfire/&gt;

==RAN operational history==

===1995–2003===
During 1995, personnel from ''Kanimbla'' participated in celebrations for the 50th anniversaries of [[Victory in Europe]] Day and [[Victory in the Pacific]] Day.&lt;ref&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1999, personnel from ''Kanimbla'', ''Manoora'', and Sydney bases assisted the [[New South Wales Department of Agriculture]] in containing an outbreak of [[Newcastle disease]] in [[Mangrove Mountain]] poultry farms.&lt;ref&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April and June 2001, ''Kanimbla'' was sent to Vanuatu to provide disaster relief assistance following the eruption of the [[Lopevi]] volcano.&lt;ref&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; After this, from 2 June to 8 August 2001, the ship was deployed to the Solomon Islands to support the [[International Peace Monitoring Team]] following the signing of the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Following this,{{citation needed|date=November 2013|reason=Cited source only identifies the ship as participating at some point in the 1998-2003 operation}} ''Kanimbla'' operated in support of the [[Peace Monitoring Group]] (PMG) in [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville|Bougainville]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This was a short term assignment at the end of the Solomon Islands deployment to assist with backload of PMG equipment to Australia.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

On 2 December 2001, ''Kanmibla'' and the frigate {{HMAS|Adelaide|FFG 01|2}} were deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of [[Operation Slipper]], to enforce UN trade sanction against Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy Operations p. 44&quot;&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; This deployment concluded on 4 March 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy Operations p. 44&quot;/&gt; The ship returned to the Gulf on 13 February 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy Operations p. 48&quot;&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; During this deployment, which concluded on 14 June, she was involved in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], served as a command-and-control ship during operations in the northern waters of the Gulf, and helped deliver relief supplies to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy Operations p. 48&quot;/&gt; The ship received a [[Meritorious Unit Citation]] on 27 November 2003 for her service during this deployment.&lt;ref name=unitcitation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1055904&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true |title=It's An Honour – Honours |accessdate=22 February 2008 |quote=Citation: For meritorious service in warlike operations in the war against weapons of mass destruction, IRAQ, during Operations BASTILLE and FALCONER between February and May 2003.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–2006===
On 30 December 2004, ''Kanimbla'' sailed as part of [[Operation Sumatra Assist]], the Australian contribution to relief efforts following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy Operations p. 61&quot;&gt;Bendle et al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990–2005'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's involvement ended on 26 March 2005, and she sailed to Singapore, but was redeployed three days later after a new [[2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake|earthquake off the Sumatran coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy Operations p. 61&quot;/&gt; On 2 April, a [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter operating from ''Kanimbla'' [[2005 Nias Island WS-61 Sea King crash|crashed]] on the island of [[Nias]], killing nine of the eleven personnel aboard; the single deadliest incident in the Australian Defence Force since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, ''A dark history of crashes''&lt;/ref&gt; Operations did not conclude until 13 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Navy Operations p. 61&quot;/&gt;

[[File:HMAS Kanimbla in Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|HMAS ''Kanimbla'' at Darwin in July 2006]]
In May 2006, ''Kanimbla'' was deployed to East Timor as part of [[Operation Astute]], the Australian response to the [[2006 East Timorese crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham, ''Streets calmer, but peril remains''&lt;/ref&gt; The ship remained in the area until late July.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Associated Press, ''Peacekeepers to check weapons in E Timor&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of November 2006, ''Kanimbla'', {{HMAS|Newcastle|FFG 06|2}}, and {{HMAS|Success|AOR 304|2}} sailed to Fiji as part of [[Operation Quickstep]], the ADF response to threats of a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|coup d'état by Fijian military forces]].&lt;ref name=DT021106/&gt; The three vessels were to be used in the event of an evacuation of Australian citizens and nationals, but not as a military force.&lt;ref name=DT021106&gt;{{cite news |title=Aussie warships heading for Fiji |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November 2006, an [[Australian Army]] [[S-70|S-70A Black Hawk]] helicopter operating from ''Kanimbla'' crashed and fell overboard while attempting to land on the aft helicopter deck.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;ABC, ''One dead, one missing in Black Hawk crash off Fiji''&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ten Army personnel on board, seven were injured, one was killed, and the tenth was declared missing until his remains were found on 5 March 2007, trapped in the helicopter wreckage {{convert|3000|m|ft}} below sea level.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=AGE&gt;''Remains of SAS soldier found off Fiji'', in ''The Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2010===
In October 2007, ''Kanimbla'' visited New Zealand.&lt;ref name=kanNZ&gt;Royal Australian Navy, ''A 'chully in zid' experience for Kanimbla''&lt;/ref&gt; The ship had been previously scheduled to visit New Zealand on two occasions in 2006, but was unable to on both occasions due to short-notice operational deployments.&lt;ref name=kanNZ/&gt;

[[File:2009 SH Fleet Entry 013.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large grey warship underway. Flags are being flown from the ship's mast, and white-uniformed people line the decks. Brown cliffs line the horizon for the right two-thirds of the image|''Kanimbla'' performing a ceremonial entry into Sydney Harbour. The ocean-side cliffs of [[Sydney Heads#South Head|South Head]] are in the background.]]
On the morning of 13 March 2009, ''Kanimbla'' was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, ''Marching into History''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kanimbla'' was one of the thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review.

Following an overhaul of the RAN [[battle honour]] system completed in early 2010, ''Kanimbla'' was also granted the battle honours &quot;Persian Gulf 2001–2003&quot; and &quot;Iraq 2003&quot;.&lt;ref name=newhonours&gt;Royal Australian Navy, ''Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=honourslist&gt;Royal Australian Navy, ''Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours''&lt;/ref&gt; During July and August 2010, ''Kanimbla'' was one of three RAN ships to participate in the [[RIMPAC]] 2010 muntinational exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, ''No-show by subs slammed''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decommissioning and fate==
On 21 September 2010, ''Kanimbla'' was entering Sydney Harbour when a fire broke out aboard and caused the ship to lose power briefly.&lt;ref name=McPhedran18Oct10/&gt; Shortly after this, ''Kanimbla'' and sister ship ''Manoora'' were brought to Fleet Base East for an 'operational pause' after several problems were identified with both ships.&lt;ref name=McPhedran18Oct10&gt;McPhedran, ''The rust never sleeps on pride of navy fleet''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr15Oct10&gt;Kerr, ''Operational tempo and neglect spell problems for ageing Australian amphibs''&lt;/ref&gt; These included large quantities of corrosion and faults with the deck crane and alarm system, along with the need to overhaul the propulsion system, power generators, and air-conditioning, and upgrade the communication suite.&lt;ref name=McPhedran18Oct10/&gt; The problems have been attributed to the ship's high operational tempo, delays in maintenance, and the age of the ships.&lt;ref name=Kerr15Oct10/&gt;

''Manoora'' was marked for decommissioning in early 2011, but the intention at that time was to repair ''Kanimbla'' and return her to active service by mid-2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transition plan to Landing Helicopter Dock&quot;/&gt; However, the predicted timeframe and cost of the repairs (18 months and over $35 million), and the successful acquisition of the British [[landing ship dock]] {{Ship|RFA|Largs Bay|L3006|6}} (which entered RAN service at the end of 2011 as HMAS ''Choules'') prompted the Australian government to announce plans on 18 August 2011 to decommission ''Kanimbla''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanimbla to decommission&quot;/&gt; The decommissioning occurred on 25 November 2011.&lt;ref name=SPCKanimbla2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, ''Decommissioning marks end of an era''&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's capability will initially be replaced by ''Choules'', until the [[Canberra class landing helicopter dock|''Canberra'' class]] amphibious warfare ships enter service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transition plan to Landing Helicopter Dock&quot;&gt;Stephen Smith MP Minister for Defence, ''Transition plan to Landing Helicopter Dock''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanimbla to decommission&quot;&gt;Minister for Defence Materiel and Minister for Defence, ''Decommissioning of HMAS Kanimbla''&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the federal government offered ''Kanimbla'' and ''Manoora'' to the Queensland state government for [[scuttling]] as [[dive wreck]]s off the Queensland coast.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, ''Naval ships offered as dive sites for coast''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government chose not to go ahead with this, as it would cost $4 million each to prepare them for scuttling, and could provoke similar reactions to the contested sinking of the frigate {{HMAS|Adelaide|FFG 01|6}}.&lt;ref name=McPhedran030113&gt;McPhedran, ''Navy workhorses HMAS Manoora and HMAS Kanimbla to end careers as scrap''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ''Kanimbla'' is to be [[ship breaking|broken up]], with an estimated scrap metal value of $2.5 million.&lt;ref name=McPhedran030113/&gt; Because the two vessels were originally owned by the United States of America and were sold to Australia, their disposal had to receive US government approval and comply with [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]].&lt;ref name=ADM25jun13&gt;Australian Defence Magazine, ''Sale of decommissioned ships Manoora and Kanimbla''&lt;/ref&gt; Tendering for the disposal of the vessels began in June 2012, with the contract awarded to [[Southern Scrap Recycling|Southern Recycling LLC]] on 20 May 2013.&lt;ref name=ADM25jun13/&gt; The two vessels were returned to the United States, and [[ship breaking|broken up]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=SPCKanimbla2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-kanimbla-ii |title=HMAS Kanimbla (II) |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
