[[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] '''Sir James Anthony (Jim) Rowland''', {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|AC|KBE|DFC|AFC}} (1 November 1922&amp;nbsp;– 27&amp;nbsp;May 1999) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), serving as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) from 1975 to 1979. He later held office as [[Governor of New South Wales]] from 1981 to 1989, and was [[List of University of Sydney people#Administration|Chancellor of the University of Sydney]] from 1990 to 1991. Born in rural [[New South Wales]], Rowland cut short his [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]] studies at the [[University of Sydney]] to join the RAAF in 1942. He was posted to Britain and served as a bomber pilot with the [[Pathfinder Force|Pathfinders]] in the [[RAF Bomber Command#Strategic Bombing 1943-45|air war over Europe]], earning the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] in 1944. The following year he was forced to bail out over Germany following a collision with another Allied aircraft, and spent the rest of the war as a [[Prisoner of war#Western Allies' POWs|prisoner]].

After [[repatriation]] and [[demobilisation]], Rowland gained his engineering degree and rejoined the RAAF. He became a [[test pilot]], serving with and later commanding the [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|Aircraft Research and Development Unit]] in the 1950s, and also a senior engineering officer, being closely involved in preparations for delivery to Australia of the [[Dassault Mirage III]] supersonic fighter in the 1960s. In 1972 he was promoted to [[air vice marshal]] and became Air Member for Technical Services, holding this post until his elevation to air marshal and appointment as CAS in March 1975. He was the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and the first man to personally command it in a legal sense, following abolition of the Australian Air Board in 1976. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1977, Rowland retired from the Air Force in 1979 and became Governor of New South Wales in January 1981. He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in 1987. Retiring from the Governorship in 1989, he held a place on several boards as well as the Chancellorship of the University of Sydney.

Rowland was assigned to the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder Force]] that marked targets for other aircraft on [[RAF Bomber Command#Strategic Bombing 1943-45|strategic bombing missions over Europe]]. Considered an exceptional pilot, he became a master bomber with [[No.&amp;nbsp;635 Squadron RAF]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/134/Air-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Marshals|work=Air Marshals of the RAAF|publisher =[[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a master bomber, his role was to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, &quot;From Wagga to Waddington&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;635 Squadron operated Lancasters, a type that, Rowland recalled, &quot;would forgive sprog pilots doing the most outrageous things to it, and would even bring them home with quite large bits shot off it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/635squadron.cfm |title=635 Squadron|publisher= [[Royal Air Force]]|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Skylarks'', p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been promoted to acting [[flight lieutenant]], Rowland was on a [[sortie]] to attack [[Düsseldorf]] in December 1944 when he lost one of his engines. He nevertheless continued on to the target where, owing to his lower-than-normal altitude, his aircraft was seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire before and after he dropped his bombs. Nursing his plane back to base, he was recommended for the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] in recognition of his &quot;great determination and devotion to duty&quot;; the award was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 16&amp;nbsp;February 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DFC&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36942|startpage=931|supp=yes|date= 16 February 1945|accessdate=on 6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1945, Rowland's Lancaster collided with a Canadian bomber over [[Frankfurt]], and he had to bail out with his surviving crew. Captured and held by the [[Gestapo]] in solitary confinement, he was scheduled to be executed but was saved by two [[Luftwaffe]] officers who had learned of his situation. They took him to a prisoner-of-war camp, where he remained until being repatriated at the end of hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.warmemorialsregister.nsw.gov.au/content/air-marshal-sir-james-anthony-rowland |title=Air Marshal Sir James Anthony Rowland|work= Register of War Memorials in NSW|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of Rowland's crew survived the war and, though he believed he had done all he could to save them, he suffered [[survivor guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Lancaster Men'', p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowland's commission was terminated in November 1945. Returning to Australia, he resumed his studies at the University of Sydney and completed his degree, before rejoining the RAAF as a member of its newly formed Technical Branch in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; He was posted to Britain in 1949 to attend the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]].

The [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Defence Minister]], [[Philip McBride|Sir Philip McBride]], had reached a similar conclusion and kept the Sabre in frontline service until a more suitable aircraft could be chosen, namely the [[Dassault Mirage&amp;nbsp;III]] delta-wing fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 354–357&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to 1964 Rowland was based in Paris, as Technical Staff Officer on the RAAF team preparing for the Mirage's acceptance into Australian service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; In contrast to most of the team members, he displayed a talent for language and by his second year was chairing meetings in French with Dassault engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Susans, ''The RAAF Mirage Story'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Australia, he was posted to the Directorate of Aircraft Engineering at the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]], Canberra, responsible for ongoing technical oversight of the Mirage.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF News&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Buying a new aircraft poses many problems|magazine=RAAF News|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|date= January–February 1965|page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1966, Rowland became commanding officer of [[No. 3 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Aircraft Depot]] (No.&amp;nbsp;3 AD) at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, with the acting rank of [[group captain]]; his promotion was made substantive in November 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Officer postings Dec–Jan|magazine=RAAF News|publisher=Department of Defence |date= January–February 1967|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Officer promotions&amp;nbsp;– 1968|magazine=RAAF News|publisher=Department of Defence |date= November 1967|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his tenure at No.&amp;nbsp;3 AD in January 1969, Rowland was appointed Senior Engineering Staff Officer at [[RAAF Air Command|Headquarters Operational Command]] in [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Glenbrook]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWIA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 he was posted to Britain to attend the [[Royal College of Defence Studies]], London.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWIA&quot;/&gt; Returning to Australia, he was Director-General of Aircraft Engineering before being promoted to [[air vice marshal]] to serve as Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS), the RAAF's senior engineering position, in November 1972. The AMTS occupied a seat on the Australian Air Board, the service's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 75–76, 174–179&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1975, Rowland was raised to [[air marshal]] and took over from Air Marshal [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] as CAS, becoming the first appointee to the position who had joined the RAAF after the commencement of World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; He was also the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and was selected over a more senior air vice marshal through the personal influence of the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Defence Secretary]], [[Arthur Tange|Sir Arthur Tange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, ''The Quiet Man'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The CAS was nevertheless required to be a member of the Air Force's aircrew stream so Rowland, still a qualified pilot, had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch. Soon afterwards, the stipulation for the CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens296–297&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Rowland became the first CAS to personally command the RAAF in a legal sense, following dissolution of the Air Board, a consequence of defence reorganisation in the wake of the 1973 &quot;[[Arthur Tange|Tange report]]&quot; that recommended departmental rationalisation. A new Chief of the Air Staff Advisory Committee (CASAC) was set up, but there was no requirement for the CAS to accept its advice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens296–297&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Alan Stephens, Rowland considered that the &quot;collective wisdom&quot; engendered by the Air Board had been generally beneficial to the RAAF, and believed the new arrangements led to {{&quot; '}}paralysis and arrogation of decision making', and empire building in the Public Service component&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Chiefs&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Though known as a strong committee member who enjoyed a good argument, he &quot;found that the sheer time involved in attending meetings made it very difficult for him to run the Air Force 'the way [he] wanted to{{' &quot;}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Chiefs&quot;/&gt; To facilitate the cross-fertilisation of ideas on air power between senior officers, he inaugurated an annual CAS Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;Pickard, ''Air Power Doctrine Education'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; During his term as CAS, Rowland reoriented the RAAF's priorities in line with the [[Defence of Australia policy]], which had been adopted by the government in the early 1970s. As a result, he placed the strongest emphasis on protecting Australia from air attack, followed by conducting air strikes on targets in other countries, and supporting the [[Australian Army|Army]] and Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11&amp;nbsp;June 1977, Rowland was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the military division.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=47236|startpage=7125|supp=yes|date= 11 June 1977|accessdate=on 6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July the same year, he was awarded the [[National Medal (Australia)|National Medal]] with First Clasp, given &quot;for diligent long service to the community&quot;.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1027710&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true |title=National Medal|work= It's an Honour|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowland's original three-year tenure as CAS was extended by a year. He retired from the Air Force in March 1979, and was succeeded by his [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|deputy]] and former classmate at RAAF Staff College, Air Vice Marshal [[Neville McNamara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, ''The Quiet Man'', pp. 106, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw the role as the monarch's representative in New South Wales as helping to provide &quot;a valuable link with an older part of the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorial&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH 1980&quot;/&gt; Wran, for his part, was understood to have chosen Rowland largely on the basis of his engaging personality; it was also said that the Premier preferred military men for [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] office because &quot;they knew how to take orders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, &quot;Sir James Anthony Rowland&quot;, p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; Rowland was duly appointed by [[Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorial&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=48508|startpage=1309|date= 29 January 1981|accessdate=on 6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon taking office, he declared that he wished to be seen as a &quot;man of the people&quot;. To this end, he opened [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to the public on a more frequent basis, and also extended invitations for official functions to a broader range of society than was previously the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorial&quot;/&gt;

As Governor of New South Wales and therefore the senior state governor, Rowland held a [[dormant commission]] to serve as [[Administrator (Australia)|Administrator of the Commonwealth]] and Commander-in-Chief of the [[Australian Defence Force]] during absences by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor General]], and did so six times while in office.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Soldiers in Politics'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; On one such occasion he was required to dismiss an old colleague, Air Vice Marshal James Flemming,&lt;!---—who like Rowland had been involved in the introduction of the Mirage to Australia—from the latter's---&gt; from his position as director of the [[Australian War Memorial]], Canberra, after the Government lost faith in Flemming's ability to properly manage the Memorial. Rowland had served as one of Flemming's referees when he applied to head the Memorial in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH 1987&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKernan, ''Here Is Their Spirit'', pp. 341–342&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist and public servant Evan Williams also credited Rowland with being &quot;the first Viceregal whistleblower&quot; for alerting the Wran government to an unusual number of early release requests for prisoners that he was being asked to sign by [[Corrective Services NSW|Corrective Services Minister]] [[Rex Jackson]]. The inquiries set in motion by Rowland's queries revealed that Jackson was receiving money from criminals for misusing the early release scheme. Forced to resign, Jackson was later charged with corruption and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, &quot;Sir James Anthony Rowland&quot;, pp. xviii, 570–571&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowland was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Engineering by the University of Sydney in 1983, and also appointed a [[Knight of the Order of St John]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WWIA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UoS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/senate/documents/Other/Rowland.pdf|title=Sir James Rowland elected Chancellor|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|date=April 1990|accessdate=6 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011228/http://sydney.edu.au/senate/documents/Other/Rowland.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26&amp;nbsp;January 1987, he was invested as a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] for &quot;service to the Crown and to the people of New South Wales&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=885205&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true|title= Companion of the Order of Australia|work= It's an Honour|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sydney Town Hall]] on 3&amp;nbsp;October that year, he took the salute of [[Vietnam veteran]]s during their official &quot;Welcome Home March&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Korbl, ''Ex-Luftwaffe MBE'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; His governorship coincided with [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, &quot;Sir James Anthony Rowland&quot;, p. 575&lt;/ref&gt; A popular Governor, Rowland was considered by his [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] premiers to be &quot;a safe pair of hands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, &quot;Sir James Anthony Rowland&quot;, pp. 576–577&lt;/ref&gt; His original four-year term was extended twice, each time for two years, by the Wran and [[Barry Unsworth|Unsworth]] administrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parliament&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;April 1988, Rowland opened the Forty-Ninth New South Wales Parliament with a new premier, [[Nick Greiner]], whose [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] had defeated Labor in the March elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=New South Wales |title=First session of the Forty-Ninth Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LC19880427/$file/491LC001.PDF |house=Legislative Council |date= 28 April 1988|pages=1, 3, 5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426081424/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LC19880427/$file/491LC001.PDF| archivedate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=762|title=Parliament of New South Wales, Assembly election|work=Australian Politics and Elections Database|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]]|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That November, he took a turn at flying one of the RAAF's recently acquired [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornets]] piloted by Wing Commander (later Air Vice Marshal) John Kindler.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, &quot;Sir James Anthony Rowland&quot;, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1989 by Rear Admiral [[David Martin (governor)|Sir David Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/AListofGovernorsofNewSouthWales|title=A list of  Governors of New South Wales|publisher= Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=14 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306145619/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/AListofGovernorsofNewSouthWales|archivedate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from the Governorship, Rowland served as President of the [[Royal Humane Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.braveryaward.org/rhs/annual_reports/rhs_annual_report_2010.pdf |title= Annual Report Year Ended 30 June 2010 |publisher=[[Royal Humane Society]] |date=August 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of University of Sydney people#Administration|Chancellor of the University of Sydney]] from 1990 to 1991,&lt;ref name=&quot;UoS&quot;/&gt; and as a member of the [[New South Wales Police Force|Police Board]] from 1989 to 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eulogy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parliament&quot;/&gt; He was also a member of the boards of several private companies, including [[Angus &amp; Coote]] and [[Thomson-CSF|Thomson-CSF Pacific Holdings]], and Chairman of the Aerospace Foundation of Australia from 1992 until his death in Sydney on 27&amp;nbsp;May 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt; Sir James Rowland was survived by his wife and daughter, and accorded a state funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorial&quot;/&gt;
