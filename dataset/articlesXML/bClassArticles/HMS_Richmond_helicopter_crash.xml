The [[Westland Lynx]] helicopter attached to the [[Royal Navy]] frigate [[HMS Richmond (F239)|HMS ''Richmond'']] crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on 12 June 2002, killing two of the three on board. It had been returning to the ship after an air-to-ship missile live firing exercise, when it suffered a double engine failure.

The two fatalities were [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenants]] Rod Skidmore and Jenny Lewis, the pilot and [[Air observer|observer]] seated in the two-person cockpit; Lewis is believed to be the first female Royal Navy pilot or observer to die in service. A third crew member, Petty Officer Paul Hanson, survived after being rescued. He had been on board to record the exercise.

The helicopter went down approximately 200 miles off the eastern seaboard of the United States, necessitating the deepest salvage operation ever undertaken by the Ministry of Defence. Both the wreckage and the body of Skidmore were recovered, but Lewis's body was never found, leading the coroner to express regret that he was only permitted in law to record a verdict on Skidmore, of accidental death.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved in the incident was a Lynx helicopter,&lt;ref name=&quot;GovUK_28Oct10&quot; /&gt; which was from the Royal Naval Air Station in [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]], Somerset.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_13Jun02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Standard_13Jun02&quot; /&gt; The 15-year-old&lt;ref name=&quot;Register_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; Mark 8 Lynx was serial No. XZ256, at the time flying from the [[Type 23 frigate]] HMS ''Richmond''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukserials&quot; /&gt; Both XZ256&lt;ref name=&quot;ukserials&quot; /&gt; and Lieutenants Skidmore and Lewis were assigned to [[815 Naval Air Squadron]], based at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]] in Somerset.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yorkshire_13Jun02&quot; /&gt;

==Crash and rescue==
On 12 June 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt; the HMS ''Richmond'' was participating in a training exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_12Jun14&quot; /&gt; with the U.S. Navy&lt;ref name=&quot;IWCP_13Jun02&quot; /&gt; to test [[Sea Skua]] and [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]] missiles by firing them from a Lynx helicopter at a disused American warship&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt; at the Virginia Cape range.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukserials&quot; /&gt;

The Lynx helicopter attached to the Richmond&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; was being piloted by Lieutenant Rod Skidmore, 39, a British citizen and married father of two from Martinstown, Dorset.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_13Jun02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotsman_15Jun02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt; The flight observer was Lieutenant Jenny Lewis, 25, also a British citizen and one of three women in the forty-strong 815 Naval Air Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotsman_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; Lewis had been in the Navy for four years, previously serving on HMS ''London'' and HMS ''Northumberland''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotsman_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; Her family was from the Isle of Wight,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt; and she lived in Sherborne.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_12Jun14&quot; /&gt; Also on board was Paul Hanson, a petty officer working as a photographer,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; from St Helens, Merseyside. He was on board to video record the launch of the missiles and the damage that they caused.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt;

Whilst returning to the Richmond&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_13Jun02&quot; /&gt; in fair weather,&lt;ref name=&quot;Register_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; Lewis made an emergency call at low altitude around 40 miles from the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; As stated at the later inquest, Hanson heard a bang from the starboard engine, after which the helicopter nosedived into the Atlantic Ocean&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt; from a height of around 400ft.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyPost_26Jun03&quot; /&gt; The crash occurred 190 miles southeast of the US naval base at [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IWCP_13Jun02&quot; /&gt; A door of the helicopter was ripped off during the crash, which allowed Hanson to swim free of the craft as it started to sink.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyPost_26Jun03&quot; /&gt; He suffered only minor injuries, while Lewis and Skidmore were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; Five weeks later it was found that Hanson had suffered from two crushed vertebrae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portsmouth_13Aug02&quot; /&gt;

Following the accident, Hanson that he could see his fellow crew-members in the water as well, as &quot;there were two green helmets, they were no more than 50 or 60 feet away from me.&quot;, but after he swam to them he found that they were just empty floating helmets.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Portsmouth_13Aug02&quot; /&gt;

The wreck subsequently sank to 4,000m,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; as deep as the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Portsmouth_13Aug02&quot; /&gt; with very little debris left on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Standard_13Jun02&quot; /&gt;

In the aftermath of the crash, a joint search and rescue operation was launched by British and American authorities but was called off at sunset, with only Hanson being rescued.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_13Jun02&quot;/&gt; The crew of HMS ''Richmond'' held a memorial service on 13 June near the last reported position of the helicopter, including throwing a white Royal Navy [[ensign]] into the sea at the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt;

==Salvage operation and crash investigation==
Initial reports were that the craft had suffered double engine failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukserials&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; The MoD stated that there were no safety issues known with the Lynx at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; A Royal Navy board of inquiry was convened to investigate the crash, and British investigators flew to the US later in the week of the accident to interview Hanson and other involved people.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_15Jun02&quot; /&gt;

Lewis was &quot;the first female Lynx helicopter aircrew&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WesternDailyPress_13Jun14&quot; /&gt; and the first female pilot or observer to die while serving with the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotsman_15Jun02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WesternDailyPress_13Jun14&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WesternDailyPress_13Jun14&quot; /&gt;

The crash raised questions about the airworthiness of the helicopters, following from their grounding two years earlier from operational stress suffered by the core of the rotor blades, although the accident wasn't linked to that defect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Standard_13Jun02&quot; /&gt;

It was initially reported that the crashed helicopter would not be recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Register_15Jun02&quot; /&gt; However, MOD Salvage and Marine Operations (SALMO) Project Team later recovered the helicopter. At its depth of 4,000m this made it the deepest ever recovery of a crashed aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovUK_28Oct10&quot; /&gt; After recovery, the wreckage was transferred to the Flight Safety &amp; Accident Investigation Centre at Yeovilton.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukserials&quot; /&gt; The recovery enabled the accident investigators to identify a potentially serious defect with the aircraft, which was fixed immediately throughout the rest of the helicopter fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovUK_28Oct10&quot; /&gt;

Skidmore's body was later recovered from the ocean, but Lewis's body was never recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt;

The [[inquest]] into Skidmore's death, held in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] on Wednesday 25 June 2003, reached a verdict of accidental death for Skidmore. Coroner Michael Johnston explained that he was prevented by law from holding an inquest into Lewis's death as her body was not recovered, despite involving exactly the same circumstances - a situation he criticised while apologising to Lewis' mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt;

At the inquest, Hanson said that he thought that one of the engines had caught fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_25Jun03&quot; /&gt;

==Locomotive D6515 dedication==
[[File:33012 &amp; 73136 , Claycross.jpg|thumb|D6515 (nearest to camera) in 2011, since named ''Lt Jenny Lewis RN'']]

On 12 June 2014,&lt;ref name=&quot;Western_14Jul14&quot; /&gt; 12 years to the day after the crash, Lewis's death was commemorated by a [[flypast]] over Swanage station by a Lynx from RNAS Yeovilton, and the renaming of the preserved [[British Rail Class 33]] diesel-electric locomotive No. D6515 to ''Lt Jenny Lewis RN''. Lewis was a fan of the class. The locomotive was used to haul trains between [[London]] and [[Corfe Castle]] and [[Swanage]] in 1966,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_12Jun14&quot; /&gt; and the 77-tonne locomotive was recently overhauled to mainline standards. Lewis's father became a major shareholder in the overhaul project after her death.&lt;ref name=&quot;WesternDailyPress_13Jun14&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BornemouthEcho_16Jun14&quot; /&gt;
