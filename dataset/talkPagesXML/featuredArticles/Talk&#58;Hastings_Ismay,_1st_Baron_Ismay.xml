*[[Hastings Lionel Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay]] - The biography is simply a list of important dates. [[User:Mackensen|Mackensen]] [[User_talk:Mackensen|(talk)]] 19:25, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

Lord Ismay was survived by three daughters, Susan, Mary and Sarah.

==Improvements==
I have just completed the B class checklist and feel that the article could be improved slightly. There are a few in line citations that could be consolidated using the namedrefs system. Many of them have been done, but I think there are still twelve that could be consolidated (4 &amp; 5, 37 &amp; 38, 41 &amp; 42, 112 &amp; 113, 118 &amp; 119, 150 &amp; 151). I might have missed a couple, though. Other than that it seems great. Maybe also include in the in line citations the year (e.g. Rupert 2008, p. 8.) making sure to include the full stop. This is, however, a personal preference and I don't think it should affect a GA nomination. I'd do the GA nom myself, but the process confuses me. Great work. [[User:AustralianRupert|AustralianRupert]] ([[User talk:AustralianRupert|talk]]) 01:23, 8 April 2009 (UTC)
:Thanks so much for reviewing.  I've consolidate those refs (thanks for pointing them out), and I looked through for other duplicates, but I don't see any.  As for the year with the notes, I tend to only use the year when an author wrote multiple pieces; otherwise it doesn't seem necessary.

::Many of the references to Times articles could be replaced by the original ''[[London Gazette]]'' article, which are freely available as pdfs http://www.london-gazette.co.uk whereas access to ''The Times'' requires subscription, and/or a visit to a public library.  Also, whilst it makes sense to generally reference a book by author and page umber, and give fulld etails fo the book in a aseparate seciton, it seems rather user-unfreindly to do the same thing with articles and so on wehre there isn't normally the issue of having to refer to a specific page, easier just to give the full detils in the reference, rather than forcing a reader to then scroll through a whole separate set of articles to tie it back to the one that's meant (this seems to be a more typical way of hadnling references within Wikipedia as well).  [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 17:38, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
:::As per the suggestion about the London Gazette, that's not a bad idea, but the Times articles work perfectly well.  If you feel called to convert references to the Gazette, then feel free, but otherwise I think it's fine to reference The Times.  As for the referencing style, I've just the article names in order to maintain consistency.  It allows the references to be placed into multiple columns (thus taking up less screen space), and it's a reasonably common practice elsewhere.  Another advantage (at least in my opinion) is that it presents a single and uninterrupted list of all references used, so that you don't have to look through each note to find them all.  If other support a change though, I wouldn't particularly object. [[User:Cool3|Cool3]] ([[User talk:Cool3|talk]]) 17:54, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
::::I don't see that using the full details in the main reference stops the use of multiple columns.  This way, not only does a reader have to scroll through more to get the full details fo all the references, but the editor has to edit in two entirely different places every time a new ref is added, rather than only having to do that when adding a book for the first time, and other references need only e added where they are actually used.  This way of doing things seems to me to make it harder to maintain the article.  Of course ''The Times'' is a perfectly good reference, but it's not the very best in this instance, the ''London Gazette'' is the [[journal of record]], it's the publication there which to a large extent makes a promotion have effect, or an honour to be legally recognised.

==Extra quote mark==
[[Jock Colville]], Churchill's private secretary, wrote that Ismay had the &quot;tact, patience, and skill in promoting compromise&quot; needed to keep the war running smoothly.&quot; I didn't add any quote marks to the previous sentence; all three are in the original. Which of the three begins the quotation, and which of the three ends it? Ideally, it should be corrected by someone with access to this reference: {{Cite book|title = Winston Churchill and His Inner Circle |page= 161| first = John| last = Colville| publisher = Wyndham Books| location = New York| year= 1981| isbn = 0-671-42583-8| oclc = 7283766}} [[User:Art LaPella|Art LaPella]] ([[User talk:Art LaPella|talk]]) 17:05, 6 September 2010 (UTC)

==Language==
Is this intended to be in English or American spelling? At present it is a mixture of the two. It is mostly English but, e.g. &quot;After completing the program&quot;, &quot;skeptical&quot; &quot;Companions of Honour, an honor&quot; etc

Secretary of the CID, clerk of the Privy Council, and Secretary to the Cabinet: mix of upper and lower case for titles. - [[User:Tim riley|Tim riley]] ([[User talk:Tim riley|talk]]) 18:53, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

(Most ungraciously omitted to add that this is an excellent article!) [[User:Tim riley|Tim riley]] ([[User talk:Tim riley|talk]]) 18:54, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

==&quot;General&quot; in lead==
I don't believe it's wise to address article subjects in a way that smacks of honorofics, but [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)]] seems to be rather unclear about the matter. I can't recall seeing any general consensus about beginning biographical articles with titles, so I've tried to get a discussion going over at [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (biographies)#Ranks of people]].
