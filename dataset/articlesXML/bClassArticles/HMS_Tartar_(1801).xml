'''HMS ''Tartar''''' was a 32-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[Narcissus class frigate|''Narcissus''-class]] [[Sailing frigate|frigate]] of the [[Royal Navy]], built at [[Frindsbury]] and launched in 1801. She captured privateers on the [[Jamaica Station (Royal Navy)|Jamaica station]] and fought in the [[Gunboat War]] and elsewhere in the Baltic before being lost to grounding off Estonia in 1811.

==Jamaica station==

Captain [[James Walker (Royal Navy officer)|James Walker]] commissioned ''Tartar'' in July 1801. She sailed for Jamaica in October.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1802 Captain [[Charles Inglis (d. 1833)|Charles Inglis]] took command.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; On 30 August 1802 ''Tartar'' was among the British warships sharing in the capture of the French [[tartane]] ''Concezione''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15543|startpage=1360|date=21 December 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803 Captain [[John Perkins (Royal Navy officer)|John Perkins]] succeeded Inglis.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; ''Tartar'' was in Captain [[John Loring (d. 1808)|John Loring's]] squadron at the [[Blockade of Saint-Domingue]] when {{HMS|Vanguard|1787|2}} captured the 74-gun {{Ship|French ship|Duquesne|1787|2}} on 25 July off [[Saint-Domingue]]. ''Tartar'' outsailed her larger companions and kept ''Duquesne'' engaged until {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|2}} came up, at which point ''Duquesne'' surrendered.&lt;ref name=LG15642&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15642|startpage=1553|date=10 November 1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ3186&quot;&gt;James (1837), Vol. 3, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NAK2&quot;&gt;National Archives, Kew: ADM 51/1447 Captains' logs Tartar 16 April 1802 – 30 April 1804&lt;/ref&gt;

As the British warships and their prize were sailing between the two islands of St. Domingo and [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortudo]], near [[Port-de-Paix|Port-au-Paix]], they met up with the French schooner ''Oiseaux''. She was armed with 16 guns and her crew of 60 men was under the command of ''Lieutenant de Vaisseau'' Druault. Loring ordered ''Vanguard'' and ''Tartar'' to escort ''Duquesne'' and [[French schooner (1801)|''Oiseau'']] to Port Royal.&lt;ref name=LG15642/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The prize money for ''Duquesne'' allocated to a seaman on the British ships, including ''Tartar'', was 2s 11d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15892|startpage=244|date=22 February 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Between 20 November and 4 December 1803 ''Tartar'' was in company with Captain Loring's squadron when the squadron captured the French frigates {{Ship|French frigate|Clorinde|1801|2}}, {{Ship|French frigate|Surveillante|1802|2}}, and [[French frigate Vertu (1794)|''Vertu'']], the [[brig]] {{HMS|Cerf|1803|2}}, and the [[schooner]] [[French schooner Découverte (1800)|''Découverte'']].&lt;ref name=LG15935&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15935|date=8 July 1806|startpage=861}}&lt;/ref&gt; All five were taken into British service. ''Surveillante'' had on board at her surrender [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|General Rochambeau]] the commander of the French forces on [[Saint-Domingue]].{{#tag:ref|The head money for an ordinary seaman arising out of the captures was 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 6 [[pence|d]].&lt;ref name=LG15935/&gt;|group=Note}} On 1 December the squadron detained the ''Hiram'' for a breach of the blockade of Cape Francois.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16582|startpage=477|date=10 March 1812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803 and 1804 Perkins escorted Edward Corbet to Haiti. Corbet had been appointed to liaise with [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], the new governor general and later first Emperor of Haiti. These missions were often less than successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;LN311&quot;&gt;Wright ''et al''. (2002), p. 311-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1804 ''Tartar'' was on the Jamaica Station under Captain Keith Maxwell, who had received promotion to [[post-captain]] on 1 May.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Around this time ''Tartar'' grounded in Murray's Roads, Bermuda. The tiny 4-gun schooner {{HMS|Mackerel|1804|6}} came to ''Tartar{{'}}''s assistance, temporarily salvaging the main deck guns and bower anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, pp.315-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July ''Tartar'' sighted a schooner. Maxwell set off to prevent the schooner from entering the narrow and intricate channel between the island of [[Saona]] and [[Hispaniola|San Domingo]] where it would be difficult for him to pursue. As ''Tartar'' got closer he saw that the schooner was using her sweeps to aid her.&lt;ref name=LG15745/&gt; Her behaviour made Maxwell suspect that his quarry was a privateer so he pursued her until neither vessel could progress farther. At that point, Maxwell was unable to get ''Tartar'' into a position from which she could use her broadside.&lt;ref name=LG15745/&gt; Instead, he sent in a cutting out party in three boats. As the boats set out, their quarry fired a gun, hoisted French colours, and then opened fire on the boats. The schooner was not able to deter the attack and the British captured her with no more casualties than two men wounded. The French lost nine killed and six wounded, as well as three missing, presumed drowned when they tried to swim to shore.&lt;ref name=LG15745/&gt; Maxwell sent the wounded to San Domingo under flag of truce, but kept the other Frenchmen prisoners, there being no English prisoners available for exchange. The privateer was ''Hirondelle'', under the command of Captain La Place. She was armed with ten 4-pounder guns and had been out of San Domingo for two days. She had been active during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and for the past two years also, having frequently escaped pursuit due to her speed.&lt;ref name=LG15745&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15745|startpage=1282|endpage=1283|date=13 October 1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1804, Captain [[Edward Hawker]] joined ''Tartar'' from {{HMS|Theseus|1786|2}} and sailed her from Jamaica to the Halifax station. On 9 January 1805 ''Tartar'', in company with [[French frigate Surveillante (1802)|''Surveillante'']], captured the Spanish ship ''Batidor.''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16253|date=2 May 1809|startpage=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 1806 ''Tartar'' captured the American brig ''Romulus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16146|date=18 April 1807|startpage=700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 9 June ''Tartar'' and the 10-gun cutter {{HMS|Bacchus|1806|2}} captured the French navy brig [[French brig Observateur (1800)|''Observateur'']], of 18 guns and 104 men, which was under the command of Captain Crozier. ''Observateur'' had sailed from Cayenne on 13 May with the brig-of-war ''Argus'', with provisions for a four-month cruise but had not captured anything.&lt;ref name=LG15941&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15941|startpage=951|endpage=952|date=29 July 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS ''Observateur''.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield (2008), p.316.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August ''Tartar'' captured the Charlestown [[Packet ship|packet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16359|date=7 April 1810|startpage=531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year Captain Hawker exchanged with Captain Stephen Poyntz of {{HMS|Melampus|1785|2}} and ''Tartar'' returned to England under reduced masts as a consequence of damage she had sustained in a hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1925), Vol. 2, Part 2, p.901.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tartar'' was paid off in October 1807. Then between October and April 1808 she underwent repairs, which cost [[pound sterling|£]]18,700.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Gunboat War==

In October, Captain [[George Edmund Byron Bettesworth|George Bettesworth]] took command while ''Tartar'' was fitting out at Deptford for service in the Baltic.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; This was early in the [[Gunboat War]] between Britain and Denmark-Norway.

In what became known as the [[Battle of Alvøen]], ''Tartar'' sailed to attack the Dutch frigate ''Guelderland'', of thirty-six 6 and 12-pounder guns, which had been reported to be in Bergen being repaired. ''Guederland'' had been escorting a small convoy to Batavia but then had to deviate to deal with a leak that she had developed.&lt;ref name=James5&gt;James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.34-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tartar'' left Leith roads on 10 May 1807 and arrived off Bergen on the 12th, but heavy fog prevented her from getting closer until three days later. Unfortunately, by the time ''Tartar'' arrived,  ''Guelderland'' had sailed more than a week earlier. Bettesworth nevertheless decided to send his boats into the harbour to cut out some merchant vessels and three privateers that were there. When the boats encountered heavy fire and discovered that [[Boom (navigational barrier)|a heavy chain]] protected the ships in the harbour, they and Bettesworth returned to ''Tartar''.&lt;ref name=James5/&gt; However, as ''Tartar'' tried to withdraw, she came  attack from the schooner ''Odin'' and between three and six gunboats (accounts differ).&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson (1810), p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon fire from the Norwegians killed Bettesworth and a midshipman, Henry FitzHugh, early in the action. A further twelve men were wounded before ''Tartar'' was able to complete her  withdrawal.&lt;ref name=James5/&gt; The Danes lost four men,&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; and a gunboat.

Captain [[Joseph Baker (captain)|Joseph Baker]] replaced Bettesworth in May.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; On 3 November ''Tartar'' was escorting a convoy in the Naze of Norway. She was twelve [[League (unit)|leagues]] off Bovenbergen (Bovbjerg, Jutland) when she sighted a sloop that after a chase of three hours she captured. The sloop was the Danish privateer ''Naargske Gutten'', of seven 6 and 4-pounder guns and 36 men. She was quite new and only one day out from [[Christiansand]], without having made any captures.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16199|date=8 November 1808|startpage=1519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later ''Tartar'' was in company with {{HMS|Constant|1801|2}} when they captured ''Jonge Minert''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16390|date=24 July 1810|startpage=1105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 1808, ''Tartar'' was in company with {{HMS|Cygnet|1804|2}} when ''Cygnet'' captured the Dutch privateer ''Christiana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16223|date=28 February 1809|startpage=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cygnet'' chased the privateer brig for nine hours before she could capture her. ''Christiana'' was a former British merchant brig now armed with twelve 12-pounder [[carronade]]s and two long 9-pounder guns, and had a crew of 60 men. She had provisions for a one-month cruise and had sailed three days earlier from [[Oslo|Christiana]] to intercept the homeward-bound Greenland-men off the north of Shetland.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16168|date=5 March 1811|startpage=1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 11 and 16 March 1809, ''Tartar'', {{HMS|Ranger|1807|2}}, and {{HMS|Rose|1806|2}} captured sundry Danish vessels in the Baltic.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16349|date=10 March 1810|startpage=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March ''Tartar'' captured the Danish privateer ''Falcon'', while ''Ranger'' and ''Rose'' shared by agreement.&lt;ref name=LG17096&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17096|date=2 January 1816|startpage=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Baker received £3 14s 9d; an ordinary seaman received 11¼d.&lt;ref name=LG17098/&gt;|group=Note}}

Three days later ''Tartar'' captured ''Kron Prince Frederick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16340|date=6 February 1810|startpage=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was carrying a cargo of spices that the [[Honourable East India Company]] sold.&lt;ref name=LG16542&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16542|date=6 April 1811|startpage=2223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tartar'' shared with {{HMS|Orion|1787|2}}, {{HMS|Superb|1798|2}}, and {{HMS|Cruizer|1797|2}} in the capture on 8 April of ''Vergnugen'' and ''Gustaff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16357|date=31 March 1810|startpage=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the same four warships captured ''Caroline'',&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16471|date=2 April 1811|startpage=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tartar'', apparently alone, captured ''St Johannes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16464|date=16 March 1811|startpage=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then on 10 and 11 April, ''Tartar'' was in company with ''Orion'', ''Superb'' and ''Cruizer'' when they captured the Danish sloop ''Brigetta'' and the Prussian [[galiot]] ''Erwartnung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16461|date=5 March 1811|startpage=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the month, on 30 April, ''Tartar'' captured ''Charlotte'', with ''Superb'', {{HMS|Stately|1784|2}}, ''Vanguard'', [[HMS Allart (1807)|''Allart'']], ''Constant'', {{HMS|Monkey|1801|2}}, and {{HMS|Urgent|1804|2}} being in sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16903|date=15 January 1814|startpage=1139}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|An ordinary seaman received 17s 9d; a lieutenant commanding received £16 1s 1¾d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16934|date=13 September 1814|startpage=1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} That same day ''Tartar'', ''Superb'' and ''Constant'' captured ''Maria Dorothea''.{{refn|The prize money for an ordinary seaman was £1 12s 4d; Baker received £251 4s 1½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17022|date=10 June 1815|startpage=1110}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 15 May 1809, Baker and ''Tartar'' chased a Danish privateer sloop near [[Jūrkalne|Felixberg]] on the coast of [[Courland]].&lt;ref name=LG16266/&gt; The sloop was armed with two 12-pounders on slides and two long 4-pounders, and carried a crew of 24. Her crew ran her ashore and then left her, taking their muskets up behind some sandhills where some local civilians joined them. Baker, concerned that the schooner might harm British trade, sent in his boats to bring her out or destroy her.&lt;ref name=LG16266/&gt; The British cutting out party boarded the privateer, without loss despite the small arms fire from the beach, got her off the shore, and turned her guns on the beach. While the boarding party was securing the vessel, one of the men fortunately discovered a lighted candle set in a powder cartridge in the magazine and extinguished it when it had only a half an inch to burn. The privateer's [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] contained about a hundredweight of powder; had it exploded it would have killed the boarding party.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Baker considered this artifice a &quot;dishonourable Mode of Warfare&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The prize crew then brought the sloop off.&lt;ref name=LG16266&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16266|date=13 June 1809|startpage=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privateer was probably ''Felix''.&lt;ref name=LG17096/&gt;{{refn|Baker received £43 7s 6d in prize money; an ordinary seaman received 8s 7d.&lt;ref name=LG17098&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17098|date=9 January 1816|startpage=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 28 October 1809 {{HMS|Cheerful|1806|2}} captured ''Destrigheiden'', ''Rinaldine'' and a sloop, name unknown, while in the company of ''Tartar'' and {{HMS|Lynx|1794|2}}. By agreement, Commander John Willoughby Marshall of ''Lynx'' and Baker of ''Tartar'' pooled their share of the prize money with that due Lieutenant Daniel Carpenter, the commander of the ''Cheerful''.{{refn|As a result, each of the three received £29 5s 2¾d. Without the pooling Carpenter, because of his junior rank, would only have received £7 10s 5¾.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16960|startpage=2347|date=26 November 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ordinary seaman received 10s 9¾d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17050|startpage=1649|date=12 August 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On 13 April 1810 ''Tartar'' captured Crown Sloop ''No. 9''.&lt;ref name=LG16542/&gt; Then four days later ''Tartar'' and {{HMS|Nightingale|1805|2}} were in sight when {{HMS|Mercurius|1807|2}} captured ''Enighied''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16459|date=5 February 1811|startpage=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tartar'' and {{HMS|Raleigh|1806|2}} were in company when they captured ''Twende Broders'' on 31 July.&lt;ref name=LG16542/&gt; ''Tartar'' then captured ''Anna Maria Elizabeth'' and ''Enigheit'' on 6 and 7 August with ''Emanuel'' and ''Eliza Maria'' following on 11 and 10 August.&lt;ref name=LG16542/&gt;

==Battle of Anholt==

At the beginning of February 1811 [[James Wilkes Maurice|Captain Maurice]] of the [[Royal Navy]] warned Vice Admiral Sir [[James Saumarez]] that the Danes were planning an attack on the island of [[Anholt (Denmark)|Anholt]], on which there was a small British garrison of which Maurice was the commander.&lt;ref name=LG16473a&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16473|date=6 April 1811|startpage=648|endpage=651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice received further confirmation of the attack on 8 March. Saumarez ordered ''Tartar'' and ''Sheldrake'' to sail to Anholt to provide support. They left Yarmouth on 20 March and anchored off the north end of the island on 26 March.

The next day the British garrison sighted the invasion force off the south side of the island. Maurice marched to meet them with a battery of howitzers and 200 infantry, but was not able to forestall a landing. He therefore pulled back to prepared positions and  alerted ''Tartar'' and ''Sheldrake'' that the enemy was on shore.&lt;ref name=LG16473a/&gt; The two vessels immediately set sail, with ''Tartar'' going around one side of the island and ''Sheldrake'' the other. However, the shoals forced ''Tartar'' to swing wide, delaying her by many hours.

The Danes, who had eighteen heavy gunboats for support, had landed more than 1000 troops in the darkness and fog. They were poorly equipped and their attack was uncoordinated, with the result that the British batteries at Fort Yorke (the British base) and Massareenes stopped the assault.&lt;ref name=LG16473a/&gt; Gunfire from ''Tartar'' and ''Sheldrake'' forced the gunboats to move off westwards.

The gunboats made their escape over the reefs while the ships had to sail around the outside.&lt;ref name=LG16453b/&gt; ''Tartar'' chased three gunboats towards [[Læsø]] but found herself in shoal water as night approached and gave up the chase. On the way back ''Tartar'' captured two Danish transports that she had passed while chasing the gunboats; one of them had 22 soldiers on board, with a considerable quantity of ammunition, shells and the like, while the other contained provisions.&lt;ref name=LG16453b/&gt; ''Sheldrake'' managed to capture two gunboats.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16473|date=6 April 1811|startpage=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of the Danish invasion force managed to board fourteen gunboats on the western side of Anholt and make their escape that way.&lt;ref name=LG16473a/&gt; The [[Battle of Anholt]] cost the British only two killed and 30 wounded. The Danes lost their commander, three other officers, and 50 men killed. The British took, besides the wounded, five captains, nine lieutenants, and 504 rank and file as prisoners, as well as three pieces of artillery, 500 muskets, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name=LG16473a/&gt; In addition, ''Sheldrake''{{'}}s two captured gunboats resulted in another two lieutenants of the Danish Navy and 119 men falling prisoner.&lt;ref name=LG16453b/&gt;

The Danish troops came from the 2nd Battalion of Jutland Sharp Shooters, 4th Battalion 2d Regiment Jutland Jagers and the 4th Battalion lst Regiment Jutland Infantry. Maurice sent a flag of truce to Jutland offering to release the prisoners on their parole not to serve until exchanged. Baker proposed that if the Danish authorities agreed to these terms, that he would take all the prisoners to [[Randers]] to exchange for the officers and crew of the sloop {{HMS|Pandora|1806|2}} which had wrecked off Jutland on 13 February 1811.&lt;ref name=LG16453b&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16473|startpage=651|endpage=652|date=6 April 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Admiralty had declared the island of Anholt a vessel, &quot;HMS ''Anholt''&quot;, for administrative purposes, ''Tartar'' shared with her and ''Sheldrake'' in the head money for the battle and for gunboats ''No.1'' and ''No. 7'', which ''Sheldrake'' had taken. HMS ''Anholt'' also had a schooner, the ''Anholt'', as a tender. She had been cruising looking for enemy vessels but had returned in time to take part in the battle. All four vessels, i.e., including the island HMS ''Anholt'', also shared in the money for the ordnance stores captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16665|date=7 November 1812|startpage=2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Anholt 27 March 1811&quot; to the remaining British survivors of the battle.

''Tartar'' and {{HMS|Ethalion|1802|2}} captured ''St. Helena'' (4 June), ''St. Johannes'' (5 June), ''St. Alexa'' (26 June), and the packet of Abo (4 July).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16683|date=21 November 1812|startpage=2551}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June they captured the ''Commerce''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16831|date=25 December 1813|startpage=2682}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on 27 July 1811, ''Tartar'' and ''Ethalion'' were in sight when {{HMS|Fisgard|1797|2}} captured the ''St Ivan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16667|date=10 November 1812|startpage=2275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June and July the two warships also captured the Danish galiots Nos. 7 and 9, the ''St. Peter'' and ''St. Simeon'', and the sloop ''Expressen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16684|date=22 December 1812|startpage=2276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==

''Tartar'' grounded on 18 August 1811 on [[Hiiumaa|Dagö Island]] off the coast of Estonia and sprang a leak. Her crew was able to refloat her but she continued to fill with water. Baker then ran her ashore on 21 August at Kahar Islet, midway between Dagö Island and the Isle of Worms; he later burned her to prevent her capture.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.137.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethalion'' rescued all her crew, who then were re-assigned to other ships on the Baltic station. A court martial on 23 October honorably acquitted Captain Baker, his officers and crew of ''Tartar{{'}}''s loss.&lt;ref&gt;Grocott (1997), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curiously, there are prize money notices crediting ''Tartar'' and ''Ethalion'' with the capture on 11 September of the ''Primus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16750|date=6 July 1813|startpage=1342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post script==
On the Sunday prior to 6 November, a Russian [[galiot]] that ''Tartar'' had captured was laying stranded at [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. The river had carried her and deposited her on the beach. A strong tide then lifted her, causing her to drift out to sea where she was dashed to pieces on the Ness (probably Scurdie Ness).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 November 1811, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
