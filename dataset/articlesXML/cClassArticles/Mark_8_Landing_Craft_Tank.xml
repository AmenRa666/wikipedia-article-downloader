The '''Mark 8 Landing Craft Tank''' (also referred to as the '''LCT (8)''' or '''LCT Mark VIII''') were [[landing craft tank]] ships operated by the [[British Armed Forces]]. The vessels were based on an American design, but improved into ocean-going vessels capable of transiting to and operating in the [[Far East]].

Although 187 vessels were ordered, the end of the [[Second World War]] meant that only 30 were completed for service in the [[Royal Navy]], while another 6 were sold to civilian parties. 12 of the Royal Navy vessels were, from 1957, transferred to the [[British Army]]; these were initially operated by the [[Royal Army Service Corps]], then by the [[Royal Corps of Transport]]. Between 1958 and 1966, the other 18 Royal Navy ships were transferred or sold to foreign navies or civilian companies, converted for other uses, or otherwise disposed of. Several Army Mark 8s were also sold to foreign powers, with the design operated by the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]], the [[French Navy]], the [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Singaporean Navy]], and the [[Military of Comoros]].

During their service life, vessels of the class operated during the [[Suez Crisis]] and [[Indonesian Confrontation]], and were involved in the setup and supply to guided weapons bases in the [[Hebrides]] as part of [[Operation Hardrock]].

==Design==
In October 1943, the [[Director of Naval Construction]] was instructed to prepare plans for a class of Landing Craft Tank vessels suitable for travelling to and operating in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name=Brown51&gt;Brown (ed.), ''The Design and Construction of British Warships'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; They had to be capable of ocean operations and able to keep up with [[Landing Ship, Infantry]] convoys.&lt;ref name=USNIs1p37&gt;US Division of Naval Intelligence, ''Allied Landing Craft of World War II'', Supplement No. 1, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton458&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; Greater ranges and more lengthy periods of sustained operation than in the European or Mediterranean theatres would require a larger vessel with better [[seakeeping]] ability.&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt; Design and capabilities were heavily influenced by the United States' Mark 7 LCT (which was later re-categorised as [[Landing Ship Medium]]), which was capable of transporting multiple tanks over large distances.&lt;ref name=Bishop&gt;Bishop, ''The Encyclopaedia of Weapons of WWII'', p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; The Mark 8 was a synthesis of the best qualities of previous amphibious warfare vessels: the design was based on an enlarged version of the [[Landing craft tank#Mark 4|Mark 4 LCT]], incorporating its light construction and suitability for mass-production, while including the robustness of the [[Landing craft tank#Mark 3|Mark 3]] design, and adopting the bow layout and other elements from the [[Landing Ship, Tank#LST Mk.2|Mark 2 Landing Ship Tank]].&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt;&lt;ref name=USNIs1p37/&gt;

[[File:HMAV Abbeville (L4041) - At Rhu Hard - July 1977.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Polaris missile]] being unloaded from the tank deck of HMAV ''Abbeville'' in 1977]]
The vessels were {{convert|225|ft|m}} long [[between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|231.2|ft|m}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a beam of {{convert|38|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Janes71st&gt;Blackman (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships, 1968–69'', p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Although retaining the open tank deck of previous LCT designs, the Mark 8 was protected by a taller bow section, which was fitted with powered doors and ramp.&lt;ref name=Lenton458/&gt; The capacity was eight 30-ton tanks, up to 13 fully loaded 3-ton trucks, or 350 tons of cargo.&lt;ref name=USNIs1p37/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton460&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum displacement and draught varied depending on the loadout: trucks would result in a 650-ton displacement, {{convert|3|ft|adj=on}} draught at the bow, and {{convert|4|ft|8|in|adj=on}} draught at the stern; for tanks, it was 780 tons, {{convert|3|ft|9|in}} forward, and {{convert|5|ft}} aft; while a full load of cargo resulted in a displacement of 880 tons, and draughts of {{convert|4|ft|8|in}} and {{convert|5|ft|2|in}}.&lt;ref name=USNIs1p37/&gt; Maximum displacement was 1,017 tons.&lt;ref name=Janes71st/&gt; The deeper draughts compared to previous vessels helped improve seakeeping.&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt;

An enlarged engine room compared to previous designs allowed the installation of four {{convert|460|shp}}, 12-cylinder Davey [[Paxman (engines)|Paxman]] 12TPM [[diesel engine]]s, coupled in two tandem sets to drive the two propeller shafts.&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paxman&gt;Carr, ''Paxman and the Royal Navy''&lt;/ref&gt; These had a maximum combined output of {{convert|1,840|bhp}} (roughly doubling that of previous LCTs), although output was capped at {{convert|1,600|bhp}}.&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton458/&gt; Cruising speed was {{convert|8|kn}}, with a maximum speed of {{convert|12.5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Janes71st/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt; The landing craft could travel {{convert|4000|nmi}} at cruising speed, or {{convert|2500|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Janes71st/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt;

The expanded engine room required a lengthening of the [[poop deck]], which allowed for improved accommodation spaces and an enlarged superstructure.&lt;ref name=Lenton458/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt; During design, the vessel's complement was pegged at 25 (including three officers), but by the late 1960s, this had expanded to between 33 and 37.&lt;ref name=USNIs1p37/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janes71st/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt; Additional accommodation was provided for up to 42 personnel (including six officers): typically the crews of any vehicles being transported.&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt; For defence, the vessels were fitted with four single [[20 mm Oerlikon]] guns.&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt; There were also plans to fit some of the vessels with a Hedgerow:&lt;ref name=USNIs1p37/&gt; a modified [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar]] which would be fired to clear mines and obstructions from beaches prior to the landing of troops.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The bridge, wireless telegraphy office, and gun platforms were armoured with {{convert|0.25|in|adj=on}}, {{convert|15|lb|adj=on}} D1 HT plating.&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt;&lt;ref name=USNIs1p37/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt;

==Construction==
187 vessels were ordered.&lt;ref name=Brown52&gt;Brown (ed.), ''The Design and Construction of British Warships'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; They were identified with the pennant numbers L4001 through to L4187.&lt;ref name=Lenton460/&gt; 96 were ordered in the initial batch on 7 April 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', pp. 484–6&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by orders of 9 at an unknown date, 22 on 9 October 1944, batches of 20, 16, and 12 at unknown dates during late 1944, then the final 12 on 6 January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', pp. 486–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipyards and companies involved in the vessels' construction included [[Stockton Construction]] at [[Thornaby]] (46), [[A. Findlay]] at [[Old Kilpatrick]] (27), [[Arrol]] at [[Alloa]] (25), [[Tees-Side Bridge]] at [[Middlesbrough]] (17), MacLellan at [[Bo'ness]] (12), [[Motherwell Bridge]] at [[Meadowside]] (12), [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]] at [[Chepstow]] (12), [[Redpath Brown]] at [[Meadowside]] (11), [[Cleveland Dockyard]] at [[Middlesbrough]] (7), [[Warren Point Shipyard]] (8), Lagan at [[Belfast]] (8), and [[White]] at [[Cowes]] (2).&lt;ref name=Lenton484.7&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', pp. 484–7&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, individual hull sections were fabricated by [[Cargo Fleet]] of [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], [[Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company|Cleveland Bridge]] of [[Darlington]], [[Whessoe Foundry]] of [[Darlington]], [[Head Wrightson]] of [[Thornaby]], and [[Appleby-Frodingham]].&lt;ref name=Lenton487&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; Building designs were provided for both riveted and welded versions.&lt;ref name=Brown51/&gt;

The first vessel was completed in June 1945.&lt;ref name=Brown52/&gt; 30 were completed for the Royal Navy before the end of World War II meant that the vessels were no longer required; none of those completed saw wartime service.&lt;ref name=Lenton458/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown52/&gt; Of the remaining 157, 6 were sold into civilian service (4 directly, 2 to intermediate parties for conversion), while the rest were cancelled, scrapped in their incomplete state, or otherwise disposed of.&lt;ref name=Brown52/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton484.7/&gt;

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy===
{{Expand section|the addition of information on what activities the LCT carried out during Suez, and any operations before or after|date=February 2010}}
[[File:L4040 HMS Bastion.jpg|thumb|right|HMS ''Bastion'' beached and with her bow doors open]]
Nine ships in the class (HM Ships ''Redoubt'', ''Rampart'', ''Citadel'', ''Parapet'', ''Bastion'', ''Counterguard'', ''Portcullis'', ''Sallyport'', and ''Buttress'') served during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] under Royal Navy control,&lt;ref name=smallwarssuez&gt;Paul &amp; Sprint, ''British Units involved in the Suez crisis''&lt;/ref&gt; while a tenth (L4086, later named HMAV ''Arromanches'') operated with a civilian crew.&lt;ref name=Habesch142&gt;Habesch, ''The Army's Navy'', p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, ''Bastion'', ''Redoubt'', and the landing ship tank {{HMS|Striker|L128|6}} transported heavy stores and vehicles from Bahrain to Kuwait in support of [[Operation Vantage]].&lt;ref name=Hobbs207&gt;Hobbs, in Stevens &amp; Reeve, ''Sea Power ashore and in the air'', p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army===
The Suez Crisis highlighted the Army's need to train landing craft crews to respond to similar emergencies.&lt;ref name=Cantwell&gt;Cantwell, ''Fort Victoria'' p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1957, twelve LCT (8)s were transferred to the Army and stationed at [[Portsmouth]]: seven entered Army service between January and March of that year, while the other five followed later.&lt;ref name=Habesch142/&gt; The vessels were given names of [[Second World War]] battles, and were crewed by men of 76 Company, [[Royal Army Service Corps]] (RASC).&lt;ref name=Habesch142/&gt; The RASC [[Water Transport Training Unit]], based at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] began running LCT training courses and supplied the vessels with crews (men on their [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Service]]) until the unit closed in 1962.&lt;ref name=Cantwell/&gt;

In 1957–58, several of the LCTs took part in [[Operation Hardrock]], a joint Army/RAF operation to create a guided weapons tracking station in the [[Hebrides]].&lt;ref&gt;Habesch, ''The Army's Navy'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;  The vessels made exploratory voyages and subsequently delivered men and equipment to islands like [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], [[South Ford]], and [[Lochboisdale]].&lt;ref&gt;Habesch, ''The Army's Navy'', pp. 143–4&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, they made supply runs from their base at [[Cairnryan]] to the islands.&lt;ref name=Habesch144&gt;Habesch, ''The Army's Navy'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Landings were dangerous, due to weather and beach conditions, and on one occasion, ''Abbeville'' became grounded at Village Bay in St Kilda for three days.&lt;ref name=Habesch144/&gt;

In 1960, three of the LCTs (''Ardennes'', ''Agedabia'' and ''Arromanches'') were transferred to [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Habesch, ''The Army's Navy'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst in service there, they carried out routine transport and ammunition-dumping activities, and were deployed in the [[Indonesian Confrontation]] in 1962. Two more LCTs (''Antwerp'' and ''Arakan'') were despatched to the region the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Habesch, p. 149&quot;&gt;Habesch, ''The Army's Navy'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An old photo of HMAV Abbeville (L4041).jpg|thumb|left|HMAV ''Abbeville''. Note the [[Royal Corps of Transport]] (RCT) marking under the [[pennant number]].]]
When the LCTs first entered service with the British Army, they were designated as Royal Army Service Corps Vessels (RASCV). In 1965, the RASC was amalgamated with the transportation arm of the [[Corps of Royal Engineers]] to form the [[Royal Corps of Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;Habesch, The Army's Navy, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] dictated that all RCT vessels would have their prefix changed to Her Majesty's Army Vessel (HMAV).&lt;ref&gt;Habesch, The Army's Navy, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forces and civilian service===
During the late 1950s, ''Jawada'' was loaned to the [[Qatar Petroleum Company]].&lt;ref name=Boniface62&gt;Boniface, ''HMS Superb'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The landing craft was briefly recommissioned during late 1956 and early 1957 to serve as a [[Ship's tender|tender]] to the cruiser {{HMS|Superb|25|6}}, which was visiting Bahrain for amphibious warfare exercises.&lt;ref name=Boniface62/&gt;

''Buttress'' was sold to the [[French Navy]] in July 1965; she was redesignated ''L 9061'', then later ''Issole''.&lt;ref name=Janes71st/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenton486&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; She was then resold to the [[Military of Comoros]] in 1976, and operated as the naval vessel ''Ville de Nimachova''.&lt;ref name=Lenton486/&gt; ''Counterguard'' was sold to the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] in 1965 and renamed ''Sri Langkawi''.&lt;ref name=Janes71st/&gt; The vessel operated under this name until February 1968, when she was disposed of.&lt;ref name=Jane&gt;Blackman (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships, 1968–69'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ardennes'' and ''Arromanches'' were sold to the [[Singaporean Navy]] in 1970, operating as ''Cairn Hill'' and ''Tanglin''.&lt;ref&gt;Lenton, ''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', pp. 485–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Habesch161.2&gt;Habesch, ''The Army's Navy'', pp. 161–2&lt;/ref&gt;
