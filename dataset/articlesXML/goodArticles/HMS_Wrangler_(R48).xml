'''HMS ''Wrangler''''' was one of eight [[W and Z-class destroyer|W-class destroyers]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Completed in 1944, the ship spent most of the war in the [[Far East]] and escorted British [[aircraft carrier]]s as their aircraft attacked targets in the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupied Dutch East Indies]] and in Japan itself. ''Wrangler'' was present in [[Tokyo Bay]] when the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese formally surrendered]] on 2 September 1945. 

She served as a [[training ship]] after the war until she was converted into a [[Type 15 frigate]] in the early 1950s and subsequently sold to the [[South African Navy]] later that decade. The ship was renamed ''Vrystaat'' in South African service and made many overseas port visits before corrosion problems caused her to be reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1963. ''Vrystaat'' was sunk as a target by a South African [[submarine]] in 1976.

== Description ==
The W-class ships displaced {{convert|1710|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard load]] and {{convert|2530|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. They had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|362|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|35|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean deep [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|14|ft|6|in|m|1}}. The ships were powered by a pair of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], using steam provided by two [[Admiralty three-drum boiler]]s. The turbines developed a total of {{convert|40000|ihp|lk=in}} which gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. They carried {{convert|615|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave them a range of {{convert|4675|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|20|kn}}. Their crew numbered 179 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=l2/&gt;

The W-class destroyers were armed with four single [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch (120&amp;nbsp;mm) Mark IX guns]], two [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{convert|40|mm|1|adj=on}} Bofors]] [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]] on a twin mount and eight [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|1|adj=on}}]] light AA guns on twin mounts. They also were equipped with two quadruple mounts for {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. For [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine work]], the ships were fitted with [[ASDIC]] and two rails and four throwers for 70 [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; They were equipped with a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 272|Type 272]] surface-search [[radar]], Type 282 and 285 gunnery radars and a Type 291 [[early-warning radar]].&lt;ref name=l2&gt;Lenton, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Type 15 conversion===
{{main|Type 15 frigate}}
In 1951, ''Wrangler'' became the first ship of her [[ship class|class]] to be converted into a Type 15 anti-submarine [[frigate]]. This was a major reconstruction that involved the removal of the [[superstructure]], masts and armament as well most of the internal equipment. To increase the usable volume of the hull and to improve crew comfort, the [[forecastle]] deck was extended almost all the way to the stern and a new superstructure was built above it, made of aluminium to reduce topweight. Two [[lattice mast]]s were added to carry the [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 277|Type 277Q]] surface-search, Type 274 navigation, and Type 293Q gunnery radars. The ship's main gun armament now consisted of a twin-gun turret fitted with [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|4-inch (102&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk XVI guns]] mounted aft and a water-cooled, twin-gun Mk V mount for 40&amp;nbsp;mm Bofors guns above the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. The pair of triple-barrelled [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] [[anti-submarine mortar]]s were shifted to the [[quarterdeck]] aft&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; and were controlled by Type 170 and 174 ASDIC systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Chumbley &amp; Budzbon, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes greatly increased the ships' displacement, now {{convert|2300|LT|t}} at standard load and {{convert|2700|LT|t}} at deep load. This reduced their speed to a maximum of {{convert|31|kn}} at deep load and the crew now numbered 174 officers and ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
The W-class destroyers were ordered on 3 December 1941 and ''Wrangler'' was [[laid down]] by [[Vickers-Armstrong]] at their [[shipyard]] in [[Barrow-in-Furness]] on 23 September 1942. The ship was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 30 December 1943 and completed on 14 July 1944.&lt;ref name=l2/&gt; She was assigned to the [[27th Destroyer Flotilla]], together with all of her [[sister ship]]s, upon completion&lt;ref name=d1&gt;du Toit, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Wrangler'' was [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]] at [[Scapa Flow]] with the [[Home Fleet]] from 21 July to 16 August. She then proceeded to the Mediterranean for several months before she was assigned to the Eastern Fleet by late 1944.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Robson]], an aerial attack on the [[oil refinery]] complex at [[Pangkalan Brandan]], [[Sumatra]], in mid-December, ''Wrangler'' escorted the main body of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the ship sailed to [[Bombay]], [[India]], to have her [[boiler tube]]s replaced, a lengthy job that took from 14 January to 19 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 105–06&lt;/ref&gt; By 17 July, the ship was en route, together with her sister {{HMS|Wakeful|1943|2}} to reinforce the [[British Pacific Fleet]] operating off the coast of Japan. On 20 August she was selected to remain with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|6}} as part of the British contribution to the occupation forces.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, pp. 260, 288, 297&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wrangler'' was present when the Japanese surrendered on 2 September aboard the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} in Tokyo Bay.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt;

The ship ferried Allied prisoners of war back to Australia before departing Sydney on 8 November and arrived at Plymouth on 16 December. The navy originally intended to reduce her to Category B reserve, but decided to assign ''Wrangler'' to the Naval Training Command on 18 January 1946&lt;ref name=e6&gt;English, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; and she became the chemical warfare training ship based at [[Devonport Royal Dockyard]]. From September 1946 until 1950 the ship was with the [[Rosyth]] Local Flotilla as a boys' training ship&lt;ref&gt;Critchley, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and had her 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns removed during her December 1946 – January 1947 refit. Two years later ''Wrangler'' was in a collision that damaged her [[Carley float]]s and main deck plating. In 1950–51 she was assigned to the 4th Training Flotilla. The ship was allocated to the Type 15 programme on 4 January 1950 and sailed to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] in February 1951 to prepare for the reconstruction. From June 1951 to 10 March 1953 she was rebuilt by [[Harland &amp; Wolff]] at [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref name=e6/&gt; with the new [[pennant number]] F157.&lt;ref name=d2&gt;du Toit, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; On re-commissioning in 1953 she took part in the [[Fleet Review]] to celebrate the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;Souvenir Programme: ''Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953'', HMSO, Gale and Polden&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1953 and 1955 she served as part of the [[5th Frigate Squadron (United Kingdom)|5th Frigate Squadron]] in the Mediterranean. In 1954 ''Wrangler'' was involved in the search for wreckage of the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] [[de Havilland Comet]] airliner ''[[Aircraft registration|G-ALYP]]'', that [[BOAC Flight 781|crashed in the Mediterranean Sea]] near the island of [[Elba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crash of BOAC Comet Yoke Peter and RFA Sea Salvor|url=http://historicalrfa.org/archived-stories2/863-the-crash-of-boac-comet-yoke-peter-and-rfa-sea-salvor|website=historicalrfa.org|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February 1955, she ran aground at [[Villefranche sur Mer]], [[France]]; she was refloated on 6 February 1955 by [[French Navy]] and [[Italian Navy]] [[tugboat|tugs]].&lt;ref name=Times070255&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Telgrams in Brief |day_of_week=Monday |date=7 February 1955 |page_number=6 |issue=53159 |column=C-D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South African service===
In 1956 ''Wrangler'' was sold to South Africa for [[pound sterling|£]]1,425,000 &quot;as is&quot; and refitted between November and January 1957 in [[Cardiff]] by the [[Mount Stuart Dry Dock Company]].&lt;ref name=e6/&gt; She was commissioned into the SAN on 29 November 1956 and subsequently renamed as SAS ''Vrystaat''. Captain [[M.R. Terry-Lloyd]] was in command when the ship was formally accepted by the [[High commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa]], Dr. J. E. Holloway, at a ceremony in Devonport on 10 January 1957. ''Vrystaat'' departed England on 22 January and arrived in South Africa on 19 February after having made port visits en route. Shortly after her arrival, the ship was sent to [[Marion Island]] to take off a resident who urgently needed to go to hospital. Later that year, she was sent to [[Portuguese Mozambique]] with several other South African ships. Now assigned to the 10th Frigate Squadron, ''Vrystaat'' and the frigate {{SAS|Good Hope|F432|2}} visited the city of [[Matadi]] in the [[Belgian Congo]], some {{convert|70|mi}} up the [[Congo River]], in 1958. Two years later the ship, now under the command of Captain [[John Fairbairn (naval officer)|John Fairbairn]], was sent to Portugal to participate in the naval review commemorating of the [[quincentenary]] of the death of Infante [[Henry the Navigator]]. In 1961, ''Vrystaat'' visited the city of [[Lourenco Marques]] (now Maputo) in Portuguese Mozambique.&lt;ref name=d2/&gt;  

By 1963 many of her aluminium rivets were deteriorating and there were significant [[galvanic corrosion]] problems where the aluminium superstructure joined with the steel hull. Deemed too expensive to repair, the ship was placed in reserve in [[Simon's Town]] that year. ''Vrystaat'' was towed out to sea by the frigate {{SAS|President Steyn|F147|2}} on 14 April 1976 and was sunk as a target by the [[submarine]] {{SAS|Maria van Riebeeck}}, {{convert|8|mi|spell=in}} southwest of [[Cape Point]].&lt;ref&gt;du Toit, pp. 203–04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WRECKSITE - VRYSTAAT DESTROYER 1944-1976|url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?138179|website=www.wrecksite.eu|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
