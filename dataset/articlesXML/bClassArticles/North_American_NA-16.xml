The '''North American Aviation NA-16''' was the first trainer aircraft built by [[North American Aviation]], and was the beginning of a line of closely related North American trainer aircraft that would eventually number more than 17,000 examples.

==Design and development==
[[File:North American NA-16 prototype NX2080.jpg|thumb|First NA-16 with initial canopy and still in civilian registration.]]
The NA-16 is a family of related single-engine, low-wing monoplanes with tandem seating.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants could have an open cockpit (the prototype and the NA-22) or be under a glass greenhouse that covered both cockpits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 20–21&quot;&gt;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; On some variants, the rear of the canopy could be opened for a gunner to fire to the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of air-cooled [[radial engine]]s, including the [[Wright Whirlwind]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp]] and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior]] of varying horsepowers, could be installed depending on customer preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fuselage was built up from steel tubes and normally fabric covered; however, later versions were provided with aluminium monocoque structures.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the development of the design, a six&amp;nbsp;inch stretch was made by moving the rudder post aft.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Many versions had a fixed landing gear, but later versions could have retractable gear, mounted in a widened wing center section (which could have either integral fuel tanks or not).&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Most had a straight trailing edge on the outer wing while again, some had the wing trailing edge swept forward slightly in an attempt to fix a problem with stalls and spins.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 14, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Several different rudders were used, with early examples having a round outline, intermediate examples having a square bottom on the rudder (Harvard I) and late examples using the triangular rudder of the AT-6 series, due to a loss of control at high angles of attack with the early types.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontal and vertical tails were initially covered in corrugated aluminum, but later examples were smooth-skinned, and the horizontal stabilizer was increased in chord near its tips on later versions.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NA-16 flew for the first time on 1 April 1935, and was submitted to the [[United States Army Air Corps]] for evaluation as a basic trainer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagedorn 1997, p. 8&quot;&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Army accepted the trainer for production but with some detail changes. The modified NA-16 was redesignated by North American as the '''NA-18''', with production examples entering Air Corps service as the [[North American BT-9]] (NA-19). Similar aircraft continued to be sold outside the U.S. under the NA-16 designation.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign developments ===
;Australia
The [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] produced 755 units of a modified version of the NA-16-2K known there as the [[CAC Wirraway|Wirraway]] between 1939 and 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Francillon|first= René J|title=The Royal Australian Air Force &amp; Royal New Zealand Air Force in the Pacific|series=Aero Pictorials 3|publisher=Aero Publishers Inc, 1970 |location=California|year=|isbn=978-0-8168-0308-8|id=Library of Congress Number 76-114412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Argentina
Experience with the NA-16-4P and deteriorating political relations with the US led to the local development of the I.Ae. D.L. 21, which shared the NA-16 fuselage structure; however it proved too difficult to produce. As a result of this, an entirely new design (the [[I.Ae. D.L. 22]]) was built instead; it had similar configuration, but was structurally different and optimized to available materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wooden Warriors&quot;&gt;von Rauch, Georg and David L. Veres. &quot;Argentina's Wooden Warriors&quot;. ''Air Classics'' (Challenge Publications), Volume 19, March 1983, pp. 14–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Japan
The NA-16-4RW and NA-16-4R inspired the development of the [[Kyushu K10W]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] instructed Kyushu to develop something similar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arawasi&quot;&gt;Starkings, Peter. [http://www.arawasi.jp/ &quot;From American Acorn to Japanese Oak&quot;.] ''Arawasi'' (Asahi Process, Tokyo), Issue 7, 2007, pp. 26–31. Retrieved: 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting aircraft owed little to the NA-16, however Allied Intelligence saw so few examples that the error was not corrected and some drawings show a modified NA-16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arawasi&quot; /&gt;

==Variants==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}

[[File:North American BT-9 manual drawing.jpg|thumb|North American BT-9]]

Listing includes aircraft built specifically under NA-16 designation for export, and similar aircraft built for use by the United States armed forces.

;NA-16
:One for [[United States Army Air Corps|United States Army Air Corps (USAAC)]] (trials) developed into '''NA-18''' and '''BT-9''' series.
:powered by [[Wright Whirlwind|Wright R-975 Whirlwind]]
When the North American NA-16 was first conceived, five different roles were intended for the design, designated '''NA-16-1 thru NA-16-5''':&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
;NA-16-1:General purpose two-seat aircraft - which became the '''Harvard I'''&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;
;NA-16-2:Two-seat fighter - produced under licence in Australia as the '''[[CAC Wirraway]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;Smith 2000, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
;NA-16-3:Two-seat light attack bomber. The first aircraft in this category was the retractable gear '''NA-26'''&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved into the '''NA-36''' ('''BC-1'''). The fabric-covered fuselage was replaced by an all-metal monocoque to create the '''NA-44''',&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the basis for a line of light attack bombers whose improvements would result in the '''[[North American T-6 Texan|AT-6]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
;NA-16-4:Advanced trainer - became the '''[[North American BT-9|BT-9]]''' for the USAAC and which provided the bulk of early production. The improvement of the BT-9 with a longer metal skinned fuselage as on the NA-44 would create the '''NA-64 (Yale)''' and improved wings would result in the '''BT-14'''. 
;NA-16-5:Single-seat fighter - although this designation was never used, it became the '''NA-50''' for Chile, and later the '''NA-68''', which saw limited USAAF service as the '''[[North American P-64|P-64]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn 1997, pp. 41–42, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A Swedish NA-16-4M (locally designated as Sk 14) was built from an ex-RAAF [[CAC Wirraway]] (s/n A20-223) with additional parts from an ex-RCAF [[North American NA-64 Yale]] and is on display at the [[Swedish Air Force Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/36603228@N00/9384436256/ Flickr - Sk 14, North American NA 16-4M, Swedish Air Force Museum, Flygvapenmuseum, Linköping] Accessdate:Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[CAC Wirraway]] (originally NA-16-2K) was first modified to British standards and equipment, then later models diverged further from the NA-16 in minor details such as the fitting of dive brakes etc. The sole surviving CA-1 Wirraway is A20-10, the 8th production Wirraway, effectively a licence built NA-16-2K, and held at the [[Australian National Aviation Museum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarg.com.au/cac-wirraway-a20-10.html The Australian National Aviation Museum - CAC CA-1 Wirraway A20-10] Accessdate:Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
