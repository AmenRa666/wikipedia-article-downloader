The '''Battle of Madang''', fought between early February and late April 1944, was the [[Breakout (military)|break-out]] and [[Breakthrough (military)|pursuit]] phase of the [[Markham and Ramu Valley&amp;nbsp;– Finisterre Range campaign]], which was part of the wider [[New Guinea campaign]] of [[World War II]]. After overcoming the Japanese defences around [[Battle of Shaggy Ridge|Shaggy Ridge]], the Australian forces descended the steep slopes of the Finisterre Mountains and pursued the withdrawing Japanese towards [[Bogadjim]] and then [[Madang]] on the north coast of New Guinea. There they linked up with US and Australian forces that had advanced along the coast from the [[Huon Peninsula]], while the remnants of three Japanese divisions withdrew towards [[Wewak]], where further fighting would take place throughout late 1944 and into 1945.

==Prelude==
After the defeat of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] in the [[Battle of Shaggy Ridge]] in late January 1944, the remnants of the Japanese [[78th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|78th Infantry Regiment]], assigned to Lieutenant General [[Shigeru Katagiri]]'s [[20th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|20th Division]], began a withdrawal towards [[Madang]]  and then [[Wewak]].{{sfn|Bradley|2004|p=241}} This enabled the [[Australian Army]] forces to break through the Japanese positions in the Finisterre Mountains, which had been holding up their drive north. After a brief pause to bring up supplies, and to rotate troops as the Australian [[11th Division (Australia)|11th Division]] under Major General [[Allan Boase]] replaced [[George Alan Vasey|George Vasey]]'s [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], the Australians slowly advanced down the rugged, densely forested slopes of the Finisterres, pursuing the withdrawing Japanese towards [[Bogadjim]] on the northern coast, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} away.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=346; 359–360}}{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|pp=241–245}}{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=771}} At the same time, US and Australian troops advanced towards Madang from the west, about {{convert|40 |mi|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19440202&amp;id=3ddXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=afUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7352,319625&amp;hl=en |title=Madang Battle Nearing Climax |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=2 February 1944 |p=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
In the early stages of the pursuit, the Australians sent long range patrols forward, while two battalions from the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|US 32nd Infantry Division]] landed  around the Yalau Plantation.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=772}} Throughout February and March, the Japanese 20th Division withdrew towards Madang, fighting a series of rearguard actions against the Australians that were advancing from Kankiryo.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=370}} The going was tough for the troops of the 15th Brigade who advanced slowly towards Bogadjim, using aggressive patrols to advance their position forwards. The Japanese began strengthening their defences around Bogadjim at this time, constructing a series of outposts in a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} radius to the south of the town; nevertheless, Australian patrols were able to bypass these and penetrate towards Erima Plantation where intelligence received from locals indicated large concentrations of Japanese forces.&lt;ref name=dva/&gt;

The [[2/2nd Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/2nd Commando Squadron]] advanced from Orgoruna, linking up with the [[57th/60th Battalion (Australia)|57th/60th Infantry Battalion]] around Yaula on 4 April.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=360}} Advancing along a motor road that had been laid by the Japanese, the Australians moved along an axis bounded by the Nuru River and Kabenau River. The withdrawing Japanese offered stiff resistance, but continued to withdraw, allowing the Australians to link up with US forces around Rimba. Bogadjim was eventually reached on 13 April.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=360}} Meanwhile, part of the 11th Division's divisional carrier company was flown into to Wantoat in response to intelligence of Japanese patrols in the area. The dismounted troops fought a brief engagement with about 20 Japanese soldiers on 14 April during which four Japanese were killed and one Australian wounded. The Australians subsequently expanded their patrols towards the confluence of the Wantoat and Ikwap Rivers. Detecting a small group withdrawing to the north, they returned to Wantoat. A later patrol resulted in four Japanese being taken prisoner.&lt;ref name=dva/&gt;

The 57th/60th and [[58th/59th Battalion (Australia)|58th/59th Infantry Battalions]] continued to patrol heavily across a wide around around the Bogadjim Road, and they subsequently joined up with US troops around Sungum. The Japanese had re-orientated themselves into positions at various locations including Alibu, Rereo, Wenga, Redu and Kaliko. During this time, a number of small unit actions were undertaken as the Japanese attempted to ambush the Australians while the Australians in turn sought to infiltrate the Japanese positions. On 22 April, large amounts of Japanese supplies were found abandoned by a patrol from the 57th/60th as it became clear that the Japanese were withdrawing from the area in a hasty fashion.&lt;ref name=dva/&gt;

At this point, the Australian command determined the need for a rotation of forces. When the commander of the 15th Brigade, Brigadier [[Heathcote Hammer]] learnt that his brigade was to be relieved by Brigadier [[Claude Ewen Cameron|Claude Cameron]]'s [[8th Brigade (Australia)|8th Brigade]], he endeavoured to push towards Madang with all haste, in an effort to secure it before the prize went to Major General [[Alan Ramsay]]'s [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division]]. On 24 April, the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion was ordered to cross the treacherous Gogol River, a fast-flowing torrent of water teeming with crocodiles.{{sfn|Dean|2014|p=285}} The 57th/60th attempted to outflank the Gogol River, sending a patrol to link up with two US Navy patrol boats. However, they were thwarted in their attempt to reach Madang first when troops from the 8th Brigade came ashore around Ort, about {{convert|6.5|km|mi}} south of Madang,{{sfn|Dean|2014|p=285}} effecting a link up between the 11th and 5th Divisions.&lt;ref name=dva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrb.gov.au/dvapublications/CLIK-ng-campaigns.pdf |title=New Guinea |work=Campaign Publications |publisher=Veterans Review Board |accessdate=19 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071150/http://www.vrb.gov.au/dvapublications/CLIK-ng-campaigns.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th Division had been advancing along the coast from [[Landing at Saidor|Saidor]], which had been secured by US and Australian forces in January&amp;nbsp;– February 1944 by troops assigned to the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]], who were pursuing the Japanese forces withdrawing from the peninsula.{{sfn|Pratten|2014|p=280}}

Madang was subsequently taken on 24–25 April by troops from the 8th and 15th Brigades, with the [[30th Battalion (Australia)|30th Infantry Battalion]] leading the way towards the airfield, advancing along the northern part of [[Astrolabe Bay]] to secure Madang,&lt;ref name=battlehonour/&gt; while a platoon from the 57th/60th entered the town. Resistance in the town was almost non existent. Several artillery rounds were fired, but they landed well awry of their intended target, while a short burst of machine-gun cracked inaccurately in the direction of the advancing troops. A small group of Japanese stragglers scattered on sighting the Australian platoon. Shortly afterwards, the 8th Brigade's headquarters entered Madang Harbour aboard several landing craft, escorted by the destroyer [[HMAS Vendetta (D69)|''Vendetta'']] and the corvette [[HMAS Bundaberg (J231)|''Bundaberg'']].{{sfn|Dean|2014|p=287}} 

The following day was [[Anzac Day]], which saw the Australians consolidate their position around Madang. A follow up landing was made by the [[37th/52nd Battalion (Australia)|37th/52nd Infantry Battalion]] on [[Karkar Island]]. Meanwhile, the [[35th Battalion (Australia)|35th Infantry Battalion]] secured a large quantity of abandoned Japanese stores at [[Hansa Bay]], and pushed patrols towards the [[Sepik River]].&lt;ref name=dva/&gt; The ''Bundaberg'' also landed a party of sailors on Sek Island, firing a heavy bombardment which wiped out  the small group of defending Japanese.{{sfn|Dean|2014|p=287}} The 30th pushed on to [[Alexishafen]] the following day,{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=360}} suffering several casualties from improvised explosive devices that were planted along the road by the withdrawing Japanese. In addition, large quantities of Japanese supplies were also discovered.&lt;ref name=dva/&gt;

==Aftermath==
With the capture of Madang, the Allies finally effectively secured the Huon Peninsula.{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=29}}{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=360}} In the aftermath of the campaign the Australian 5th Division was tasked with providing a garrison force for the north-east coast of New Guinea, patrolling the area around Madang, which would be built up as a base with the intention of being able to supply 35,000 troops for subsequent operations. Meanwhile, the bulk of the Australian first line combat troops were withdrawn to Australia for rest and re-organisation. The commitment of US troops from the 32nd Division to the fighting around Saidor&amp;nbsp;– coupled with the dispatch of the 41st Division to the Salamaua campaign earlier in 1943&amp;nbsp;– represented a shift in the Allied strategy of giving the Australians autonomy of operations in New Guinea and from early 1944 until the end of the war, the US Army would assume primary responsibility for offensive operations in the Pacific.{{sfn|Dean|2014|pp=287–288}}

The Japanese 18th Army was subsequently ordered to withdraw to Wewak in late March; as the [[51st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|51st Division]] withdrew to the Wewak area, the 20th Division held Hansa Bay, and the [[41st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|41st Division]] carried out rearguard operations around Madang throughout April.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=789}} Severely depleted, in all, the three divisions only fielded about 20,000 troops.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=370}} In late 1944, US troops carried out a [[landing at Aitape]] and began operations to isolate the Japanese garrison there, later [[Battle of Driniumor River|clashing around the Driniumor River]].{{sfn|Bradley|2004|p=241}} They were subsequently relieved in late 1944 by Australian troops from the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]], which launched the [[Aitape–Wewak campaign]], fighting to secure the airfield and then clear the Japanese from the inland areas patrolling through the [[Torricelli Range|Torricelli]] and [[Prince Alexander Mountains|Prince Alexander mountain ranges]] until the end of the war in August 1945.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=271–281}}{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=370–374, 400–408}} Meanwhile, troops from the 8th Brigade remained in the Madang area until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/unit/U56112/ |title=30th Australian Infantry Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939–1945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Australian Army issued a [[battle honour]] for &quot;Madang&quot; to the 30th Infantry Battalion for its advance along the northern part of Astrolabe Bay and its subsequent capture of Madang. It was the only unit to receive that honour.&lt;ref name=battlehonour&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/battle-honour/E455/ |title=Madang |work=Battle Honours |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
