== Battle of the Imjin River ==
The [[Battle of Kapyong]] and the [[Battle of the Imjin River]] are clearly related because the take place over the same dates and the objective of the attackers was the same &quot;advance on Seoul&quot;. What is needed is an over view of the Chinese/NK offensive/campaign and were these battles fit into it. --[[User:Philip Baird Shearer|Philip Baird Shearer]] 22:32, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment/Tag &amp; Assess 2008]] ==
Ensured that the article is within project scope, tagged for task forces, and assessed for class. --[[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) 00:20, 29 April 2008 (UTC)

== Article status ==
this article is so apparently not written in a neutral point of view, i´d say it is a shame for wikipedia in the actual status. tammo  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/87.122.28.45|87.122.28.45]] ([[User talk:87.122.28.45|talk]]) 01:15, 8 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Care to elaborate? [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 04:07, 8 February 2010 (UTC)
::I'll see what I can dig up in Chinese archives. Don't worry about the POV mate, everything checked out fine. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 14:37, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

::: Once again Jim excellent work. Thanks greatly for your efforts. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 04:38, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

== Errors and clarification needed. ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having a reputation for unreliability in defence, the South Koreans...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reputation should be elaborated a bit, explanations are needed on why ROK 6th Division has a problems at this battle...I'll dig my South Koreans sources on this issue.  

: Thanks, please do. I think I can add something here too. I'll have a look also. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 05:12, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
US casualties during the period 22–29 April numbered 314 killed and 1,600 wounded, while Commonwealth, South Korean and other UN contingents brought the total to 547 killed, 2,024 wounded and 2,170 captured.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is completely different from the US I Corps' casualty number, which is provided in the article [[Battle of Imjin River]], and 3 times higher.

: I have checked my sources and both Johnston and Mossman agree with the figures I have cited, however I think this only relates to the first week of the offensive. I will reword.  [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 05:12, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

:: I have looked at this again and really can't figure out a solution. Mossman is a fairly good source and seems fairly explicit when I read it. Johnston supports these figures (and adds Commonwealth stats etc). I just cannot reconcile this discrepancy with the figures cited in the Battle of the Imjin River article, I'm afraid. I'm open to suggestions... [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 05:24, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
&lt;s&gt;::: Well, the problem I see is the Chinese number 80,000. Is there a source that directly compared the 80,000 number with some UN casualty numbers? I know the source on the Battle of the Imjin River article did, which is a direct comparsion between 70,000 vs 16,000. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 05:32, 10 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s&gt;: I'll have to look into this issue too. Given that Roy Appleman and Mossman both served together as combat historian in Korea, their widely different numbers on I Corps is really puzzling. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 06:05, 10 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
:: It may not help but below is the quote from Johnston p 109:

&quot;During its first week, the spring offensive had cost the communists 13,349 known dead, and Eighth Army headquarters estimated that a total of 24,000 enemy [sic] had been killed. With US Army losses at only 314 killed and 1,600 wound - Commonwealth, ROK, and other UN contingent lossess brought the totals to 547 killed, 2,024 wounded, and 2,170 caputure - the disparity between the two sides' casualties reflected the devasting effect of the UN's enorous firepower when directed against massed infantry. UN Command headquarters in Tokyo estimated that the enemy [sic] lost between 75,000 and 80,000 in killed and wounded in the offensive.&quot; [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 06:19, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

: It appears I'm in error. 16,000 were the causalty number from April 2 to May 1. The exact US causalty number from April 22 to 29 were 413 KIA, 1,709 WIA, 448 POW, 69 MIA for a total of 2,645. After scanning Johnston's book, the numbers he used were in the ball park. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 14:32, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...fierce resistance in battles at the Imjin river and at Kapyong had blunted the impetus,...Undoubtedly the defence mounted by the 27th Brigade ultimately helped to halt the advance on Seoul and prevented its capture...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since Kapyong was not on the Chinese route of attack, is this still a valid conclusion?

: I see what you mean, I think its still valid but needs to be tweaked to acribe the correct weight. Have done this now - please review and let me know what you think. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 05:12, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
:: I cannot comment too much on this issue unless someone wrote a book that compares the Chinese and Commonwealth records...but one useful metric on the importance of Kapyong was did the road junction at Kapyong served any purpose before Chinese could capture it? Like for example, the defense of Kapyong allowed some reinforcements for the I Corps, etc. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 05:29, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The battlefield was littered with the corpses of Chinese soldiers, a testament to the discipline and firepower of the defenders. And yet, despite their ultimate defeat the battle once again demonstrated that the Chinese were tough and skillful soldiers, inflicting heavy casualties on the Australians and forcing their eventual withdrawal, albeit intact and orderly.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few citations here would would be nice.

: Added one. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 05:12, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

Anyway, those are the content issues that I believe that needs to be looked at. Chinese record didn't say much about this battle, since the 40th Field Army was only ordered to block at Kapyong, not to capture Kapyong. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 02:20, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
:Striking all issues, looks fine now. The Chinese 80,000 casualty numbers were replaced with the confirmed dead number plus a note, given UN estimations and authenticated Chinese telegraphs does not match. South Korean analysis of the aftermath were also added, plus the real Chinese intention at Kapyong and why Chinese did not exploit the breakthrough at ROK 6th Division sector. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 15:11, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

== Misspelling in Footnotes ==
The word 'Commissar' is misspelt in the article's footnotes as 'Commassiar [sic]'. Commissars were officials of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in this instance, responsible for political education and organisation within military units. It was a term and concept copied by the CCP from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Kobalt08 01 Mar. 2010

== First and Second Phase of Spring Offensive. ==
It is a popular misconception that the Chinese Spring Offensive had completely failed to capture Seoul on April 29. There was a second attempt to captured Seoul by the Chinese in mid-May by outflanking the UN defenders at the east of Kapyong. I corrected this error in the article. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 02:09, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
: Cheers. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 10:43, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
:: And another thing, &quot;''they had little recourse but to withdraw back into North Korea and regroup''&quot; is somewhat incorrect. There was a change of plan on April 29 by shifting the 3rd Army Group further east, but no Chinese unit withdraw back to North Korea on April 29 or gave up their gains. Chinese forces did not withdraw back to North Korea until May 21 in the aftermath of the Soyang River battle. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 14:36, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
:: I also modified the Chinese war aim...160 km advance type objective was completely illogical in Chinese military thinking due to their logistics constraints. Thus the Chinese war planning during the entire Korean War always aimed at Cannae style annihilation with the least amount of walking. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 15:29, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
:::Good work. Thanks again for clearing that up, my only defence is that thats what my sources said! Cheers. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 10:10, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Responses from the closed review ==
*What makes: Coulthard-Clark, Chris (2001). a reliable tertiary source? Are articles individually authored, if so did you only consult particular articles? [by Fifelfoo]
**Why wouldn't it be? The author is an official historian at the Australian War Memorial and has written dozens of books. Articles in the Encyclopaedia are not individually authored (AFAIK he wrote them all). Anotherclown (talk) 05:34, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
***Excellent, author expertise satisfies me greatly here.   Academic encyclopaedia often have individually authored articles of journal article length which impart original research.  I was asking if it was this kind of encyclopaedia.  But I'll accept a sole-authored expert (AWM official historian) as a good thing. [[User:Fifelfoo|Fifelfoo]] ([[User talk:Fifelfoo|talk]]) 08:29, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
**** No worries. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 08:05, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
*London, England. England, Really?
**I think that means 'England is so obvious it should be removed'. Done. Anotherclown (talk) 05:34, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
***I more meant that London is in the UK; but removing the national origin due to obviousness is also acceptable. [[User:Fifelfoo|Fifelfoo]] ([[User talk:Fifelfoo|talk]]) 08:29, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
****Of course, I missed that... that makes more sense. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 08:05, 26 October 2010 (UTC) 
*Help me out with what makes Centre of Military History and Australian Military Historical Publications reliable publishers?
**Not sure how to respond to this... IMO there is no reason to assume they are not. CMH is a US gov organisation that sponsors academic research on US Army history and has been around for a long time, while AMHP is definately less well known but has published numerous unit histories, biographies and memoires (many in concert with the Army History Unit, such as 'The Fight Leaders'). Anotherclown (talk) 05:34, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
***No worries, actually now that I think about it I should probably add 'US Army' to the citation template for CMH... [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 08:05, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
**I am very very satisfied with these answers and they were exactly what I was looking for.  Very reliable: academic specialist and specialist publisher non-fiction. [[User:Fifelfoo|Fifelfoo]] ([[User talk:Fifelfoo|talk]]) 08:29, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

: Thanks again for the review and cheers for the response. I'm a bit embarrassed that there were so many errors in my citations, well spotted. This has forced me to look a bit closer at some of my other articles. Take it easy. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 08:05, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

== 59 Description is imprecise, and thus misleading ==

At dawn the Chinese intensified their attack, driving the Australians off the high ground, and killing and wounding the bulk of the Medium Machine Gun section and the Assault Pioneer Platoon:

^ Breen 1994, p. 54/55
A P pl 1 KIA ,A/T Pl 1 WIA (sub deceased)  ,Sig 2 KIA in Acoy lines,  4 more KIA in BHQ.  2  RP in Jeep, 2 from LMG section.  4 were wounded. This does not tally with the above statement &quot;killing and wounding the bulk of the Medium Machine Gun section and the Assault Pioneer Platoon&quot;.  This is taken from O'Niell's Official History, but is disputed by Breen.  Most of these casulties occured prior to 1 am.

This is controversial re actions of Lt Coln I.B. Ferguson .

NB driven of what high ground?  A Coy still hold hill at dawn.
NB Leonard Francis Turton-Sainsbury was with support coy, (My Father).  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Fsainsbu|Fsainsbu]] ([[User talk:Fsainsbu|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fsainsbu|contribs]]) 07:40, 21 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Unfortuantly it is a problem I have often encountered in my research, that is two reliable sources seemingly contradicting each other. Perhaps you might suggest how this could be re-written in a way that it is more accurate? To be honest though I have been burnt by Breen previously and am tempted to go with O'Neill. Cheers again. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 08:52, 21 November 2010 (UTC)

:: OK, I have reworded this slightly to remove the implication that A Coy had been pushed of their position, merely that MMG and Assault Pioneers had, per O'Neill. Still not sure how to reconcile your concerns re the casualties, although as you say most of those identified above occurred prior to 1 am, whilst O'Neill appears to be recounting the situation a number of hours later at dawn. Might they therefore both be accurate? Anyway please let me know what you think. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 09:13, 21 November 2010 (UTC)

== Comds and units ==

I've reduced the scope of the comds and units listed in the infobox. Ultimately Kapyong was a small battle which was part of a much larger action, and was primarily fought b/n the 27th Brit Com Bde and 118th Chinese Division. The South Korean 6th Division was heavily involved in the initial stages of course, while the US 5 Cav Regt reinforced the 27th Brit Com Bde later in the battle. South Korean and US divisions were of course involved in the wider action and on the flanks, although given the focus of this article on Kapyong I don't think it is really necessary to list them in the infobox. Likewise with the comds. I have tried to reduce this to a more appropriate level. Previously it included Ridgeway and Van Fleet (CinC and Comd US 8th Army respectively) and Peng Dehuai (comd Chinese PVA). Obviously a level of comd much above that at Kapyong. I seem to recall this was actually my addition a few years ago and I believe it may have been questioned by another editor at the time (if my memory serves me correctly). I've had a bit of a rethink about it now and now think this may have been a bit excessive. Happy to discuss if others disagree of course.
