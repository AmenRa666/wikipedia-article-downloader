'''SS ''Pennsylvanian''''' was a [[cargo ship]] built in 1913 for the [[American-Hawaiian Steamship Company]]. During [[World War I]] she was requisitioned by the [[United States Navy]] and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] as '''USS ''Pennsylvanian'' (ID-3511)''' in September 1918, and renamed two months later to '''USS ''Scranton'''''. After her naval service, her original name of ''Pennsylvanian'' was restored.

''Pennsylvanian'' was built by the [[Maryland Steel Company]] as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and the [[Panama Canal]] after it opened. ''Pennsylvanian'' was one of the first two steamships to travel eastbound through the canal when it opened in August 1914. During World War I, as both SS ''Pennsylvanian'' and USS ''Scranton'', the ship carried cargo and animals to France, and returned American troops after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in 1918.

After her naval service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the [[War Shipping Administration]], and shipped cargo on [[New York City|New York]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Caribbean]] routes and transatlantic routes. In mid-July 1944, ''Pennsylvanian'' was [[scuttling|scuttled]] as part of the [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] for one of the [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry artificial harbors]] built to support the [[Normandy Invasion]].

== Design and construction ==
In September 1911, the [[American-Hawaiian Steamship Company]] placed an order with the [[Maryland Steel Company]] of [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]], for four new [[cargo ships]]—{{SS|Minnesotan||2}}, {{SS|Dakotan||2}}, {{SS|Montanan||2}}, and ''Pennsylvanian''.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Maryland Steel had built three ships—{{SS|Kentuckian||2}}, ''Georgian'', and ''Honolulan''—for American-Hawaiian in 1909 in what proved to be a satisfactory arrangement for both companies.&lt;/ref&gt; The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, with a maximum cost of $640,000 each. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of ''Pennsylvanian'', including financing costs, was $70.35 per [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight ton]], which came out to just under $716,000.&lt;ref name=Cochran-358 /&gt;

''Pennsylvanian'' (Maryland Steel yard no. 127)&lt;ref name=Colton /&gt; was the final ship built under the original contract.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Further contracts on similar terms were signed in November 1911 and May 1912 to build four additional ships: {{SS|Panaman||2}}, {{SS|Washingtonian||2}}, {{SS|Iowan||2}}, {{SS|Ohioan|1914|2}}. See: Cochran and Ginger, p. 358, and Colton.&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 March 1913,&lt;ref name=Miramar /&gt; and delivered to American-Hawaiian in June.&lt;ref name=Colton /&gt; ''Pennsylvanian'' was {{GRT|6,547|disp=long}},&lt;ref name=Cochran-365 /&gt; and was {{convert|429|ft|2|in|m}} in length and {{convert|53|ft|6|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; She had a [[deadweight tonnage]] of {{DWT|10,175|long}} and a storage capacity of {{convert|491084|cuft}}.&lt;ref name=Cochran-365 /&gt; ''Pennsylvanian'' had a single [[quadruple expansion steam engine]] powered by oil-fired [[boiler]]s that drove a single [[screw propeller]]. It could propel the ship at a speed of {{convert|15|knots|km/h}}.&lt;!--quadruple expansion--&gt;&lt;ref name=Penn30/&gt;&lt;!--oil-fired, single screw --&gt;&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochran-357&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- speed --&gt; The engine had cylinders of 25½ [[inch]]es (65 [[centimetre|cm]]), {{convert|37|in|cm}}, 53½ inches (136&amp;nbsp;cm) and {{convert|78|in|cm}} diameter by {{convert|54|in|cm}} stroke. It was built by the Maryland Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland.&lt;ref name=Penn30/&gt;

== Early career ==
When ''Pennsylvanian'' began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] ports via the Tehuantepec Route to [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] ports and [[Hawaii]], and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at [[Mexico|Mexican]] ports—[[Salina Cruz|Salina Cruz, Oaxaca]], for eastbound cargo, and [[Coatzacoalcos]] for westbound cargo—and would traverse the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] on the [[Tehuantepec National Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Hovey, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.&lt;ref name=Cochran-355-56&gt;Cochran and Ginger, p. 355–56.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pennsylvanian'' sailed in this service on the west side of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. | type = display ad | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 13 April 1914 | page = I–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ←shows she was part of the service--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = American-Hawaiian new steamships | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 6 May 1912 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ←shows the intent at time of announcement --&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-greet_canal&gt;{{cite news | last = Barrett | first = John | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801EEDE153DE733A25753C2A96E9C946596D6CF | format = pdf | title = Greet first canal ships | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 20 August 1914 | accessdate = 12 August 2008 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ←shows she was on the west side at time of canal opening --&gt;

After the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the [[Victoriano Huerta|Huerta]]-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled with the fact that the [[Panama Canal]] was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the [[Straits of Magellan]].&lt;ref name=Cochran-360&gt;Cochran and Ginger, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.&lt;ref name=Cochran-360 /&gt; ''Pennsylvanian'', on the west side of the canal when it opened, was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her trip to [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=NYT-greet_canal /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Though the canal transit was part of an eastbound journey, the actual compass heading of the passage through the canal is actually closer to north.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Luckenbach Line ship ''Pleiades'' was the other steamship to make the eastbound transit of the canal at the same time. Contemporary sources refer to the pair as the first two, making no distinction between which was first. See: {{cite news | last = Barrett | first = John | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801EEDE153DE733A25753C2A96E9C946596D6CF | format = pdf | title = Greet first canal ships | work = The New York Times | date = 20 August 1914 | accessdate = 12 August 2008 | page = 7 }} Also see: {{cite news | title = All astounded by war news | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 15 August 1914 | page = II– 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that ''Pennsylvanian'' would sail on a [[San Francisco]]&amp;nbsp;– Panama Canal&amp;nbsp;– [[Boston]] route, sailing opposite of {{SS|Mexican||2}}, ''Honolulan'', and sister ship ''Washingtonian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pacific-Boston sailings begun | work = Christian Science Monitor | date = 29 August 1914 | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including ''Pennsylvanian'', returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.&lt;ref name=Cochran-361&gt;Cochran and Ginger, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pennsylvanian''{{'}}s exact movements during 1916 and 1917 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was [[ship chartering|chartered]] for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, [[nitrate]]s, cocoa, rubber, and [[manganese|manganese ore]].&lt;ref name=Cochran-362&gt;Cochran and Ginger, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including ''Pennsylvanian'', was requisitioned by the [[United States Shipping Board]] (&lt;small&gt;USSB&lt;/small&gt;), which then returned the ships for operation by American-Hawaiian.&lt;ref name=Cochran-363&gt;Cochran and Ginger, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Navy service ==
On 13 September 1918, ''Pennsylvanian'' was transferred to the U.S. Navy at New York and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] USS ''Pennsylvanian'' (ID-3511) the same day. Assigned to the Navy's [[Naval Overseas Transportation Service]] (&lt;small&gt;NOTS&lt;/small&gt;), ''Pennsylvanian'' loaded a general cargo and sailed for [[Brest, France|Brest]], France, on 30 September. She arrived there on 15 October and sailed for [[La Pallice (harbour)|La Pallice]] the next day, where she unloaded her cargo before departing for New York on 5 November.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

[[Image:USS El Sol with boat, 1919.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|El Sol|ID-4505|6}} waits for a towline from a [[launch (boat)|launch]] from ''Scranton''. Three of ''Scranton''{{'}}s men in the launch died when it capsized after this photograph was taken.]]
Arriving at New York on 15 November, four days after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], ''Pennsylvanian'' was refitted as an animal transport ship, which, among other things, required the building of ramps and stalls for the animals.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; Sometime in November, probably during her refit, she was renamed USS ''Scranton'',&lt;ref name=OLS-Scranton /&gt; becoming the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania city]]. ''Scranton'' sailed for France on 12 December, arriving at [[Saint-Nazaire]] on 29 December, and returning to New York on 29 January 1919.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 5 February, ''Scranton'' was transferred from the &lt;small&gt;NOTS&lt;/small&gt; to the Navy's [[Cruiser and Transport Force]], and began conversion to a [[troop transport]] to carry American personnel home from France. While sailing to France to begin her first troop-carrying duties in late March, ''Scranton'' suffered damage to her [[rudder]] and was disabled {{convert|900|nmi|km}} east of New York.&lt;ref name=AC-troop_ship&gt;{{cite news | title = Troop ship Scranton reported disabled | work = [[The Atlanta Constitution]] | date = 30 March 1919 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Navy transport {{USS|El Sol|ID-4505|2}} responded to ''Scranton''{{'}}s distress call,&lt;ref name=DANFS-El_Sol&gt;{{cite DANFS | author = Navy Department, Naval History &amp; Heritage Command | title = El Sol | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e2/el_sol.htm | short = on | accessdate = 12 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to take ''Scranton'' under tow.&lt;ref name=AC-troop_ship /&gt; During the day on 28 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h99000/h99449c.htm | title = Photo #: NH 99449 picture data | work = Online Library of Selected Images | publisher = [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]], [[Naval Historical Center]] | date = 5 July 2004 | accessdate = 12 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scranton'' attempted to run a towline to ''El Sol'' by sending a [[launch (boat)|launch]] in the rolling seas, but it capsized, drowning three men.&lt;ref name=WP-82_nurses&gt;{{cite news | title = 82 Nurses return; served under fire | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 4 April 1919 | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Sol'' stood by ''Scranton'' for over 40 hours until minesweeper {{USS|Penguin|AM-33|2}} arrived and took ''Scranton'' under tow.&lt;ref name=DANFS-El_Sol /&gt;&lt;ref name=WP-82_nurses /&gt;&lt;ref name=NHCalbum&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Naval Historical Center]] | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/albums/s583/s583.htm | title = USS ''Scranton'' (ID # 3511) Photo Album, 1919 | work = Online Library of Selected Images: Photo Albums | publisher = [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]], [[Naval Historical Center]] | date = 11 July 2004 | accessdate = 12 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Penguin'' and ''Scranton'' arrived in New York on 3 April,&lt;ref name=WP-82_nurses /&gt; where ''Scranton'' entered [[drydock]] to undergo repairs.&lt;ref name=NHCalbum /&gt;

[[Image:HaleTelescope-MountPalomar.jpg|thumb|right|''Pennsylvanian'' delivered 325 tons of steel parts for the [[Hale Telescope]] then under construction at [[Palomar Observatory]] outside of [[San Diego]].]]
After repairs, ''Scranton'' made three roundtrips to France and carried some 6,000 troops and passengers home to the United States before she was decommissioned on 19 July. The ship was handed over to the &lt;small&gt;USSB&lt;/small&gt; for return to American-Hawaiian, who restored her original name.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

== Interwar years ==
''Pennsylvanian'' resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time,&lt;ref name=Cochran-363 /&gt; ''Pennsylvanian'' continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful career. One incident of note occurred on 28 November 1930, when ''Pennsylvanian'' hit a [[Southern Pacific Company|Southern Pacific]] ferry near [[Goat Island (Yerba Buena Island)|Goat Island]] (present-day Yerba Buena Island) in a dense fog in [[San Francisco Bay]]. ''Pennsylvanian'' hit the stern of the ferry and caused damage to the ferry's superstructure and destroyed about {{convert|15|ft|m}} of the ferry's railing. No one on either ship was injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fog causes two ferry smash-ups | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 29 November 1930 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hints of ''Pennsylvanian''{{'}}s activities throughout the rest of her career can be found from contemporary newspaper reports. In October 1929, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on a shipment that included 2,500 to 3,000 radio sets among ''Pennsylvanian''{{'}}s {{convert|2300|LT|MT|sigfig=3}} of cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B. | title = Shipping News and Activities at Los Angeles Harbor | type = column | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 7 October 1929 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1938, ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that ''Pennsylvanian''{{'}}s captain, C. M. Bamforth, had temporarily turned the deck of the cargo ship into a boatyard to build a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} [[catboat]] for his son in [[Swampscott, Massachusetts]]. Bamforth [[keel laying|laid the keel]] while in San Francisco, bought copper rivets for the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] planking in [[Portland, Oregon]], and began painting the boat after ''Pennsylvanian'' had traversed the Panama Canal. He expected to have the boat finished when ''Pennsylvanian'' arrived in Boston on 22 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Boat built aboard ship; B. &amp; M. reports for 1937 | work = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date = 28 March 1938 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October the same year, ''Pennsylvanian'' delivered {{convert|325|LT|t}} of steel parts for the [[Hale Telescope]] then under construction at the [[Palomar Observatory]] outside [[San Diego]]. The ship had picked up the $375,000 cargo in Philadelphia before sailing for San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mt.

== World War II ==
At some point after the United States entered World War II, ''Pennsylvanian'' was requisitioned by the [[War Shipping Administration]] (WSA), and, as with her pre-U.S. Navy service in World War I, she continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian.&lt;ref name=CSM-US_awards&gt;{{cite news | last = Stone | first = Leon | title = U.S. awards $7,247,637 to Hawaiian ship firm | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 31 March 1945 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From July to September 1942, ''Pennsylvanian'' sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at [[Trinidad]], [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], [[Hampton Roads]], [[Guantánamo Bay]], and [[Cristóbal, Colón|Cristóbal]]. In January 1943, ''Pennsylvanian'' called at [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Iran]], on the [[Persian Gulf]], and returned to Caribbean sailings again by March 1943.&lt;ref name=CPDB&gt;{{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: Pennsylvanian | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=PENNSYLVANIAN~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | accessdate = 12 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May and September 1943, ''Pennsylvanian'' made four transatlantic crossings between New York and [[Liverpool]], making intermediate stops in [[Loch Ewe]] and [[Methil, Fife|Methil]] while in the United Kingdom. The cargo ship made two New York&amp;nbsp;– Guantánamo Bay roundtrips between September and December before resuming transatlantic sailings. After two New York&amp;nbsp;– Liverpool roundtrips between late December 1943 and April 1944, ''Pennsylvanian'' left the United States for the final time on 19 May 1944, arriving in Liverpool on 2 June. She called at the British ports of Methil, Loch Ewe, [[River Clyde|Clyde]], and [[Milford Haven]] in late June and early July, and, sailing from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] in mid July, ''Pennsylvanian'' arrived at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]], France.&lt;ref name=CPDB /&gt; There she was [[scuttling|scuttled]] as part of the [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] for the [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry artificial harbor]] built to support the [[Normandy Invasion]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'' (''DANFS'') and Radigan both give the scuttling date as 16 July. ''Arnold Hague's Ports Database'' has ''Pennsylvanian'' sailing from [[River Clyde|Clyde]] on that date, and lists ''Pennsylvanian''{{'}}s arrival at [[Baie de la Seine|Seine Bay]] on 20 July.&lt;!-- It's possible that in preparing the scant entry on the ship in ''DANFS'' that the scuttling date may have been confused with the ship's World War I decommissioning date of 16 July 1919.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1945, the WSA offered a payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for ''Pennsylvanian'' as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk, scuttled, or were to be retained by the government.&lt;ref name=CSM-US_awards /&gt;
