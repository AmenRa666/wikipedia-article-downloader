'''I Parachute Battery (Bull's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery''' is the [[Headquarters (military)|Headquarters]]  [[Artillery battery|battery]] of [[7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery]], part of the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] of the [[British Army]], currently based in [[Merville Barracks]] in [[Colchester]].

Formed in 1805, the battery took part in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], notably in the [[Peninsular War]] and the [[Battle of Waterloo]]{{snd}}for which service it was awarded its Honour Title as ''Bull's Troop''{{snd}}and the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s.

In 1961, it was given a parachute role as part of [[7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery]] and has seen considerable active service particularly in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]), the [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].

==History==
===Napoleonic Wars===
The battery was formed on 1 February 1805 as I [[Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery|Horse Artillery]]&lt;ref name=Clarke99&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Colchester]], [[Essex]] as a [[horse artillery]] [[Artillery battery|battery]] of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name=MOD&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/regiments/24671.aspx | title=7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery | publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]] | accessdate=2 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Robert Bull]] was appointed to command and he took it to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in August 1809 where it served until 1814.  It arrived too late for the [[Battle of Talavera]], but thereafter took part in most of [[Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] major actions of the [[Peninsular War]] including [[Battle of Bussaco|Bussaco]] (1810), [[Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro|Fuentes de Oñoro]] (1811), [[Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1812)|Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz]], [[Battle of Salamanca|Salamanca]], and [[Siege of Burgos|Burgos]] (1812), [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]], [[Siege of San Sebastián|San Sebastián]], the [[Battle of the Bidassoa|Bidassoa]] and the [[Battle of the Nive|Nive]] (1813) and [[Battle of Bayonne|Bayonne]] (1814).&lt;ref name=NapoleonSeries&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/Britain/Artillery/c_RHACompanies.html | title=British Royal Horse Artillery Companies and the Men Who Led Them – 1793 To 1815 | first=Steve | last=Brown | publisher=The Napoleon Series | date=May 2010 | accessdate=9 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Fuentes d'Onoro, 1811.jpg|thumb|''Captain Norman Ramsay, Royal Horse Artillery, Galloping his Troop Through the French Army to Safety at the Battle of Fuentes d'Onoro, 1811'']]
Its most famous&lt;ref name=MOD/&gt;&lt;ref name=NapoleonSeries/&gt; action during the Peninsular War occurred at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro on 5 May 1811 when it was temporarily under the command of [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] [[William Norman Ramsay|Norman Ramsay]].{{efn|Later, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[William Norman Ramsay|Ramsay]] was killed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] while leading [[H Battery (Ramsay's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery]].&lt;ref name=NapoleonSeries/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Ramsay, William Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The troop was surrounded by French [[cavalry]] and cut off from the main force.  With the guns limbered up and swords drawn, they charged through the surprised enemy horsemen thereby saving themselves from being captured.&lt;ref name=Clarke10&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed with six 5½&quot; [[howitzer]]s,{{efn|This was exceptional: other RHA batteries at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] were armed with a combination of five 6 pounder guns and a single 5½&quot; howitzer or five 9 pounder guns and a single 5½&quot; howitzer.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717034259/www.napoleonic-literature.com/Waterloo_OB/Allied.htm |date=17 July 2012 |title=The Anglo-Allied Army at napoleonic-literature.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/British_Order_of_Battle_WATERLOO.html | title=Wellington's Army in 1815 | accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} it took part in the [[Hundred Days|Hundred Days Campaign]] in 1815.  Early in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] it was ordered to support the garrison at [[Hougoumont#The Defence of Hougoumont|Hougoumont]].  Firing [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] over the heads of friendly troops, in 10 minutes it cleared a nearby wood of French [[tirailleurs]], much to the satisfaction of Wellington and [[Augustus Simon Frazer|Frazer]] (commander of the horse artillery).&lt;ref name=Clarke11&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It then took part in the advance to Paris and joined the Army of Occupation.&lt;ref name=NapoleonSeries/&gt;

In commemoration of its performance in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo, the Honour Title &quot;Bull's Troop&quot; was officially granted to the battery on 13 October 1926.&lt;ref name=Clarke155&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the usual post-war reductions of the British Army, a number of troops of horse artillery were disbanded between 1815 and 1816, including D Troop ([[Beane's Troop]]) on 31 July 1816.&lt;ref name=Clarke96&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining troops were then moved up to assume the next available letter&lt;ref name=Clarke12&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the I Troop became H Troop on the same date.&lt;ref name=Clarke99/&gt;

===Victorian era===
The next forty years were spent in peacetime routine.  The troop was not one of the three sent to take part in the [[Crimean War]],&lt;ref name=Clarke13&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|'Ball Cartridge Brigade', C Troop, and The Rocket Troop took part in the [[Crimean War]], which today are designated as [[B Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|B]], [[C Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|C]], and [[O Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|O Batteries]] respectively.&lt;ref name=Clarke13/&gt;}} nor one of the three dispatched to [[British Raj|India]] in 1858 to assist in the final operations to quell the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref name=Clarke14&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|D, E and F Troops were sent to India in 1858, which today are designated as [[E Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|E]], [[D Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|D]], and [[G Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|G Batteries]] respectively.&lt;ref name=Clarke14/&gt;}}  However, by 1 July 1859 it was in [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] when it was assigned to the Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery&lt;ref name=Frederick430&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with all the existing horse artillery batteries of the [[Royal Artillery]].  This was an administrative, rather than tactical, formation.&lt;ref name=Clarke116&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the Rebellion, the [[British Crown]] took direct control of India from the [[East India Company]] on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1858]].  The [[Presidency armies]] transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army.  Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries).  On 19 February 1862, the Horse Brigade RA became the 1st Horse Brigade RA and the [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]] horse artillery formed the 2nd to 5th Horse Brigades.&lt;ref name=FrederickIHA&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|pp=428–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The 1st Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery became 2nd Horse Brigade RA, the Madras Horse Artillery became 3rd Horse Brigade RA, the Bombay Horse Artillery became 4th Horse Brigade RA and the 2nd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery became 5th Horse Brigade RA. The 3rd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery was split between 2nd and 5th Horse Brigades RA.&lt;ref name=FrederickIHA/&gt;}}

The 1st Brigade with 10 batteries was much larger than the other four (with four to seven batteries each).  Therefore, a reorganization of the Horse Artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as [[A Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|A]] and [[B Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|B Brigades]].&lt;ref name=Clarke53&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|At the same time, 2nd Brigade become [[C Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|C Brigade]], 3rd become [[D Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|D Brigade]], 4th become [[E Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|E Brigade]], and 5th become [[F Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|F Brigade]].&lt;ref name=Clarke53/&gt;}}  The battery was moved to B Brigade, and as battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, it was redesignated as D Battery, B Brigade (or D/B Battery in short).&lt;ref name=Clarke99/&gt;  The battery was at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]] at this time.&lt;ref name=Clarke123&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1866, the term &quot;[[Royal Horse Artillery]]&quot; appeared in Army List&lt;ref name=Frederick431&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the battery was designated D Battery, B Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery from about this time.  Another reorganization on 14 April 1877 saw the number of brigades reduced to three (of 10 batteries each); the battery{{snd}}at [[Meerut]]&lt;ref name=Clarke117&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}joined A Brigade and became I Battery, A Brigade.&lt;ref name=Frederick433&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of brigades was further reduced to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882 without effecting the designation of the battery&lt;ref name=Frederick435&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=435}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which time it was at [[Royal Artillery Barracks|Woolwich]].&lt;ref name=Clarke118&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigade system was finally abolished on 1 July 1889.  Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation&lt;ref name=Clarke54&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the battery took on its final designation as I Battery, Royal Horse Artillery.&lt;ref name=Clarke99/&gt;

The battery did not take part in the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name=Clarke55&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Of the 10 RHA batteries that took part in the [[Second Boer War]]:&lt;ref name=Clarke55/&gt;
* [[A Battery (The Chestnut Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|A]], [[J (Sidi Rezegh) Battery Royal Horse Artillery|J]] and [[M Battery Royal Horse Artillery|M Batteries]] were unbrigaded
* [[Q (Sanna's Post) Battery Royal Artillery|Q]], [[T Battery (Shah Sujah's Troop) Royal Artillery|T]] and [[U Battery Royal Horse Artillery|U Batteries]] were assigned to [[1st Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Cavalry Brigade]]
* [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|G]] and [[P Battery Royal Artillery|P Batteries]] were assigned to [[2nd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Cavalry Brigade]]
* [[O Battery (The Rocket Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|O]] and [[R Battery Royal Horse Artillery|R Batteries]] were assigned to [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Cavalry Brigade]]}}

===First World War===
The brigade system was reintroduced on 1 March 1901, this time as tactical formations, and the battery was assigned to the VIII Brigade-Division, RHA (redesignated as [[VII Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|VII Brigade, RHA]] on 1 October 1906) along with [[L Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|L Battery]].&lt;ref name=Frederick443&gt;{{harvnb|Frederick|1984|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903 it was stationed at [[Secunderabad]]&lt;ref name=Clarke142&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1905 it took part in the [[Rawalpindi Parade 1905|Rawalpindi Parade]].&lt;ref name=Rawalpindi&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vsdh.org/feltham/cathy_day/rawal2.htm | title=Rawalpindi Parade 1905 | accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:QF13pounderBouncingNYTribune20October1918.jpg|thumb|left|Photo showing [[13 pounder]] gun team galloping into action.]]
By the time the [[First World War]] broke out, the battery had been re-equipped with six [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] [[13 pounder]]s&lt;ref name=Clarke45&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was stationed at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]], still assigned to VII Brigade with L Battery and attached to the [[1st Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Cavalry Brigade]].&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marksrussianmilitaryhistory.info/BRIT14.html|title=The British Army, 1914|last1= Conrad|first1= Mark|year=1996|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On mobilization, it joined [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|The Cavalry Division]] and served with it on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=Becke4&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, the batteries were permanently assigned to the cavalry brigades from September 1914 onwards and the battery was attached to 1st Cavalry Brigade on 17 September.&lt;ref name=Becke5&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It crossed to [[France]] between 15 and 18 August 1914, concentrated with the division around [[Maubeuge]] between 18 and 20 August, and moved forward towards [[Mons]] on 21 August.&lt;ref name=Becke6&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first action was the [[Battle of Mons]] on 23 and 24 August where the division formed the left flank.&lt;ref name=Lomas3839&gt;{{harvnb|Lomas|1997|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It took part in the subsequent [[Great Retreat|retreat]], notably the [[Battle of Le Cateau]], the [[Action at Néry]] and the [[First Battle of the Marne]], before advancing again to the [[First Battle of the Aisne]] and the [[Race to the Sea]] ([[Battle of Messines (1914)|Battle of Messines]]).&lt;ref name=Becke6/&gt;

In 1915 it took part in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] ([[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Frezenberg (8–13 May)|Battle of Frezenberg]], 9–13 May, and [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Bellewaarde (24–25 May)|Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge]], 24 May).&lt;ref name=Becke6/&gt;  The only action in 1916 was at the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] (15 September) when it was in reserve to [[XIV Corps (United Kingdom)|XIV Corps]] of [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]].&lt;ref name=Becke6/&gt;  In 1917, it supported the division in a number of major actions including the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (April, [[Battle of Arras (1917)#First Battle of the Scarpe (9–14 April 1917)|First Battle of the Scarpe]]) and the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (November and December, including the Tank Attack, the Capture of Bourlon Wood and the German Counter-attacks).&lt;ref name=Becke7&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1935|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At other times, the battery served in the trenches as infantry.&lt;ref name=Clarke45/&gt;

1918 saw greater action as the war of movement resumed, including the German [[Operation Michael]] (March, the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Battle of St. Quentin]], the [[First Battle of Bapaume]] and the [[Battle of Rosières]]), the [[Hundred Days Offensive|Advance to Victory]] (August, [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]]), the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|Second Battle of the Somme]] (August, [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]]) and the battles of the [[Hindenburg Line]] (October, [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]] and [[Battle of the Selle|the Pursuit to the Selle]]).&lt;ref name=Becke7/&gt;

At the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], it was still serving with 1st Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BEF GHQ|1918|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war period===
Still with the 1st Cavalry Division, it took part in the advance of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] into [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Becke7/&gt;  E Subsection{{efn|name=Subsection|A Subsection consisted of a single gun and limber drawn by six horses (with three drivers), eight gunners (riding on the limber or mounted on their own horses), and an ammunition wagon also drawn by six horses (with three drivers).&lt;ref name=Clarke43&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two Subsections formed a Section and in a six gun battery these would be designated as Left, Centre and Right Sections.&lt;ref name=Clarke45/&gt;}} was the first British gun to enter Germany, crossing the frontier at [[Poteau, Belgium|Poteau]] (between [[St. Vith]] and [[Malmedy]] and now in the Belgian province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]]) at 9am on 1 December 1918.&lt;ref name=Clarke31&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It crossed the [[Rhine]] by 13 December.&lt;ref name=Becke7/&gt;  

It transferred from Germany to [[IV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|IV Brigade, RHA]] at [[Newbridge, County Kildare|Newbridge]] and [[Kilkenny]] in May 1919.&lt;ref name=Clarke148&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IV Brigade survived the immediate post-war reductions in the strength of the RHA, but was dissolved in October 1921 and the batteries became independent: I Battery was posted to India.&lt;ref name=Clarke134&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3.7inchHowitzerTowedByLightDragonTractor.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Light Dragon tractor towing a [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7 inch howitzer]] on Carriage Mk IV and limber.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the battery served as a separate unit, rotating through the five remaining battery stations of the RHA at [[Meerut]], [[Risalpur]], [[Sialkot]], and [[Trimulgherry]] in India and [[St John's Wood Barracks]] in London.&lt;ref name=Clark62&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mechanisation of the RHA began in 1934 and by 1936 the battery{{snd}}now at Risalpur{{snd}}had been given a mix of equipment: two sections{{efn|name=Subsection}} had [[18 pounder]]s and one had [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7&quot; Howitzers]] towed by Dragon gun tractors.&lt;ref name=Clarke50&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1936, the battery returned to the United Kingdom where it joined [[II Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery|II Brigade, RHA]] at [[Raglan Barracks|Newport]].&lt;ref name=Clarke125&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1938, field artillery brigades were reorganized from three six-gun batteries to two 12-gun batteries.  Rather than disband existing batteries, they were instead linked in pairs.  As a result, on 11 May, [[H Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|H Battery]] (from 8th Field Brigade) and I Battery were linked as H/I Battery, RHA.&lt;ref name=Clarke126&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|After linking RHA batteries in pairs, just [[C Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|C Battery]] with [[4th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery]] in Egypt and [[K Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|K Battery]] at [[St John's Wood Barracks]] remained unlinked.&lt;ref name=Clarke51&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  With effect from May 1938, brigades were redesignated as regiments and II Brigade became [[2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery|2nd Regiment, RHA]] on 21 May.&lt;ref name=Clarke151&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1993|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By August 1939 the battery had been fully mechanized and equipped with 18/25 pounders.&lt;ref name=Clarke50/&gt;{{efn|18/25 pounders were [[25 pounder]] guns mounted on late model [[18 pounder]] carriages.&lt;ref name=Bellis7&gt;{{harvnb|Bellis|1995|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the battery was still linked with H Battery as H/I Battery in 2nd Regiment, RHA.  It remained with the 2nd RHA throughout the war.&lt;ref name=Clarke151/&gt;

Initially part of [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|The Armoured Division]] in the United Kingdom, in October 1939 it moved to France where the regiment was placed under direct command of General Headquarters, [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|BEF]].&lt;ref name=Joslen215&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was still serving with the BEF when the [[Battle of France]] broke out in May 1940.&lt;ref name=Joslen462&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After evacuation from the continent, it joined the [[2nd Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Armoured Division]] and was transferred to Egypt with the division in November and December 1940.&lt;ref name=Joslen216&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From January to May 1941 it took part in the [[Battle of Greece]] with the [[1st Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Brigade]].&lt;ref name=Joslen145&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the BEF in 1940 showed the limitations of having artillery regiments formed with two 12-gun batteries: field regiments were intended to support an infantry brigade of three battalions (or armoured brigade of three regiments).  This could not be managed without severe disruption to the regiment.  As a result, field regiments were reorganised into three 8-gun batteries.&lt;ref name=Forty73&gt;{{harvnb|Forty|1998|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly, it was not until April 1942 that H/I was unlinked.&lt;ref name=Clarke151/&gt;  At this point the battery was armed with eight [[25 pounder]]s.&lt;ref name=Joslen567&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 21 April 1942, it served with [[22nd Guards Brigade]] under command of [[2nd South African Division]] in the [[Battle of Gazala]].&lt;ref name=Joslen265&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 June it transferred to [[22nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|22nd Armoured Brigade]] and took part in the [[Battle of Mersa Matruh]] and the [[First Battle of El Alamein|Defence of the El Alamein Line]].&lt;ref name=Joslen168&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 24 August 1942 it rejoined the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]].  It served with this division throughout the rest of the [[Western Desert Campaign]] and the [[Tunisia Campaign]], in particular, the battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], [[Operation Pugilist|Tebaga Gap]], [[Battle of Wadi Akarit|Akarit]], [[Battle of El Kourzia|El Kourzia]] and [[Tunisia Campaign|Tunis]].  It moved with the division to [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] in May 1944, fighting at the [[Battle of Coriano]] on the [[Gothic Line]].&lt;ref name=Joslen13&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regiment left 1st Armoured Division on 26 September 1944 and came under direct command of Headquarters, [[Allied Armies in Italy]] where it remained until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Joslen467&gt;{{harvnb|Joslen|1990|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===
Post-war, the battery remained part of the 2nd RHA, equipped with [[Sexton (artillery)|Sexton]] [[25 pounder]] [[self-propelled gun]]s.  Initially stationed in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], by 1950 it was at [[Hildesheim]] in Germany as part of the [[BAOR]].&lt;ref name=Units2RHA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/royal-artillery/2nd-regiment-rha.html | title=2nd Regiment RHA | publisher=British Army units from 1945 on | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=A. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1958, 2nd RHA reverted to the [[Royal Artillery]] as [[2nd Regiment Royal Artillery|2nd Field Regiment, RA]] and the battery was transferred to [[4th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery|4th RHA]] in exchange for [[N Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|N Battery]].&lt;ref name=Clarke151/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units2RA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/royal-artillery/2nd-regiment-ra.html | title=2nd Regiment RA | publisher=British Army units from 1945 on | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=A.

In 1961, it was decided to convert 33rd Parachute Light Regiment RA into a RHA regiment. As a result, 4th RHA reverted to the Royal Artillery as [[4th Regiment Royal Artillery]] and its three batteries{{snd}}[[F Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|F]], [[G Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|G]] and I{{snd}} were transferred to [[7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery]] on 27 June 1961.&lt;ref name=Units4RHA/&gt;  Initially equipped with the [[OTO Melara Mod 56|105mm Pack Howitzer]], in 1974 the battery (and regiment) was re-armed with the [[L118 light gun]].&lt;ref name=Units7RHA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/royal-artillery/7th-regiment-rha.html | title=7th Regiment RHA | publisher=British Army units from 1945 on | accessdate=6 December 2015 | author=A. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than a period from 1977 to 1984 when the battery (and the regiment) was rerolled as a field artillery unit and posted to the [[BAOR]] in Germany, it has been based in England, initially at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]] but latterly at [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester]].&lt;ref name=Units7RHA/&gt;

Since 1961, it has been posted to [[Kuwait]] in 1961, [[Aden]] in 1964, a number of [[roulement]] tours to Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) in the [[infantry]] role, [[Belize]] in 1992, [[Cyprus]] as part of [[UNFICYP]] (June to December 1994), [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Kosovo]] ([[Operation Agricola]]) in June 1999, [[Sierra Leone]] ([[Operation Silkman]]) in May 2000, [[Afghanistan]] ([[Operation Jacana]]) in 2001 and 2002, the [[Iraq War|Gulf War]] ([[Operation Telic]]) from March 2003, and Afghanistan again ([[Operation Herrick]]) in 2008.&lt;ref name=Units7RHA/&gt;

===Current status===
Under [[Army 2020]] plans, 7 PARA RHA was reduced from five to three batteries; [[V Battery, Royal Horse Artillery|V Battery]] was placed in suspended animation{{efn|name=SA|&quot;Suspended animation&quot; means that the unit continues to exist but without any personnel or equipment assigned.&lt;ref name=Bellis6&gt;{{harvnb|Bellis|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in May 2013&lt;ref name=FaceV&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152862595705615.1073741870.318319690614&amp;type=1The | title=Parade marks artillery battery’s proud history | author=British Army | publisher=Facebook | date=28 May 2013 | accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Headquarters#Military|headquarters]] battery{{snd}}H Battery{{snd}} was transferred to [[1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery|1st RHA]] in August of the same year.  As a consequence, I Battery was redesignated as the headquarters battery of the regiment as I Parachute HQ Battery (Bull's Troop).&lt;ref name=FaceH&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153086304770615.1073741932.318319690614&amp;type=3 | title=Parade completes airborne gunners’ reorganisation | author=British Army | publisher=Facebook | date=2 August 2013 | accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides command and control for the regiment.&lt;ref name=MOD/&gt;
