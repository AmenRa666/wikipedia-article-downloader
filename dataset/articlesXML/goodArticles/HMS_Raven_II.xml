'''HMS ''Raven II''''' was a [[seaplane carrier]] of the [[Royal Navy]] used during [[World War I]]. Converted from the captured German freighter ''Rabenfels'', the ship's aircraft conducted [[aerial reconnaissance]], observation and bombing missions in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]] during 1915–17 even though the ship was not [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Royal Navy until mid-1915. She fruitlessly searched the [[Indian Ocean]] for the German [[commerce raider]] {{SMS|Wolf|auxiliary cruiser|2}} in mid-1917. ''Raven II'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in late 1917 and became a [[Merchant Navy]] [[collier (ship)|collier]] for the last year of the war. She was sold off in 1923 and had a succession of owners and names until she was sunk during [[World War II]] while under Japanese ownership.

==Description==
''Raven II'' was {{convert|394|ft|5|in|m}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|51|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|27|ft|6|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=l1&gt;Layman, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; She was rated at 4,706 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]]. The ship had one propeller shaft powered by one [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|quadruple-expansion steam engine]] that used steam generated by an unknown number of coal-fired [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s. ''Raven II'' had a maximum speed of {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner and Gray, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The German freighter [[steamship|SS]] ''Rabenfels'' was built by [[Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson]] and completed in December 1903. On the outbreak of war in August 1914, she was seized by the British authorities whilst in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]] and was requisitioned for service under the [[Red Ensign]] in January 1915 to operate [[seaplanes]].&lt;ref name=l1/&gt; No special modifications were made to the ship; the aircraft were stowed on the aft hatch covers and handled with her cargo booms.&lt;ref name=tc7&gt;Turncoat Carriers, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aenne Rickmers'' operated two French [[Nieuport]] [[floatplane]]s that had been off-loaded by the {{ship|French seaplane carrier|Foudre||2|up=yes}}; they were flown by French pilots with British observers.&lt;ref name=l1/&gt; Later, the ship operated included British [[Short Type 184]], [[Sopwith Schneider]], [[Sopwith Baby]] and [[Short Admiralty Type 827]] [[floatplane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Layman, pp. 40, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first two months of 1915, the ship and her aircraft supported Allied operations in Syria, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. Aside from reconnaissance duties, they delivered and recovered Allied spies as well as observed for ships performing [[naval bombardment|coastal bombardments]]. Around 20 March, ''Rabenfels'' arrived in [[Moudros|Mudros]] to load the aircraft and crew of the damaged [[HMS Anne (1915)|''Aenne Rickmers'']] (later HMS ''Anne'').&lt;ref name=tc7/&gt; The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 12 June 1915 and renamed HMS ''Raven II''.&lt;ref name=l1/&gt; On 17 August, both ''Anne'' and ''Raven II'' spotted for the French [[armoured cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|1899|2}} as she bombarded [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]].&lt;ref name=tc7/&gt; In January 1916, she was assigned to the [[East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron]] together with the carriers {{HMS|Empress|1914|2}}, {{HMS|Ben-my-Chree||2}} and ''Anne''. The squadron was under the command of the [[General Officer Commanding]], Egypt and its primary duty was to watch Turkish positions and movements in southern Palestine and the Sinai in early 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the end of March, ''Raven II'' was sent to the Red Sea to attack Turkish troops threatening [[Aden]]; she carried one two-seat Short floatplane and five Sopwith Schneiders for this operation. After a preliminary reconnaissance mission, on 2–3 April her aircraft dropped ninety-one {{convert|20|lb|adj=on}} bombs as well as leaflets urging the Arab auxiliaries to desert. The ship returned to the Syrian coast for patrols and was transferred to [[Kastellorizo]] in early July to conduct [[aerial reconnaissance]] and bombing missions in that area. ''Raven II'' was transferred to the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] later that month to take aerial photographs of the head of gulf as well as the east coast of the Red Sea. Her aircraft observed for the [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{HMS|M21||2}} as she bombarded a Turkish encampment in the Sinai. One aircraft was forced to land, but it was taken in tow by the monitor and delivered back to ''Raven II''.&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The East Indies and Egypt Squadron reassembled in late August with ''Raven II'', ''Anne'' and ''Ben-my-Chree'' and the aircraft from the three carriers attacked the Turkish supply dump at [[El Afule]] for thirty minutes. The squadron then steamed south along the Palestinian coast where they encountered two Turkish supply dhows. One was sunk by the escorting {{ship|French destroyer|Arbalète||2|up=yes}} while the other was captured. The squadron flew off seven aircraft that attacked an encampment at [[Bureir]] and a nearby railroad [[viaduct]]. ''Raven II'' was then sent to the [[Antalya|Adalia]] area on the Turkish coast where her aircraft bombed a factory at [[Fineka]] and searched for U-boat bases&lt;ref&gt;Turncoat Carriers, pp. 291&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September, the ship was in Port Said preparing for another [[sortie]] into the Red Sea when she was hit by a bomb dropped by a German aircraft (probably the first successful air attack on an aviation vessel).&lt;ref name=tc2/&gt; Although ''Raven II'' was only lightly damaged, ''Anne'' was sent in her place. ''Raven II'' relieved Anne on 26 October in the Red Sea and her aircraft bombed Turkish forces advancing on [[Rabigh]] and [[Yenbo]] on 10 December. Shortly afterwards, the ship was transferred back to the Eastern Mediterranean where her aircraft attacked a bridge over the [[Ceyhan River]] with one {{convert|65|lb|adj=on}} bomb and eight {{convert|16|lb|adj=on}} bombs on 27 December.&lt;ref name=tc2/&gt;

On 10 March 1917, ''Raven II'' and the {{ship|French armoured cruiser|Pothuau||2|up=yes}} sailed for the Indian Ocean to hunt for the German [[Q-ship]] ''Wolf''. For this mission she carried a Short Baby and two Short 184s. The two ships searched the [[Laccadive Islands]] en route to [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]], which they reached on 2 April. They then searched the [[Chagos Archipelago]] and the [[Maldive Islands]] and returned to Colombo. Engine problems forced a Short 184 to make an [[emergency landing]] on 21 April in the Maldives; the crew rejoined the ship on 6 May after a series of adventures that inspired [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s story &quot;A Flight of Fact&quot;.&lt;ref name=tc2&gt;Turncoat Carriers, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raven II'' recovered the floatplane and its aircraft continued to fly search missions from Colombo until 21 May. She then joined a convoy bound for Egypt and arrived back in Port Said on 10 June. In early November, the ship's aircraft observed fire for a variety of ships during the [[Third Battle of Gaza]].&lt;ref name=tc2/&gt;

===Commercial service===
HMS ''Raven II'' was paid off shortly afterwards and, renamed ''Ravenrock'', served as a collier under the Red Ensign from January 1918 until the end of the war under the management of Grahams &amp; Co. She was sold to British Dominion Steamship Co. in 1923 and resold later that year to Karafuto Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha (KKK), which renamed her ''Heiyei Maru No. 7''. In 1935, the ship was sold to Inuri KKK and she was renamed ''Heiei Maru No. 7'' in 1938. The ship was sunk during World War II, although the circumstances are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Layman, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;
