'''Ernest Cotton Deane''' {{post-nominals|MC}} (4 May 1887 – 25 September 1915) was a medical officer of the [[British Indian Army]] and an Irish international rugby player. Born in the city of [[Limerick]], Ireland, he went to school in Kingstown (present day [[Dún Laoghaire]]) in County Dublin and then studied medicine at the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI), graduating in 1909. He was selected to play rugby for {{nrut|Ireland}} in one match, against {{nrut|England}} in February 1909. His rugby career was cut short when he broke his leg in a match against [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford University]].

Deane was commissioned into the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in 1911, after a period as house surgeon at the [[Adelaide Hospital (Dublin)|Adelaide Hospital]], Dublin. In 1913, he was posted to India and served in [[Burma]]. He was stationed in [[Meerut]] at the start of the First World War. From there, he travelled to France with the [[Garhwal Brigade]] of the [[Indian Expeditionary Force]], landing in [[Marseille]] in September 1914. He was deployed immediately to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where he served first with the 20th Field Ambulance and then as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment]]. His unit saw much active service. On 22 August 1915, he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four men who had been wounded by artillery fire. A month later, his regiment participated in the [[Battle of Loos]], and was almost entirely obliterated. He was shot dead after going to help some injured soldiers: his action earned him a [[mention in despatches]]. Deane was one of 60 RCSI doctors to receive the Military Cross in the First World War, and one of 17 to be killed in action.

==Early life==
Ernest Deane, born in the city of [[Limerick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000010022/|title=Census of Ireland 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland on 4 May 1887, was the third of the four sons of Thomas and Aileen Deane of [[Dún Laoghaire|Kingstown]] (present day Dún Laoghaire), County Dublin.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=40}}&lt;ref name=&quot;readingroommanchester&quot;&gt;{{CWGC|id=281600|name=DEANE, ERNEST COTTON}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ourheroes.southdublinlibraries.ie/node/16397 | title=Ernest Cotton Deane – Our Heroes | work=southdublinlibraries.ie | accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Corrig School, Kingstown, from 1901 to 1904 then went on to study medicine at the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] from 1904 to 1909.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=40}} He became [[senior house officer|house surgeon]] at the [[Adelaide Hospital (Dublin)|Adelaide Hospital]], Dublin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramc-ww1.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ramc-ww1.com/profile.php?cPath=292_511_544&amp;profile_id=10509&amp;osCsid=250dc14858435b432eb17d5719950a04 | title=RAMC: Royal Army Medical Corps WW1 | work=ramc-ww1.com | accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby===
[[File:Ireland Rugby 1909.JPG|thumb|left|Ireland Rugby Team in 1909: Deane is standing on the left.]]
Deane was an all-round sportsman, skilled in golf, lawn tennis, horse-riding and shooting. Furthermore, at Corrig, Deane was captain of the school's rugby XV, and later he captained the Adelaide Hospital XV, and the [[Monkstown Football Club|Monkstown]] XV.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=40}} He was selected to play wing for {{nrut|Ireland}} in the match against {{nrut|England}} at [[Lansdowne Road]], Dublin, on 13 February 1909, which Ireland lost 5–11.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.espn.co.uk/ireland/rugby/match/19121.html | title=Rugby Union – ESPN Scrum – Ireland v England at Lansdowne Road | work=ESPN scrum | accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was England's first victory on Irish soil since 1895. Deane's opposite number that day was the New Zealand-born Alexander Palmer of [[London Hospital FC]], whose speed allowed him to get around Deane, and to score two of England's three tries, and a conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=&quot;Onlooker&quot;|title=The Playground|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=ST19090403.2.12&amp;srpos=3|accessdate=10 March 2016|work=Southland Times|date=3 April 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Match Centre: Ireland v England 1909|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/rugby/fixturesandresults/match_centre.php?section=overview&amp;fixid=25685|website=Irish Rugby|publisher=IRFU|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the start of the next season, on 29 November 1909, Deane was part of the Monkstown team to play [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford University]]. During the game, he collided with [[Robert Bourne (politician)|Robert Bourne]], breaking his own leg and bringing his rugby career to an end.{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldrugbymuseumblog.wordpress.com/2015/09/25/lest-we-forget-ernest-cotton-deane-mc-ireland-25091915/|title=Lest We Forget- Ernest Cotton Deane MC (Ireland) 25/09/1915|work=World Rugby Museum: from the vaults}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
At the start of the 20th century, many Irish doctors joined the British armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcsi.ie&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rcsi.ie/files/rcsi_matters_jan_2015/#page66 | title=RCSI Doctors in World War One | publisher=RCSI | work=RCSI Matters | date=January 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deane himself was commissioned temporary lieutenant in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC) on 28 July 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 28526|date= 29 August 1911|startpage=6374|accessdate=11 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed 9 February 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28580|date=13 February 1912|startpage=28580|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1913, he went to India and served in Burma. He was stationed at [[Meerut]] when the First World War broke out.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramc-ww1.com&quot;/&gt; He went to France with the [[Garhwal Brigade]] of the [[7th (Meerut) Division]] of the [[Indian Expeditionary Force]],{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=40}} arriving in Marseilles on 26 September 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramc-ww1.com&quot;/&gt; He was attached to the 20th Field Ambulance, and later served as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment]], in active service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ramc-ww1.com&quot;/&gt;

A few days before he died, Deane was awarded the [[Military Cross]],{{sfn|Sewell|1919|p=41}} one of 60 awarded to RCSI doctors in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcsi.ie&quot;/&gt; Frederick Conway Dwyer, president of the RCSI, proudly read out Deane's citation in an address to students of the college, and commended recent licentiates to enter the RAMC.{{sfn|Conway Dwyer|1915|pp=323–325}} The citation in the Gazette said:{{quote|For conspicuous gallantry on 22nd August 1915, near Fauquissart. A standing patrol 120 yards in front of our line was bombed by the enemy at about 10 p.m., the only notification being two loud bomb explosions. Captain Deane, without any knowledge of the enemy's strength, at once got over the parapet and ran by himself to the spot under rifle and machine gun fire. Finding four wounded men he returned for stretchers and got them back into safety. This is not the first time that Captain Deane's gallantry under fire has been brought to notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29313|date=1 October 1915|startpage=9719|supp=yes|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 25 September, Deane's battalion, the 2nd Leicesters, took part in the [[Battle of Loos]], in a diversionary attack by the Indian Corps to draw away German reserves from the main attack.{{sfn|Corrigan|1999|p=225}} According to the personal account of George Wilfred Grossmith, after the battle, the battalion ceased to exist, and most of the other regiments of the Meerut Division were decimated.{{sfn|Warner|1976|p=193}} The artillery bombardment prior to the infantry assault had failed to destroy all of the German barbed wire defences, and some men got caught up in them. Deane went to help. Returning across the open, he was killed instantly by a bullet to the head. His Colonel, who was himself badly wounded, wrote to his family saying: {{quote|He was the most gallant fellow I ever met, and we all loved him in the regiment, both officers and men. He was just a part of us, and the few of us left mourn his loss very deeply. We had a big battle on the 25th, and your son went out to try and help some wounded in and got killed. I believe his death was instantaneous, but I am not sure, as I was wounded myself, and had to be taken back. His body was recovered and was buried by our Padre, and I will give you exact location of cemetery afterwards. Everyone knew Deane as one of the bravest of the brave, and it was only the other day that he got one of the best deserved and gallantly won honours, when he was awarded the Military Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramc-ww1.com&quot;/&gt;}} Following this action, he was [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29422|supp=yes|date=31 December 1915|startpage=64|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Ernest Deane was one of 17 RCSI doctors killed in action during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcsi.ie&quot;/&gt; He is buried at the Rue-du-Bacquerot No 1 Military Cemetery (Grave II.D.14), Laventie, France.&lt;ref name=&quot;readingroommanchester&quot;/&gt;
