The '''Northrop F-20 Tigershark''' (initially '''F-5G''') was a privately financed [[light fighter]], designed and built by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]]. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop's [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]], featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible [[radar]]. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained [[beyond-visual-range missile|beyond-visual-range]] air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.

Much of the F-20's development was carried out under a [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) project called &quot;FX&quot;. FX sought to develop fighters that would be capable in combat with the latest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft, but excluding sensitive front-line technologies used by the [[United States Air Force]]'s own aircraft. FX was a product of the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]]'s military export policies, which aimed to provide foreign nations with high quality equipment without the risk of US front-line technology falling into Soviet hands. Northrop had high hopes for the F-20 in the international market, but policy changes following [[Ronald Reagan]]'s election meant the F-20 had to compete for sales against aircraft like the F-16, the USAF's latest fighter design. The development program was abandoned in 1986 after three prototypes had been built and a fourth partially completed.&lt;ref name = Johnsen_p92-8&gt;{{harvnb |Johnsen|2006|pp= 92–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===F-5E===
When the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] entered office in 1961, the U.S. Department of Defense was instructed to find an inexpensive fighter aircraft that the United States could offer to its allies through the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act]]. A number of designs were studied, including stripped-down versions of the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader]], and the newly designed Northrop N-156F. On 23 April 1962, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) informed the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] that the N-156F had been selected, under the designation F-5 and given the name &quot;Freedom Fighter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald World Aircraft&quot;&gt;Donald 1997, p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt; 847 F-5's of various early marks would be produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2282 &quot;Factsheet: Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter&quot;], National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved: 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] became more common, the U.S. Air Force initiated the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) program to provide an equivalent to allies. The USAF desired a light weight fighter with competitive performance to the MiG, inexpensive when purchased in large numbers, and with reasonable operating costs for prospective customer nations. Although numerous companies entered designs, Northrop's existing F-5 put them in a leading position. They submitted an upgrade, the F-5E Tiger II, with the [[AN/APQ-153]] radar and other changes to allow the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missile to be fired from wing-tip rails. On 20 November 1970, Northrop's entry was announced as the IFA winner.&lt;ref name=Eden&gt;Eden, Paul, ed. &quot;Northrop F-5 family.&quot; ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. London: Amber Books, 2004. ISBN 1-904687-84-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Northrop produced a total of 1,399 F-5E/F Tiger IIs by the time manufacturing ended in 1986.&lt;ref name=Johnsen_p90&gt;{{harvnb|Johnsen|2006|p= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===F-5G and export limitations===
In the late 1970s, the [[Republic of China Air Force|Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force]] started looking for a fighter aircraft to match improvements made in [[mainland China|mainland]] [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]'s air force. In particular, they wanted a platform capable of firing the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] long-range missile. At the time, the US was in the process of opening up ties with the People's Republic of China after President Nixon's famous [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit in 1972]]. China considered US support of Taiwan against their interests, and the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] wanted to tread carefully. They blocked export of all of the AIM-7 capable aircraft, even otherwise outdated early models of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]. The State Department suggested the Israeli [[IAI Kfir]] instead; however, it was rejected.{{Sfn | Inbar | 2008 | p = 33}}  Taiwan was already producing the F-5E under license, so the Department of Defense asked Northrop to study adding an AIM-7 capable radar to the Tiger II as an alternative. This effort became the first of several F-5G studies.&lt;ref&gt;Fink, Donald. &quot;Taiwan Offered F-5G with Sparrow.&quot; ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 21 August 1978, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1977, [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration had announced a new military export policy that limited sales of front line designs to countries within [[NATO]], along with Australia and Japan.&lt;ref name=saga&gt;Frey, Lieutenant Colonel William. [http://www.airpower.au.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1986/may-jun/frey.html &quot;The F-20, Saga of an FX.&quot;] ''Air University Review'', May–June 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter stated at the time that the U.S. could not be &quot;both the world's champion of peace and the world's leading supplier of the weapons of war.&quot;&lt;ref name=saga /&gt; Previously, there was no coherent export policy, fueling concerns that the US's latest technologies might quickly end up in Soviet hands.&lt;ref name=saga /&gt;

Numerous exceptions were made; Israel and Egypt could buy advanced designs under the [[Camp David Agreements]], Israel was even allowed to buy [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]]s, a key component in U.S. air-defense technology. Iran was already receiving the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], and this demonstrated the problem with advanced exports in February 1979 when reports emerged that Iran had sold an [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missile to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Iran Arms Concern.&quot; ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', 19 February 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's F-16 order was initially blocked under this policy, but later allowed in the context of strengthening relations.&lt;ref name = &quot;thorn 252&quot;&gt;Thornton 2004, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite exceptions, the export policy was implemented, covering many potential and current customers. As the F-5G was a relatively modest upgrade to the F-5E, the F-5G appeared to be in a strong position for sales given the limitations placed on rival designs, however Carter personally blocked the sales of the F-5G to Taiwan.&lt;ref name=saga/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 13&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FX===
In 1979, problems with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's [[Dassault Mirage 2000]].&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 2&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Statements by Barry N. Blechman in the U.S. Congress Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Fiscal Year 1980 International Security Assistance Authorization.&quot; ''Government Printing Office'' 1979, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton 2004, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Department argued that the U.S. needed a modern counterpart for the role the F-5E had occupied in the 1960s and 1970s. In light of Carter's concerns, they suggested that a new aircraft be designed for the role, based on technology that would not pose a threat to the U.S. After a lengthy study, in January 1980, President Carter allowed the development of a new export fighter: &quot;FX.&quot;&lt;ref name=saga/&gt; The FX would have to outperform the F-5E; however, it could not use any advanced avionics systems that were also used in US aircraft. Unlike the Mutual Defense Assistance Act programs that led to the F-5E, FX would be entirely privately financed. Moreover, the companies could not market the aircraft directly; all sales would be handled by the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref name=saga/&gt;

Both Northrop and [[General Dynamics]] (GD) responded to the FX requirement. GD's F-16/79 was a variant of the F-16A, replacing the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F100]] engine with the J79 and equipping it with downgraded avionics;&lt;ref name = &quot;thorn 252&quot;/&gt; Northrop responded with the F-5G.&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 14&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FX stumbles and F-20 emerges===
When [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration took power in 1981, the export restrictions put in place by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed.&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 14&quot;/&gt; At first, the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 [[Three Communiques|US-PRC Joint Communiqué]] was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the [[AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo]]. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.&lt;ref&gt;Schemmer, Benjamin. &quot;Pressures Build for DOD to Buy and Help Sell Northrop F-5G as Its Business Prospects Look Bleaker Than Advertised.&quot; ''Armed Forces Journal International'', September 1982, pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Frank Carlucci]] sent a memorandum to the Air Force and Navy, encouraging them to seek out potential foreign customers to procure FX aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Starsiak, M.H. &quot;Implications of Moving Away from Formal Foreign Military Sales (FMS): Procedures for Aircraft Sales.&quot; ASD-XOR Project, ''U.S. Department of the Air Force'', 1982, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; However, four months later Carlucci sent a classified memo to the same services to abandon the FX, and green-lighting the exporting of front-line fighters overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Richard. &quot;Carlucci Reverses FX Policy for Persian Gulf.&quot; ''Defense Week'', 22 November 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, after prompting from the White House, Carlucci reversed his position again, and directed the Air Force to fund a small number of F-20s in the fiscal year 1984 budget.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Richard. &quot;Carlucci to AF: 'Buy the F-20'.&quot; ''Defense Week'', 20 December 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of the FX program seemed doubtful. Following an agreement to sell F-16s to Pakistan,&lt;ref name = &quot;singh&quot;&gt;Singh, Pushpindar. &quot;F-16s for Pakistan: Reactions and Views.&quot; ''Asian Defence Journal'', September 1981, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Northrop felt that the F-5G needed to match the performance of F-16. This would require not only better performance from the engine, but a new and comparable avionics suite as well. Northrop saw that the F-5G was still being viewed as the &quot;FX fighter&quot;, a low-cost option for second-tier air forces. To combat this perception, Northrop requested the designation &quot;F-20&quot;; the USAF approved in late 1982, and of the name ''Tigershark'' in March 1983.&lt;ref name=saga/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 15&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:F-20 cockpit mock-up.jpg|thumb|upright|A mock-up of the prototype cockpit with two multi-function displays and HUD|alt=Mock-up of jet fighter's cockpit, featuring a head-up display behind windshield and displays and dials in front of the pilot.]]

The primary design change between the earlier F-5E and the F-5G was the use of a single [[General Electric F404]] engine that was originally designed for the F/A-18 Hornet.&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 4&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The new engine provided 60% more thrust compared to the combined output of the F-5E's paired [[General Electric J85]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 12&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This improved the aircraft's [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] to 1.13 from 1.0. The new engine gave speed of over Mach&amp;nbsp;2.0, a ceiling over 55,000&amp;nbsp;ft (16,800&amp;nbsp;m), an initial [[Rate of climb|climb rate]] of 52,800&amp;nbsp;ft per minute (16,100m/min).&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald World Aircraft&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnsen_p94-6/&gt;

The wing profile remained the same as the F-5E, but had modified [[leading edge extension]]s (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel [[fly-by-wire]] control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach&amp;nbsp;0.8 and 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft (4,572&amp;nbsp;m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.

The F-20 would also make greater usage of composite materials in its construction.&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 4&quot;/&gt; During its development, several areas using metal were re-designed to use [[fiberglass]], and there were numerous upgrades to various mechanical parts.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, David. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=HuMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA145 &quot;Why the F-20 isn't selling.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1986, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-20's avionics suite was all-new and greatly improved over the earlier designs. The [[General Electric AN/APG-67]] multi-mode radar was the heart of the sensor suite, offering a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. The F-5's electro-mechanical navigation system was replaced with an all-electronic version based on a [[ring laser gyroscope]]. Time from power-on to being able to launch was greatly reduced as a result, to about 22 seconds, and Northrop boasted the aircraft had the shortest scramble time of any contemporary aircraft.&lt;ref name = &quot;pop mech&quot;/&gt; The cockpit of the F-5 was completely re-worked with a large [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and two monochrome multi-function displays set high on the control panel, and the addition of a complete hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control system. Many of the avionics promised to have reliability beyond that of any competing aircraft then in service.&lt;ref&gt;Blinken 1986, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-20 would have been able to utilize most of the common weapons in U.S.'s inventory, including the entire range of [[Mark 80|Mark 80 series]] bombs, the [[AGM-65 Maverick]] air-to-ground missile, and the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] air-to-air missiles. Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two [[M39 cannon]] mounted in the nose.&lt;ref name=fas20/&gt; Production F-20s may have substituted two [[Ford Aerospace]] ''Tigerclaw'' cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and had a higher rate of fire than the M39A2.&lt;ref&gt;William 2000, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-20 did, however, have several problems inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant that there was limited ground clearance, and the position of the [[landing gear]] meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited [[hard point]] weights to 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb (454&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=loadout&gt;[http://www.f20a.com/f20loadout.jpg &quot;F-20 Loadout Chart&quot;], ''Northrop''&lt;/ref&gt; A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single [[Mark 84 bomb|Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb]] or up to five [[Mark 82 bomb|Mk 82 500 lbs bombs]].&lt;ref name=loadout/&gt; Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload/range]] figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.&lt;ref name=requiem&gt;Jurkus, Antony. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2486557 &quot;Requiem for a Lightweight: The Northrop F-20 Strategic Initiative.&quot;] ''Strategic Management Journal'', Vol. 11, No. 1, January 1990, pp. 59–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offered as a low-cost option, the F-20 was significantly more expensive than the F-5E, but much less expensive than other designs like the $30&amp;nbsp;million F-15 Eagle,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=101 &quot;F-15 Eagle Fact Sheet.&quot;] ''National Museum of the United States Air Force'', March 2008.

Retrieved: 6 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The F-20 was projected to consume 53% less fuel, require 52% less maintenance manpower, had 63% lower operating and maintenance costs and had four times the reliability of average front-line designs of the era.&lt;ref name=fas20&gt;[http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/fighter/f20.html &quot;F-20 Tigershark.&quot;] ''Federation of American Scientists'', 7 June 1999. Retrieved: 13 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The F-20 also offer the ability to fire the beyond-visual-range [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] missile, a capability that the F-16 lacked at that time, and did not gain until the Block 15 ADF version in February 1989.&lt;ref&gt;David Donald and Jon Lake, Encyclopedia of World Military Aircraft, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===Testing===
[[File:F-20 Tigershark launching AGM-65 Maverick.jpg|thumb|An F-20 launching an [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missile|alt=Gray jet fighter aircraft fires a white missile.]]
On 30 August 1982, the original engine-change-only F-5G (serial 82-0062, c/n GG1001, registered N4416T) made its [[maiden flight]] piloted by Russ Scott.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr 09 p.33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dorr|2009|p=33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 40-minute flight, the prototype climbed to {{convert|40,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and reached Mach&amp;nbsp;1.04.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr 09 p.33&quot;/&gt; GG1001 demonstrated outstanding reliability; by the end of April 1983 240 flights had been accumulated, including evaluation flights with 10 potential customer nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr 09 p.33&quot;/&gt; The second prototype (serial number 82-0063, registered N3986B, c/n GI1001), featuring the complete avionics suite, made its first flight on 26 August 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr 09 p.36&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dorr|2009|p=36.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The F-20 would fly a total of 1,500 flights prior to its termination;&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 6&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; although these were exclusively flown in ideal conditions.&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 25&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the test program, the F-20 fired the AIM-9 Sidewinder and, in February 1985 the AIM-7 Sparrow. In air-to-ground testing, it fired the [[AGM-65 Maverick]], 2.75 in (70&amp;nbsp;mm) folding fin aerial rockets, dropped Mk. 82 bombs, and fired rounds from a 30&amp;nbsp;mm (1.18&amp;nbsp;in) gun pod (GPU-5/A, four-barrel [[GAU-13/A]]) in addition to the two internal 20&amp;nbsp;mm (.79 in) [[M39 cannon]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2291 &quot;Fact Sheets: Northrop F-20 Tigershark.&quot;] ''National Museum of the United States Air Force''.

Northrop signed a [[Memorandum of Agreement]] with the Air Force in May 1983 that made the Air Force responsible for certifying the F-20's performance, air worthiness and fixed-price program. Aerospace legend [[Chuck Yeager]], employed as a spokesperson for Northrop, touted the aircraft as &quot;magnificent&quot; and was featured in advertising.&lt;ref name = &quot;pop mech&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HuMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Northrop+F-20&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xL_zTdvxD4mw8QPDr4ikBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage &quot;Why the F-20 Isn't Selling.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', 163(3), March 1986, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr 09 p.36&quot;/&gt;

In November 1982, Bahrain became the first customer. South Korea also explored local production of the F-20, and in support improvements were implemented. These included avionics upgrades, an expanded fuel tank, and the use of fibreglass composites. The changes were so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to test them. By 1983, Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20, and its prospects appeared positive.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Mark. &quot;Is 1984 the Year of the Tigershark?&quot; ''Interavia'', April 1984, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 1984, GG1001 crashed in South Korea on a demonstration flight, killing Northrop pilot [[Darrell Cornell]]. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive [[g-force]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorr 09 p.37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dorr|2009|p=37.}}&lt;/ref&gt; GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]], Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on [[G-LOC]]; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the [[Paris Air Show]].&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 16&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle for sales===
In December 1981, President Reagan, reacting to the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], signed a major economic and military aid package for Pakistan that included 40 F-16As.&lt;ref name = &quot;singh&quot;/&gt; The offer was in keeping with U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union, and the idea of &quot;[[containment]]&quot; within a ring of U.S.-friendly countries. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was initially viewed as an attempt to break out of the arranged containment system, thus the U.S. placed a priority on quickly building up a new layer of defense.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Andrew. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3993537 &quot;'The Red Template': US Policy in Soviet-Occupied Afghanistan.&quot;] ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 23, No. 3, June 2002, pp. 467–489.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other U.S. allies saw this as a potential break in the FX policy, and began requesting only &quot;the very best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, James. &quot;Trials of the Tigershark.&quot; ''Air Force'', January 1985, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such approval was increasingly granted starting in 1982.&lt;ref name = &quot;MS 21&quot;&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Venezuela, who had long examined the FX project, agreed to buy 18 F-16As and six F-16Bs, replacing a fleet of [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] interceptors and [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage 5]] ground-attack aircraft.&lt;ref name = &quot;miami cancel&quot;&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB366271C4044C8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM &quot;Northrop scraps F-20 Fighter: $1.2 Billion 'Mercy Killing'.&quot;] ''Miami Herald'', 18 November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden decided to develop their own design, the [[JAS 39 Gripen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams p.72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Williams et al.|2002|p=72.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1983, Turkey announced plans to buy 132 F-16Cs and 28 F-16Ds to replace their Lockheed F-104G/S Starfighter and Northrop F-5A/B.&lt;ref&gt;''New Statesman'', Volume 105, 1983, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Greece, stung by its long-time rival receiving the F-16, purchased 34 F-16C and six F-16Ds in November 1984, giving a firm pledge of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/659942411.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+14%2C+1986&amp;author=(AP)&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=GREECE+GIVES+PLEDGE+IN+BUYING+F-16+JETS&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Greece Gives Pledge in Buying F-16 Jets.&quot;] ''Boston Globe'', 14 January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, late in 1983, the U.S. government made a financial commitment to help Israel develop its own new fighter, the [[IAI Lavi]]. Northrop objected to this, as the Lavi would be a potential competitor to the F-20 in the export market; while Northrop had to privately fund the F-5G, the government was directly subsidizing a foreign competitor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Reagan Approves Credits to Israel for Lavi.&quot; ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 28 November 1983, pp. 27–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Congressional support for Israel overruled Northrop's complaints along with complaints from other branches of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Jane. &quot;Israeli Foreign Policy: South Africa and Central America.&quot; ''South End Press'', 1987, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

While other companies marketed directly to foreign air forces, as part of the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State Department had no interest in selling the FX, from their perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach,&lt;ref name=weeksales&gt;Healy, Melissa. &quot;Government Not Vigorous Salesman for Northrop F-20.&quot; ''Defense Week'', 2 April 1984, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.&lt;ref&gt;Pederson 2002, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional investigation and Air Force collusion===
Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired a series of hearings into FX. [[William Schneider, Jr.]], the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support.&lt;ref name=house&gt;''House Subcommittee on International Security and Scientific Affairs and on Asian and Pacific Affairs'', 1984, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. [[Thomas V. Jones]], Northrop's CEO, argued that there was little point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor.&lt;ref name=house/&gt; Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX.&lt;ref name=weekexports&gt;Kozicharow, Eugene. &quot;USAF Will Increase Export Fighter Role.&quot; ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 9 April 1984, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's concluding remarks, the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.&lt;ref name=house/&gt;

In April 1984, after the Congressional hearings, the USAF was directed to promote FX actively. Several potential customers were briefed during May and June 1984 on the performance and cost of both the F-20 and F-16/79.&lt;ref name=weekexports/&gt; The Air Force published an internal report on FX in late June 1984. The F-20 was characterized as having outstanding performance against viable threats; and seen as a candidate for the Air Force's aggressor requirement. The report additionally stated that the F-20 had been contractor-funded, totaling over $750&amp;nbsp;million, compared to $60&amp;nbsp;million on the F-16/79. However, the report concluded that it had little or no market to sell to.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Policy Statement on FX.&quot; ''USAF/PRIP'', 20 June 1984, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The USAF had a vested interest to encourage F-16 sales; larger production numbers would drive down the cost per unit.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg Easterbrook noted that F-20 may have cast the Air Force in a bad light, as an aircraft developed independent of their input,&lt;ref name=easter&gt;Easterbrook, Gregg. &quot;The Airplane That Doesn’t Cost Enough.&quot; ''Atlantic'', August 1984, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  authors such as Donald Pattillo shared this conclusion.&lt;ref name = &quot;pat 340&quot;&gt;Pattillo 2001, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the F-16 was heavily involved in the USAF hierarchy, originating from a group of officers known as the &quot;[[fighter mafia]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Binkin 1986, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1985, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of State were reconsidering the policy. Despite some calls to support Northrop, FX was abandoned.&lt;ref name=saga/&gt;

===Aggressor and ANG roles===
[[File:F-20 Agressor.jpg|thumb|F-20 &quot;GI1001&quot; carrying its [[Paris Air Show]] identity number &quot;340.&quot;|alt=Dark-blue jet aircraft taxiing on ramp, carrying an external fuel tank under belly.]]

A possibility for a U.S. purchase opened in 1984, for a small number of &quot;aggressor aircraft&quot; for [[dissimilar air combat training]]. This style of training had been introduced by the [[United States Navy]] at their [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|TOPGUN]] school, using the F-5 to simulate the MiG-21. In November 1984, Congress directed the Navy and Air Force to study the use of a single aircraft type to fill similar aggressor roles for both services.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Melissa. &quot;Another Shot at Selling Navy 'Red' Fighters.&quot; ''Defense Week'', 13 November 1984, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1985 the Navy announced they had selected a specially configured version of the F-16. It was rumored that the aircraft was sold at a loss to keep Northrop's F-20 out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Stephen. &quot;The End of the F-20?&quot; ''For Your Eyes Only'', 21 January 1985, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another chance for the F-20 was as an upgrade for the [[Air National Guard]] (ANG). Northrop claimed that the F-20's fast scramble time made it a natural fit for this role, its lower cost would allow the ANG to operate larger aircraft numbers, and that it supported the AIM-7 while the F-16 did not. Additionally, the ANG would not be competing with the Air Force for production quotas, they would be able to replace their aircraft more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Guard Studies F-20.&quot; ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 26 November 1984, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Air Force's requirements had priorities favoring the F-16 for the role; if the ANG flew the F-16, they would further lower unit costs, maintain commonality between the ANG and USAF, and better equip ANG units to perform front line combat roles. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] had also disputed Northrop's lower cost claim in their own research. On 31 October 1986, the Air Force announced that the F-16C had been selected, which had been upgraded to support the AIM-7 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/602720251.html?dids=602720251:602720251&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+01%2C+1986&amp;author=The+New+York+Times&amp;pub=The+Providence+Journal&amp;desc=Dynamics+wins%2C+Northrop+loses+on+jet+fighters+But+both+will+get+a+chance+to+design+next+generation+of+U.S.+combat+planes&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Dynamics wins, Northrop loses on jet fighters; but both will get a chance to design next generation of U.S. combat planes.&quot;] ''The New York Times'', 1 November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Schmidt 1987, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; As several nations had suggested they would accept the F-20 on the condition that it was inducted into the USAF, the selection was a heavy blow to Northrop.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne 1990, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, local production of the F-20 was discussed with India. A move was also made in the 1980s to market the aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force with a license production manufacture of the aircraft. It was evaluated by a Pakistani contingent in the United States, with the F-20 being flown by Abbas Mirza, a senior Pakistani air force fighter pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Ganguly, Sumit.

Hameed commented in 1986 that the F-20 was a &quot;logical choice&quot; for the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia; however, it had &quot;scant chance of being selected&quot; due to political factors, as well as competition from other candidates such as the Mirage 2000 and [[Panavia Tornado ADV]].&lt;ref&gt;Hameed 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;
