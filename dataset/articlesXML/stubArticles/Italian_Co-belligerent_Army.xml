      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14402">The '''Italian Co-belligerent Army''' (''Esercito Cobelligerante Italiano''), '''Army of the South''' (''Esercito del Sud''), or '''Italian Liberation Corps''' (''Corpo Italiano di Liberazione'') were names applied to the [[Royal Italian Army]] during the period when it fought on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], that is to say from September 1943 onwards. During the same period, the [[Allies of World War II|pro-allied]] [[Italian Royal Navy]] and [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian Royal Air Force]] were known as the [[Italian Co-belligerent Navy]] and [[Italian Co-belligerent Air Force]] respectively.
From September 1943, pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] Italian forces became part of the newly formed [[Italian Social Republic]].

The Italian Co-belligerent Army was the result of the [[armistice with Italy|Allied armistice with Italy]] on September 8, 1943; [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] dismissed [[Benito Mussolini]] as Prime Minister in July 1943 following the Allied invasion of Southern Italy, and nominated Marshal of Italy ([[Maresciallo d'Italia]]) [[Pietro Badoglio]] instead, who aligned Italy with the Allies.

Although the Co-belligerent Army provided over 20,000 men for the Allied cause, it was greatly outnumbered by the partisans of the [[Italian Resistance]], who fielded up to 80,000 men on the Allied side, including perhaps 30,000 fighters in the [[Italian Communist Party]]'s partisan units.

== Formation ==
On 28 September 1943, the Italian Co-belligerent Army began when its first military unit was formed in tented reorganization camps near [[Lecce]]. Some of the first soldiers in this unit had just barely managed to escape [[Italian military internees|internment by the Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, ''Italy's Sorrow'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  In accordance with Royal Army Order 70/V, the Italian First Motorized Combat Group (''1• Raggruppamento Motorizzato'') was created.  The unit included elements of two divisions of the old Italian Royal Army:  The [[18 Infantry Division Messina]] and the [[58 Infantry Division Legnano]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jowett, p. 24&quot;&gt;Jowett, ''The Italian Army 1940-43 (3)'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The First Motorized Combat Group had a strength of 295 officers and 5,387 men.

The first action of the First Motorized Combat Group was in the [[Cassino (FR)|Cassino]] sector at [[Battle of San Pietro Infine|Monte Lungo]].  This action did much to remove the Allied distrust of the Italian soldiers fighting on their side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mollo, p. 100&quot;&gt;Mollo, ''The Armed Forces of World War II'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The unit suffered heavy casualties and performed well enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jowett, p. 24&quot;/&gt;

Following service with the [[Fifth United States Army|American 5th Army]] and re-organization, the First Motorized Combat Group was transferred to the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]] on the extreme left of the [[British 8th Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mollo, p. 100&quot;/&gt;

== Italian liberation corps ==
On 17 April 1944, the formation (now 22,000 men strong) assumed the name Italian Liberation Corps (''Corpo Italiano di Liberazione'', or CIL).  The continuous influx of volunteers made it necessary to form further formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mollo, p. 100&quot;/&gt;  The CIL was organized in two new divisions:  The [[184 Airborne Division Nembo|&quot;Nembo&quot;]] and the &quot;Utili.&quot;  The &quot;Nembo&quot; Division was formed around the old Royal Army's parachute division of the same name. The &quot;Utili&quot; Division was formed around the First Motorized Combat Group and was named after its commander, [[General]] [[Umberto Utili]].  In early 1944, a 5,000 man force of Italians fought on the [[Gustav Line]] around [[Monte Cassino]] and acquitted itself well. The Italians once again suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jowett, p. 24&quot;/&gt;

{{Further|Gothic Line order of battle|Operation Grapeshot order of battle}}
After the battle of [[Filottrano]] (July 1944), Italian troops were sent to the rear lines to rest and re-train. In the meantime they were re-kitted with standard British/Commonwealth equipment including [[Battle Dress]] uniforms and [[Brodie helmet|helmets]] (mostly new and not taken off corpses as hearsay sometimes has it).

By early 1945 the CIL had outgrown itself. It was used as the nucleus for six separate Combat Groups (''Gruppi di Combattimento''):  &quot;Cremona&quot;, &quot;Legnano&quot;, &quot;Friuli&quot;, &quot;Mantova&quot;, &quot;Piceno&quot;, and &quot;Folgore&quot;. Each Combat Group was the equal to a weak division and was equipped with British uniforms, materiel and weapons. The established strength for each was 432 officers, 8,578 other rank, 116 field guns, 170 mortars, 502 light machine guns, and 1,277 motor vehicles.  The Combat Groups were given the names of old Royal Army divisions and followed the component numbering system of the component regiments to some extent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jowett, p. 24&quot;/&gt;  These groups were attached to various American and British formations on the [[Gothic Line]].  The following is the &quot;[[order of battle]]&quot; of the Italian Co-belligerent Army as of April 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces High Command was Marshal [[Giovanni Messe]], while the Chief of Staff of the Army was Lieutenant General Paolo Berardi.

=== Combat groups ===
Each infantry regiment fielded three infantry battalions, a mortar company armed with  British [[Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar|ML 3 inch]] mortars and an anti-tank company armed with British [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6 pounder]] guns. The artillery regiments consisted of four artillery groups with British [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|QF 25 pounder]] guns, one anti-tank group with British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|QF 17 pounder]] guns and one anti-air group armed with British versions of the [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40mm]] gun.
