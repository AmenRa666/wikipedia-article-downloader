'''HMCS ''Prince Rupert''''' was a [[River-class frigate]] that served with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]]. She served primarily as a convoy escort in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. She was named for [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]].

''Prince Rupert'' was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program.&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910–1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages= |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid down on 1 August 1942 by [[Yarrows Limited|Yarrows Ltd.]] at [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]] and launched 3 February 1943.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 August 1943 at Esquimalt.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|River-class frigate}}

The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the [[Royal Navy]] at the time, including the [[Flower-class corvette]]. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the [[United Kingdom]], giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.friends-amis.org/index.php/en/document-repository/english/fact-sheets/44-canadian-river-class-frigate-1/file |title=Fact Sheet No. 21 – Canadian River Class Frigates |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral [[Percy Nelles]] of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book|title=Frigates of the Royal Canadian Navy 1943–1974 |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |publisher=Vanwell Publishing |year=1989 |place=Lewiston, New York |pages=6–7, 15 |isbn=0920277225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at {{convert|7200|nmi|km}} at 12 knots.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat [[U-boats]] including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt; 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of {{HMCS|Valleyfield|K329|6}}, they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; The design was too big for the shipyards on the [[Great Lakes]] so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

==War service==
[[File:U-575 Bomben.jpg|thumb|left| 20mm gunfire from ''Prince Rupert'' striking water to port of ''U-575'']]
After working up at [[Pictou, Nova Scotia|Pictou]], ''Prince Rupert'' was assigned to the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] escort group C-3 as Senior Officer's Ship. She was used a trans-Atlantic convoy escort until November 1944.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; On 13 March 1944, ''Prince Rupert'', alongside {{USS|Haverfield|DE-393|6}}, {{USS|Hobson|DD-464|6}} and aircraft from American and British services, sank {{GS|U-575||2}} in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; When the U-boat was spotted by an RCAF patrol plane, ''Prince Rupert'' was detached from the convoy and sped to the sighting. There alongside the aforementioned units, she fought for five hours to sink ''U-575''. In the end the U-boat surfaced and ''Prince Rupert'' helped carry off the survivors, saving fourteen of the sinking submarine's crew.&lt;ref name=Paterson&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cowichanvalleycitizen.com/living/gallant-hmcs-prince-rupert-served-on-the-newfie-derry-run-1.159128 |title=Gallant HMCS Prince Rupert served on the 'Newfie-Derry' run |work=Cowichan Valley Citizen |first=T.W. |last=Paterson |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1944, ''Prince Rupert'' began a refit at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]] which was completed in March 1945. She returned to active service with escort group EG 27, based out of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] and remained with them until June 1945, when she sailed for Esquimalt.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; Upon reaching Esquimalt, ''Prince Rupert'' underwent tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. This meant adding refrigeration, water-cooling capabilities and a change to her camouflage pattern.&lt;ref name=Paterson/&gt; However this refit was cancelled when [[Japan]] surrendered.&lt;ref name=Paterson/&gt; She was paid off there on 15 January 1946. She was sold in 1947 to Capital Iron &amp; Metals Ltd. of [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=Iron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nauticapedia.ca/Articles/Capital_Iron_Ships.php |title=A List of the Ships Scrapped or Broken Up By Capital Iron &amp; Metals Ltd. in Victoria BC. |work=nauticapedia.ca |date=2011 |accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hull was stripped and expended as a breakwater at [[Royston, British Columbia]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;
