[[File:Philip Louis Vian by Charles Wheeler, 1942.jpg|thumb|300px|Philip Louis Vian by [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]], 1942]]
[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir Philip Louis Vian''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|KBE|DSO}} &amp; [[Medal bar|Two Bars]] (15 July 1894&amp;nbsp;– 27 May 1968) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer who served in both World Wars.

Vian specialised in [[naval gunnery]] from the end of World War I, and subsequently received several appointments as gunnery officer. In the early 1930s, he was given command of a destroyer, {{HMS|Active|H14|6}}, and, later, various destroyer flotillas. During this phase of his career, in early 1940, he commanded a force that forcibly [[Altmark Incident|released captured British merchant sailors]] from the German supply ship [[German tanker Altmark|''Altmark'']] in [[Jøssingfjord]] in, then neutral, Norway and, later, his flotilla took an active role in the final action of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].

Much of Vian's wartime service was in the Mediterranean, where he commanded a cruiser squadron, defended several critical convoys and led naval support at the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy. His wartime service was completed in command of the air component of the [[British Pacific Fleet]], with successful actions against the Japanese in Sumatra and the western Pacific. Post-war, Vian served in the United Kingdom, as a [[Fifth Sea Lord]] and as Commander-in-Chief, [[Home Fleet]]. He retired in 1952 with the rank of Admiral of the Fleet, took up commercial directorships and died at home, in 1968.

==Early life==
Born the son of Alsager Vian and Ada Vian (née Renault), Vian joined the Royal Navy as an officer cadet in May 1907 and was educated at the Royal Naval Colleges at [[Osborne House#Naval College|Osborne]] and [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth]].&lt;ref name=UnitHistories&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RN_officersV.html|title=RN Officer career summaries, V|work=World War II Unit Histories and Officers|publisher=Hans Houterman &amp; Jeroen Koppes|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On passing out from Dartmouth in 1911, Vian and his term&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Term&quot; refers to a group of cadets joining in the same intake and educated together.&lt;/ref&gt; sailed for the West Indies on the training cruiser {{HMS|Cornwall|1902|6}}&lt;ref&gt;Vian 1960, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but the cruise was ended by grounding on an uncharted reef off [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monmouth class cruisers|work = Battleships-Cruisers.co.uk|publisher = Cranston Fine Arts|date=2001–2008|url=http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/monmouth_class.htm|accessdate = 30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[midshipman]] on the [[pre-Dreadnought battleship]] {{HMS|Lord Nelson|1906|6}}, which was serving with the [[Home Fleet]], on 15 January 1912.&lt;ref name=Admirals&gt;{{cite web|last=Bevand|first=Paul|author2=Frank Allen|title=Philip Vian|work=Royal Navy Flag Officers, 1904–1945|year=2008|url=http://www.admirals.org.uk/admirals/fleet/vianpl.php|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
At the start of World War I Vian remained on ''Lord Nelson'' which, as an obsolescent ship, was kept at [[Portland Harbour|Portland]] away from danger.&lt;ref name=vian12&gt;Vian 1960, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This was disappointing for Vian, but when the ship was to be transferred to the Mediterranean, he was posted to what he considered to be an even less desirable appointment. From October 1914 to September 1915, Vian served in the {{HMS|Argonaut|1898|6}}, an [[armoured cruiser]] patrolling in East African waters, on the lookout for the German cruiser [[SMS Karlsruhe|''Karlsruhe'']].&lt;ref name=vian12 /&gt; He was confirmed as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in January 1915.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; Dissatisfied by the lack of action in ''Argonaut'', Vian used a promise of help from [[William Wordsworth Fisher|William Fisher]] and subsequently received an appointment to {{HMS|Morning Star|1915|6}}, a modern [[Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd|Yarrow]]-built [[Yarrow M-class destroyer|M-class destroyer]], in October 1915.&lt;ref name=vian&gt;Vian 1960, p. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst on this ship, he was a spectator of the [[Battle of Jutland]], although his ship played no active part.&lt;ref name=RNMuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Vian|year=2008|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_philip_vian.htm|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion to [[lieutenant]] in 1917 (with seniority backdated to February 1916) resulted in two appointments as First Lieutenant in the destroyers {{HMS|Ossory|1915|6}} (September 1916) and {{HMS|Sorceress|1916|6}} (December 1917).&lt;ref&gt;Vian 1960, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-war==
Following gunnery courses in 1916, 1918 and 1919 at the Royal Naval gunnery school ([[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']]), Vian obtained a First Class certificate in Gunnery in October 1919. Despite being slated for service with the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|British Military Mission in Southern Russia]], he was loaned to the [[Royal Australian Navy]] for two years from January 1920 and served as Gunnery Officer of [[HMAS Australia (1911)|HMAS ''Australia'']], then the [[Australia]]n [[flagship]].&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; On his return to the Royal Navy, Vian was given a series of appointments as gunnery officer, first, in January 1923, to the battleship {{HMS|Thunderer|1911|6}}, then serving as a cadet training ship. During this appointment, he was promoted to [[lieutenant-commander]] on 15 February 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32909|startpage=1457|date=19 February 1924|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1924 by two appointments to aging [[C-class cruiser]]s ({{HMS|Champion|1915|6}} and {{HMS|Castor|1915|6}}).&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; There was a short period at the [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] gunnery school ([[HMS Vivid (shore establishment 1890)|HMS ''Vivid'']]) and another sea posting, to the battleship {{HMS|Emperor of India}} in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in May 1925.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;

There followed two foreign postings, still as a gunnery specialist. First in February 1927 to {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|6}}, in the [[British Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Fleet]].&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; This was followed, in November 1927, to {{HMS|Kent|54|6}}, the then-[[flagship]] of the [[China Station]], where he was promoted to [[commander]] on 30 June 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33513|startpage=4360|endpage=4361|date=2 July 1929|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the two years up to January 1933, Vian had a &quot;shore&quot; appointment at the [[Admiralty]] in London, with the Director for Staff Training and Development (DTSD), analysing practice gunnery statistics.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; He then attended a short Tactical Course in Portsmouth and subsequently took command (his first), in March 1933, of the destroyer {{HMS|Active|H14|6}} and a Division within the [[3rd Destroyer Flotilla]] (part of the Mediterranean Fleet). Two incidents occurred during this command for which Vian was held to be at fault: damage to ''Active'' while going astern alongside a depotship in Malta&lt;ref name=vian16&gt;Vian 1960, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; and the loss of a torpedo from {{HMS|Anthony|H40|6}}.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; Vian's commander-in chief, William Fisher, had remained well-disposed towards him;&lt;ref name=vian16/&gt; however, and these incidents had no ill effect on his career: he was promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] on 31 December 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34120|startpage=59|date=1 January 1935|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to the UK in early 1935, he was told to expect to spend time on [[History of the Royal Naval Reserve|half-pay]],&lt;ref&gt;Vian 1960, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinian crisis]] intervened and he was given command of the [[19th Destroyer Flotilla]] (on board {{HMS|Douglas|D90|6}}), which had been activated from the reserve to reinforce [[Malta]].&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;

Vian returned to the UK in July 1935 at the end of the crisis and attended a Senior Officers Technical Course before rejoining the 19th Destroyer Flotilla. In May 1936, he was transferred to command the [[1st Destroyer Flotilla]], flotilla leader {{HMS|Keppel|D84|6}}, also at Malta.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; In July, 1st Destroyer Flotilla returned to Portsmouth. En route home, however, Vian's ships responded to a call from the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in [[Vigo]] for protection for British residents at the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. His ships acted in various roles, including, after discussion, the evacuation of British residents. When relieved by the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Vian's ships continued home.&lt;ref&gt;Vian, 1960, p. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt; During a period at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], Vian was unexpectedly offered an appointment as [[Flag-Captain]] to Rear-Admiral [[Lionel Wells]] in {{HMS|Arethusa|26|6}}, flagship of the [[3rd Cruiser Squadron]], then part of the Mediterranean Fleet. He greatly preferred sea duties&lt;ref&gt;Vian 1960, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and gladly took up the new appointment in March 1937.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;

==World War II==
Vian returned to the UK shortly before [[World War II]] broke out. An appointment to command the boys' training establishment [[HMS Ganges (shore establishment)|HMS ''Ganges'']] was cancelled, and he was appointed to command of the [[11th Destroyer Flotilla]]. This flotilla had been recently activated from reserve and consisting of seven old [[V and W-class destroyer]]s plus his own ship, {{HMS|Mackay|D70|6}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Geoffrey B|title=HMS ''Duncan''|work = naval-history.net|year=2004|url = http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-03Scott-MacKay.htm|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; based first at [[Plymouth]] then at [[Liverpool]], with the role of escorting Atlantic [[convoy]]s. There was an ineffective brush with a [[u-boat]]. A change in policy required Vian, as a [[Captain (D)]], to operate from shore, the better to command his flotilla.&lt;ref name=vian22&gt;Vian 1960, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1940 he moved, this time to command of the [[4th Destroyer Flotilla]], the famous [[Tribal-class destroyer (1936)|Tribal-class]] destroyers.&lt;ref name=vian22 /&gt; The leader's ship at the time was {{HMS|Afridi|F07|6}} but as she was due for a refit he swapped ships to take over {{HMS|Cossack|F03|6}}.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;
[[File:HMS Cossack.jpg|thumb|300px|The destroyer, {{HMS|Cossack|F03|6}}, which Vian commanded]]

===''Altmark''===
{{main|Altmark Incident}}
In February 1940, Vian's flotilla was ordered to find and locate the German supply tanker, [[German tanker Altmark|''Altmark'']]. This ship was believed to be holding around 300 British merchant seaman captured by the [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|''Admiral Graf Spee'']]. When found, the ''Altmark'' was in neutral Norwegian waters, escorted by two Norwegian torpedo-boats. After peacefully negating the Norwegian opposition, Vian pursued ''Altmark'' into Jøssingfjord, she was boarded and the captives were freed.&lt;ref&gt;Vian 1960, p. 24–28&lt;/ref&gt; This was a violation of Norwegian neutrality, as was the imprisoning of the British seamen; there were protests and the incident is sometimes given as a contributory factor towards the German invasion later that year. During a quiet stage in the war, the incident was widely publicised in Britain. Vian was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for this successful action, the citation was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' of 9 April 1940 (dated 12 April 1940, and read:

{{quote|''Admiralty, Whitehall. 12th April, 1940.''

[[George VI of the United Kingdom|The KING]] has been graciously pleased to give orders for the following Appointments to the Distinguished Service Order:—

''To be a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order:''

Captain Philip Louis Vian, Royal Navy, H.M.S. Cossack;

for outstanding ability, determination and resource in the preliminary dispositions which led to the rescue of 300 English prisoners from the German Armed Auxiliary Altmark, and for daring, leadership and masterly handling of his ship in narrow waters so as to bring her alongside and board the enemy, who tried to blind him with the glare of a searchlight, worked his engine full ahead and full astern, tried to ram him and drive him ashore and so threatened the grounding and loss of Cossack.&lt;ref name=dso1&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34827|supp=yes|startpage=2137|date=9 April 1940|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Naval actions===
The Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940 and Vian, now in ''Afridi'', was engaged in a number of operations against German shipping and warships and in support of Allied troops. On 9 April 1940, Vian's destroyers were escorting two cruisers ({{HMS|Southampton|83|6}} and {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}}) off Bergen when they came under heavy German air attack. {{HMS|Gurkha|F20|6}} became isolated and was sunk.&lt;ref&gt;Vian 1960, p. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt; From 15–17 April, ''Afridi'' assisted and protected British troop landings at Namsos ([[Operation Maurice|Operation ''Maurice'']]), which were a part of a planned pincer movement to seize [[Trondheim]]. ''Afridi'' later assisted the evacuation of Namsos and the rescue of the survivors of the [[French destroyer Bison|French destroyer ''Bison'']], during which, on 3 May, ''Afridi'' was bombed and sunk; the survivors were rescued by destroyers {{HMS|Imperial|D09|6}} and {{HMS|Grenade|H86|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Geoffrey B|title = HMS ''Afridi''|work = naval-history.net|year=2001|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-34Tribal-Afridi.htm|accessdate = 30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vian was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] for his part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34901|supp=yes|startpage=4492|date=19 July 1940|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 13/14 October, Vian, now re-established in HMS ''Cossack'' and with HMS ''Ashanti'', ''Maori'' and ''Sikh'', attacked a small German convoy off [[Egerö]] light. Although the operation's success was over-stated (just one ship was sunk and later refloated),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kindell|first=Don|title=1940: Sunday, 13 October|work = naval-history.net|year=2001|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4010-23OCT01.htm|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vian was awarded a [[medal bar|bar]] to his DSO.&lt;ref name=dso2&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35007|supp=yes|startpage=6915|date=3 December 1940|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 1941, Vian, in HMS ''Cossack'', with several destroyers, provided additional escort to troop convoy WS8B en route from Glasgow to the Indian Ocean. On 25 May, Vian's destroyers (HMS ''Cossack'', ''Maori'', ''Sikh'', ''Zulu'' and [[ORP Piorun (G65)|ORP ''Piorun'']]) were detached from the convoy to join the search for the German battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]''. Eventually, Vian's flotilla participated in the destruction of the ''Bismarck''. While the main battle fleet awaited daylight, they, in a series of night attacks, harried the German ship. They failed to score a hit in the darkness, but their activities fixed the German's position and denied the crew much-needed rest before the main battle on 27 May. Afterwards, they escorted {{HMS|King George V|41|6}} back to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Geoffrey|title=HMS ''Cossack''|work = naval-history.net|year=2004|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-34Tribal-Cossack1.htm|accessdate = 30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vian received a second bar to his DSO for this action.&lt;ref name=dso3&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35307|supp=yes|startpage=5946|date=10 October 1941|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38098|supp=yes|startpage=4847|endpage=4868|date=14 October 1947|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Nigeria.jpg|300px|thumb|The light cruiser, {{HMS|Nigeria|60|6}}, which formed part of Force K, under Vian's command]]
Vian was promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 8 July 1941, by special order of the [[First Sea Lord]], Sir [[Dudley Pound]]. During July and August, 1941, Vian was involved in liaising with the [[Soviet Navy]] to assess their readiness and to investigate the practicalities of a British naval force being based at [[Murmansk]] or nearby. In the event, Vian advised against this, but in September, 1941, he commanded Force K, a naval force that supported an Anglo-Canadian raid and demolition on the Norwegian archipelago of [[Spitsbergen]]. The intention was to clear out any German garrison (there was none), destroy the coal mines and coal stocks and evacuate the Russian miners. The troops were aboard the liner {{RMS|Empress of Canada|1922|6}}, escorted by two Royal Navy cruisers, {{HMS|Nigeria|60|6}} and {{HMS|Aurora|12|6}} and three destroyers: {{HMS|Icarus|D03|6}}, {{HMS|Anthony|H40|6}} and {{HMS|Antelope|H36|6}} and several smaller ships. The operation was successful and during Force K's return, a German convoy was intercepted and the German training cruiser ''[[German training ship Bremse|Bremse]]'' was sunk.&lt;ref name=RNMuseum /&gt;

===Mediterranean===
In October 1941, Vian was given command of the [[15th Cruiser Squadron]] (flag in {{HMS|Naiad|93|6}}, stationed at [[Alexandria]]. The main naval tasks at this stage of the [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean campaign]] were to ensure the survival of [[Malta]] as a British possession and military base by the protection of supply convoys while preventing Italian convoys supplying their forces in north Africa. Secondary tasks included the supply and artillery support of Allied military actions in north Africa and elsewhere, such as a successful bombardment of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] in December. Vian's first convoy was in December 1941 and led to the [[First Battle of Sirte]]. This was, in effect, a series of skirmishes between British and Italian warships escorting desperately needed supply convoys. Overall, the fight was inconclusive, but both sides managed to deliver the supplies. There were several sorties to support the army and to intercept Italian convoys. On one such operation, in early March 1942, Vian's flagship, HMS ''Naiad'', was torpedoed and sunk by [[German submarine U-565|''U-565'']]. Vian transferred his flag to {{HMS|Dido|37|6}} and later to {{HMS|Cleopatra|33|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HMS ''Naiad''|publisher = Naval-History.net|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CL-Naiad.htm|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta was still in a desperate state and another convoy (MG1) was run in March 1942. This time, the Italian Navy made a more determined attempt to intercept the convoy, leading to the [[Second Battle of Sirte]]. Vian's force of cruisers and destroyers, using threat and concealment by smoke, managed to hold off the Italians while the convoy escaped. The naval action was portrayed as a tactical success against a greatly superior enemy, although the convoy's progress was sufficiently delayed to leave it vulnerable to air attacks and all four transports were sunk and the bulk of the supplies were lost. Despite this, Vian received a personal letter of congratulation from [[Winston Churchill]] and he was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (KBE).&lt;ref name=kbe&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35506|supp=yes|startpage=1445|date=27 March 1942|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38073|supp=yes|startpage=4371|endpage=4380|date=16 September 1947|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Vian|publisher=Royal Naval Museum Library|year=2004|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_philip_vian.htm|accessdate = 30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, Vian's force provided escort for the [[Operation Vigorous]] convoy from [[Haifa]] and [[Port Said]]. This was a part of a sequence of movements but it was rebuffed by strong surface and air forces and returned. After this failed operation, Vian's health deteriorated and he was sent back to Britain in September 1942. During a delay in the journey in west Africa, he caught [[malaria]] and was not passed fit for service until January, 1943. In January, he was Mentioned in Despatches for &quot;outstanding zeal, patience and cheerfulness and for setting an example of wholehearted devotion to duty without which the high tradition of the Royal Navy could not have been upheld&quot;.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|startpage=26|date=29 December 1942|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vian's physical condition was now considered to debar him from further sea service and in April 1943 he was appointed to the planning staff for the invasion of Europe. Probably much to his relief,&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt; however, this shore job was pre-empted by his return to the Mediterranean to command (from {{HMS|Glengyle}}) an amphibious force for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;

[[File:HMSAttackerD02.jpg|300px|thumb|{{HMS|Attacker|D02|6}} at anchor in San Francisco Bay on 13 November 1942]]In September 1943, he commanded [[Force V]], a flotilla of [[escort aircraft carriers]] providing air support for the [[Operation Avalanche|Allied landings at Salerno]], Italy. Force V comprised the [[escort aircraft carriers]] {{HMS|Attacker|D02|6}}, {{HMS|Battler|D18|6}}, {{HMS|Hunter|D80|6}} and {{HMS|Stalker|D91|6}}, and the maintenance carrier {{HMS|Unicorn|I72|6}}, acting temporarily as a light fleet carrier. The planned period had to be increased and, when General [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]] requested Force V to stay longer despite fuel shortages, Vian replied: &quot;My carriers will stay here if we have to row back.&quot; Vian was twice Mentioned in Despatches; once for each of the Italian operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36295|supp=yes|startpage=5540|endpage=5541|date=17 December 1943|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38895|supp=yes|startpage=2077|endpage=2098|date=28 April 1950|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36526|supp=yes|startpage=2353|endpage=2355|date=19 May 1944|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38899|supp=yes|startpage=2171|endpage=2176|date=2 May 1950|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normandy landings===
In November 1943, Vian returned to the UK as commander of Force J in preparation for D-Day and in January 1944, he was appointed commander of the Eastern Task Force (in {{HMS|Scylla|98|6}}), supporting the D-Day [[Invasion of Normandy|landings in Normandy]]. He was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the [[King's Birthday Honours]],&lt;ref name=cb&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2567|date=2 June 1944|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided with the early stages of the invasion. After the success of the landings, he was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) &quot;for distinguished services in the planning and execution of the successful landings&quot;.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;&lt;ref name=kcb&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36624|supp=yes|startpage=3461|date=21 July 1944|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38110|supp=yes|startpage=5109|endpage=5124|date=28 October 1947|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Pacific Fleet===

In November 1944, Vian became the commander in charge of air operations of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] (Flag Officer Commanding, [[1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron]], British Pacific Fleet and Second in Command, British Pacific Fleet, in {{HMS|Formidable|67|6}}). The first operations of Vian's new command were against Japanese oil and port installations in [[Sumatra]] (Operations [[Operation Cockpit|''Cockpit'']], [[Operation Transom|''Transom'']], [[Operation Lentil (Sumatra)|''Lentil'']] and [[Operation Meridian|''Meridian'']]). These served to damage the enemy's capabilities, distract his attention from events elsewhere and provide experience for the British and Commonwealth crews in the procedures that they would use while working with the Americans in the western Pacific. The U.S. aircraft carrier, {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, participated in the training exercises and the first two operations. Vian was Mentioned in Despatches once again for &quot;bravery, skill and devotion to duty&quot;.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37058|supp=yes|startpage=2299|date=27 April 1945|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39191|supp=yes|startpage=1803|endpage=1812|date=3 April 1951|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Pacific, the BPF operated as Task Force 57 from March 1945, providing air support for the American invasion of [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] (Operation ''Iceberg''). Their role was to interdict the [[Sakishima Islands]], suppressing Japanese air operations. Vian's carriers were externally resistant to the determined suicide attacks, returning to active service within hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38308|supp=yes|startpage=3289|endpage=3314|date=28 December 1951|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[vice admiral]] on 8 May 1945.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;

==Post war==
After the Japanese surrender, Vian returned finally to the UK and became [[Fifth Sea Lord]] in charge of naval aviation from 1946 until 1948,&lt;ref name=RNMuseum /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37740|startpage=4851|date=27 September 1946|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37760|startpage=5095|date=15 October 1946|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37852|supp=yes|startpage=279|date=14 January 1947|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37945|startpage=1959|date=2 May 1947|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38104|startpage=4971|date=21 October 1947|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38232|startpage=1751|date=9 March 1948|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38257|startpage=2273|date=9 April 1948|accessdate=30 August 2014}} &lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38384|startpage=4631|date=20 August 1948|accessdate=30 August 2014}} &lt;br /&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38400|startpage=4905|date=10 September 1948|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was promoted to [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|admiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38461|startpage=6076|date=19 November 1948|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final appointment was Commander in Chief, [[Home Fleet]] (in {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}) until his retirement in 1952. He was promoted to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] (GCB) in the 1952 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name=gcb&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39421|supp=yes|startpage=2|date=28 December 1951|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 1952 he was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39606|startpage=3999|date=25 July 1952|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unusual recognition for an officer who had not reached the pinnacle of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=RNMuseum /&gt;

Vian was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] five times, and received several foreign awards.&lt;ref name=Admirals /&gt;&lt;ref name=legion&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37180|supp=yes|startpage=3672|date=13 July 1945|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usnavy&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37683|supp=yes|startpage=4063|date=9 August 1946|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olav&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38358|startpage=4154|date=20 July 1948|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement, Vian became a [[Board of directors|director]] of the [[Midland Bank]] and the [[North British and Mercantile Insurance|North British and Mercantile Insurance Company]]. He also published his [[memoir]]s, ''Action this day'', in 1960. He died on 27 May 1968 at his home at Ashford Hill, Hampshire near Newbury, Berkshire.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote 2002, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Vian married, on 2 December 1929, Marjorie Price, daughter of Colonel David Price Haig, OBE of [[Withyham]] in Sussex; they had two daughters.&lt;ref name=UnitHistories /&gt;
