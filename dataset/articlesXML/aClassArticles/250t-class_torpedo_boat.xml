The '''250t class''' were high-seas [[torpedo boat]]s built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] between 1913 and 1916. A total of 27 boats were built by three shipbuilding companies, with the letter after the boat number indicating the manufacturer. There were small variations between manufacturers, mainly in the [[steam turbine]]s used, and whether they had one or two [[funnel (ship)|funnels]]. The eight boats of the T-group, designated ''74 T''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''81 T'', were built by [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]], located at [[Trieste]]. The sixteen boats of the F-group, designated ''82 F''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''97 F'', were built by [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] at their shipyards at [[Rijeka|Fiume]] and [[Kraljevica|Porto Re]]. The three M-group boats, designated ''98&amp;nbsp;M''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''100&amp;nbsp;M'', were manufactured by [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] at [[Monfalcone]].

All 27 boats saw service in [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]]. Although widely used during the war, the class suffered no losses, and available sources indicate they were only involved in a few engagements. In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], the boats were transferred to various countries, including seven to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], six to [[First Portuguese Republic|Portugal]], six to [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], and eight to the newly created [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia). By 1940, thirteen boats of the class had been lost or [[Ship breaking|scrapped]], including all six Portuguese boats.

During [[World War II]], the five remaining Greek boats were sunk by [[Axis powers|Axis]] aircraft during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Battle of Greece|invasion of Greece]] in April 1941.  One Romanian boat was lost during the war, while the two remaining Romanian boats performed escort tasks in the [[Black Sea]] before being taken over by the [[Soviet Navy]], and serving in their [[Black Sea Fleet]] until the end of the war; they were finally stricken in late 1945.

The six surviving Yugoslav boats were captured by the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] during the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, and were operated by the ''[[Regia Marina]]''. Immediately following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, one ex-Yugoslav boat was sunk by German aircraft, another was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] by its Italian crew, and two more fell back into Yugoslav hands. The remaining two were seized by the Germans. Of the two ex-Yugoslav boats taken over by the Germans, both were operated by Croatian crews or by the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]] for some time before being recovered from them by the Germans. One was destroyed by [[Royal Navy]] [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s in June 1944, and the other was sunk by [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft in 1945. The two surviving boats were commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war, with one continuing in service until the early 1960s.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|0|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|link=in}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] base at [[Kotor|Cattaro]] to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

==Description and construction==
[[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The STT boats used [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] turbines driving two [[drive shaft|propeller shafts]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by [[AEG]]-Curtiss turbines, and had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnels]] rather than the single funnel of the STT boats.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The third contract went to [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=63}} The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58, 60 &amp; 63}}

When completed, all 27 boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]]. Each vessel could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58, 60 &amp; 63}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=10}}

===T-group===
The T-group were built by STT at the [[Port of Trieste]] between April 1913 and December 1914. They had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|262|t|LT|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|320|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. Their Parsons turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|18|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|24|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|980|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

The T-group boats were originally to be armed with three {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30 guns, and three {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed,{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} in order to standardise the armament with the following F-group. In 1914, one {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]] was added.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

When ''74 T'''s turbines were initially installed, the problems with them were so significant that all her power and propulsion machinery had to be rebuilt. She was launched for a second time on 26 June 1914.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===F-group===
The F-group were built by Ganz &amp; Danubius at [[Rijeka|Fiume]] and nearby [[Kraljevica|Porto Re]] between October 1913 and December 1916. They had a waterline length of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a beam of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal draught of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38 officers and enlisted men. Their AEG-Curtiss turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}}, and the boats were designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. During trials, ''93 F'' produced {{convert|6450|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}}, and reached a top speed of {{convert|29.7|kn}}. They carried {{convert|20|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=no|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

When [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] declared war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915, five incomplete F-group boats were towed to be completed in safety. ''82 F'', ''83 F'' and ''84 F'' were taken from Porto Re to [[Pula|Pola]], and ''90 F'' and ''91 F'' were taken to [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]]. This resulted in delays to the completion of these boats.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

===M-group===
[[File:Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat 98 M.jpg|thumb|300px|First of the &quot;M&quot;-group, ''98 M'', underway|alt=black and white photograph of a vessel underway]]
The M-group were built by CNT at [[Monfalcone]] between March 1914 and March 1916. They had a waterline length of {{convert|60.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a beam of {{convert|5.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal draught of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|270|t|LT|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38 officers and enlisted men. Their Melms-Pfenniger turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}}, and the boats were designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28.5|kn}}. They carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=no|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=63}}

==Service history==

===World War I===
[[File:SM Tb80T.jpg|thumb|right|Damage to ''80&amp;nbsp;T'' incurred during a raid on Porto Corsini on 24 May 1915|alt=a black and white photograph of the side of a ship hull with a large hole in it]]
At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''74&amp;nbsp;T''&amp;nbsp;– ''77&amp;nbsp;T'' comprised the 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=11–12}} All 27 boats saw service, performing [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for &quot;high seas&quot; operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} On the morning of 24 May 1915, ''80&amp;nbsp;T'' was part of the [[Bombardment of Ancona]], a fleet action that involved the shelling of various targets in the [[Province of Ancona]] and 11 other Adriatic ports. At [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]] near Ravenna, an Italian {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Coastal artillery|shore battery]] returned fire, hitting the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} and damaging ''80&amp;nbsp;T''.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2014|p=1235}} In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at Pola to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the T-group torpedo boats. This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=229}} On the night of 31 May – 1 June 1916, the [[Tátra-class destroyer|''Tátra''-class destroyer]]s ''Orjen'' and ''Balaton'', accompanied by ''77&amp;nbsp;T'', ''79&amp;nbsp;T'' and ''81&amp;nbsp;T'', raided the [[Otranto Barrage]], an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto. ''Orjen'' sank one [[Naval drifter|drifter]], but once the alarm had been raised, the Austro-Hungarian force withdrew.{{sfn|Halpern|1987|p=151}}

In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58, 60 &amp; 63}} On 11 May 1917, the British [[submarine]] [[HMS H1|HMS ''H1'']] stalked ''78&amp;nbsp;T'' off Pola, firing two torpedoes at her. The British captain had kept his submarine's [[periscope]] extended too far and for too long, and the tell-tale &quot;feather&quot; alerted the crew of ''78&amp;nbsp;T'', allowing her to avoid the incoming torpedoes.{{sfn|Compton-Hall|1991|p=242}} On 14–15 May 1917, several 250t-class boats were part of the support forces for a major raid on the Otranto Barrage. On the departure of the raiding force, consisting of three light cruisers and two [[destroyer]]s&amp;nbsp;— torpedo boats and aircraft secured the approaches to the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro. Once the raiding force had departed for the barrage, the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}, a destroyer, and ''84&amp;nbsp;F'', ''88&amp;nbsp;F'', ''99&amp;nbsp;M'' and ''100&amp;nbsp;M'' were to be prepared to sortie out to support the raiders on their return voyage. The old [[coastal defence ship]] {{SMS|Budapest||2}} and ''86&amp;nbsp;F'', ''91&amp;nbsp;F'' and ''95&amp;nbsp;F'' were also available at Cattaro if needed. While the raid was a success, the raiding force was then engaged by Allied ships in the [[Battle of the Otranto Straits]]. Both support groups sailed to meet the returning Austro-Hungarian force, which included the heavily damaged ''Novara'', which was under tow. On marrying-up with the raiding force, the torpedo boats fanned out to screen the larger warships, protecting them as they returned to port.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|p=162}}{{sfn|Halpern|2004|pp=47, 93–101}}

In late September 1917, ''98&amp;nbsp;M'' was part of a squadron of four destroyers and four torpedo boats supporting an air attack on the Italian airfield at [[Ferrara]] by [[flying boat]]s. After destroying an Italian [[airship]], the squadron withdrew at high speed in the darkness, but was intercepted by an Italian squadron of eight destroyers that had been sent to support an Italian air raid on Pola. In the resultant 45 minute melee, several Austro-Hungarian destroyers were damaged. As the squadron retreated through the minefields off [[Poreč|Parenzo]], ''98&amp;nbsp;M'' was hit by Italian fire, resulting in one casualty.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=148–149}} In June 1918, ''76&amp;nbsp;T'' was part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian motor torpedo boats that sank her. During that action, ''76&amp;nbsp;T'' fired at the Italian vessels, but did not score a hit.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}}

Elements of the Austro-Hungarian fleet [[Cattaro Mutiny|mutinied]] in [[Bay of Kotor|Cattaro]] in February 1918,{{sfn|Bell|Elleman|2004|p=51}} and in May, a plot was discovered to take over ''80&amp;nbsp;T'' at Pola. The motive appeared to be nationalism. Two of the ringleaders, a [[Czechs|Czech]] and a Dalmatian [[Croats|Croat]], were tried, convicted and executed by firing squad.{{sfn|Bell|Elleman|2004|p=60}}{{sfn|Hathaway|2001|p=204}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1994|p=334}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Post-World War I transfers===
Under the provisions of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], all Austro-Hungarian warships were surrendered to the Allies. The 250t-class torpedo boats were distributed among [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[First Portuguese Republic|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], and the newly created [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), as follows:{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58, 60 &amp; 63}}

===World War II===
By 1940, thirteen boats of the class had been lost or scrapped, including all six Portuguese boats.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58, 60 &amp; 63}} At the time of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the Yugoslav boats ''T1'' and ''T3'' were assigned to the Southern Sector of Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with several [[minesweeper]]s and other craft.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013a}} ''T5''–''T8'' comprised the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]].{{sfn|Niehorster|2013b}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All six Yugoslav boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

The five surviving Greek boats were all sunk by aircraft during the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of Greece]], also in April 1941. The first was ''Proussa'', which was sunk off Corfu on 4 April by Italian [[Junkers Ju 87]] &quot;Picchiatello&quot;s of the 239th Squadron, 97th Dive Bomber Group.{{sfn|Weal|1998|p=22}}{{refn|According to Greger, ''Proussa'' was sunk by German bombers on the same day and at the same location.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=63}}|group = lower-alpha}} Later, ''Kios'' was sunk off [[Athens]] on 22 April, ''Kyzikos'' at [[Salamis Naval Base|Salamis]] on 24 April, ''Pergamos'' off Salamis on 25 April, and ''Kydoniai'' south of the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula on the following day, all by German aircraft.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=63}}

The three Romanian boats were initially deployed against the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Black Sea Fleet]] following the launch of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941,{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58, 60 &amp; 63}} with ''Naluca'' and ''Sborul'' allocated to the 3rd Section of the [[Romanian Naval Forces|Romanian Navy]]. On 9 July 1941, ''Naluca'', along with a [[gunboat]] and three [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s (MTBs), sank the Soviet submarine ''SC-206'' off the southern Romanian coast near [[Mangalia]].{{sfn|Smillie|2012|p=134}} Between 7–16 October 1941, all three Romanian torpedo boats were part of the escort for a minelaying group that laid several minefields along the Bulgarian coast to protect Axis shipping.{{sfn|Smillie|2012|p=324}} ''Naluca'' was sunk by Soviet aircraft at [[Constanța]] on 20 August 1944, but ''Sborul'' and ''Smeul'' survived World War II,{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}} having been transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet in late August 1944 after Romania changed sides and joined the Allies, serving as ''Musson'' and ''Toros'' respectively.{{sfn|Monakov|Rohwer|2001|pp=167 &amp; 171}}

The Yugoslav boats served in a coastal and second-line escort role with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) in the Adriatic under their Yugoslav designations, and were fitted with two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30 anti-aircraft guns in place of their {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations were made to them.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, they transferred ''T1'' back to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|One source states that she was captured by the Germans and transferred to the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia|navy]] of the puppet state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} but several other sources state that she was returned to the KJRM in December 1943.{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=186}}}} ''T3'' was seized by the Germans at Rijeka on 16 September 1943 and was renamed ''TA48''. She was commissioned on 15 August 1944, and was used for patrol and escort work in the northern Adriatic.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=81}} The Germans added to her armament, fitting her with two single {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft guns in addition to the guns fitted by the Italians, and removing two of her torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=107}} She was either crewed exclusively by Croatian officers and sailors but remained under German control,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} or was transferred to the Croatian navy but then repossessed by the Germans on 14 December 1944 due to the unreliable nature of the Croatian navy.{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=81}} Her complement was also increased to 52 during her German/Croatian service.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She was sunk in the port of Trieste by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft on 20 February 1945.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}{{refn|Sources conflict on who sank ''TA48''. Gardiner and Lenton state that they were Allied aircraft without specifying their nationality,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=110}} while Chesneau states they were British aircraft,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and Wilmott states that US aircraft carried out the attack.{{sfn|Willmott|2010|p=209}}|group = lower-alpha}}

''T5'' was also returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December 1943.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} ''T6'' was scuttled by the Italians {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Rimini]] on 11 September as she had insufficient fuel on board to reach an Allied port.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=92}} Once under German control, ''T7'' was also handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and served under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} On 24 June 1944, she and the [[E-boat|S-boats]] ''S 154'' and ''S 157'' of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between [[Šibenik]] and [[Rijeka]], protecting German sea supply routes along the Adriatic when they were attacked by the [[Royal Navy]] [[Fairmile D motor torpedo boat]]s ''MTB 659'', ''MTB 662'' and ''MTB 670'' near the island of Kukuljari, south of [[Murter|Murter Island]]. The MTBs fired two torpedoes at ''T7'', but missed, so they closed and engaged her with their guns, setting her ablaze. She was beached, and 21 crew were rescued by the MTBs. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more crew, then destroyed her with demolition charges.{{sfn|Paterson|2015|p=223}} ''T8'' was sunk {{convert|37|km|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Dubrovnik]] by German aircraft while evacuating Italian troops from Dalmatia on 10 or 11 September 1943.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=186}}{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=92}}

===Post-World War II===
Only four of the twenty-seven 250t-class torpedo boats survived World War II, two in Yugoslav service and two in Soviet service. ''T1'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war as ''Golešnica''.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} She was re-armed with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and four {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, and her torpedo tubes were removed. She continued in Yugoslav service under that name until October 1959. ''T5'' was also commissioned by the Yugoslav Navy after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}} ''Musson'' and ''Toros'' were returned to Romania in October 1945, and stricken the following month.{{sfn|Monakov|Rohwer|2001|p=270}}{{refn|According to Greger, ''Toros'' survived the war and was scrapped in 1960.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}|group = lower-alpha}}
