'''North-Eastern Area Command''' was one of several [[RAAF area commands|geographically based commands]] raised by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War II. For most of its existence it covered central and northern [[Queensland]], and [[Papua New Guinea]]. It was formed in January 1942 from the eastern part of the former [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area Command]], which had covered the whole of northern Australia and [[Territory of Papua|Papua]]. Headquartered at [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland, North-Eastern Area Command was primarily responsible for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], [[aerial reconnaissance]] and protection of the [[sea lane]]s within its boundaries.  Aircraft under its control took part in the [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|battles of Rabaul]], [[Battle of Port Moresby|Port Moresby]] and [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]] in 1942, and the [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|landings at Hollandia and Aitape]] in 1944.  The command continued to operate following the end of the war, before its responsibilities were subsumed in 1954 by the RAAF's new functional command-and-control system; the headquarters was disbanded two years later.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:RAAFAreaCommands1941.png|thumb|left|upright=1.28|alt=Map of Australia showing state borders, with RAAF area command boundaries superimposed|RAAF area commands in December 1941]]
North-Eastern Area Command was formed at [[Townsville]], Queensland, on 15&amp;nbsp;January 1942, taking over the eastern portion of what was previously [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area Command]].&lt;ref name=Gillison311&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070486--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 311]&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Area had been established on 8&amp;nbsp;May 1941 as one of the RAAF's [[RAAF area commands|geographically based command-and-control zones]], and covered northern [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], the [[Northern Territory]], and [[Territory of Papua|Papua]].&lt;ref name=Gillison91&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 91–92]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles of the area commands were [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], protection of adjacent [[sea lane]]s, and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Each area was led by an [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary.&lt;ref name=Gillison91/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pathfinder121&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Organising for war: The RAAF air campaigns in the Pacific | magazine = Pathfinder |issue= 121| date = October 2009| url = http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/403/121-Organising-for-War-The-RAAF-Air-Campaigns-in-the-Pacific.aspx|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in December 1941 was the catalyst for Northern Area being split into [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]] (NWA) and North-Eastern Area (NEA), to counter distinct threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea, respectively.&lt;ref name=Gillison311/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens111&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; Air Commodore [[Frank Lukis]], formerly in charge of Northern Area, was NEA's inaugural AOC, taking responsibility for RAAF operations against the Japanese in New Guinea, [[New Britain]] and surrounding islands.&lt;ref name=Ashworth302&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 302–304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; His headquarters staff numbered 284.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force, ''Northern Area and North-Eastern Area Headquarters'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; On 20&amp;nbsp;January 1942, a force of over 100&amp;nbsp;Japanese aircraft [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|attacked Rabaul]], destroying or badly damaging six [[CAC Wirraway]]s and killing or wounding eleven crewmen of [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron]] under Wing Commander [[John Lerew]].&lt;ref name=Stephens135&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison354&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070489--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 354–358]&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, NEA headquarters sent a signal to Lerew ordering him to keep his airfield open, to which Lerew, with only two Wirraways left, replied using the legendary ancient [[gladiator]]ial phrase to honour an [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]]: &quot;''Morituri vos salutamus''&quot; (&quot;We who are about to die salute you&quot;). Ignoring a further message from headquarters to abandon his squadron and escape in a [[Lockheed Hudson]] bomber, on 22&amp;nbsp;January Lerew began evacuating staff to [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Gillison354/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=408|title=Gladiator's salute from Rabaul's air commander|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron]], operating ex-[[Qantas]] [[Short Empire]] flying boats and several smaller transports, was raised in NEA on 19&amp;nbsp;February 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Units35&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 35–38&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that month, Lukis warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of [[Australian Army]] troops at Port Moresby, due to lack of air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070515--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 447–448]&lt;/ref&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;February, Nos.&amp;nbsp;3 and 4&amp;nbsp;Fighter Sector Headquarters were established to coordinate fighter operations; they were based at Townsville and Port Moresby respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Kokoda Air Strikes'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawks]] of [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]], recently formed at Townsville, were deployed to Port Moresby in mid-March.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070515--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 458–462]&lt;/ref&gt; Commanded by Squadron Leader [[John Francis Jackson|John Jackson]], the squadron suffered heavy losses in the [[Battle of Port Moresby|ensuing battle]]. At one point NEA headquarters gave Jackson permission to withdraw but he refused, and the squadron was eventually credited with destroying thirty-five Japanese aircraft in the air and on the ground, securing Port Moresby until relieved by the [[35th Fighter Squadron|35th]] and [[36th Fighter Squadron|36th Squadrons]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), operating [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39 Airacobras]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 164, 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Several USAAF bomber formations operated under NEA's control in early 1942, including [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|A-24 Banshees]] of the [[8th Bombardment Squadron|8th Squadron]] from Port Moresby, and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]] of the [[435th Bombardment Squadron|435th Squadron]] (initially known as the &quot;Kangaroo Squadron&quot;) from Townsville.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Kokoda Air Strikes'', pp. 147, 180&lt;/ref&gt; As of 20&amp;nbsp;April, operational authority over all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was invested in the newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area Command]] (SWPA).&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 473]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers15&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.  15–16]&lt;/ref&gt; One result of this was the integration of USAAF and RAAF staff at area headquarters. According to the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the RAAF]], though &quot;more a diplomatic gesture than a practical method of war organisation&quot;, it gave personnel from the two services the opportunity to quickly become acclimatised to each other and &quot;in North-Eastern Area, as an example, the atmosphere was happy and the staff extremely cooperative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 473–478]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May, USAAF units no longer operated under RAAF control in the NEA but were commanded directly by senior American officers of the AAF.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Kokoda Air Strikes'', pp. 268–270&lt;/ref&gt;

NEA's operational headquarters, a reinforced concrete [[bunker]] known as Building&amp;nbsp;81, was completed in May 1942. Located on Green Street, Townsville, at the base of [[Castle Hill, Queensland|Castle Hill]], it was topped with a suburban house to mislead enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=WWIINQ&gt;{{cite report |author=Pearce, Howard |date=January 2009 |title= WWII&amp;nbsp;– NQ |url=http://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/heritage/documents/ww2_nth_qld_cultural_heritage.pdf  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428050622/http://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/heritage/documents/ww2_nth_qld_cultural_heritage.pdf |publisher= [[Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland)|Queensland Environmental Protection Agency]] |location=Brisbane|pages=59, 100, 107 |accessdate=6 June 2016|archivedate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|Eastern Area Command]] was formed, taking control of units in New South Wales and southern Queensland from [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area]] and NEA.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 478]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; This left NEA in command of Nos.&amp;nbsp;24, 33 and [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76 Squadrons]], as well as No.&amp;nbsp;3 Fighter Sector Headquarters, at Townsville; [[No. 100 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;100 Squadron]] at [[Cairns]]; [[No. 32 Squadron RAAF|No. 32 Squadron]] at [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]]; and [[No. 11 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;11]], [[No. 20 Squadron RAAF|20]] and 75&amp;nbsp;Squadrons, as well as No.&amp;nbsp;4 Fighter Sector Headquarters, at Port Moresby.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force, ''Northern Area and North-Eastern Area Headquarters'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; NEA's boundaries were finetuned on 19&amp;nbsp;August: a portion of Queensland within the [[Barkly Tableland]] and the Haslingden and Heywood districts was assigned to the control of North-Western Area.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 588]&lt;/ref&gt; Lukis handed over command of NEA to Group Captain (later Air Commodore) [[Harry Cobby]] on 25&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=Gillison588&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 588–589]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the month, the headquarters staff numbered 684.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force, ''Northern Area and North-Eastern Area Headquarters'', p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron, replenished after its defence of Port Moresby, and No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron, deployed north from Townsville and also flying Kittyhawks, played what senior Australian Army commanders described as the &quot;decisive&quot; role in the [[Battle of Milne Bay]] in New Guinea during August and September 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070520--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 603–604, 615–617]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the battle, Cobby exercised overall command of the RAAF units from NEA headquarters, while their efforts were coordinated on the ground by Group Captain [[Bill Garing]], NEA's senior air staff officer.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', pp. 33, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1&amp;nbsp;September 1942, [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 (Operational) Group]] was formed at Port Moresby as a mobile strike force to move forward with Allied advances in the Pacific, in contrast to the static, defensive nature of the area commands.&lt;ref name=Odgers6&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens122&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; It took over all units in New Guinea previously operating under NEA Command. NEA initially retained administrative control of No.&amp;nbsp;9 Group but, on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943, the group was made independent of the area command and its administration became the responsibility of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.&lt;ref name=Gillison588/&gt; September 1942 also saw the formation of [[RAAF Command]], led by Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070519--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 585–588]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odgers4&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070530--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 4–6]&lt;/ref&gt; Bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over all Australian units.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; He personally coordinated operations when they involved more than one area command, for instance when the fighter squadrons of both NWA and NEA were required to repulse a major attack.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070532--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 42]&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 42 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;42 (Radar) Wing]] was formed at Townsville in February 1943, and the following month took control of all [[radar]] stations in NEA.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force, ''Northern Area and North-Eastern Area Headquarters'', pp. 326, 350&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 1943, the area command directly controlled four squadrons tasked primarily with [[anti-submarine warfare]]: [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;7 Squadron]], flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] reconnaissance-bombers out of [[Ross River, Queensland|Ross River]]; [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Squadron]], a fleet co-operation unit flying [[Supermarine Seagull (1921)|Supermarine Seagulls]] from [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]]; and Nos.&amp;nbsp;11 and 20&amp;nbsp;Squadrons, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions with [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalinas]] from Cairns.&lt;ref name=Odgers141&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070558--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1943, Japan was still believed to be capable of invading, or at least bombing, the [[Torres Strait]] islands, and NEA had only No.&amp;nbsp;7 Squadron, now operating from Horn Island, to counter the threat. It was reinforced in April by [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;84 Squadron]], flying [[CAC Boomerang]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070556--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 113]&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, [[No. 72 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;72 Wing]] was formed at Townsville, before deploying to [[Merauke]], New Guinea.

In October, No.&amp;nbsp;84 Squadron converted to Kittyhawks and transferred to the newly formed [[No. 75 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Wing]], which was given responsibility for units at Horn Island, [[Thursday Island]], and [[Northern Peninsula Airport|Higgins Field]] on [[Cape York Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070556--1-.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 113–116]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gogler&gt;Gogler, ''We Never Disappoint'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;75 Wing headquarters moved from Horn Island to Higgins Field, where it was soon joined by other units under its control, Nos.&amp;nbsp;7 and [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|23&amp;nbsp;Squadrons]]; the latter operated Vengeances until being declared non-operational in June, prior to re-equipping with [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]] for duty in North-Western Area.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force, ''Northern Area and North-Eastern Area Headquarters'', pp. 679, 706, 709&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 245]&lt;/ref&gt; By May, NEA's order of battle on the Australian mainland consisted of Nos.&amp;nbsp;7, 9, [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|13]] (operating [[Lockheed Ventura]]s from [[Cooktown]]), 20 and 23&amp;nbsp;Squadrons.&lt;ref name=Gogler/&gt;

Following the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was dissolved and RAAF Headquarters again assumed full control of all its operational formations, including the area commands.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the month, NEA headquarters staff numbered 526, including ninety-eight officers.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Air Force, ''Northern Area and North-Eastern Area Headquarters'', p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force shrank dramatically as personnel were demobilised and units disbanded; most of the RAAF's bases and aircraft employed in operations after the war were situated within Eastern Area's sphere of control in New South Wales and southern Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 11–12, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1946, the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], proposed reducing the five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Areas]]) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The Australian Government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''The Private Air Marshal'', pp. 321–325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solo68&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 68, 462&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1949, NEA headquarters was located in Sturt Street, Townsville.&lt;ref name=Solo68/&gt; [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron]] was based at Townsville from March that year, operating [[Avro Lincoln]]s over the Pacific and Australia's northern approaches in the maritime reconnaissance and search-and-rescue roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129976134 |title=RAAF's big task in Qld |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]  |location=Adelaide |date=16 May 1953 |accessdate=10 June 2016 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/10sqn.htm|title=No. 10 Squadron|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Commodore [[Ian Dougald McLachlan|Ian McLachlan]] was appointed AOC NEA in September 1951 and served two years in the post before handing over to acting Air Commodore Patrick Heffernan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2837203 |title=New postings in RAAF |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Canberra |date=8 September 1951 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |page=6 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62503697 |title=New RAAF chief for North-Eastern Area|newspaper=Townsville Daily Bulletin |location=Townsville, Queensland |date=9 September 1953 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commencing in October 1953, the RAAF was reorganised from a geographically based command-and-control system into one based on function. In February 1954, the newly constituted functional organisations—[[RAAF Home Command|Home]], [[RAAF Training Command|Training]], and Maintenance Commands—assumed control of all operations, training and maintenance from North-Eastern Area Command.&lt;ref name=Pathfinder121/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73–76, 462–463&lt;/ref&gt; NEA headquarters remained in existence, but only as one of Home Command's &quot;remote control points&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23429331 |title=Battle 'nerve-centre' goes north: RAAF fighting control shifted from here |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=21 May 1954 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally disbanded on 3&amp;nbsp;December 1956, and was succeeded by [[RAAF Base Townsville|Headquarters RAAF Townsville]].&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;
