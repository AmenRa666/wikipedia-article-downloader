==Ethnocentrism==
The last sentence:

Had the Great Khan Ogodei not died, and Batu had decided to proceed westward, the French King would have found Paradise.

what does finding paradise mean?

The statement is indeed a bookend to the The famous remark of the French King that he was going to fight the Tartars and would either send them back to hell or be himself sent to paradise was a sign of the fear the Mongol invasions aroused -- this can be found in Saunders, J.J. -- ''The History of the Mongol Conquests,'' among other works.  The article does need referencing and cleaning up, but the blunt fact is that the Mongols destroyed the armies of Poland Humgry in a 2 day period with relatively no casalties on their part!  Every military historian who has studied the era believes they would have destroyed Europe with ease, and only internal family infighting after Ogedei's death halted that invasion.[[User:Oldwindybear|old windy bear]] 13:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, but Poland and Hungary were the easy parts of Europe so to speak. Further West there were more woods, rivers, a wetter climate and most importantly lots of fortified towns and castles. The Hungarians were rather successful against the Mongols until the catastrophic battle and similar tactics combined with better external circumstances in Germany, Italy and France would have seriously hampered the Mongols. Religious fanaticism could've been problematic, too. Not to mention the fact that with an enemy that had a supply line of 5000 miles through enemy territory (the Russian regions remained unruly) the Europeans could afford loss ratios of 3:1 or more.

Poland was fragmented at the time however, do not forget that the Mongols launched an unsuccessful raid in 1287, led by Talabuga and Nogai Khan. Lublin, Mazovia, Sandomierz and Sieradz were successfully raided, but the Mongols were defeated at Kraków.  The force sent was not sufficient to meet the full Polish army. It burned a few small towns, and fled when the Polish army was mustered.  The Poles stopped the advance of The Golden Horde at Krakow and the Turks under General Sobieski in 1643 at the Battle of Vienna.  That is twice the Poles stopped the west from being overrun by Barbarians...and don't you forget it!

&quot;    Yes, but Poland and Hungary were the easy parts of Europe so to speak. Further West there were more woods, rivers, a wetter climate and most importantly lots of fortified towns and castles. The Hungarians were rather successful against the Mongols until the catastrophic battle and similar tactics combined with better external circumstances in Germany, Italy and France would have seriously hampered the Mongols.

In response to the wooded areas and wetter climate, i don't see why this would negatively affect the Mongols calvary based armies at all. Medieval Europe at the time was DOMINATED ENTIRELY by the use of heavy calvary for another hundred years. It is ridiculous to think that they wouldn't do well just because they were from Mongolia, which has a wet climate, although is more of valleys/plains. The other piece to note, is that they had, except for possibly England, the best bows you could get, and were adept at firing while riding, the heavy infantry advantage here is thus negated for the most part. Really the only thing I would think that would ''maybe'' screw up their advantages would be if they were unfamiliar in dealing with pikes, in which they would have to invade England to really see their popular use until another 50 years or more later.

But, you must remember the mongol war machine WAS 
built for steppe warfare were heavy cavalry would be ineffective vs. horse archers but the in dense forests of europe it's the other way around for instance, 
if knights were ineffective as a military unit then how did german heavy cavalry crush the mygar(spelling) light cavalry and horse archers at the battle of lechfied(spelling again)? I believe the khan would have found the holy roman empire not worth the trouble of wasting mongol lives on germany while more imminent threats lay waiting but i'm not denying that the mongols could have conquered europe i'm just saying it would'nt be easy and might end in disaster.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.221.243.4|68.221.243.4]] ([[User talk:68.221.243.4|talk]]) 03:12, 29 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:''In response to the wooded areas and wetter climate, i don't see why this would negatively affect the Mongols calvary based armies at all. Medieval Europe at the time was DOMINATED ENTIRELY by the use of heavy calvary for another hundred years.''

:It affects horse archers (which were hardly used at all in Europe) and especially horse archers with composite bows because they degrade faster. It's not like they fall apart after a week, but it adds to the logistic nightmare.

:''It is ridiculous to think that they wouldn't do well just because they were from Mongolia, which has a wet climate, although is more of valleys/plains.''


:Here you're seriously misinformed. Quote from another page (just google for mongolia and climate): &quot;The average rainfall 200-220 mm. In Mongolia there are 250 sunny days a year, often with clear cloudless skies. Therefore Mongolia is known to the world as a country of “Blue Sky”.&quot; Average rainfall in e.g. Germany is 4 times that value and it's distributed equally instead of concentrated during a few months.

:''The other piece to note, is that they had, except for possibly England, the best bows you could get, and were adept at firing while riding, the heavy infantry advantage here is thus negated for the most part.''

:European heavy cavalry was too heavily armored to go down to anything but huge amounts of arrows (there are some mid-east sources from the crusades on that) or at point blank range so we're back to the logistics issue. Especially if you lose the battle and can't recycle your old arrows. Good arrows aren't that easy to make. That's one reason the musket displaced the bow so quickly. A child can roll musket rounds.

:Also you completely ignored the part where I said: &quot;and most importantly lots of fortified towns and castles.&quot; Lots of stone fortifications where a major part of Hungary's successes against the Mongols later on and the western parts of Europe were more heavily fortified earlier. The Mongols would've had to choose between assaulting every fortified town, castle and monastery (you can't afford those kinds of losses from the sheer number of such places you found in Europe) or sieging it which nails them down and negates their speed advantage compared to European armies. Barring major tactical mistakes (there would've been a few of those but not that many. They weren't completely retarded. Sooner or later you learn) a stand up fight against European armies would've been very costly for the Mongols (once again, it's not about whether you win or lose. It's about whether you can afford your losses. The Russians lost their way to victory against Napoleon).

:And finally, it's not like pikes were invented in England or Scotland. But that's besides the point. Until the tercio of the early/mid 16th century pike formations would've been very vulnerable to horse archers. It was the Spaniard's use of armor and shot that made pike squares the dominant battle formation for a hundred years (and that was also the time when Russia's border with the Mongols started to move eastward)

:P.S.: Just to make this clear: Had the Great Khan directed all his might towards Europe with the express mission to conquer it or die trying, I wouldn't wanna bet on Europe (i.e. had the Mongols relocated to Ukraine and Europe played to role of Sung China). But we are talking about a semi-conceivable military expedition by perhaps 150000 men from their base in the far east to extend the borders (i.e. Ögedei not dying when he did).

== Introduction -- Get Real!!! ==

'''Had the Mongols sent the forces which devastated Poland and Hungary on into the German states and France, they probably would have destroyed them as easily as they had the Rus principalities.'''

This states that the Mongols would have destroyed the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[France]], at the height of Imperial and Frankish power!  WTF?  [[User:IP Address|IP Address]] 15:19, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

:Neither was at the height of their power and the common consensus amongst historians - whether specializing in the Mongols, the Middle East or Europe - is that the Mongols would most likely have conquered Europe or at least made significant inroads had events not prevented this invasion. [[User:An Siarach|siarach]] 15:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

::I don't think it's accurate to say that this is the common consensus among historians.  It is clear that they had no trouble dealing with Poland and Hungary, but further east the Mongols would have encountered mountainous terrain, poor pastureland, and extensive fortification.  The extent to which they would have been able to conquer and establish control is not clear. [[User:Variable|siafu]] 00:33, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

''Hmm...''  Yes, the Holy Roman Emperor would have been taken down by the Khan.  The Crusades were not the most highly organised event in Christendom, ever?!  I wonder what Genghis Khan would do in the case of Charles Martel or Charlemagne--it appears that the old Romans were ineffective at stopping the Hunnish onslaught.  [[User:IP Address|IP Address]] 22:42, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

Well for the sake of argument i dont think either Charles Martel or his grandson would have been able to stand in the way of Chingiz Khan - far more powerful and advanced princes and empires than them/theirs had fallen to the Mongols. Of course with alternate history there can never be a right answer and who knows what would have happened - im sure few would have predicted anything other than the continuation of Mongol conquests in the build up to Ayn Jalut but obviously they were halted permanently against the odds. [[User:An Siarach|siarach]] 21:57, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

Actually, the vast lands of Russia did not have a powerful government at the time.  [But, it was stronger than under the Goths before them--which is why the Mongols could not repeat the Hunnish conquest, besides the fact that the Huns and Mongols focused on two separate areas]  Everything was spaced out, with a thin infrastructure and enormous amounts of peasantry.  That is why the Khans destroyed the Kievan Rus.  There was no shortage of wealth and power in the West during this time, which is why the West was able to afford the continual Crusading for centuries.  As always, the vastness of the Steppes only swallowed up her enemies.  I believe that this is a moot point and that eventually, even the Ottoman relic known as Turkey will be no more.  [[User:IP Address|IP Address]] 23:21, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

For what it's worth, historians generally avoid counterfactuals. There's no way to know what ''could have'' happened.[[User:Fokion|Fokion]] ([[User talk:Fokion|talk]]) 02:05, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

Its a lot of guessing and speculations here. Ok the mongols crushed the Song dynasty and the muslim kingdoms in the east. But they were stopped both in Egypt and Japan. Why is it so unthinkable that they would have been stopped by the germans that was far more advanced than the russians? One of the reasons why the other countries in east fall, was because the mongols destroyed the irrigation systems, what was there to destroy in Europe? Open plains was the ultimate area for their battles, not dense european woods.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/90.237.216.124|90.237.216.124]] ([[User talk:90.237.216.124|talk]]) 18:22, 27 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Invasion of Hungary ==
The whole paragraph should be reformulated. The outcome of the campaign is somehow mixed with the outcome of the battle of Sajo/Muhi. The battle was lost but the war won. 
According to chinese sources the Hungarian campaign was the blodiest for the Mongols. The King was not caught, the resistance in the strongholds wasn't broken and the occupation was a great failure for the Mongols. However the Mongols killed 25% of the population the Kingdom strenghten in the next 100 year (2 month after the Mongol invasion Hungarian army reached Wienna and reconquered 3 counties). The Mongol army were withdrawn, no garissions were left behind (contrary to Russia) the ellection was just a pretext: Batu was not recognised as legal heir of the Great Khan. Moreover after the battle in 1241 they stopped at Danube. Why? Was a river obstacle for a light cavalry army?? --[[User:Fz22|fz22]] 11:26, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

::I'd certainly like to know where it is stated that Hungarian campaign was particularly bloody for Mongols compared to Khwarezmian one (where they actually lost at least one major battle), or campaign against Song Empire (which took 40 years). It seems dubious anyway that Batu - weakest of the Mongol Khans - would plan another major invasion just one year after he had conquered his own - still unconsolitated - realm (ie. Russia). As for why Mongols stopped for summer - likely to prepare for winter, which was their preferred campaign season. Lets not forget that Batu's own Mongol contingent numbered only around 4000 troops, of which he is said to have lost around 30 in Battle of Mohi. Extrapolating from there, Mongol casualties in that battle were perhaps 1%. --[[User:Mikoyan21|Mikoyan21]] ([[User talk:Mikoyan21|talk]]) 00:43, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

Its a disgrace to wikipedia. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jimmyjimjam|Jimmyjimjam]] ([[User talk:Jimmyjimjam|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jimmyjimjam|contribs]]) 00:13, June 18, 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; 

==Disputed==
Parts of this article appear to be quite good, but I have tagged the article as disputed, since it's not clear if the above concerns have been addressed.  I also agree that the article needs to do a much better job of sourcing.  Parts are also very confusing.  I haven't gone through it in detail myself, but I did notice right off that the lead section doesn't even make a clear distinction that the attacks were being made by the [[Golden Horde]] as opposed to just &quot;the Mongols&quot;.  I think that this article can eventually be quite good, but enough concerns have been raised that I think we need to flag it as disputed until it gets a thorough going-over. --[[User:Elonka|El]][[User talk:Elonka|on]][[Special:Contributions/Elonka|ka]] 04:30, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

:As far as I can tell, those concerns that were actionable have been fixed.  Obviously, &quot;concerns&quot; of the form put forward in the last two headings above this one can't be addressed, because they don't name any specific problems. So which specific issues were it that made you add the disputed tag? Not saying it's necessarily wrong, just that at a first glance, I can't find any real dispute. Note that in that region, the Golden Horde during its time pretty much ''were'' &quot;the Mongols&quot;. Maybe a &quot;cleanup&quot; tag would be more appropriate? --[[User:Latebird|Latebird]] 06:33, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

==Contradictory==
At the beginning, there is a sourced statement that Subutai wanted to attack Austria but his plans were interrupted by Ogedei Khan.  After an unsourced claim in the part about the invasion of Hungary that the Hungarian resistance counted for nothing, it states that the Mongols were never interested in expanding Westward.  This is not sourced while the statement to the contrary is. I also believe this has a strong anti-Hungarian POV, without sourcing the statements that support this sentiment.[[User:Shield2|Shield2]] 05:55, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:::Rus is actually quite a bit away from the Europe-Asia border, there are Finnic, Ugrian as well Turkic peoples filling ina big fat barrier between Rus and the geographical definition of Asia. Germany is closer to Asia than most of Rus (take a ruler to a map and compare the distance between the most easterly major Rus settlement to Asia, Murom, and run the same distance from the Bosphorus). Bulgaria, Serbia, etc, are a great deal closer, and if Rus is half-Asian then there's no reason not to declare France, Spain and Italy half African. ;)  If you think about it, it's not really a conceptualization that makes any sense until the 17th century onwards.

== Mongol invasion of actual territories of Romania should be described ==

In 1241, when the [[Golden Horde|Mongol Invasions]] occured, [[Transylvania]], a part of the actual [[Romania|Romania's]] territory, was part of the [[Hungarian Empire]]. Other parts of the actual Romania are [[Walachia]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Dobrogea]]. The Mongol invasion affected first of all Moldova and Wallachia and had a big impact on the [[Romanian history]] and [[Romanian culture|culture]] and had destroyed all cultural and economical records from that time. The main target of the [[Golden Horde]] was the [[Hungarian Empire]]. The Romanian's crops and goods seem to have been a source of suply for the [[Golden Horde]]. Also tens of thousands of Romanians lost their lives trying to defend the territories from the [[Golden Horde|Mongols]] 
*'''see [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages]]''' ♫[[User:Razool|Razool]]

Modova and Walachia didn't exist in the XIII century. [[Cumans]] formed state on these territories.

== Western Europe saved? ==

How was western Europe &quot;saved&quot; when the Mongols' invasion propagated the Black Death which led to a huge death toll in Western Europe?[[Special:Contributions/216.254.172.202|216.254.172.202]] ([[User talk:216.254.172.202|talk]]) 17:21, 11 May 2009 (UTC)
:This is just not true. The Mongol invasion was in the 1240s, the Black Death was in the 1340s. While I don't doubt the transcontinental contacts established under Mongol rule helped it spread, are there sources that claim a disease of this kind could not have spread from China to Europe before the 13th/14th century?

:And I don't think the Black Death destroyed any major cities, as the Mongols did in Russia and Central Asia. [[User:Yaan|Yaan]] ([[User talk:Yaan|talk]]) 18:00, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

:The Mongols were still involved in Europe in the 1300s and according to [[Black_Death#Plague_migration]], they likely spread the disease. While it's great that the Western European buildings were not destroyed, it's quite misleading to call Western Europe &quot;saved&quot; when there was such a catastrophic death toll that resulted from the Mongol armies' movements.[[Special:Contributions/207.112.59.175|207.112.59.175]] ([[User talk:207.112.59.175|talk]]) 01:31, 12 May 2009 (UTC)
::And I though the death toll resulted from microbes, unsanitatary conditions and trade. The sources at the Black death article do not seem to be in particularly good shape. But it seems to imply it was not only Mongol armies who spread the siege, but also Genoese traders, merchants along the silk road, a lot of infected Europeans etc.[[User:Yaan|Yaan]] ([[User talk:Yaan|talk]]) 14:10, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

:I changed &quot;saved&quot; to &quot;avoided Mongol attacks&quot; in the latter part of the sentence. It's OK to represent the subjective Hungarian view using the word &quot;saved&quot; if that is what they believe, but when counterbalancing with a more general and objective view in the latter part of the sentence a more neutral term is needed. It's not by any means an established fact that the rest of Europe was helpless and in need of some external force/event to save it.

==THIS PART IS FAKE==
&quot;More than 200 years before the Mongol invasion, the Hungarian army (descendants of the Magyars) was based on light cavalry. An interesting fact is that the former tactics of the Hungarian army were similar to those of the Mongols, but had been largely forgotten by 1241. One of the major light cavalry tactics was a sudden rush on the enemy position. However, if the enemy held (or reformed), light cavalry was insufficient to achieve a victory. Another significant tactic was a feigned retreat, in which the light cavalry would attack the enemy and then withdraw, apparently fleeing. The enemy would ideally pursue and become disorganized, leaving themselves open to attack by units hidden in reserve. The light cavalry would then reform and attack the flanks or rear of the enemy forces. The Hungarians stopped using these tactics during the 11th century.[why?]

In the late 11th century, the majority of the Hungarian army consisted of mounted sergeants (heavy knights) and infantry. The Hungarian allies, some of whom still utilized the light cavalry combat style, included the Cumans, who had settled down in Hungary not long before the Mongol invasion. They were tasked with providing the light cavalry force in the Hungarian army. However tension erupted when Mongol troops first broke into Hungary: The Hungarians, frustrated by their own helplessness, took revenge on the Cumans, whom they accused of being Mongol spies. &quot;

The reality:
1. Hungarians and Magyars are the same thing.
2. Hungarians didn't forget steppe tactics. This is an old, denied theory. They had vast number of horse archers even in the time of the battle of Nicopolis, 1397. Who have the time read A tatárjárás by B. Szabó János.
3. &quot;frustrated by their own helplessness, took revenge on the Cumans&quot; Real reasons: the Cumans were violent against local people and their nomadic lifestyle was hurtful for the Hungarian peasants but the king favoured the Cumans. Second the Mongol forces used the Cuman troops from the steppe as part of their tactics and that's why people tought them spies.
