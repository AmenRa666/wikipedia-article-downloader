'''Winthrop Sargent''' (May 1, 1753 – June 3, 1820) was a [[United States]] patriot, [[politician]], and writer; and a member of the [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] party.

==Biography==
Sargent was born in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Harvard College]] before the [[American Revolution|Revolution]]. He spent some time at sea, as [[captain (nautical)|captain]] of a [[cargo ship|merchantman]] owned by his father. He enlisted in Gridley's Regiment of Massachusetts Artillery on July 7, 1775 as a [[lieutenant]], and later that year was promoted to [[captain lieutenant]] of Knox's Regiment, Continental Artillery, on December 10. He was with his guns at the [[siege of Boston]], as well as the battles of [[Battle of Long Island|Long Island]], [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]], [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]], [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], and [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]]. He was promoted to [[captain (United States)|captain]] in the 3rd Continental Artillery on January 1, 1777, and [[Brevet (military)|brevet]]ted [[major]] on August 25, 1783.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=%22winthrop+sargent%22+mississippi+governor+natchez&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TJaWaagP50&amp;sig=vVYw2dblTpyvzy-25UNOyvdyz9o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QK-jScfdMYKOsQOWyrCdAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA10,M1 The Mississippi Territorial Archives, Vol. 1 (Executive Journals of Governors Sargent and Claiborne) p. 9] retrieved 2/24/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, he helped to survey the [[Seven Ranges]], the first lands laid out under the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]]. With inside knowledge of the area, he went on to form the [[Ohio Company of Associates]], was an important shareholder in the [[Scioto Company]], and as of 1787, secretary of the Ohio Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohiohistorycentral.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=331 Biography of Winthrop Sargent on Ohio History Central] retrieved 2/24/09&lt;/ref&gt;

:
Sargent was appointed by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] as the first Secretary of the Northwest Territory, a post second in importance only to the governor, [[Arthur St. Clair]]. He took up his post in 1788, and in 1789 he married Roewena Tupper, a daughter of Gen. [[Benjamin Tupper]], at the settlement of [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] in the first marriage ceremony held under the laws of the [[Northwest Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, L: ''True Stories from Pioneer Valley'', Broughton Foods Co., Marietta, Ohio (1987) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Like St. Clair, Sargent would function in both civil and military capacities; he was wounded twice at the [[St. Clair's Defeat|Battle of the Wabash]], on November 4, 1791.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohiohistorycentral.org&quot; /&gt;  He also served in the Indian wars of 1794-5 and became adjutant general.&lt;ref name=&quot;appletons&quot;/&gt; On August 15, 1796, he would, as Acting Governor, proclaim the establishment of [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], the first American government in what is now [[Michigan]].

President [[John Adams]] then appointed Sargent the first Governor of the [[Mississippi Territory]], effective from May 7, 1798 to May 25, 1801. His last entry as Northwest Territory's secretary was on May 31, 1798; he arrived at [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on August 6, but due to illness was unable to assume his post until August 16.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=%22winthrop+sargent%22+mississippi+governor+natchez&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TJaWaagP50&amp;sig=vVYw2dblTpyvzy-25UNOyvdyz9o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QK-jScfdMYKOsQOWyrCdAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA10,M1 The Mississippi Territorial Archives, Vol. 1 (Executive Journals of Governors Sargent and Claiborne) p. 10] retrieved 2/24/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargent was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1788.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Philosophical Society and an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] as a delegate from [[Massachusetts]], and published, with Benjamin B. Smith, ''Papers Relative to Certain American Antiquities'' (Philadelphia, 1796), and “Boston,” a poem (Boston, 1803).&lt;ref name=&quot;appletons&quot;&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Sargent, Paul Dudley|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a Federalist, Sargent was dismissed from his position as territorial governor in 1801 by  incoming president [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Sargent took up life in the private sector, developing his plantation [[Gloucester (Natchez, Mississippi)|Gloucester]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://misspreservation.com/101-mississippi-places-to-see-before-you-die/gloucester-natchez/]&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest such establishment in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]. Sargent was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on June 3, 1820 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Skates&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Family==
His uncle [[Paul Dudley Sargent]] also served in the Continental Army.

His elder sister was [[Judith Sargent Murray]], an essayist, playwright, and poet.

His grandson was the writer [[Winthrop Sargent (writer)|Winthrop Sargent]].

==Legacy==
Although there are at least two Sargent Townships (in [[Sargent Township, Douglas County, Illinois|Illinois]] and [[Sargent Township, Custer County, Nebraska|Nebraska]]) and one [[Sargent County, North Dakota|Sargent County]], it is not known if these are named after Winthrop Sargent. However, a former township of the Northwest Territory's [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] was designated as Sargent Township or the District of Sargent; this apparently encompassed the settlements downriver from Detroit and at the [[River Raisin]] in what is now [[Monroe County, Michigan]]. This township apparently ceased to function after the organization of [[Michigan Territory]], being replaced by the District of Erie.
