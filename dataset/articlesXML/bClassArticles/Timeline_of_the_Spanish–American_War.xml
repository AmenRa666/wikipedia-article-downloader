{{Campaignbox Spanish American War Theaters}}
The '''timeline of events of the Spanish–American War''' covers major events leading up to, during, and concluding the [[Spanish–American War]], a ten-week conflict in 1898 between Spain and the United States of America.

The conflict had its roots in the worsening socio-economic and military position of Spain after the [[Peninsular War]], the growing confidence of the United States as a world power, a lengthy independence movement in [[Cuba]] and a nascent one in the [[Philippines]], and strengthening economic ties between Cuba and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile, p. 507-508; Hamilton, ''President McKinley, War and Empire: President Mckinley and the Coming of War, 1898'', p. 105; &quot;Spanish-American War and Filipino Insurrection&quot;, in ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'', p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; Land warfare occurred primarily in Cuba and to a much lesser extent in the Philippines. Little or no fighting occurred in [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], or other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bining and Cochran, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although largely forgotten in the United States today,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish–American War was a formative event in American history. The destruction of the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}}, [[yellow journalism]], the war slogan &quot;Remember the Maine!&quot;, and the [[Battle of San Juan Hill|charge up San Juan Hill]] are all iconic symbols of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, Delgado, and Adams, p. 185; Cookman, p. 68; Kaplan, p. 125; Lordan, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The war marked the first time since the [[American Civil War]] that Americans from the North and the South fought a common enemy, and the war marked the end of strong sectional feeling and the &quot;healing&quot; of the wounds of that war.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish-American War catapulted [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to the presidency,&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; marked the beginning of the modern [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the first establishment of American colonies overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J1WRQBjFLTUC&amp;pg=PA22 Soltero, p. 22].&lt;/ref&gt;

The war proved seminal for Spain as well. The loss of Cuba, which was seen not as a colony but as part of Spain itself,&lt;ref&gt;Offner, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; was traumatic for the Spanish government and Spanish people. This trauma led to the rise of the [[Generation of '98]], a group of young intellectuals, authors, and artists who were deeply critical of what they perceived as conformism and ignorance on the part of the Spanish people. They successfully called for a new &quot;Spanish national spirit&quot; that was politically active, anti-authoritarian, and generally anti-imperialistic and anti-military.&lt;ref&gt;Dyal, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The war also greatly benefited Spain economically. No longer spending large sums to maintain its colonies, significant amounts of capital were suddenly repatriated for use domestically.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, Castro, and Blanco, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; This sudden and massive influx of capital led to the development for the first time of large, modern industries in banking, chemicals, electrical power generation, manufacturing, ship building, steel, and textiles.&lt;ref&gt;Herr, p. 119-120; Balfour p. 54-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war led to independence for Cuba within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, p. 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States imposed a colonial government on the Philippines, quashing the young Philippine Republic. This led directly to the [[Philippine–American War]],&lt;ref&gt;Abinales and Amoroso, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; a brutal guerilla conflict that caused the deaths of about 4,100 Americans and 12,000 to 20,000 Filipino guerilla and regular troops.&lt;ref&gt;Hack and Rettig 2006, p. 172; [http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/2006/10apr06/10paul.html &quot;Historian Paul Kramer Revisits the Philippine–American War.&quot; ''The JHU Gazette.'' 35:29 (April 10, 2006)], accessed 2013-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillermo&quot;&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gbIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GEUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5222%2C6070988 Guillermo, Emil. &quot;A First Taste of Empire.&quot; ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' February 8, 2004.] Accessed 2013-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 200,000 to 1,500,000 Filipino civilian deaths occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guillermo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, p. 214; Burdeos, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the conflict brought [[William Howard Taft]] to the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt, and led to Taft's ascension to the U.S. presidency in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Cash, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The American presence in the Philippines still existed at the beginning of World War II. Along with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the American experience in the Philippines at the start of the war (the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|Philippines Campaign]], the [[Bataan Death March]], the [[Battle of Corregidor]]) became another formative episode in the American experience&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, p. 74; Preston, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; and rehabilitated the career of General [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, p. 10; Watson, p. 109; Jeffers, p. 100; Buhite, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1892==
*April 10 - After widespread discussion with Cubans living in the United States, [[José Martí]] co-founds El Partido Revolucionario Cubano (the Cuban Revolutionary Party). Its purpose is to win independence for Cuba. The organization is a reaction to nearly 15 years of economic growth, expansion of trade with the U.S., withering of trade with Spain, and extreme dissatisfaction with the ''[[Peninsulars|peninsular]]'' [[caste]] system and socio-economic injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez and Prevost, p. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1894==
*August 27 - The [[United States Congress]] enacts the [[Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act]], which imposes much higher [[tariff]]s on sugar. A suspension of Spanish tariffs on American goods expires at about the same time, leading to fears that the U.S. will retaliate against Cuba and other Spanish colonies by raising sugar and other tariffs even further. The two events devastate Cuba's economy, and Cuban sugar producers unite to try to get the Spanish tariffs lowered.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, p. 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1895==
*February 24 - In the small town of Baire near the city of [[Santiago de Cuba]], Martí issues the ''Grito de Baire'', igniting the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. Within 18 months, the insurrectionists have 50,000 men under arms and uprisings have spread across the island.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 12 - U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] issues a proclamation declaring the United States [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] in the Cuban war of independence.&lt;ref&gt;LeFaber, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1896==
*February 10 - After losing the eastern part of Cuba to the revolutionaries and witnessing the outbreak of insurrection in the western provinces, [[Spanish Army]] [[General officer|General]] [[Arsenio Martínez-Campos y Antón]] is replaced as [[List of colonial governors of Cuba|Governor of Cuba]] by General [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rubí]]. Weyler begins a policy of ''recontratación'' (&quot;reconcentration&quot;), in which the people in rebel-held areas are rounded up and placed in [[Internment#Concentration camp|concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockoff48&quot;&gt;Rockoff, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Weyler brings with him more than 200,000 Spanish Army troops, and organizes 50,000 ''peninsulars'' and Cubans into a pro-Spanish militia.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; About 400,000 people are placed in concentration camps with little provision made for food, housing, clothing, sanitation, and medical care, and the local economy collapses in areas where the camps are created. Tens of thousands of Cubans starve to death or die from disease.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*November 3 - [[William McKinley]] defeats [[William Jennings Bryan]] to become President of the United States. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] platform advocates independence and democracy for Cuba. The neutralist wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] loses power in Congress as voters elect pro-Cuban Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Peceny, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1897==
*May 20 - The U.S. Congress appropriates $50,000 to provide food, clothing, and other supplies to approximately 1,200 destitute people living in Cuba who have both Cuban and American citizenship. President McKinley signs the legislation on May 24.&lt;ref&gt;Curti, p. 199; &quot;Cuba Relief Bill Passed.&quot; ''New York Times'' May 21, 1897; &quot;Cuban Relief Plans.&quot; ''New York Times'' May 25, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 7 - [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Sherman]] issues an official protest to the government of Spain regarding the brutality of General Weyler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockoff48&quot; /&gt;
*July 7 - The U.S. Congress enacts the [[Dingley Act]], which doubles the tariff on sugar. This plunges the Cuban economy into depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockoff48&quot; /&gt;
*October 6 - After [[Liberal-Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservative Party]] [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]] is assassinated on August 8, [[Liberal Party (Spanish Restoration)|Liberal Party]] leader [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]] forms a government to become Prime Minister of Spain. Sagasta recalls Weyler (replacing him with General [[Ramón Blanco y Erenas]]), offers [[home rule]] to the Cubans, and closes the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Rickover, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Confident of victory, the Cuban rebels reject the offer of home rule.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1898==

===January===
*January 11 - Anti-independence riots, incited by [[Spanish Army]] officers, occur in [[Havana]], the capital of Cuba. Extensive property damage occurs as rioters demand that Spain stop giving concessions to the Cuban rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;
*January 25 - The United States Navy [[battleship]] {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} arrives at [[Havana Harbor]] from [[Key West]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; President McKinley says the ship is on a good-will visit, but the ship is there as a show of strength to ensure American property and lives are not threatened should additional rioting occur.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Spanish-American War&quot;, in ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy'', p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

===February===
[[File:Journal98.gif|thumb|350px|[[Yellow journalism]], like these headlines about the destruction of the ''USS Maine'' in the ''New York Journal'', worsened war hysteria in the U.S. and helped cause the Spanish–American War.]]
*February 9 - [[Enrique Dupuy de Lôme]], the [[List of Ambassadors of Spain to the United States|Spanish ambassador to the United States]], is forced to resign after the [[De Lôme Letter]] is published in the ''[[New York Journal]]''. This document, a private letter written to friend in Cuba, characterizes U.S. President McKinley as &quot;weak&quot; and a &quot;would-be politician&quot; who catered to the most [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] elements of the Republican Party and public. The American public is outraged at the depiction of the United States as immature, militarily weak, and lacking in diplomatic skill.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, p. 116-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The Autonomous Charter of Puerto Rico, a law approved the previous November by the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] (the Spanish national legislature) giving local city and provincial governments of the island nearly complete [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomy]], is implemented by Spanish [[List of Governors of Puerto Rico|Governor-General]] [[Manuel Macías y Casado]]. The first autonomous government of Puerto Rico meets the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, &quot;Manuel Macías y Casado&quot;, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;
*February 15 - The USS ''Maine'' explodes. About 274 of the ship's roughly 354 crew die.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod&quot;&gt;Axelrod, p. 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Accurate information for both the number of crew and dead are difficult vary widely.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[naval court of inquiry]] led by Captain [[William T. Sampson]] is inconclusive, but the American press and most members of Congress conclude that the ''Maine'' struck a [[naval mine]] laid by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Marley, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; (Subsequent investigations over the next century suggest the explosion was caused by the ignition of [[coal dust]] in the fuel bunker or a fire in the coal bunker, although some have also concluded the cause was a mine.)
*February 25 - U.S. [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sends an order to [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]], commander of the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Squadron]] in Hong Kong, to be prepared to attack the Spanish Navy fleet in the Philippines if there is an outbreak of war. Although [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Davis Long]] is angered by Roosevelt's precipitate action (which occurred during his absence), he does not countermand the order.&lt;ref&gt;Borneman, p. 1874.&lt;/ref&gt;

===March===
*March 3 - [[Fernando Primo de Rivera, 1st Marquis of Estella|Fernando Primo de Rivera]], [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], informs the Spanish government in [[Madrid]] that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet has orders to attack [[Manila]], capital of the Philippines, in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;
*March 9 - After learning that Spain was attempting to buy [[Brazil]]ian warships under construction in the United Kingdom, U.S. President McKinley asks Congress for $50 million for national defense. Congress approves the request in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;McKinley, William, and the Spanish-American War&quot; in ''The War of 1898, and U.S. Interventions, 1898-1934: An Encyclopedia'', p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Navy purchases the Brazilian ships instead.
*March 12 - The U.S. Navy's [[European Squadron]] is ordered to depart [[Lisbon]], Portugal, and escort the newly purchased ships {{USS|New Orleans|CL-22|6}} (formerly the ''Amazonas'') and the {{USS|Albany|CL-23}} (formerly the ''Almirante Abreu'') to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k00iAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 Maclay, p. 67.] Accessed 2013-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*March 14 - The Spanish Navy's Atlantic Squadron, commanded by [[Admiral]] [[Pascual Cervera y Topete]], leaves the Spanish port of [[Cadiz]] for the [[Canary Islands]] and then the Portuguese-held [[Cape Verde Islands]] to position itself for a dash to the [[West Indies]] in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, &quot;Cape Tunas&quot;, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Cervera has orders to destroy Key West and blockade the [[East Coast of the United States]], but knows that his navy is in disrepair, has no ship repair facilities in the Americas, is ill-trained, and is significantly weaker than the U.S. Navy.

*May 1 - [[Battle of Manila Bay]]: The U.S. Asiatic Squadron enters Manila Bay at midnight. At anchor in the harbor is the out-gunned and ill-prepared Spanish fleet under the command of Admiral [[Patricio Montojo]]. At about 4:10 A.M., the American fleet engages the older Spanish vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, p. 143-149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing seven-hour naval battle, Spain loses all seven of its ships, 381 Spanish sailors die, and three Spanish shore batteries are destroyed. There are no American combat deaths; two U.S. Navy officers and six sailors are wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 2 - The U.S. Asiatic Fleet lacks soldiers to actually occupy territory,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, ''President McKinley, War and Empire: President McKinley and America's &quot;New Empire&quot;'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; so President McKinley authorizes U.S. Army troops to be sent to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, &quot;Expansion at Home and Abroad: Timeline&quot;, p. 1161.&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 6 - After convincing [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Russell A. Alger]] he can raise an all-volunteer force of 1,000 men and form a [[cavalry]] [[Regiment#United States Army|regiment]], Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt resigns. Alger previously offered Roosevelt a commission in the Army as a full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in command of a regular regiment, but Roosevelt declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansford46&quot;&gt;Lansford, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 11 - [[Battle of Cárdenas]]: Spanish shore guns repulse a U.S. Navy effort to seize the harbor at [[Cárdenas, Cuba]]. [[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]] [[Worth Bagley]] is killed; he is the only U.S. Navy officer killed in combat during the entire war. The same day, the {{USS|Nashville|PG-7|6}} and {{USS|Marblehead|C-11|6}} send 52 [[United States Marines]] ashore at [[Cienfuegos]], Cuba, to cut the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s with Spain. Two of the three cables are cut, and the Marines suffer heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Villafaña, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 12 - [[Bombardment of San Juan]]: The U.S. North Atlantic Squadron sails into the harbor at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], where it is believed that the Spanish Atlantic Squadron has anchored. The Spanish are not there, but Rear Admiral William T. Sampson orders the city bombed anyway. Numerous civilians die.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Wesley Merritt]] is appointed commander of the American force which will invade the Philippines.

*May 29 - The U.S. Navy [[Flying Squadron (United States Navy)|Flying Squadron]], commanded by Commodore [[Winfield Scott Schley]], arrives off Santiago de Cuba. Schley received orders to blockade Santiago de Cuba on May 24, but futilely awaited the Spanish Atlantic Squadron off Cienfuegos first. The Flying Squadron consists of the armored cruiser {{USS|Brooklyn|CA-3|6}}; the battleships {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}}, {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-2|6}}, and {{USS|Texas|1892|6}}; and the protected cruiser ''USS Marblehead''.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, &quot;Expansion at Home and Abroad: Timeline&quot;, p. 1163.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry — better known as the &quot;[[Rough Riders]]&quot; because most of the men are [[cowboy]]s, [[American frontier|frontiersmen]], [[Rail transport|railroad]] workers, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and similar &quot;rough&quot; people from the [[American frontier#The term &quot;West&quot;|American West]] — depart their training camp in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. They are under the command of Colonel [[Leonard Wood]]; Theodore Roosevelt, who largely organized the unit, declines command of it. Pleading inexperience, Roosevelt accepts a commission as [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of volunteers and serves as Wood's subordinate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansford46&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutton286287&quot;&gt;Hutton, p. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===June===
[[File:Aguinaldo.jpg|thumb|Emilio Aguinaldo in 1898]]
*June 3 - Commodore Schley's U.S. Flying Squadron, supported by Rear Admiral Sampson's U.S. North Atlantic Squadron (which arrived on June 1), attempts to block the entrance to the harbor at Santiago de Cuba by sinking the [[Collier (ship)|collier]] {{USS|Merrimac|1894|6}} in the main channel. Small Spanish gunboats and mines prevent the ship's proper positioning, and the harbor remains open. Assistant Naval Constructor [[Richmond P. Hobson]] and his crew of seven are captured.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 132, 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 7 - U.S. Marines from the {{SS|St. Louis|1894|6}} cut the submarine telegraph cable at [[Guantánamo Bay]], severing communication between the city of [[Guantánamo]] and the rest of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 10 - [[1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay|Invasion of Guantánamo Bay]]: 647 U.S. Marines land at Guantánamo Bay, beginning the invasion of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 140; Hansen, p. 98-100; Caporale, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 12 - Emilio Aguinaldo declares the independence of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Halili, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 13 - U.S. President McKinley signs the [[War Revenue Act of 1898]] into law. Passed by Congress on June 10, the act authorizes a tax on amusements, [[liquor]], [[tea]], and [[tobacco]], and requires tax stamps on some business transactions (such as [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]], [[Manifest (transportation)|manifests]], and [[marine insurance]]).&lt;ref&gt;Garbade, p. 29; Jewell, p. 1895; Swaine, p. 653; Pratt, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; It also authorizes $200 million in [[war bond]]s, provided that no more than $100 million in bonds is outstanding at any time.&lt;ref&gt;Garbade, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The act also permitted the government to float up to $100 million in war bonds with a [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] of less than a year. This proves &quot;a turning point&quot; in the federal government's ability to create flexible financial instruments critical to maintaining the credit of the United States. See: Livingston, p.121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The estate tax was not the first estate tax enacted in the history of the United States, but its [[Progressive tax|graduated]] nature made it the precursor to the modern federal estate tax. The 1898 estate tax was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Knowlton v. Moore]]'', 178 U.S. 41 (1900). See: Johnson and Eller, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 16 - The Spanish Navy's 2d Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Manuel de la Cámara y Libermoore]], departs Spain for the Philippines. The fleet consists of the battleship ''[[Spanish battleship Pelayo|Pelayo]]'', armored cruiser ''[[Spanish cruiser Emperador Carlos V|Emperador Carlos V]]'', unarmored cruisers ''[[Spanish cruiser Patriota (1889)|Patriota]]'' and ''[[Spanish cruiser Rapido (1889)|Rapido]]'', and two transports with 4,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, &quot;Cámara y Libermoore, Manuel de la&quot;, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 19 - The Rough Riders disembark from U.S. Navy vessels onto a beach near Santiago de Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutton286287&quot; /&gt;
*June 20 - U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and Cuban rebels meet for the Aserraderos Conference in the small town of Aserraderos (near Santiago de Cuba). They jointly plan strategy, troop movements, and battle plans.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 21 - [[Capture of Guam]]: The American protected cruiser {{USS|Charleston|C-2|6}} arrives at the Pacific Ocean island of [[Guam]] on June 20 and fires a few warning shots in the air, which are misinterpreted by the small Spanish garrison as a salute. (The undersea telegraph was not working, and the garrison did not know war had been declared.) The Spanish garrison formally surrenders the island without a fight on June 21.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, p. xv; Schoonover, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 22 - U.S. Major General [[William Rufus Shafter]]'s [[Fifth Army Corps (Spanish-American War)|Fifth Army Corps]] begins landing at the Cuban village of [[Daiquirí]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} east of Santiago de Cuba. About 6,000 men land in a chaotic operation on the first day. Among the 16,888 troops are 15 regiments of regulars and three regiments of volunteers. Spanish Army [[Lieutenant General]] [[Arsenio Linares y Pombo]] has 12,000 soldiers in the surrounding hills, but does not oppose the landings.&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerChrono1506&quot;&gt;Tucker, ''A Global Chronology of Conflict'', p. 1506.&lt;/ref&gt; The cruiser {{USS|Saint Paul|SP-1643|6}}, commanded by Captain [[Charles Dwight Sigsbee|Charles D. Sigsbee]] (former commander of the ''USS Maine''), disables the Spanish Navy [[destroyer]] ''[[Spanish destroyer Terror|Terror]]'' while blockading San Juan, Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweetman98&quot;&gt;Sweetman, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 23 - A division of the American Fifth Corps seizes the village of [[Siboney, Cuba]], without a fight. Siboney, just {{convert|9|mi|km}} from Santiago de Cuba, becomes the corps headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerChrono1506&quot; /&gt;
*June 24 - [[Battle of Las Guasimas]]: Major General [[Joseph Wheeler]] learns that Spanish Army forces are digging in along a ridge above El Camino Real (the &quot;Royal Road&quot;) near the village of Las Guásimas, {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Siboney. Wheeler orders [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Samuel Baldwin Marks Young|S. B. M. Young]] to lead the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]], [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]] (a [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] unit of [[African American]] soldiers), and the Rough Riders to attack the position, apparently knowing that Spanish Army Brigadier General [[Antero Rubín]] has orders to withdraw. The Spanish — outnumbering the Americans 1,500 to 1,000, and armed with superior [[7×57mm Mauser|7mm]] [[Mauser#Spanish M93|1893 model Mauser repetition rifles]] firing ammunition propelled by [[Smokeless powder|smokeless gunpowder]] — hold off the U.S. 1st Cavalry. Led by Lt. Colonel Roosevelt, three companies of the Rough Riders try to outflank the Spanish and succeed to some extent. After two hours, the Spanish withdraw as scheduled. The Americans claim victory, but were much closer to defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, &quot;Expansion at Home and Abroad: Timeline&quot;, p. 1169, 1171.&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 28 - U.S. President McKinley extends the American naval blockade to Puerto Rico. The cruiser {{USS|Yosemite|1892|6}} attacks the Spanish Navy transport ''Antonio Lopez'', which is defended by the Spanish cruisers ''[[Spanish cruiser Isabel II|Isabel II]]'' and ''Alfonso XIII''. Although the ''Antonio Lopez'' is run aground near the city of San Juan and destroyed, most of her cargo (including heavy artillery) is saved by the Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweetman98&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerExpansion1171&quot;&gt;Tucker, &quot;Expansion at Home and Abroad: Timeline&quot;, p. 1171.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charge of the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill.JPG|thumb|350px|''Charge of the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill'' by [[Frederic Remington]]]]
*July 1 - [[Battle of the Aguadores]]: In support of U.S. Army troops moving on Santiago de Cuba, Brigadier General [[Henry M. Duffield]] leads a [[brigade]] consisting of the 33rd Michigan Volunteer Infantry, 34th Michigan Volunteer Infantry, and 9th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry in a [[Feint#Attacks|feint]] toward the Aguadores River. The railway [[trestle]] over the river is destroyed, preventing an American crossing. His 2,500 soldiers are stopped by about 275 Spanish Army soldiers, and Duffield withdraws.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of El Caney]]: 520 Spanish Army soldiers under the command of Brigadier General [[Joaquín Vara del Rey y Rubio]] hold off 6,653 men of Fifth Army Corps' 2d Division, led by Brigadier General [[Henry Ware Lawton]]. Heavy ground cover delayed and exhausted the U.S. troops as they climbed the hill toward El Caney, the men had little food, the underpowered American artillery was not close enough to provide cover, and six wooden blockhouses and a small stone fort give the Spanish excellent protection. The battle begins at 6:30 A.M., and was expected to last two hours; it does not end until American troops finally overrun El Caney at 5:00 P.M. Vara del Rey is killed.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, p. 175-176; Trask, p. 235-236.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battles of San Juan Hill and Kettle Hill]]: Two elements of Fifth Corps — the 1st Division, under the command of U.S. Brigadier General [[Jacob Ford Kent]], and the Cavalry Division (dismounted) under the command of Executive Officer [[Samuel S. Sumner]] (General Wheeler was ill) — assault San Juan Hill and Kettle Hill (named for the large iron sugar-cooking kettles on its slopes) overlooking Santiago de Cuba. The 15,000 American soldiers are opposed by 800 men of the Spanish Army's IV Corps under the command of General Linares. The attack on Kettle Hill is led by one element of the Cavalry Division's 1st Brigade (the 3rd U.S. Cavalry) and two elements of the Cavalry Division's 2d Brigade (the Rough Riders and the all-black 10th Cavalry). The assault is initially slowed as U.S. soldiers suffer from [[heat exhaustion]], but effective fire from American [[Gatling gun#Spanish-American War|Gatling guns]] and &quot;the charge up San Juan Hill&quot; by Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders secure the heights. U.S. troops on Kettle Hill briefly take Spanish artillery fire from San Juan Hill until it, too, is taken relatively easily. All U.S. objectives at San Juan Heights are secure by 1:30 P.M.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan and Tucker, p. 574; Trask, p. 237-246.&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 2 - U.S. General Shafter sends a message to Admiral Sampson, requesting that the U.S. Navy force its way into Santiago de Cuba's harbor and destroy the shore batteries and artillery there. &quot;Sampson is appalled&quot; as he realizes the U.S. Army has suffered such grievous losses from disease that it needs the U.S. Navy to capture the city for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweetman98&quot; /&gt;
*July 3 - [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]]: On July 1, the Spanish Governor of Cuba, General Blanco, ordered Admiral Cervera to run the blockade and escape the harbor at Santiago de Cuba. Cervera does so at 9:00 A.M. on July 3, just hours after U.S. Rear Admiral Sampson leaves his fleet for an on-shore conference (leaving Commodore Schley in command of both the Flying Squadron and North Atlantic Squadron).&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, &quot;Santiago de Cuba, Naval Battle of (July 3, 1898)&quot;, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marley602&quot;&gt;Marley, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt; Cervera's fleet consists of the armored cruisers ''[[Spanish cruiser Infanta Maria Teresa|Infanta Maria Teresa]]'' (his flagship), ''[[Spanish cruiser Vizcaya|Vizcaya]]'', ''[[Spanish cruiser Cristóbal Colón|Cristóbal Colón]]'', and ''[[Spanish cruiser Almirante Oquendo|Almirante Oquendo]]'', and the destroyers ''[[Spanish destroyer Plutón|Plutón]]'' and ''[[Spanish destroyer Furor|Furor]]''.

The U.S. Navy later refloats the ship and takes it back to the United States as a war prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maryley603&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Battle of Santiago Bay - 1898-07-03.jpg|thumb|Somewhat fictional depiction of the beginning of the naval Battle of Santiago de Cuba.]]
*July 7 - Worried about an American attack on the coast of Spain, the Spanish government tells Rear Admiral Cámara to bring the Spanish Navy's 2d Squadron, then at the mouth of the [[Suez Canal]], back to Cadiz. This ends the Spanish attempt to oppose the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 275-278.&lt;/ref&gt; With U.S. President McKinley having pressed for it since June 11, Congress passes a joint resolution on June 6 [[annexation|annexing]] Hawaii.

American soldiers secure the main road to [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] on July 26 in the &quot;Battle of Yauco&quot; after a brief and bloodless skirmish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marley604&quot; /&gt; U.S. General Merritt reaches Manila in the Philippines.

These diplomats telegraph the U.S. Navy's terms of surrender to the Spanish Governor-General of Puerto Rico, Manuel Macías. He reluctantly agrees to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baralt113&quot;&gt;Baralt, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

*July 29 - U.S. Army troops in the Philippines begin establishing an offensive line stretching from the beach at Manila Bay inland to the Calle Real (the inland road connecting Cavite with Manila).&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth Corps departed the U.S. without proper equipment, food, or medical supplies, and is suffering from extremely poor living and sanitary conditions. The letter, written by now-Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and signed by all commanders of the corps, demands the withdrawal of the corps to the U.S. before disease decimates it. Delivered to General Shafter before its publication, U.S. Secretary of War Alger has already agreed to withdraw Fifth Corps (and does so on August 3). The American public is outraged by the scandalous living conditions under which the troops suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Wintermute, p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 5 - 5,000 U.S. Army troops under the command of Major General [[John R. Brooke]] have orders to march west along the southern coast of Puerto Rico from Arroyo to the nearby town of [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]], then to [[Coamo, Puerto Rico|Coamo]]. They are then to turn northeast and head for the inland city of [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]]. The U.S. soldiers meet stiff resistance in Guayama, but the August 5 firefight is brief and they invest the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerExpansion1176&quot;&gt;Tucker, &quot;Expansion at Home and Abroad: Timeline&quot;, p. 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 9 - Units of Major General [[James H. Wilson]]'s U.S. Army column, moving east-northeast from Ponce to Coamo and then north to the heavily concentrated Spanish Army position at [[Aibonito, Puerto Rico|Aibonito]], encounter heavy resistance in Coamo.

*August 12 - U.S. Army General Wilson's command again runs into Spanish Army resistance, this time in the Asomante Hills near Aibonito. The Spanish are routed after a brief skirmish.&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerExpansion1176&quot; /&gt; Spain and the United States sign an [[armistice]], the &quot;Protocol of Peace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, &quot;Expansion at Home and Abroad: Timeline&quot;, p. 1177.&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 12–13 - [[Fourth Battle of Manzanillo]]: A U.S. Navy squadron consisting of the protected cruiser {{USS|Newark|C-1|6}}, the auxiliary cruisers {{USS|Hist|1895|6}} and [[USS Mayflower (1897)|USS ''Suwanee'']], the gunboat {{USS|Alvarado|1895|6}}, and the armed tugboat {{USS|Osceola|AT-47|6}} bombard the Cuban port of Manzanillo and capture it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweetman100&quot; /&gt;
*August 13 - [[Battle of Manila (1898)|Battle of Manila]]: Manila surrenders. Governor General Jáudenes, fearing Spanish troops will be massacred by the Filipinos, agrees to surrender the city after token resistance if U.S. General Wesley Merritt excludes Filipino troops from the battle. Merritt agrees. After a brief naval bombardment, the 1st Brigade under Brigadier General [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]] attacks from the south while General Greene's 2d Brigade attacks from the north. There is brief Spanish resistance to MacArthur's advance after large groups of Filipinos ignore American orders to stay behind and rush the Spanish lines. Governor General Jáudenes surrenders at 11:20 A.M. after a battle lasting two hours.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;MacArthur, Arthur&quot;, in ''The War of 1898, and U.S. Interventions, 1898-1934: An Encyclopedia'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico, U.S. Army Brigadier General Schwan's command encounters Spanish Army resistance near the town of [[Las Marías, Puerto Rico|Las Marías]]. Word of the armistice has not yet reached Puerto Rico, and a brief skirmish ensues.

===September===
*September 13 - The Spanish national legislature, the Cortes, approves the Protocol of Peace by a vote of 161 to 48. But many deputies [[abstain]], indicating a deep feeling within the Cortes that the war should continue to be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p. 611.&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 15 - The [[Malolos Congress]], the assembly of the revolutionary government of the Philippines, convenes in [[Malolos]], Philippines. It ratifies Aguinaldo's declaration of independence, and begins drafting a constitution for an independent Republic of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard364&quot;&gt;Pollard, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 26 - The War Department Investigating Commission (also known as the &quot;Dodge Commission&quot; after its chairman, Major General [ret.] [[Grenville M. Dodge]]) begins investigating the conduct of the U.S. Department of War during the Spanish–American conflict. Vivid testimony by Major General Nelson A. Miles on December 21 about chemically adulterated beef bought by the department to feed soldiers in the field (the &quot;[[United States Army beef scandal]]&quot;) leads to public outrage. The final report, issued on February 9, 1899, exonerates the War Department but subtly implies that Secretary of War Alger was an inefficient if not incompetent manager.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, &quot;War Department Investigating Commission&quot;, p. 582-584.&lt;/ref&gt; Alger denies the implication, but on July 19, 1899, he resigns (effective August 1).&lt;ref&gt;Schulp, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

*October 24 - U.S. President McKinley has a dream in which he claims God told him that the United States should seize the entire Philippines: &quot;nothing left for us to do but to take them all, to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and Christianize them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 26 - U.S. President McKinley instructs the American delegation at the Paris Peace Conference to seek possession of the entire Philippines:&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowe624&quot; /&gt; &quot;The cession must be of the whole archipelago or none. ...latter is wholly inadmissible, and the former must therefore be required&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ellipsis in original. Hamilton, ''President McKinley, War and Empire: President McKinley and America's &quot;New Empire&quot;'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===November===
*November 29 - The Malolos Congress ratifies the [[Philippine Constitution|Malolos Constitution]], a major step toward establishing the Philippines as an independent state.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

*February 4 - The [[Philippine–American War]] breaks out when U.S. soldiers fire on four Filipino soldiers who enter the &quot;American Zone&quot; in Manila. This ignites the [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]], and is the first military engagement of the second Philippine war for independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nickeson491&quot; /&gt;
*February 6 - The [[United States Senate]] ratifies the Treaty of Paris by a close vote of 57 to 27. (A two-thirds majority, or 56 votes, was needed to ratify.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowe624&quot; /&gt; An amendment requiring the United States to give the Philippines its independence fails after [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Garret Hobart]] casts the deciding vote against it. The Senate might have declined to ratify the treaty, but the outbreak of hostilities in Manila turns the tide of feeling in the treaty's favor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nickeson491&quot; /&gt;
*March 19 - Exercising her right to &quot;fulfil the crown's constitutional obligations and serve the national interest&quot; by peacefully resolving political tension, [[Maria Christina of Austria|Maria Cristina]], [[List of Spanish regents#Reign of Alfonso XIII|Queen Regent of Spain]], signs the Treaty of Paris personally. The Cortes was deeply divided over the terms of the treaty, and deadlocked over its ratification. With ratification in jeopardy, the Queen Regent dissolved the Cortes and exercised her imperial privilege — ratifying the treaty herself.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Spanish-American War: Conflict in the Caribbean and the Pacific, 1895-1902'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
