{{History of Hungary}}

{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}

The '''Hungarian Revolution of 1956''' or the '''Hungarian Uprising of 1956'''&lt;ref&gt;Alternate references are &quot;Hungarian Revolt&quot; and &quot;Hungarian Uprising&quot;. In Hungarian, first the term &quot;felkelés&quot; (uprising) was used, then in the 1957–1988 period, the term &quot;ellenforradalom&quot; (counter-revolution) was mandated by the government, while the new official name after 1990 has become &quot;forradalom és szabadságharc&quot; (revolution and freedom fight) to imitate the old expression for the 1848–1849 revolution. Another explanation of the terms is that &quot;Revolution&quot; conforms to both English [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26566.htm (see US Department of State background on Hungary)] and Hungarian (&quot;forradalom&quot;) conventions. There is a distinction between the &quot;complete overthrow&quot; of a revolution and an uprising or revolt that may or may not be successful ([[Oxford English Dictionary]]). The 1956 Hungarian event, although short-lived, is a true &quot;revolution&quot; in that the sitting government was deposed. Unlike the terms &quot;coup d'état&quot; and &quot;putsch&quot; that imply action of a few, the 1956 revolution was initiated by the masses.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-hu|1956-os forradalom}} or {{lang|hu|''1956-os felkelés''}}) was a nationwide [[revolt]] against the government of the [[Hungarian People's Republic]] and its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-imposed policies, lasting from 23 October until 10 November 1956. Though leaderless when it first began, it was the first major threat to Soviet control since the USSR's forces drove out Nazi Germany from its territory at the end of World War II and broke into Central and Eastern Europe.

The revolt began as a student demonstration, which attracted thousands as they marched through central [[Budapest]] to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament building]], calling out on the streets using a van with loudspeakers via [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]]. A student delegation, entering the [[Hungarian Radio|radio building]] to try to broadcast [[Demands of Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1956|the students' demands]], was detained. When the delegation's release was demanded by the demonstrators outside, they were fired upon by the [[State Protection Authority|State Security Police]] (ÁVH) from within the building. One student died and was wrapped in a flag and held above the crowd. This was the start of the revolution. As the news spread, disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital.

The revolt spread quickly across [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] and the government collapsed. Thousands organised into [[militia]]s, battling the ÁVH and [[Soviet Army|Soviet troops]]. Pro-Soviet communists and ÁVH members were often executed or imprisoned and former political prisoners were released and armed. Radical impromptu [[workers' council]]s wrested municipal control from the ruling [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] and demanded political changes. A new government formally disbanded the ÁVH, declared its intention to withdraw from the [[Warsaw Pact]], and pledged to re-establish free elections. By the end of October, fighting had almost stopped and a sense of normality began to return.

After announcing a willingness to negotiate a withdrawal of Soviet forces, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution. On 4 November, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The Hungarian resistance continued until 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter. By January 1957, the new Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. These Soviet actions, while strengthening control over the [[Eastern Bloc]], alienated many Western [[Marxism|Marxists]], leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for [[Communist party|Communist Parties]] in the West.

Public discussion about this revolution was suppressed in Hungary for more than 30 years. Since the thaw of the 1980s, it has been a subject of intense study and debate. At the inauguration of the [[Third Hungarian Republic]] in 1989, 23 October was declared a national holiday.

==Prelude==
During World War II Hungary was a member of the [[Axis powers]], allied with the forces of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. In 1941, the Hungarian military [[Hungary during World War II|participated]] in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia|occupation of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The Soviet army was able to force back the Hungarian and other Axis invaders. By 1944 Soviet armies were advancing towards Hungary.

Fearing invasion, the Hungarian government began armistice negotiations with the Allies. These ended when [[Operation Margarethe|Nazi Germany invaded and occupied]] the country and set up its own pro-Axis regime, the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]].

Both Hungarian and German forces stationed in Hungary were subsequently defeated when the Soviet Union invaded the country in 1945.

===Postwar occupation===
Towards the end of World War II, the [[Soviet Army]] occupied Hungary, with the country coming under the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. Immediately after World War II, Hungary was a [[multiparty democracy]], and [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1945|elections in 1945]] produced a [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|coalition government]] under Prime Minister [[Zoltán Tildy]]. However, the [[Hungarian Communist Party]], a [[Leninist|Marxist–Leninist]] group who shared the Soviet government's ideological beliefs, constantly wrested small concessions in a process named [[salami tactics]], which sliced away the elected government's influence, despite the fact that it had received only 17% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kertesz | first=Stephen D. | title=Diplomacy in a Whirlpool: Hungary between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia|chapter-url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/dipl/dipl08.htm|chapter=Chapter VIII (Hungary, a Republic)|pages=139–52 | publisher=[[University of Notre Dame Press]], Notre Dame, Indiana | year=1953 | isbn=0-8371-7540-2}} Retrieved 8 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNPara47&quot;&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter II.

After the elections of 1945, the portfolio of the Interior Ministry, which oversaw the [[State Protection Authority|Hungarian State Security Police]] (''Államvédelmi Hatóság'', later known as the ÁVH), was transferred from the Independent Smallholders Party to a nominee of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter IX D, para 426 (p. 133) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.47&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ÁVH employed methods of [[intimidation]], falsified accusations, imprisonment, and [[torture]] to suppress political opposition.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter II.N, para 89(xi) (p. 31) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.47&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brief period of multi-party [[democracy]] came to an end when the Communist Party merged with the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] to become the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]], which stood its candidate list unopposed in 1949. The [[People's Republic of Hungary]] was then declared.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNPara47&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- Does this reference cover all three facts in this paragraph? A: (30 Oct 2009) the two references, paras 89 and 47, cover the last half of the paragraph. A citation on the ÁVH founding and the interior ministry is yet needed--&gt; By 1949, the Soviets had concluded a mutual assistance treaty, the [[Comecon]], with Hungary, that granted the Soviet Union rights to a continued military presence, assuring ultimate political control.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

The Hungarian Working People's Party set about to modify the economy into [[socialism]] by undertaking radical [[nationalization]] based on the Soviet model. This forced method of economic socialisation during infrastructural recovery from the war initially resulted in economic stagnation, lower standards of living, and a deep malaise.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Writers and journalists were the first to voice open criticism of the government and its policies, publishing critical articles in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter II.

===Political repression and economic decline===
Hungary became a [[People's Republic of Hungary|communist state]] under the severely authoritarian leadership of [[Mátyás Rákosi]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Video''': Hungary in Flames [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/selection/rip/4/av/1956-43.html CEU.hu] producer: CBS (1958) – Fonds 306, Audiovisual Materials Relating to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, OSA Archivum, Budapest, Hungary ID number: HU OSA 306–0–1:40&lt;/ref&gt; Under Rákosi's reign, the Security Police ([[State Protection Authority|ÁVH]]) began a series of purges, first within the Communist Party to end opposition to Rákosi's reign. The victims were labeled as &quot;[[Titoism|Titoists]],&quot; &quot;western agents,&quot; or &quot;[[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]&quot; for as insignificant a crime as spending time in the West to participate in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In total, about half of all the middle and lower level party officials—at least 7,000 people—were purged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Litván 1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Litván|first=György|title=The Hungarian Revolution of 1956: Reform, Revolt and Repression|year=1996|publisher=Longman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tokes317&quot;&gt;Tőkés, Rudolf L.

[[File:Rákosi Mátyás fortepan 56324.jpg|thumb|upright|Mátyás Rákosi speaks in Budapest, 1948]]
From 1950 to 1952, the Security Police forcibly relocated thousands of people to obtain property and housing for the Working People's Party members, and to remove the threat of the intellectual and 'bourgeois' class. Thousands were arrested, tortured, tried, and imprisoned in [[concentration camps]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to the east]], or were executed, including ÁVH founder [[László Rajk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tokes317&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawsoc&gt;{{Cite book| last=Gati | first=Charles | title=Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher=Stanford University Press |date=September 2006 | isbn=0-8047-5606-6 }} (page 49). Gati describes &quot;the most gruesome forms of psychological and physical torture&amp;nbsp;... The reign of terror (by the Rákosi government) turned out to be harsher and more extensive than it was in any of the other Soviet satellites in Central and Eastern Europe.&quot; He further references a report prepared after the collapse of communism, the Fact Finding Commission ''Törvénytelen szocializmus'' (Lawless Socialism): &quot;Between 1950 and early 1953, the courts dealt with 650,000 cases (of political crimes), of whom 387,000 or 4 percent of the population were found guilty. (Budapest, Zrínyi Kiadó/Új Magyarország, 1991, 154).&lt;/ref&gt; In a single year, more than 26,000 people were forcibly relocated from Budapest. As a consequence, jobs and housing were very difficult to obtain. The deportees generally experienced terrible living conditions and were interned as slave labor on [[collective farms]]. Many died as a result of poor living conditions and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt;

The Rákosi government thoroughly politicised Hungary's educational system to supplant the educated classes with a &quot;toiling intelligentsia&quot;.&lt;!--In February 1950, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party defined the supplantation of bourgeois leaders as its main goal. József Darvas, the Minister of Education and Religion from February 1950, wrote about secondary educational reforms in the pedagogical magazine ''Köznevelés'' (17 September 1950): &quot;The conversion of different grammar schools to industrial technical institutes, agricultural technical institutes, economical vocational high schools, and training-colleges for school teachers and kindergarten instructors tends to the success of the [[planned economy|five year plan]] by supplying many of the needed technicians.&quot; On 30 October 1950, new guidelines were set for the colleges and universities: Marxism-Leninism should be the main subject in all classes, and studying the [[Russian language]] became mandatory. By the end of 1951, 107 new course books were issued, 61 of which were translations of texts used in Soviet universities. The number of students had to be increased by an additional 30,000 over the next five years.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=[http://tortenelemszak.elte.hu/intezet/segtud/kardos.html Kardos, József] | authorlink=| title=Monograph  | journal=Iskolakultúra | volume=6–7 | issue=June–July 2003 | pages=73–80 | publisher=[[University of Pécs]] | year=2003 | url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00000/00011/00072/pdf/tan-konf-vita2003-6-7.pdf | accessdate=9 October 2006 |language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian language study and Communist political instruction were made mandatory in schools and universities nationwide.

The post-war Hungarian economy suffered from multiple challenges. Hungary agreed to pay [[war reparations]] approximating US$300 million to the Soviet Union, [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and to support Soviet garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;The Avalon Project at Yale Law School: [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/hungary.htm#art12 Armistice Agreement with Hungary; 20 January 1945].

In addition, Rákosi began his first Five-Year Plan in 1950-based on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s industrial program of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|same name]] that sought to raise industrial output by 380 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Litván 1996&quot;/&gt; Like its Soviet counterpart, the Five-Year Plan never achieved these outlandish goals due in part to the crippling effect of the exportation of most of Hungary's raw resources and technology to the Soviet Union as well as Rákosi's purges of much of the former professional class. In fact, the Five-Year Plan weakened Hungary's existing industrial structure and caused real industrial wages to fall by 18 percent between 1949 and 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Litván 1996&quot;/&gt; Rákosi's agricultural programs met with the same lack of success, with attempted collectivization of the peasantry causing a marked fall in agricultural output and a rise in food shortages.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Although national income per capita rose in the first third of the 1950s, the standard of living fell.

On 5 March 1953, [[Joseph Stalin]] died, ushering in a period of [[destalinization|moderate liberalization]], when most European communist parties developed a reform wing. In Hungary, the reformist [[Imre Nagy]] replaced Rákosi, &quot;Stalin's Best Hungarian Disciple&quot;, as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=János M.

On 14 May 1955, the Soviet Union created the [[Warsaw Pact]], binding Hungary to the Soviet Union and its [[satellite state]]s in Central and Eastern Europe.

In June 1956, [[Poznań 1956 protests|a violent uprising by Polish workers]] in [[Poznań]] was put down by the government, with scores of protesters killed and wounded. Responding to popular demand, in October 1956, the government appointed the recently [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitated]] reformist communist [[Władysław Gomułka]] as First Secretary of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], with a mandate to negotiate trade concessions and troop reductions with the Soviet government. After a few tense days of negotiations, on 19 October the Soviets finally gave in to Gomułka's reformist demands.&lt;ref name = satellite&gt;{{cite web| title = Notes from the Minutes of the CPSU CC Presidium Meeting with Satellite Leaders, 24 October 1956 | work = The 1956 Hungarian Revolution, A History in Documents | publisher = George Washington University: The National Security Archive | date = 4 November 2002 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc5.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the concessions won by the Poles, known as [[Polish October]], emboldened many Hungarians to hope for similar concessions for Hungary and these sentiments contributed significantly to the highly charged political climate that prevailed in Hungary in the second half of October 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machcewicz&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Within the [[Cold War]] context of the time, by 1956, a fundamental tension had appeared in US policy towards Hungary and the [[Eastern Bloc]] generally. The United States hoped to encourage European countries to break away from the bloc through their own efforts but wanted to avoid a US-Soviet military confrontation, as escalation might lead to [[nuclear war]]. For these reasons, US policy makers had to consider other means of diminishing Soviet influence in Eastern Europe, short of a [[rollback]] policy. This led to the development of [[containment]] policies such as economic and psychological warfare, covert operations, and, later, negotiation with the Soviet Union regarding the status of the Eastern states.&lt;ref name=&quot;BorhiContRoll&quot;/&gt; Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] had also argued to the National Security Council that it would serve US interests if the Soviet Union would turn on another uprising as they had in Poland, providing a source of anti-Communist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' by [[Tim Weiner]], page 145 (2008 Penguin Books edition)&lt;/ref&gt; However, while CIA director [[Allen Dulles]] had claimed he was creating an extensive network in Hungary, at the time the agency had no Hungarian station, almost no agents who spoke the language, and unreliable, corrupt local assets. The agency's own secret history would admit &quot;at no time did we have anything that could or should have been mistaken for an intelligence operation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashes page 149&quot;&gt;''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' by [[Tim Weiner]], page 149 (2008 Penguin Books edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1956, relations between Hungary and the US began to improve. At that time, the US responded very favourably to Hungary's overtures about a possible expansion of bilateral trade relations. Hungary's desire for better relations was partly attributable to the country's catastrophic economic situation. Before any results could be achieved, however, the pace of negotiations was slowed by the Hungarian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which feared that better relations with the West might weaken Communist rule in Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;BorhiContRoll&quot;/&gt;

===Social unrest builds===
Rákosi's resignation in July 1956 emboldened students, writers, and journalists to be more active and critical in politics. Students and journalists started a series of intellectual forums examining the problems facing Hungary. These forums, called [[Sándor Petőfi|Petőfi]] circles, became very popular and attracted thousands of participants.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter IX.

On 16 October 1956, university students in [[Szeged]] snubbed the official communist student union, the DISZ, by re-establishing the MEFESZ (Union of Hungarian University and Academy Students), a democratic student organization, previously banned under the Rákosi dictatorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crampton295&quot;/&gt; Within days, the student bodies of [[Pécs]], [[Miskolc]], and [[Sopron]] followed suit.

At about the same time, a large crowd gathered at the [[Radio Budapest]] building, which was heavily guarded by the ÁVH.

===Fighting spreads, government falls===

During the night of 23 October, Hungarian Working People's Party Secretary Ernő Gerő requested Soviet military intervention &quot;to suppress a demonstration that was reaching an ever greater and unprecedented scale.&quot;&lt;ref name = satellite/&gt; The Soviet leadership had formulated contingency plans for intervention in Hungary several months before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gati | first = Charles | title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher = Stanford University Press |date=September 2006 |isbn = 0-8047-5606-6 }} (page 160). Gati states: &quot;discovered in declassified documents, the Soviet Ministry of Defense had begun to prepare for large-scale turmoil in Hungary as early as July 1956. Codenamed &quot;Wave&quot;, the plan called for restoration of order in less than six hours&amp;nbsp;... the Soviet Army was ready. More than 30,000 troops were dispatched to—and 6,000 reached—Budapest by the 24th, that is, in less than a day.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; By 02:00 on 24 October, acting in accordance with orders of [[Georgy Zhukov]], the Soviet defence minister, Soviet tanks entered Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter II.C, para 58 (p. 20) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.47&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By noon, on 24 October, Soviet tanks were stationed outside the Parliament, and Soviet soldiers guarded key bridges and crossroads.

During this time, the Hungarian Army was divided as the central command structure disintegrated with the rising pressures from the protests on the government. The majority of Hungarian military units in Budapest and the countryside remained uninvolved, as the local commanders generally avoided using force against the protesters and revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lendvai 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lendvai|first=Paul|title=One Day That Shook the Communist World: The 1956 Hungarian Uprising and Its Legacy|year=2008|publisher=Princeton UP|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 24 to 29 October, however, there were 71 cases of armed clashes between the army and the populace in fifty communities, ranging from the defence of attacks on civilian and military objectives to fighting with insurgents depending on the commanding officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lendvai 2008&quot;/&gt;

Communists of Budapest neighbourhood [[Angyalföld]] led more than 350 armed workers and 380 servicemen from the Láng Factory. Anti-fascist resistance veterans from World War II participated in the offensive by which the ''Szabad Nép'' newspaper's building was recaptured. In the countryside, defence measures were taken by pro-Communist forces. In [[Békés County]], in and around the town of [[Szarvas]], the armed guards of the Communist Party were in control throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Berecz, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Hungarian resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s in the narrow streets of Budapest, [[Workers' council|revolutionary councils]] arose nationwide, assumed local governmental authority, and called for general strikes. Public Communist symbols such as [[red star]]s and Soviet war memorials were removed, and Communist books were burned. Spontaneous revolutionary militias arose, such as the 400-man group loosely led by [[József Dudás]], which attacked or murdered Soviet sympathisers and ÁVH members.&lt;ref&gt;Cold War International History Project (CWIHP), [http://legacy.wilsoncenter.org/va2/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=home.document&amp;identifier=824CD4FC-EA38-D85C-19E642C601751C1F KGB Chief Serov's report, 29 October 1956], (by permission of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars) Retrieved 8 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet units fought primarily in Budapest; elsewhere the countryside was largely quiet.

In some regions, Soviet forces managed to quell revolutionary activity. In Budapest, the Soviets were eventually fought to a stand-still and hostilities began to wane. Hungarian general [[Béla Király]], freed from a life sentence for political offences and acting with the support of the Nagy government, sought to restore order by unifying elements of the police, army and insurgent groups into a National Guard.&lt;ref name=ng&gt;{{Cite book|last = Gati| first = Charles| year = 2006| title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt (Cold War International History Project Series)| publisher = Stanford University Press| isbn = 0-8047-5606-6}} (pp. 176–177)&lt;/ref&gt; A ceasefire was arranged on 28 October, and by 30 October most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrisons in the Hungarian countryside.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter II.

The rapid spread of the uprising in the streets of Budapest and the abrupt fall of the Gerő-Hegedüs government left the new national leadership surprised, and at first disorganised. Nagy, a loyal party reformer described as possessing &quot;only modest political skills&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gati | first = Charles | title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher = Stanford University Press |date=September 2006 | isbn = 0-8047-5606-6 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially appealed to the public for calm and a return to the old order. Yet Nagy, the only remaining Hungarian leader with credibility in both the eyes of the public and the Soviets, &quot;at long last concluded that a popular uprising rather than a counter-revolution was taking place&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gati | first = Charles | title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher = Stanford University Press |date=September 2006 | isbn = 0-8047-5606-6 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 13:20 on 28 October, Nagy announced an immediate and general cease-fire over the radio and, on behalf of the new national government, declared the following:
*that the government would assess the uprising not as counter-revolutionary but as a &quot;great, national and democratic event&quot;
*an unconditional general ceasefire and amnesty for those who participated in the uprising; negotiations with the insurgents
*the dissolution of the ÁVH
*the establishment of a national guard
*the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from Budapest and negotiations for the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Hungary

On 24 October, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (the Politburo) discussed the political upheavals [[Polish October|in Poland]] and Hungary. A hard-line faction led by [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] was pushing for intervention, but Khrushchev and Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]] were initially opposed. A delegation in Budapest reported that the situation was not as dire as had been portrayed. Khrushchev stated that he believed that Party Secretary Ernő Gerő's request for intervention on 23 October indicated that the Hungarian Party still held the confidence of the Hungarian public. In addition, he saw the protests not as an ideological struggle, but as popular discontent over unresolved basic economic and social issues.&lt;ref name = satellite/&gt; The concurrent [[Suez Crisis]] was another reason to not intervene; as Khrushchev said on 28 October, it would be a mistake to imitate the &quot;real mess&quot; of the French and British.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastny200203&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stage-wilson.p2technology.com/sites/default/files/ACFB01.pdf | title=NATO in the Beholder's Eye:  Soviet Perceptions and Policies, 1949–56 | publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | work=Cold War International History Project | date=March 2002 | accessdate=6 May 2013 | author=Mastny, Vojtech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October the Soviet leaders decided to reverse their decision from the previous day.

Two days earlier, on 30 October, when Soviet Politburo representatives [[Anastas Mikoyan]] and [[Mikhail Suslov]] were in Budapest, Nagy had hinted that neutrality was a long-term objective for Hungary, and that he was hoping to discuss this matter with the leaders in the Kremlin. This information was passed on to Moscow by Mikoyan and Suslov.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kramer, [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/ACF19B.pdf &quot;New Evidence on Soviet Decision-making and the 1956 Polish and Hungarian Crises&quot; (PDF)], Cold War International History Project Bulletin, page 369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebestyen, Victor, ''Ungernrevolten 1956: Tolv dagar som skakade världen'' (2006), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Khrushchev was in Stalin's [[dacha]], considering his options regarding Hungary.

To disguise these intentions, Soviet diplomats were to engage the Nagy government in talks discussing the withdrawal of Soviet forces.&lt;ref name = presidium/&gt;

According to some sources, the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] played an important role in Khrushchev's decision to suppress the Hungarian uprising. Chinese Communist Party Deputy Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] pressured Khrushchev to send in troops to put down the revolt by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Short]], ''Mao: a life'' (2001), page 451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lewis Gaddis]], ''The Cold War: a new history'' (2005), page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the relations between China and the Soviet Union had deteriorated during the recent years, Mao's words still carried great weight in the Kremlin, and they were frequently in contact during the crisis. Initially, Mao opposed a second intervention, and this information was passed on to Khrushchev on 30 October, before the Presidium met and decided against intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Sebestyen, Victor, ''Ungernrevolten 1956: Tolv dagar som skakade världen'' (2006), p. 247. ISBN 91-518-4612-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao then changed his mind in favour of intervention but, according to [[William Taubman]], it remains unclear when and how Khrushchev learned of this and thus if it influenced his decision on 31 October.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Taubman]]: ''Khrushchev: The Man and His Era'' (2005), ISBN 978-0-7432-7564-4, page 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1 to 3 November, Khrushchev left Moscow to meet with his European allies and inform them of the decision to intervene. At the first such meeting, he met with [[Władysław Gomułka]] in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]]. Then, he had talks with the Romanian, Czechoslovak, and Bulgarian leaders in [[Bucharest]]. Finally Khrushchev flew with [[Malenkov]] to Yugoslavia, where they met with [[Josip Broz Tito]], who was on holiday on his island  [[Brijuni|Brioni]] in the Adriatic. The Yugoslavs also persuaded Khrushchev to choose [[János Kádár]] instead of [[Ferenc Münnich]] as the new leader of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kramer, [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/ACF19B.pdf &quot;New Evidence on Soviet Decision-making and the 1956 Polish and Hungarian Crises&quot; (PDF)], Cold War International History Project Bulletin, pages 373–374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slobodan Stankovic, [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/118-1-194.shtml &quot;Yugoslav Diplomat who Defied Soviet Leaders Dies&quot;], Radio Free Europe Research, 5 August 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after the Soviet crackdown, Tito confided in Nikolai Firiubin, the Soviet ambassador to Yugoslavia, that &quot;the reaction raised its head, especially in Croatia, where the reactionary elements openly incited the employees of the Yugoslav security organs to violence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Granville, ''[https://www.academia.edu/23951275/The_First_Domino_International_Decision_making_during_the_Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 The First Domino: International Decision Making During the Hungarian Crisis of 1956.]'' Texas A &amp; M University Press, 2004 (page 103).&lt;/ref&gt;

====International reaction====
Although [[John Foster Dulles]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] recommended on 24 October for the [[United Nations Security Council]] to convene to discuss the situation in Hungary, little immediate action was taken to introduce a resolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Csaba Békés | title = The Hungarian Question on the UN Agenda: Secret Negotiations by the Western Great Powers 26 October–4 November 1956. (British Foreign Office Documents) | journal=Hungarian Quarterly | date=Spring 2000 | url =http://www.rev.hu/portal/page/portal/rev/tanulmanyok/1956/hungquest|accessdate = 7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in part because other world events unfolded the day after the peaceful interlude started, when [[Protocol of Sèvres|allied collusion]] started the [[Suez Crisis]]. The problem was not that Suez distracted US attention from Hungary but that it made the condemnation of Soviet actions very difficult. As Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] later explained, &quot;We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against [Gamel Abdel] [[Nasser]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BorhiContRoll&quot;/&gt;

The US response was reliant on the CIA to covertly effect change, with both covert agents and [[Radio Free Europe]]. However, their Hungarian operations collapsed rapidly and they could not locate any of the weapon caches hidden across Europe, nor be sure who they'd send arms too. The agency's main source of information were the newspapers and a State Department employee in Budapest called Geza Katona.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashes page 149&quot;/&gt; By 28 October, on the same night that the new Nagy government came to power, RFE was ramping up its broadcasts – encouraging armed struggle, advising on how to combat tanks and signing off with &quot;Freedom or Death!&quot; – on the orders of [[Frank Wisner]]. When Nagy did come to power, CIA director Allen Dulles advised the White House that [[József Mindszenty|Cardinal Mindszenty]] would be a better leader (due to Nagy's communist past); he had CIA radio broadcasts run propaganda against Nagy, calling him a traitor who'd invited Soviet troops in. Broadcasts continued to broadcast armed response while the CIA mistakenly believed that the Hungarian army was switching sides and the rebels were gaining arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashes page 150&quot;&gt;''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' by [[Tim Weiner]], page 150 to 151 (2008 Penguin Books edition)&lt;/ref&gt; (Wisner was recorded as having a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; by [[William Colby]] as the uprising was crushed&lt;ref&gt;''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' by [[Tim Weiner]], page 153(2008 Penguin Books edition)&lt;/ref&gt;)
[[File:1956 november 5. Eindhoven.jpg|thumb|left|March to support Hungary in Eindhoven, 5 November 1956]]
Responding to the plea by Nagy at the time of the second massive Soviet intervention on 4 November, the Security Council resolution critical of Soviet actions was vetoed by the Soviet Union; instead [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 120|resolution 120 was adopted]] to pass the matter onto the General Assembly. The General Assembly, by a vote of 50 in favour, 8 against and 15 abstentions, called on the Soviet Union to end its Hungarian intervention, but the newly constituted Kádár government rejected UN observers.&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Revolt, 23 October–4 November 1956 (Richard Lettis and William I.

===Soviet intervention of 4 November===
[[File:1956-11-01 War in Egypt.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2:39|start=2:39|1 November newsreel about the situation in Hungary]]
On 1 November, Imre Nagy received reports that Soviet forces had entered Hungary from the east and were moving towards Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{cite web|url= http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf |title=Chapter VIII.D, para 336 (p. 103) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.47&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagy sought and received assurances (which proved false) from Soviet ambassador [[Yuri Andropov]] that the Soviet Union would not invade. The Cabinet, with János Kádár in agreement, declared Hungary's neutrality, withdrew from the Warsaw Pact, and requested assistance from the diplomatic corps in Budapest and the [[Dag Hammarskjöld|UN Secretary-General]] to defend Hungary's neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/collections/colltopic.cfm?lng=en&amp;id=20933&amp;navinfo=15697 Imre Nagy's Telegram to Diplomatic Missions in Budapest Declaring Hungary's Neutrality (1 November 1956)] by permission of the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zürich and the National Security Archive at the George Washington University on behalf of the PHP network&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Andropov was asked to inform his government that Hungary would begin negotiations on the removal of Soviet forces immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Andropov Report, 1 November 1956 | publisher = Cold War International History Project (CWIHP), www.CWIHP.org, by permission of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | url = http://legacy.wilsoncenter.org/va2/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=home.document&amp;identifier=82699F97-EC4B-54BD-C4D29366EA294161 | accessdate = 4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Minutes of the Nagy Government's Fourth Cabinet Meeting, 1 November 1956 | work = The 1956 Hungarian Revolution, A History in Documents | publisher = George Washington University: The National Security Archive |date = 4 November 2002 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc7.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November, a Hungarian delegation led by the Minister of Defense [[Pál Maléter]] were invited to attend negotiations on Soviet withdrawal at the Soviet Military Command at [[Pest (county)|Tököl]], near Budapest.

At 03:00 on 4 November, Soviet tanks penetrated Budapest along the [[Pest (city)|Pest]] side of the Danube in two thrusts: one up the Soroksári road from the south and the other down the Váci road from the north. Thus before a single shot was fired, the Soviets had effectively split the city in half, controlled all bridgeheads, and were shielded to the rear by the wide Danube river. Armoured units crossed into [[Buda]] and at 04:25 fired the first shots at the army barracks on Budaörsi Road. Soon after, Soviet artillery and tank fire was heard in all districts of Budapest.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN report 5C p196&quot; /&gt; Operation Whirlwind combined air strikes, artillery, and the co-ordinated tank-infantry action of 17 divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Györkei | first = Jenõ | author2 = Kirov, Alexandr|author3=Horvath, Miklos| title = Soviet Military Intervention in Hungary, 1956 | publisher = Central European University Press | year = 1999 | location = New York

Between 4 and 9 November, the [[Hungarian Ground Forces|Hungarian Army]] put up sporadic and disorganised resistance, with Marshal Zhukov reporting the disarming of twelve divisions, two armoured regiments, and the entire Hungarian Air Force. The Hungarian Army continued its most formidable resistance in various districts of Budapest and in and around the city of [[Pécs]] in the [[Mecsek|Mecsek Mountains]], and in the industrial centre of [[Dunaújváros]] (then called Stalintown).

===Soviet version of the events===
Soviet reports of the events surrounding, during, and after the disturbance were remarkably consistent in their accounts, more so after the Second Soviet intervention cemented support for the Soviet position among international Communist Parties. [[Pravda]] published an account 36 hours after the outbreak of violence, which set the tone for all further reports and subsequent Soviet historiography:&lt;ref name=Barghoorn_SFP /&gt;
# On 23 October, the honest socialist Hungarians demonstrated against mistakes made by the [[Mátyás Rákosi|Rákosi]] and [[Ernő Gerő|Gerő]] governments.
# Fascist, Hitlerite, reactionary, counter-revolutionary hooligans financed by the imperialist West took advantage of the unrest to stage a counter-revolution.
# The honest Hungarian people under Nagy appealed to Soviet (Warsaw Pact) forces stationed in Hungary to assist in restoring order.
# The Nagy government was ineffective, allowing itself to be penetrated by counter-revolutionary influences, weakening then disintegrating, as proven by Nagy's culminating denouncement of the Warsaw Pact.
# Hungarian patriots under [[János Kádár|Kádár]] broke with the Nagy government and formed a government of honest Hungarian revolutionary workers and peasants; this genuinely popular government petitioned the Soviet command to help put down the counter-revolution.
# Hungarian patriots, with Soviet assistance, smashed the counter-revolution.
The first Soviet report came out 24 hours after the first Western report. Nagy's appeal to the United Nations was not reported. After Nagy was arrested outside of the Yugoslav embassy, his arrest was not reported. Nor did accounts explain how Nagy went from patriot to traitor.&lt;ref&gt;Pravda (Moscow), 4 November [227/228]: &quot;Without the Slightes Delays&quot;, Moscow&lt;br /&gt;
Imre Nagy turned out to be, objectively speaking, an accomplice of the reactionary forces. Imre Nagy cannot and does not want to fight the dark forces of reaction&amp;nbsp;...
The Soviet Government, seeing that the presence of Soviet troops in Budapest might lead to further aggravation of the situation, ordered troops to leave Budapest, but ensuing events have shown that reactionary forces, taking advantage of the non-intervention of the Nagy Cabinet, have gone still further&amp;nbsp;...

In January 1957, representatives of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania met in Budapest to review internal developments in Hungary since the establishment of the Soviet-imposed government.

Critical opposition attitudes were described as &quot;a plot to overthrow the people's democratic regime&quot;, and workers and peasants who took part in the revolt were called &quot;jailbirds, ragamuffins, and kulaks.&quot; Armed resistance to occupying forces became &quot;murder and wrecking state property.&quot; This kind of terminology became part of the official ideology of the regime toward the outside world.&quot; Also p. 375, footnote 40: &quot;For a typical survey of propaganda intended for distribution abroad, see the so called &quot;White Books&quot; entitled ''The Counter-Revolutionary Forces in the October Events in Hungary'', 4 vols., (Budapest: Information Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, 1956–1957)&amp;nbsp;...

In the immediate aftermath, many thousands of Hungarians were arrested. Eventually, 26,000 of these were brought before the Hungarian courts, 22,000 were sentenced and imprisoned, 13,000 interned, and 229 executed. Hundreds were also deported to the Soviet Union, many without evidence.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Approximately 200,000&lt;ref&gt;Casardi, A.

Despite Cold War rhetoric by western countries espousing a roll-back of the domination of Europe by the USSR and Soviet promises of the imminent triumph of socialism, national leaders of this period as well as later historians saw the failure of the uprising in Hungary as evidence that the Cold War in Europe had become a stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;Johns Hopkins University Professor Charles Gati, in his book ''Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt'' (see Further reading, below), agreed with a 2002 essay by Hungarian historian Csaba Bekes, &quot;Could the Hungarian Revolution Have Been Victorious in 1956?&quot;. Gati states: &quot;Washington implicitly acknowledging the division of the continent into two camps, understood that Moscow would not let go of a country bordering on neutral but pro-Western Austria and an independent Yugoslavia, so it shed&amp;nbsp;... tears over Soviet brutality, and exploited the propaganda opportunities&amp;nbsp;...&quot; (p. 208)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1957, these contributions, distributed by the Geneva-based [[International Red Cross]] as food rations, clothing, and other essentials, had amounted to some [[Swiss franc|SFR]] 26 million (US$6 million in 1957 dollars), the equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6000000|1957|r=-5}}}} in today's dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US}} On 1 March 2011, [[István Tarlós]], the [[Mayor of Budapest]], made Presley an honorary citizen, posthumously, and a plaza located at the intersection of two of the city's most important avenues was named after Presley, as a gesture of gratitude.

Meanwhile, as the 1950s drew to a close, the events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the Communist parties of Western Europe. Within the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) a split ensued: most ordinary members and the Party leadership, including [[Palmiro Togliatti]] and [[Giorgio Napolitano]], regarded the Hungarian insurgents as counter-revolutionaries, as reported in ''[[l'Unità]]'', the official PCI newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;The following are references in English on the conflicting positions of [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808752,00.html ''l'Unità''], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808824,00.html Antonio Giolitti and party boss Palmiro Togliatti], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868066,00.html Giuseppe Di Vittorio] and [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219206/socialism Pietro Nenni].&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Giuseppe Di Vittorio]], chief of the Communist trade union [[CGIL]], repudiated the leadership position, as did the prominent party members [[Antonio Giolitti]], [[Loris Fortuna]], and many other influential Communist intellectuals, who later were expelled or left the party. [[Pietro Nenni]], the national secretary of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], a close ally of the PCI, opposed the Soviet intervention as well. Napolitano, elected in 2006 as [[President of the Italian Republic]], wrote in his 2005 political autobiography that he regretted his justification of Soviet action in Hungary, and that at the time he believed in Party unity and the international leadership of Soviet communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Napolitano | first = Giorgio | year = 2005 | title = Dal Pci al socialismo europeo. Un'autobiografia politica (From the Communist Party to European Socialism. A political autobiography) | publisher = Laterza | location = | language = Italian|isbn = 88-420-7715-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), dissent that began with the repudiation of Stalin by [[John Saville]] and [[E. P. Thompson]], influential historians and members of the [[Communist Party Historians Group]], culminated in a loss of thousands of party members as events unfolded in Hungary. [[Peter Fryer]], correspondent for the CPGB newspaper ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|The Daily Worker]]'', reported accurately on the violent suppression of the uprising, but his dispatches were heavily censored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fryer&quot;/&gt; Fryer resigned from the paper upon his return, and was later expelled from the Communist Party

In France, moderate Communists, such as historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], resigned, questioning the [[French Communist Party]]'s policy of supporting Soviet actions. The French philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] wrote an [[open letter]], ''[[The Blood of the Hungarians]]'', criticising the West's lack of action. Even [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], still a determined Communist, criticised the Soviets in his article ''Le Fantôme de Staline'', in ''Situations VII''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul (1956), [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-21/2005-06-21-809020 L'intellectuel et les communistes français {{fr icon}}] Le Web de l'Humanite, 21 June 2005. Retrieved 24 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left Communists]] were particularly supportive of the revolution.

===Commemoration===
[[File:Budapešť, Hösök tére, pamětní deska 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Memorial plaque at the [[Embassy of Serbia, Budapest]] in memory of [[Imre Nagy]] who found a sanctuary there during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]
In December 1991, the preamble of the treaties with the dismembered Soviet Union, under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and Russia, represented by [[Boris Yeltsin]], apologised officially for the 1956 Soviet actions in Hungary. This apology was repeated by Yeltsin in 1992 during a speech to the Hungarian parliament.&lt;ref name = cnn/&gt;

On 13 February 2006, the [[US State Department]] commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] commented on the contributions made by 1956 Hungarian refugees to the United States and other host countries, as well as the [[German reunification|role of Hungary]] in providing refuge to East Germans during the 1989 protests against Communist rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = US State Department Commemorates the 1956 Hungarian Revolution | publisher = American Hungarian Federation | date = 13 February 2006 | url = http://www.americanhungarianfederation.org/news_1956_StateDepartment_Reception_2006-02-13.htm|accessdate = 8 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States of America|US]] President [[George W. Bush]] also visited Hungary on 22 June 2006, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Hungary a Model for Iraq, Bush Says in Budapest | publisher = International Information Programs | date = 22 June 2006 | url = http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/June/200606221431051CJsamohT0.2036402.html | accessdate = 14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 1989, the 31st anniversary of his execution, Imre Nagy's body was reburied with full honours.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCJune16&quot;/&gt; The Republic of Hungary was declared in 1989 on the 33rd anniversary of the Revolution, and 23 October is now a Hungarian [[Public holiday|national holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = National Symbols | work = Fact Sheets on Hungary | publisher = Ministry of Foreign Affairs | year = 2003 | url = http://www.mfa.gov.hu/NR/rdonlyres/98D131BF-BFB4-4545-B9BE-BAB02F71A1D9/0/National_Symbols.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north-west corner of [[MacArthur Park]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], the Hungarian-American community built a commemorative statue to honour the Hungarian freedom fighters. Built in the late 1960s, the obelisk statue stands with an American eagle watching over the city of Los Angeles.
