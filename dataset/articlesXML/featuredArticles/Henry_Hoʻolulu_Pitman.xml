'''Timothy Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman''' (March 18, 1845 – February 27, 1863) was an American [[Union Army]] soldier of [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] descent. Considered one of the &quot;Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War&quot;, he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants who fought in the [[American Civil War]] while the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] was still an independent nation.

Born and raised in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo, Hawaiʻi]], he was the eldest son of [[Kinooleoliliha|Kinoʻoleoliliha]], a Hawaiian high chiefess, and [[Benjamin Pitman (Hawaii)|Benjamin Pitman]], an American pioneer settler from [[Massachusetts]]. Through his father's business success in the whaling and sugar and coffee plantation industries and his mother's familial connections to the Hawaiian royal family, the Pitmans were quite prosperous and owned lands on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaiʻi]] and in [[Honolulu]]. He and his older sister were educated in the mission schools in Hilo alongside other children of mixed Hawaiian descent. After the death of his mother in 1855, his father remarried to the widow of a missionary, thus connecting the family to the American missionary community in Hawaiʻi. However, following the deaths of his first wife and later his second wife, his father decided to leave the islands and returned to Massachusetts with his family around 1860. He continued his education in the public schools of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], where the Pitman family lived for a period of time.

Leaving school without his family's knowledge, he made the decision to fight in the Civil War in August 1862. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian recruits of the time and enlisted in the [[22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]], a white regiment. He served as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Union Army fighting in the [[Battle of Antietam]] and the [[Maryland Campaign]]. In his company, Private [[Robert G. Carter]] befriended the part-Hawaiian soldier and wrote in later life of their common experience in the 22nd Massachusetts. Compiled decades afterward from old letters, Carter's account described the details surrounding his final fate in the war. On the march to [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], Pitman was separated from his regiment and captured by Confederate guerrilla forces. He was forced to march to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and incarcerated in the Confederate [[Libby Prison]], where he contracted &quot;lung fever&quot; from the harsh conditions of his imprisonment and died on February&amp;nbsp;27, 1863, a few months after his release on parole in a prisoner exchange. Modern historians consider Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman to be the only known Hawaiian or [[Pacific Islander]] to die as a prisoner of war in the Civil War.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=146–149}}{{sfn|Grzyb|2016|pages=127–128}}

For a period of time after the end of the war, the legacy and contributions of Pitman and other documented Hawaiian participants in the American Civil War were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians. However, there has been a revival of interest in recent years in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, these &quot;Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War&quot; were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in Honolulu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cole|first=William|title=Native Hawaiians served on both sides during Civil War|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2010/May/31/ln/hawaii5310346.html|date=May 31, 2010|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|location=Honolulu|publisher=Oahu Publications, Inc.|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=146–149}}

Because of his father's success in business and his mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the Pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo.{{sfn|Pitman|1931||page=20}}{{sfn|Kanahele|1999|page=76}} Besides being one of the leading merchants in town, his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Henry's mother, Kinoʻole, had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa from her own father, and King [[Kamehameha III]] had granted her use of the ''[[ahupuaa|ahupuaʻa]]'' of Hilo after her marriage.{{sfn|Pitman|1931||page=20}} During Henry's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840, in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort spots of [[ancient Hawaii]]an royalty. The residence also became known as the Spencer House after Pitman sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer.{{#tag:ref|During the [[American Civil War]], Captain Thomas Spencer personally funded and drilled a company of infantry composed mostly of [[Native Hawaiians]] from Hilo. These volunteers, dubbed the &quot;Spencer's Invincibles&quot;, offered their services to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. However, in order to avert diplomatic controversy and in defense of the Hawaiʻi's neutrality, King [[Kamehameha IV]] and Minister [[Robert Crichton Wyllie]] officially denied permission for the men to go as a unit.{{sfn|Dye|1997||page=77}}{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015a|pages=134–135}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Vance&amp;Manning&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon1941&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Damon|first=Ethel M.|title=Punahou Volunteers of 1863|newspaper=The Friend|location=Honolulu|publisher=|date=April 1, 1941|volume=CXI|issue=4|page=67|url=http://server.honstudios.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&amp;d=Friend19410401-01.2.5&amp;cl|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Captain Spencer heard the news, he reportedly burst into tears.{{sfn|Daws|1968||page=183}}|group=note}} The property later became the site of the Hilo Hotel, built in 1888 and torn down in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;FiftyYears&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|1997|pages=208–213}}; {{harvnb|Pierce|1956|pages=20–30}}; {{cite news|title=Returning Home After Fifty Years|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|location=Honolulu|publisher=Oahu Publications, Inc.|date=December 26, 1916|volume=XXIV|issue=7707|page=9|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014682/1916-12-26/ed-1/seq-9/|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|During a trip to Hawaiʻi in 1917, Almira Hollander Pitman, his sister-in-law, wrote &quot;The hotel in Hilo is the old home of the Pitmans, and Dad [Benjamin Keolaokalani Franklin Pitman] remembered it all.

==Education==
[[File:Mary Ann and Henry Hoolulu Pitman.jpg|thumbnail|right|225px|Portrait of Henry and his sister Mary at the [[Peabody Essex Museum]]]]
While in Hawaiʻi, Pitman and his older sister Mary attended Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Wetmore's children's school in Hilo. The school was located at the Wetmores' residence on Church Street. Taught by Lucy Sheldon Taylor Wetmore, the wife of American missionary doctor and government physician Charles Hinckley Wetmore, the two elder Pitman children received their education in English rather than Hawaiian. This was unusual since Hawaiian was the official language of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, and all other schools in Hilo were conducted in the Hawaiian language. Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Wetmore taught the children reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and singing, while also reinforcing the curriculum with a strong adherence to the principles of the [[Protestantism|Protestant faith]]. Like the Pitman siblings, many of their classmates were also of half-Hawaiian (''hapa-kanaka'') descent with a majority of them being [[Chinese immigration to Hawaii|Chinese-Hawaiians]] (''hapa-pake'').{{sfn|Kai|1974|pages=62–64}}{{sfn|Merry|2000|pages=174–175}}

After the death of his mother Kinoʻole in 1855, Pitman's father remarried to Maria Louisa Walsworth Kinney, the widow of American missionary Rev. Henry Kinney. The Kinneys were part of the Twelfth Company of missionaries from the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] to arrive in 1848. The marriage aligned the Pitman children with the American missionary community. They were called &quot;cousins&quot; by the children of the missionaries and considered part of the extended missionary family of Hawaiʻi.{{sfn|Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|1863|page=35}}{{sfn|Manning|Vance|2014|pages=161–162}}{{sfn|Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|1901|pages=86, 88}}
This first stepmother died in 1858 after giving birth to their father's fourth child, a daughter named Maria Kinoʻole (1858–1892).{{sfn|Walworth|1897|page=96}}{{sfn|Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|1901|page=88}} The Pitman family returned to Massachusetts in 1860 where his father remarried to his third wife Martha Ball, giving his four children another stepmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;HiloTribune&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LeavingHI&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pitman|1931||page=21}}; {{harvnb|Merry|2000|page=156}}; {{cite news|last=Wood|first=Ben|title=Museum given manuscript of early Hilo businessman|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|location=Honolulu|publisher=Oahu Publications, Inc.|date=March 17, 2007|volume=12|issue=76|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/03/17/features/wood.html|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to an 1887 biography written by [[Robert G. Carter]], a private who would later serve in the same company as Pitman, he was neglected after his mother's death by his father and stepmother, who &quot;subjected [him] to neglect and treatment, that with his sensitive nature he could not bear&quot;.{{sfn|Parker|Carter|1887|pages=215–216}} He continued his education in the public schools of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], where the Pitman family lived for a period of time.{{sfn|Carter|1897|pages=139–142}}{{sfn|Carter|1913|pages=139–142}} The [[1860 United States Census]] registered Pitman under his teacher Solomon Adams as residing and presumably being educated in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], also in the Boston area.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCensus1860&quot;/&gt;

Growing into adolescence, he was said to strongly resemble his Hawaiian mother.{{sfn|Parker|Carter|1887|pages=215–216}} Robert G. Carter gave a brief description of his appearance in wartime letters first published in 1897:{{#tag:ref|The description, along with one of the only detailed accounts of Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman's service in the Civil War, was originally written in a letter by an unnamed member of the artillery unit of the 22nd Regiment.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=146–149}} [[Robert G. Carter]] compiled this and other letters in the 1870s. It was first published serially in the ''Maine Bugle'' from 1896 to 1898. In 1913 Carter published the whole work in his book ''Four Brothers in Blue, Or, Sunshine and Shadows of the War of the Rebellion: A Story of the Great Civil War from Bull Run to Appomattox.''{{sfn|Carter|1913|pages=vii, 204–206}}|group=note}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] tall, slim boy, straight as an arrow. His face was a perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, and his eyes were large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness,{{#tag:ref|His enlistment card indicated he had &quot;hazel&quot; or &quot;gray&quot; colored eyes.&lt;ref name=NARA&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlistment Records for Timothy H.

His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.{{sfn|Carter|1897|pages=139–142}}{{sfn|Carter|1913|pages=139–142}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==American Civil War==
After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] under King [[Kamehameha IV]] declared its neutrality on August&amp;nbsp;26, 1861.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1953|pages=57–66}}{{sfn|Forbes|2001|pages=298–299}} But many [[Native Hawaiian]]s and Hawaiian-born Americans (mainly descendants of the American missionaries) both abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].{{sfn|Grzyb|2016|pages=127–128}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon1941&quot;/&gt; Individual Native Hawaiians had been serving in the United States Navy and Army since the [[War of 1812]], and even more served during the American Civil War.{{sfn|Schmitt|1998|pages=171–172}} Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties to [[New England]] through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vance&amp;Manning&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Manning|Vance|2014|pages=145–170}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2013&quot;/&gt;

===Enlistment and service===

On August 14, 1862, Pitman left school without his family's knowledge and volunteered to serve in the [[Union Army]] and fight in the American Civil War.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=146–149}} He apparently never informed his family in advance about the choice to join the war because the news of his enlistment was reported back in Hawaiʻi's American missionary community as &quot;Henry Pitman has run away from home and gone [to war].&quot;{{sfn|Manning|Vance|2014|pages=161–162}} Carter described Pitman's rationale for enlisting: &quot;In the midst of the clamor of war, when the very air vibrated with excitement, the wild enthusiasm of the crowds, and the inspiring sound of the drum, his Indian nature rose within him. His resolve was made.&quot;{{sfn|Parker|Carter|1887|pages=215–216}}{{sfn|Carter|1897|pages=139–142}}{{sfn|Carter|1913|pages=139–142}}

Pitman was a ''[[Hapa|hapa-haole]]'', of part Hawaiian and part Caucasian descent.{{#tag:ref|Specifically, he was 3/8 Hawaiian and 5/8 Caucasian.|group=note}} His father was white and his native-born mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who was the daughter of Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess.{{sfn|McKinzie|1983|pages=46–47}}{{sfn|Kai|1974|pages=62–64}} Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to [[United States Colored Troops|colored regiments]], but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=146–149}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Vance&amp;Manning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vance|first1=Justin W.|last2=Manning|first2=Anita|title=The Effects of the American Civil War on Hawaiʻi and the Pacific World|journal=World History Connected|volume=9|issue=3|year=October 2012|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=University of Illinois|url=http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/9.3/vance.html|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|During the war, [[Samuel C.

The most detailed account of Pitman's final fate in the War came from Robert G. Carter.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=146–149}} In November 1862, Pitman was captured near [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton Junction]] on the march toward [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], during the weeks prior to the Battle of Fredericksburg. He had fallen behind the group because his feet had blistered and swollen due to the tightness of &quot;a pair of thin, high-heeled and narrow soled boots&quot; he had purchased. One of his comrades temporarily stayed behind to care for him but later decided to move on with the rest of the camp for fear of disciplinary consequences of falling out without authority. He was urged to move on, but without much success. Pitman's last words to his comrade were, &quot;I will be in camp by night, good by.&quot; His fellow soldiers never saw him again and considered him missing. Shortly after he was left, a band of Confederate guerrillas under Colonel [[John S. Mosby]] captured the weary and defenseless soldier without a struggle.{{sfn|Parker|Carter|1887|pages=215–216}}{{sfn|Carter|1897|pages=139–142}}{{sfn|Carter|1913|pages=139–142}} The inscription on his tombstone differs slightly from Carter's account, stating he was captured by [[J.

After Pitman's capture, he was marched to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in a weak physical state. He was imprisoned in the Confederate [[Libby Prison]] and [[Belle Isle (Richmond, Virginia)|Belle Isle]], which were notoriously harsh prisons.

After his death, the memory of Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman was honored by friends and family members back in Massachusetts and Hawaiʻi. During a return to Hawaiʻi in 1917, his younger brother Benjamin Keolaokalani Franklin Pitman and his wife Almira Hollander Pitman, discovered a grandson of a nephew was named Kealiʻi i Kaua i Pakoma (meaning &quot;Chief that fought the Potomac&quot;) in honor of his deceased older brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potomac&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F.

After the war, the military service of Hawaiians, including Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman, were largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective memories of the American Civil War and the history of Hawaiʻi. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents and historians and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember &quot;our boys from Hawaii&quot;.
