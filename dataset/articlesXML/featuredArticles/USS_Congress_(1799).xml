'''USS ''Congress''''' was a nominally rated 38-gun wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed, three-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] [[heavy frigate]] of the [[United States Navy]]. She was named by [[George Washington]] to reflect a principal of the [[United States Constitution]]. [[James Hackett (shipbuilder)|James Hackett]] built her in Portsmouth New Hampshire and she was launched on 15 August 1799. She was one of the [[original six frigates of the United States Navy|original six frigates]] whose construction the [[Naval Act of 1794]] had authorized. [[Joshua Humphreys]] designed these frigates to be the young Navy's [[capital ship]]s, and so ''Congress'' and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than the standard frigates of the period.

Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the [[Quasi War]] with France and to defeat the [[Barbary pirates]] in the [[First Barbary War]]. During the [[War of 1812]] she made several extended length cruises in company with her [[sister ship]] {{USS|President|1800|2}} and captured, or assisted in the capture of twenty British merchant ships. At the end of 1813, due to a lack of materials to repair her, she was placed [[Reserve fleet|in ordinary]] for the remainder of the war. In 1815 she returned to service for the [[Second Barbary War]] and made patrols through 1816. In the 1820s she helped suppress piracy in the West Indies, made several voyages to South America, and was the first U.S. warship to visit China. ''Congress'' spent her last ten years of service as a [[receiving ship]] until ordered broken up in 1834.

==Construction==
{{main|Original six frigates of the United States Navy}}

In 1785 [[Barbary corsairs|Barbary pirates]], most notably from [[Algiers]], began to seize American [[merchant vessel]]s in the Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the [[Naval Act of 1794]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen4142&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach2627&quot;&gt;Beach (1986), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The act provided funds to construct [[Original six frigates of the United States Navy|six frigates]], but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers, the construction of the ships would be halted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach29&quot;&gt;Beach (1986), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=&quot;NA1794&quot;&gt;''An Act to provide a Naval Armament''. {{USStat|1|350}} (1794). [[Library of Congress]]. Retrieved 17 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joshua Humphreys]]' design was unusual for the time, being long on [[keel]] and narrow of [[beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and mounting very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal [[scantling]] (rib) scheme intended to restrict [[hogging and sagging|hogging]] while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states in the size of their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a [[ship of the line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll4953&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), pp. 49–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach2930&quot;&gt;Beach (1986), pp. 29–30, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen4245&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Congress'' was given her name by President [[George Washington]] after a principle of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll61&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Her keel was reportedly laid down late in 1795&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen47&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; at a shipyard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. James Hackett was charged with her construction and Captain James Sever served as a superintendent. Her construction proceeded slowly and was completely suspended when in March 1796, a peace treaty was signed with Algiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHFQW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Reestablishment of the Navy, 1787–1801: Historical Overview of the Federalist Navy

The Naval Act of 1794 had specified 36-gun frigates. However, ''Congress'' and her sister-ship {{USS|Constellation|1797|2}} were re-rated to 38s because of their large dimensions, being {{convert|164|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[length between perpendiculars|in length]] and {{convert|41|ft|m|abbr=on}} in width.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapelle128&quot;&gt;Chapelle (1949), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach32&quot;&gt;Beach (1986), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Chapelle states ''Congress'' and ''Constellation'' were re-rated to 38s during construction by Humphreys because of their large dimensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapelle128&quot;/&gt; Canney references Chapelle when rating ''Congress'' a 38-gun frigate, but also questions &quot;...&amp;nbsp;exactly what Humphreys had in mind with rating these ships as 44- or 36-gun frigates when the number of ports certainly did not correspond to the rating and, in fact, the ships rarely carried their rated batteries, reflecting contemporary European practice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canney&quot;&gt;Canney (2001), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Beach states that Secretary of the Navy [[Benjamin Stoddert]] re-rated ''Congress'' and ''Constellation'' to 38s once he compared the dimensions of the two ships with the recently completed ''Chesapeake'', which had been reduced in size from a 44 to the extent that she was smaller.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach32&quot;/&gt;|name=rating|group=Note}}

The &quot;ratings&quot; by number of guns were meant only as an approximation, and ''Congress'' often carried up to 48 guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy53&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns such as modern Navy ships carry. The guns and cannons were designed to be completely portable and often were exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer outfitted armaments to their liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, the armaments on ships would change often during their careers, and records of the changes were not generally kept.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jennings&quot;&gt;Jennings (1966), pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her first cruise in the Quasi-War against France, ''Congress'' was noted to be armed with a battery of forty guns consisting of twenty-eight {{convert|18|pdr|kg|0}} and twelve {{convert|9|pdr|kg|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canney&quot;/&gt; For her patrols during the War of 1812, she was armed with a battery of forty-four guns consisting of twenty-four 18&amp;nbsp;pounders and twenty {{convert|32|pdr|kg}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canney&quot;/&gt;

==Quasi-War==

''Congress'' launched on 15 August 1799 under the command of Captain Sever. After [[fitting-out]] in Rhode Island, she set off on her [[maiden voyage]] 6 January 1800 sailing in company with [[USS Essex (1799)|''Essex'']] to escort merchant ships to the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=Essex|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/e/essex-i.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|link=off}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll136&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper133&quot;&gt;Cooper (1856), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Without the full support of the rigging, all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying to repair the main mast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen151152&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmith191&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898) Volume 1, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew rigged an emergency sail and limped back to the [[Gosport Navy Yard]] for repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen153&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, some of Sever's junior officers announced that they had no confidence in his ability as a commanding officer. A hearing was held, and Captain Sever was cleared of any wrongdoing and remained in command of ''Congress'', though many of his crew soon transferred out to {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen153&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll139&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining in port for six months while her masts and rigging were repaired, she finally sailed again on 26 July for the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris120&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Congress'' made routine patrols escorting American merchant ships and seeking out French ships to capture. On two occasions she almost ran aground; first while pursuing a French [[privateer]], she ran into shallow water where large rocks were seen near the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmith191&quot;/&gt; Although their exact depth was not determined, Sever immediately abandoned pursuit of the privateer and changed course towards deeper waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris121&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Her second close call occurred off the coast of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Caicos Islands]], when during the night she drifted close to the reefs.

A [[Convention of 1800|peace treaty]] with France was ratified on 3 February 1801 and ''Congress'' returned to Boston in April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen221&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with an act of Congress passed on 3 March and signed by President [[John Adams]], thirteen frigates then currently in service were to be retained. Seven of those frigates, including ''Congress'', were to be placed [[Reserve fleet|in ordinary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen255&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; En route to the [[Washington Navy Yard]], she passed [[Mount Vernon]] on her way up the Potomac and Captain Sever ordered her sails lowered, flag at half mast, and a 13-gun salute fired to honor the recently deceased George Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen258&quot;&gt;Allen (1909), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Congress'' decommissioned at Washington along with {{USS|United States|1797|2}} and {{USS|New York|1800|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen258&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnitedStates&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=United States|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/u/united-states-frigate.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|link=off}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New York&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=New York|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/new-york-ii.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|link=off}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the United States' preoccupation with France during the Quasi-War, troubles with the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary States]] were suppressed by the payment of [[tribute]] to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmith215216&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 [[Yusuf Karamanli]] of [[Tripoli]], dissatisfied with the amount of tribute he was receiving in comparison to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen058890&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), pp. 88, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Thomas Jefferson]] sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and pursue peace with the Barbary States.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmith228&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen0592&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first squadron, under the command of [[Richard Dale]] in {{USS|President|1800|2}}, was instructed to escort merchant ships through the Mediterranean and negotiate with leaders of the Barbary States.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmith228&quot;/&gt; A second squadron was assembled under the command of [[Richard Valentine Morris]] in {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|2}} however, the performance of Morris's squadron was so poor that he was recalled and subsequently dismissed from the Navy in 1803.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll173&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; A third squadron was assembled under the command of [[Edward Preble]] in {{USS|Constitution||2}} and by mid-1804 they had successfully fought the [[Second Battle of Tripoli Harbor|Battle of Tripoli Harbor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05199&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Jefferson reinforced Preble's squadron in April and ordered four frigates to sail as soon as possible. ''President'', ''Congress'', ''Constellation'' and ''Essex'' were placed under the direction of Commodore [[Samuel Barron (1765-1810)|Samuel Barron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05199&quot;/&gt; ''Congress'' was captained by [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]] and two months were spent preparing the squadron for the voyage. They departed in late June&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll224227&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), pp. 224–227.&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived at [[Gibraltar]] on 12 August. ''Congress'' and ''Essex'' were immediately sent to patrol off the coast of [[Tangier]] and when they returned to Gibraltar two weeks later, ''Congress'' continued on to Tripoli.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll2252&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05219220&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 219, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Congress'', accompanied by ''Constellation'', assumed blockade duties of Tripoli and captured one ''[[xebec]]'' before sailing for [[Malta]] on 25 October for repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05219220&quot;/&gt; On 6 November Rodgers assumed command of ''Constitution'' and in his place, [[Stephen Decatur]] assumed command of ''Congress''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05220&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded activity of ''Congress'' is in early July 1805 when she was sent in company with {{USS|Vixen|1803|2}} to blockade [[Tunisia]]. They were joined on the 23rd by additional U.S. Navy vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05268&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Sources do not specifically record ''Congress''{{'}}s activities between 25 October 1804 and early July 1805.

In 1811 ''Congress'' required extensive repairs before recommissioning with
Captain John Rogers in command. She performed routine patrols early in 1812 before war was declared on 18 June. Upon the declaration she was assigned to the squadron of Commodore Rodgers sailing in company with {{USS|Argus|1803|2}}, {{USS|Hornet|1805 brig|2}}, ''President'' and {{USS|United States|1797|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy7273&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), pp. 72, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacSmith322&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately Rogers was informed by a passing American merchant ship of a fleet of British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica. ''Congress'' sailed along in pursuit, but was interrupted when ''President'' began pursuing [[HMS Belvidera (1809)|HMS ''Belvidera'']] on 23 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper244245&quot;&gt;Cooper (1856), pp. 244, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy7374&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), pp. 73, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Congress'' trailed behind ''President'' during the chase and fired her bowchasers at the escaping ''Belvidera''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy7476&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), pp. 74, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to capture ''Belvidera'', the squadron returned to the pursuit of the Jamaican fleet. On 1 July they began to follow a trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaican fleet had left behind them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy77&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacSmith325&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Sailing to within one day's journey of the English Channel, the squadron never sighted the convoy and Rodgers called off the pursuit on the 13th. During their return trip to Boston, ''Congress'' assisted in the capture of seven merchant ships, including the recapture of an American vessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacSmith325&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy78&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper247&quot;&gt;Cooper (1856), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Making her second cruise against the British with ''President'', ''Congress'' sailed from Boston on 8 October. On the 31st of that month, both ships began to pursue {{HMS|Galatea|1810|6}}, which was escorting two merchant ships. ''Galatea'' and her charges were chased for about three hours, during which ''Congress'' captured the merchant ship ''Argo''. In the meantime, ''President'' kept after ''Galatea'' but lost sight of her as darkness fell. ''Congress'' and ''President'' remained together during November but they did not find a single ship to capture. On their return to the United States they passed north of Bermuda, proceeded towards the [[Virginia capes]], and arrived back in Boston on 31 December. During their entire time at sea, the two frigates captured nine [[prize (law)|prizes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy106107&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), pp. 106, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Congress'' and ''President'' were [[blockade]]d in Boston by the Royal Navy until they slipped through the blockade on 30 April 1813 and put to sea for their third cruise of the war. On 2 May they pursued {{HMS|Curlew|1812|6}} but she outran them both and escaped. ''Congress'' parted company with ''President'' on the 8th and patrolled off the [[Cape Verde Islands]] and the coast of Brazil. She only captured four small British merchant ships during this period and returned to the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] for repairs in late 1813. By this time of the war, materials and personnel were being diverted to the [[Great Lakes]], which created a shortage of resources necessary to repair her. Due to the amount of repairs she needed, it was decided instead to place her in ordinary, where she stayed for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll419420&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), pp. 419, 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teddy174175&quot;&gt;Roosevelt (1883), pp. 174, 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacSmith521&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Barbary War==
{{see also|Second Barbary War}}

Soon after the United States declared war against Britain in 1812, [[Algiers]] took advantage of the United States' preoccupation with Britain and began intercepting American merchant ships in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmithVIIP4-5&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 1815, at the request of President [[James Madison]], Congress declared war on Algiers. Work preparing two American squadrons promptly began—one at Boston under Commodore [[William Bainbridge]], and one at New York under Commodore Steven Decatur.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmithVIIP6&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05281&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Charles Morris (naval officer)|Charles Morris]] assumed command of ''Congress'' and assigned to the squadron under Bainbridge. After repairs and refitting, she transported the Minister to Holland [[William Eustis]] to his new post. ''Congress'' departed in June and after a few weeks at Holland, sailed for the Mediterranean and arrived at [[Cartagena, Spain]] in early August joining Bainbridge's squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris181&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05292293&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), pp. 292–293.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of ''Congress''{{'}}s arrival, however, Commodore Decatur had already secured a peace treaty with Algiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05293&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris182&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Congress'', {{USS|Erie|1813|2}}, {{USS|Chippewa|1815|2}} and {{USS|Spark|1813|2}} sailed in company with Bainbridge's [[flagship]] {{USS|Independence|1814|2}}—the first commissioned [[ship of the line]] of the U.S. Navy—as a show of force off Algiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris182&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Independence&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=Independence|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/i/independence-ii.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|link=off}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron subsequently made appearances off Tripoli and Tunis and arrived at Gibraltar in early October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05293&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmithVIIP20&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; From there, ''Congress'' and many other ships were ordered back to the United States. She arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, remained there shortly, and proceeded to Boston where she decommissioned in December and assigned to ordinary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen05294&quot;&gt;Allen (1905), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris182183&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==

In June 1816 Charles Morris again commanded ''Congress'' and began preparations for a cruise to the Pacific Coast of the United States. His objective was taking possession of [[Fort Astoria]] from the British and conducting inquiries at various ports along the coast to further improve commercial trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper446&quot;&gt;Cooper (1856), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris183184&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ScholHoway432&quot;&gt;Scholefield and Howay (1914), p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were canceled, however, when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a Spanish Navy vessel in the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, Morris commanded a squadron of ships in the Gulf to ensure that American merchant commerce in the area would continue unmolested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper446&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris184&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The acquisition of Fort Astoria was completed by [[James Biddle]] in August 1818.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper446&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ScholHoway432&quot;/&gt;|name=Astoria|group=Note}}

''Congress'' arrived in the Gulf of Mexico in December 1816 and made patrols through July 1817 performing duties that Morris described as &quot;tedious and uninteresting&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris184&quot;/&gt; From there she sailed for Haiti where Morris and an agent of the United States negotiated a settlement with [[Henri Christophe]] over the case of a captured vessel. Afterward, ''Congress'' sailed for Venezuela to observe and gather information regarding the ongoing Venezuelan [[Venezuelan War of Independence|War of Independence]]. She arrived about 21 August and visited the Venezuelan city of [[Barcelona, Anzoátegui|Barcelona]] soon after.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris185190&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), pp. 185–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon return to the Norfolk Navy Yard later the same year, Morris requested relief as commander due to failing health and [[Arthur Sinclair]] assumed command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris190191&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=Sinclair|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/s/sinclair.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|link=off}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Morris did not record the date of ''Congress''{{'}}s return from Venezuela nor the date of his request to be relieved of command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris191&quot;&gt;Morris (1880), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;|name=funkytimeline|group=Note}} Sinclair began preparing for a return voyage to South America carrying a diplomatic contingent to assure various South American countries of the United States' intention to remain neutral in their conflicts with Spain for independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brack7778&quot;&gt;Brackenridge (1820), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The diplomats included [[Caesar A. Rodney]], [[John Graham (cabinet)|John Graham]], [[Theodorick Bland (judge)|Theodorick Bland]], [[Henry Marie Brackenridge|Henry Brackenridge]], [[William Reed (politician)|William Reed]], and Thomas Rodney.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brack78&quot;&gt;Brackenridge (1820), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Congress'' departed on 4 December and returned to Norfolk in July 1818.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brack79&quot;&gt;Brackenridge (1820), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Read238241&quot;&gt;Read (1870), pp. 238, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1819 ''Congress'' made a voyage under the command of Captain [[John D. Henley]] to China, becoming the first U.S. warship to visit that country. She returned to the United States in May 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond (1851), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, pirates in the West Indies began seizing American merchant ships and in early 1822, she served as the [[flagship]] of Commodore [[James Biddle]]. She is recorded as collecting prisoners from the captured pirate ship ''Bandara D'Sangare'' on 24 July of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper448&quot;&gt;Cooper (1856), p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaclaySmith28&quot;&gt;Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Her next recorded activity is returning to Norfolk in April 1823 where Biddle immediately prepared for a voyage to Spain and Argentina to deliver the newly appointed Ministers, [[Hugh Nelson (congressman)|Hugh Nelson]] and Caesar A. Rodney respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wainwright171&quot;&gt;Wainwright (1951), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Read241&quot;&gt;Read (1870), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive modifications were required to the [[Deck (ship)#Common names for decks|berth deck]] of ''Congress'' in order to accommodate Rodney's wife and eleven children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wainwright180&quot;&gt;Wainwright (1951), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Rodney's household goods and furniture, described by Biddle as &quot;enough to fill a large merchant ship,&quot; were loaded into her hold that required much of the ships stores to be relocated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wainwright179180&quot;&gt;Wainwright (1951), pp. 179, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; She departed from [[Wilmington, Delaware]] on 8 June and arrived at [[Gibraltar]] where Hugh Nelson disembarked for Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read241&quot;/&gt; On 18 September ''Congress'' arrived at [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, where Rodney hired his own merchant ship to carry his family the rest of the distance to [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Read241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wainwright182&quot;&gt;Wainwright (1951), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Congress'' subsequently returned to Norfolk on 17 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wainwright183&quot;&gt;Wainwright (1951), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her return, ''Congress'' served as a [[receiving ship]]; being moved between the Norfolk and Washington Navy Yards under tow as needed. She remained on this duty for the next ten years until a survey of her condition was performed in 1834, and found unfit for repair, she was broken up the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll474&quot;&gt;Toll (2006), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;
