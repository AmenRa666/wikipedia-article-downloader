&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Judge Advocate General's School.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School]] --&gt;
'''The Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School''' educates military, civilian, and international personnel in legal and leadership skills. The center is operated by the [[United States Army]] and is located in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;The JAG School lies entirely within the City of Charlottesville—unlike the adjacent [[University of Virginia School of Law]], most of which lies within [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]], which encloses but does not include the City of Charlottesville. For more details, see the University's official &quot;Building Category Map&quot;, which clearly shows the city-county boundary and the JAG School within the city, downloadable here [http://www.web.virginia.edu/srem/teams/].&lt;/ref&gt; The Judge Advocate General's School, the center's graduate-level division, is accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] to award the [[Master of Laws]] degree in [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Military Law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/8525736A005BC8F9/0/CE89C60813E53611852573550051C3D8?opendocument |title=Graduate Course (LL.M. Program) |publisher=Jagcnet.army.mil |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Master of Laws curriculum includes courses in [[United States administrative law|Administrative and Civil Law]], [[Contracting with the United States Government|Contract and Fiscal Law]], [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Criminal Law]], and [[Laws of war|International and Operational Law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;/&gt;   

==Leadership==
[[Image:JAG School Patch.JPG|thumb|120px|right|[[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia]] worn by [[United States Army]] personnel assigned to The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=4216 The Institute of Heraldry, &quot;Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Legal Center and School (LCS) is led by a [[Brigadier General]] who serves as the Commander/Commandant, a [[Colonel]] as the Chief of Staff/XO, a [[Warrant Officer (United States)]] who serves as the Senior Warrant Officer Advisor for the LCS, a [[Command Sergeant Major]] who serves as the Senior Enlisted Advisor for the LCS and also as the Commandant of the Noncommissioned Officer Academy and a government civilian who serves as the Executive Director. The School is led by a [[Colonel]] who serves as the Dean and the Center is led by a [[Colonel]] who serves as the Legal Center Director. The school's five academic departments are led by [[Lieutenant Colonel]]s and a Chief Warrant Officer Three. Faculty members are [[Lieutenant Colonel]]s or [[Major (United States)|Majors]] which are licensed attorneys and are members of the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Army Judge Advocate General's Corps]]. With the exception of the Legal Administrator and Paralegal Education Department, each academic department has at least one faculty member who is a Judge Advocate in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy|Navy]], [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force|Air Force]], or [[United States Marine Corps Judge Advocate Division|Marine Corps]].

==History==
Despite a long record of service by [[United States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps|Army Judge Advocates]], it was not until the beginning of [[World War II]] that efforts were made to provide Army attorneys with specialized military legal education.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/8525736A005BE1BE/0/04E1051771A098D38525735C0065FE1E?opendocument&amp;noly=1 |title=History of The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center &amp; School |publisher=Jagcnet.army.mil |date=14 July 2003 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1942, as uniformed lawyers' responsibilities increased in volume and complexity, specialized continuing legal education courses for Judge Advocates began in Washington, D.C. In August 1942, the school moved from Washington's [[National University School of Law]] to the [[University of Michigan Law School]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  Intended only as a temporary facility, it was deactivated in 1946 during the general demobilization following [[World War II]]. In October 1950, another temporary school was activated at [[Fort Myer, Virginia|Fort Myer]], Virginia on land that is now a part of [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. After graduating six classes, it was decided a permanent school for Army lawyers should be established. In August 1951, the Army accepted an offer from the [[University of Virginia]] to move the school there permanently.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  The Seventh Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course and First Judge Advocate Officer Advanced Course began in the fall of 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  The school has remained at the University of Virginia and is now located adjacent to the [[University of Virginia Law School]].

==Location==

After moving to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], The Judge Advocate General's School was initially located in Clark Hall with the University of Virginia Law School, then behind Clark Hall in what is now called Kerchof Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/8525736A005BE1BE/0/3B6F59B497241596852573620061987D?opendocument&amp;noly=1 |title=Legal Center and School Photographs |publisher=Jagcnet.army.mil |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, the school relocated to the university's North Grounds, moving at the same time as the law school. The building, and the adjacent law school building, were designed by Hugh Stubbins &amp; Associates with Rawlings, Wilson, and Fraher.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/webmap/ENorthGrounds.html |title=North Grounds, Web Map, U.Va |publisher=Virginia.edu |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An addition to the building, designed by Bohlin, Powell, Larkin, and Cywinski in collaboration with Johnson, Craven, and Gibson, was completed in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginia1&quot;/&gt;

==Master of Laws==
The Judge Advocate Officer Graduate Course is the school's &quot;flagship&quot; course.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;/&gt;  Accredited by the [[American Bar Association]], the course prepares experienced military attorneys for supervisory duties and other positions of increased responsibility within their respective services. Students who successfully complete the course are awarded a [[Master of Laws]] degree in [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Military Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/usc_sec_10_00004315----000-.html |title=United States Code: Title 10,4315. The Judge Advocate General’s School: master of laws in military law , LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Selection to attend the course is a [[Permanent Change of Station|permanent change of station]] assignment; students do not attend in a [[TDY|temporary duty]] status. Each class consists of attorneys from the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], as well as international military students and [[United States Department of the Army|Army]] civilian attorneys. International military students have come from Egypt, Israel, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Bosnia and Herzegovina and other nations. All students are licensed attorneys who generally have five to eight years of experience.

The Graduate Course covers a full resident academic year from mid-August to mid-May. The fall and spring semesters include core classes required of all students. In the second quarter of the fall semester and in the spring semester, students select from approximately fifty electives offered by the school's four academic departments:  [[United States administrative law|Administrative and Civil Law]], [[Contracting with the United States Government|Contract and Fiscal Law]], [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Criminal Law]], and [[Laws of war|International and Operational Law]]. Students may specialize in one of the four academic areas in conjunction with the Master of Laws. To qualify for a specialty, a student must either write a [[thesis]] in the area of specialization, or earn at least ten elective credit hours and write an extensive paper in the area of specialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;/&gt;

==Other programs==

In addition to the Judge Advocate Officer Graduate Course that leads to the [[Master of Laws]] degree, the school trains new Judge Advocates through the Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course (three courses are completed each year), provides [[continuing legal education]] for Judge Advocates and other attorneys, and trains [[legal administrator]] [[warrant officer]]s, [[paralegal]] [[noncommissioned officer]]s, and [[court reporter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/8525736A005BC8F9/0/1B73C7E3D2D52A3F8525735500608BF0?opendocument |title=Courses |publisher=Jagcnet.army.mil |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school's Noncommissioned Officers Academy offers the Advanced Leaders Course and the Senior Leaders Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/8525736A005BC8F9/0/6B6145A0FE036E1C8525754600480A73?opendocument |title=NCOA |publisher=Jagcnet.army.mil |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
