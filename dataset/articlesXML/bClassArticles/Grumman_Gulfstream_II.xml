The '''Gulfstream II''' ('''G-II''') is an American twin engine [[business jet]] designed and built by [[Grumman]] and then in succession, [[Grumman American]] and finally [[Gulfstream American]]. Its Grumman model number is G-1159 and its US military designation is '''C-11 Gulfstream II'''. It has been succeeded by the [[Gulfstream III]]. The first Gulfstream II flew on October 2, 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, John W 1984&quot;&gt;Taylor, John W.R., ''Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1984-85'', Jane's Publishing Company, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet swept wing corporate transport powered by two [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] [[turbofan]] engines and designed to provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop [[Grumman Gulfstream I|Gulfstream I]]. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform.  The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing are similar to those of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted [[Fowler flap]] of 30% chord.  Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.&lt;ref name=Waaland&gt;Waaland, I.T. and Curtis, E.J., &quot;Gulfstream II Aerodynamic Design&quot;, SAE paper 670242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The high angle of attack investigations on the Gulfstream II indicated that stable trim conditions existed up to 45 degrees angle of attack.  The elevator deflection required to trim to the primary stall at most forward center of gravity was sufficient to trim a [[deep stall]] at the aft center of gravity, but recovery from deep stall was immediate upon forward stick motion, and more than adequate nose-down elevator control was available.  The acceptability of the Gulfstream II high angle of attack characteristics and the absence of a deep stall influence on configuration sizing and arrangement was attributed to the mitigating influence of the nacelle-wing overlap on nacelle contribution. Configuration buildup studies revealed the adverse nacelle influence on tail pitching moment contribution above 30 degrees angle of attack was not unduly severe and no appreciable effect on elevator or stabilizer effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=Waaland /&gt;

It was found in flight testing that the stall characteristics were satisfactory but did not preclude stall penetrations to the point of secondary stall pitchup.  Rather than pursue a lengthy flight test research effort, and in view of the excellent primary stall behavior, it was decided to mechanically limit the extent of stall penetration with a [[stick shaker]] and [[stick pusher]].&lt;ref name=Waaland /&gt;

During installation of the [[Aviation Partners Inc.]] winglets (as the G-IISP), the vortex generators and midspan fence were removed and replaced with six leading edge vortilons similar to those found on the [[Gulfstream IV]].&lt;ref name=APISTC&gt;[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgstc.nsf/0/c725fd441da2e7158625770c007783bd/$FILE/ST00080SE.pdf FAA Supplemental Type Certificate ST00080SE] Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the FAA modified 14 CFR part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015.  The Gulfstream II is listed explicitly in Federal Register [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2013-07-02/2013-15843/content-detail.html 78 FR 39576].  Any Gulfstream II's that have not been modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had &quot;hushkits&quot; installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015.  ''14 CFR ยง91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less'' - lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015.

==Accidents and incidents==
* May 3, 1982 - A Gulfstream II from the Algerian government was shot down by a fighter jet in the border area of Iraq, Iran and Turkey. All 15 people on board, including the Algerian foreign minister [[Mohammed Seddik Ben Yahia]] were killed.
* In April 1983, Mallow racecourse, in Ireland, became an emergency airfield when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet made a precautionary landing. A temporary tarmacadam runway of almost 3,000 feet in length was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later in May. A movie, 'The Runway', was loosely based on the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Corkman|title=Pilot's girl touches down|url=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/corkman/news/pilots-girl-touches-down-27078359.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 19 of 1990, an accident occurred at Little Rock municipal airport, Arkansas when a Gulfstream II struck guidance lights and crashed short of the runway while attempting to land in stormy weather. It was carrying employees of an Eastman Kodak Co. subsidiary when the flight was diverted to Little Rock due to unfavorable weather. All 7 on board including 2 pilots were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=1990|title=PLANE CRASHES IN STORM, 7 KILLED|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Plane-Crashes-In-Storm-7-Killed/id-bb2afe8adafb200052716a19954b328a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
