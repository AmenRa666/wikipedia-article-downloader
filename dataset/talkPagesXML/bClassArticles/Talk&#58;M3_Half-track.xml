Picture shown is an M-16, the M-3 did not have the quad 50 mount. --[[User:141.157.157.106|141.157.157.106]] 00:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==T12 Issue==
The T12 GMC was the pilot vehicle for the M3 GMC.  The only difference between T12s and production M3s is the purpose built gun shield on the M3 replacing the sparse gun shield from the M2A3 carraige that the gun had been on previously that had been fitted to the T12.  Dunno anything about a T12 HMC, but this is the T12 ''GMC.''

Well, the T12 designation is unnecessary in the variant list since it got a &quot;proper&quot; designation once adopted. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] 10:00, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

:I honestly don't think so.  If its a term that people might stumble across its nice to have it listed there so people know what it is.  [[User:Thatguy96|Thatguy96]] 8:20, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

==Current service==

Should it be mentioned that the M3 is still in service in Israel?  [[Special:Contributions/204.152.235.217|204.152.235.217]] ([[User talk:204.152.235.217|talk]]) 21:59, 31 March 2008 (UTC)
:I was under the impression that the IDF had dispensed with the last of their halftracks by the end of the 1980s, even passing some of the remaining units to groups like the South Lebanon Army.  Do you have a source for their continued usage? -- [[User:Thatguy96|Thatguy96]] ([[User talk:Thatguy96|talk]]) 22:16, 31 March 2008 (UTC)
::Also, according to the page on the Bolivian military, they apparently still use them. [[User:SpudHawg948|SpudHawg948]] ([[User talk:SpudHawg948|talk]]) 16:49, 31 October 2008 (UTC)
:::They are still used in Colombia by the Military in Perreia District as checkpoint security. They can also be seen during protests or near the stadiums during a match as riot control vehicles.-Renteria
::::At least as recently as the mid-90s there was still something like 8 - 12 operators in South America and Africa (although for a lot of them, Janes had little caveats like &quot;unknown how many remain serviceable&quot;.) You can confirm Colombia [http://www.armyrecognition.com/colombia_colombian_army_land_ground_forces_uk/colombia_colombian_army_land_ground_forces_military_equipment_armoured_armored_vehicle_intelligence.html], and add Lebanon [http://www.militarymodelling.com/news/article.asp?a=3131], Senegal [http://www.armyrecognition.com/senegal_senegalese_army_land_ground_forces_uk/senegal_senegalese_army_land_ground_forces_military_equipment_armoured_armored_vehicle_intelligence.html], Peru [http://www.armyrecognition.com/peru_peruvian_army_military_land_ground_forces_uk/peru_peruvian_army_land_ground_forces_military_equipment_armoured_armored_vehicle_pictures_informati.html] and Dominican Republic [http://www.armyrecognition.com/dominican_republic_army_land_ground_forces_uk/dominican_republic_army_land_ground_armed_defense_forces_military_equipment_armored_vehicle_intellig.html] as countries still operating them today. (Possibly also Rwanda [http://www.armyrecognition.com/rwanda_rwandaise_armee/rwanda_armee_rwandaise_forces_terrestres_equipements_vehicules_blindes_information_description_photo.html], although given the ambiguous listing and their closer relationship to France, that might be meant to be [[Panhard M3]].) There were also a lot of M2s and M9s sold off/given away after the war, and still in service in odd little spots around the world. -- [[Special:Contributions/202.63.39.58|202.63.39.58]] ([[User talk:202.63.39.58|talk]]) 02:49, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

== Squad size ==
A WW2 US Army Armored Infantry rifle squad had 12 men. This total *includes* the driver, who was expected to act as another rifleman when dismounted and absolutely was a squad member. The M3 was also used to carry light machinegun and mortar squads also, but none of those squads had more than 12 men. So the M3 did indeed have 13 seats, but even at full strength no squad needed more than 12 seats.

== Lead Photo is clearly an M2 ==
Folks, the lead photo in this article is definitely an M2, not an M3. I will edit. [[User:DMorpheus2|DMorpheus2]] ([[User talk:DMorpheus2|talk]]) 18:25, 5 August 2016 (UTC)</text>
