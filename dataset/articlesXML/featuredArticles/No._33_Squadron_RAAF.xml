'''No. 33 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) strategic transport and [[aerial refueling|air-to-air refuelling]] squadron. It operates [[Airbus A330 MRTT|Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports]] from [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for service during World War&amp;nbsp;II, operating [[Short Empire]] flying boats and a variety of smaller aircraft. By 1944 it had completely re-equipped with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transports, which it flew in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946.

The unit was re-established in February 1981 as a [[flight (military unit)|flight]], equipped with two [[Boeing&amp;nbsp;707]]s for [[Very Important Person|VIP]] and other long-range transport duties out of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales. No.&amp;nbsp;33 Flight was re-formed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991. No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008. It began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011, and achieved [[initial operating capability]] with the type in February 2013. One of its aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the [[2014 military intervention against ISIS|military coalition against ISIS]].

The squadron operates five [[Airbus A330 MRTT|Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports]], the first of which entered service in June 2011.&lt;ref name=APDC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=628|title=First KC-30A arrived|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more are due for delivery in 2018.&lt;ref name=AA2015&gt;{{cite magazine|title=RAAF to acquire two additional KC-30s|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2015/07/raaf-to-acquire-two-additional-kc-30s/|accessdate=4 July 2015|magazine=[[Australian Aviation (magazine)|Australian Aviation]]|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:No. 33 Sqn Dragon (AWM P01877.004).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|No. 33 Squadron de Havilland Dragon at [[Kokoda]], New Guinea, in February 1943| alt=Military personnel and a jeep in front of a twin-engined biplane, with jungle and a mountain range in the background]]
During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos.&amp;nbsp;33, [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|34]], [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|35]] and [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|36&amp;nbsp;Squadrons]]. No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron was established on 16&amp;nbsp;February at [[RAAF Base Townsville|Townsville]], Queensland, under the control of [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Area Command]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Units35&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 35–38&lt;/ref&gt; It was equipped with four ex-[[Qantas]] [[Short Empire]] flying boats transferred from [[No. 11 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Squadron]], along with several smaller types including [[de Havilland Dragon]]s and [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]]s, [[Avro Anson]]s, and [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant|Vultee Vigilant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units35&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons'', pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than two weeks later the squadron suffered its first loss when one of the Empires crashed on landing at Townsville; the six crew members were killed. A second Empire was destroyed at its mooring during a [[Attack on Broome|Japanese air attack on Broome]], Western Australia, on 3 March; another Empire was impressed from Qantas to replace the lost aircraft. One of the squadron's tasks was search-and-rescue; it lost another Empire on 8&amp;nbsp;August 1942 after it sank in heavy seas off the coast of New Guinea while trying to rescue survivors of a [[torpedo]]ed ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units35&quot;/&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron transferred to [[Port Moresby]] in January 1943, providing air transport to Australian forces involved in the [[New Guinea campaign]]. Transport needs were so desperate in New Guinea that even the Tiger Moths were employed, delivering a total of {{convert|77|kg|lbs}} per trip.&lt;ref name=Eather/&gt; In September–October 1943, the squadron began taking delivery of fifteen [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]] to replace its assortment of aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units35&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather/&gt; By the time it transferred to [[Milne Bay]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1944, it was operating Dakotas exclusively, and continued to do so for the rest of the war. The squadron relocated to [[Lae]] on 15&amp;nbsp;January 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units35&quot;/&gt; Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, it was tasked with repatriating service personnel and former [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].&lt;ref name=Eather/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron returned to Townsville on 11&amp;nbsp;March 1946, and disbanded there on 13&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units35&quot;/&gt;

===Post-war re-establishment===
In 1978, the Australian government decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it saw as the risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying [[Very Important Person|VIPs]] on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one [[Boeing 727]] each from domestic carriers [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] and [[Trans Australia Airlines|TAA]] were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two [[Boeing 707]]s for $14.5 million.&lt;ref name=Units38&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt; Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers.&lt;ref name=Roylance&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Today1&gt;{{cite magazine|title=33 Squadron: operational airline|magazine=Air Force Today |volume=1 |issue=1|date =May 1996|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was transferred to the RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22&amp;nbsp;April. Located at [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by [[No. 37 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron]]. They were formed into No.&amp;nbsp;33 Flight under the command of [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] J.D. Grierson on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1981.&lt;ref name=Units38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roylance/&gt; The [[Flight (military unit)|flight's]] first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]], Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.&lt;ref name=Roylance/&gt;

On 1&amp;nbsp;July 1983, after the government procured two more 707s for $7.5 million from [[Worldways Canada]], No.&amp;nbsp;33 Flight was reorganised as No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron under Grierson's command.&lt;ref name=Eather/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units38/&gt; Responsible for transporting VIPs such as members of the [[British Royal Family]], the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], and the [[Pope]], the 707 also became the first RAAF aircraft to land in the [[Soviet Union]], the occasion being the funeral of [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in 1985. Along with Nos.&amp;nbsp;36 and 37 Squadrons, operating [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron came under the control of No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing, part of the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group), in February 1987.&lt;ref name=AMG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roylance/&gt; Routine servicing of the 707s and Hercules was the responsibility of [[No. 486 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;486 Squadron]], another component of No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing.&lt;ref name=Roylance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; Qantas undertook heavier maintenance of the 707s at its jet base in [[Sydney Airport|Mascot]].&lt;ref name=Today2&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Keeping the Boeing going|magazine=Air Force Today |volume=1 |issue=2|date =July 1996|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF acquired three more 707s on 25&amp;nbsp;February 1988, following a $25 million purchase from [[Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security|Boeing Military]]. One of the airframes was non-flying, for spares only, and was nicknamed &quot;Hulksbury&quot;.&lt;ref name=Units38/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=David|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/last-raaf-707-gives-sydney-a-scare/2008/06/30/1214677946042.html|title=Last RAAF 707 gives Sydney a scare|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 July 2008|accessdate= 16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consortium of [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] and [[de Havilland Australia|Hawker de Havilland]] converted four of No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron's six serviceable aircraft to in-flight refuelling tankers between December 1988 and May 1992.&lt;ref name=Units38/&gt; Their probe-and-drogue configuration allowed them to refuel the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets and the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]]'s [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|Douglas A-4K Skyhawks]], but not the RAAF's [[General Dynamics F-111C|General Dynamics F-111]] bombers, which required a boom system; the other two 707s continued to be used purely for long-range transport.&lt;ref name=Units38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Today1/&gt; The RAAF had argued for an air-to-air refuelling capability for both the {{nowrap|F/A-18s}} and the {{nowrap|F-111s}}, but the Australian government refused to fund the latter, considering the F-111's existing range sufficient for deterrent purposes. Observers such as journalist Frank Cranston speculated that aside from any cost issues, the government was concerned that extending the bombers' range would signal to the region that Australia was adopting a more aggressive defence posture.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 178–180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1989, one of the 707s transported 300 [[Australian Army]] personnel in two flights to Namibia as part of the [[Australian contribution to UNTAG]], the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=665|title=No 33 Squadron B-707 ferried troops to Namibia|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when [[1989 Australian pilots' strike|the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute]]; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of [[Compass Airlines (Australia)|Compass Airlines]]. On 29&amp;nbsp;October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of [[RAAF Base East Sale|East Sale]], Victoria; all five crew members were killed.&lt;ref name=Units38/&gt; The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B-707 lost in training accident|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=557|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation for this type of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time.&lt;ref&gt; State Coroner Victoria Report Case Nos. 3587, 3589, 3612, 3601, 3732/91 &lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of [[Operation Solace]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=131 |title=Advance party headed for Somalia|publisher= Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=450|title=Airlift returned Army battalion from Somalia|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
