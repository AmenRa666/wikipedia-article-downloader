==&quot;Romania Intregita&quot;==
The article now says, 'The [[political correctness|politically correct]] Romanian term &quot;Romania Intregita&quot; has its closest meaning in English as &quot;Whole Romania&quot;.'

#Shouldn't this be &quot;România Intregita&quot;?
#:''România Întregit&amp;#257;'' indeed.. it's a plague, romanians are using Western European Encoding Keyboard instead of switching to Central European keyboard, i'm plagued by this too -- [[User:Criztu|Criztu]] 19:41, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
#A few questions: how common is this usage? I get less than 200 Google hits.
#:Romania Mare (greater romania) was hijacked by a political nationalistic party. ([[User:Criztu|Criztu]], unsigned)
#:*Yes, I added had already added a statement to that effect to the article, but that doesn't answer how common is ''România Întregit&amp;#259;''. -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 23:41, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)
#As a native English speaker, &quot;Whole Romania&quot; is certainly something I would never think to say. What is the basis for saying this is &quot;its closest meaning in English&quot;? I would say &quot;Integral Romania&quot; or &quot;Undivided Romania&quot;.

-- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 18:38, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)
: in 1919 Romania was &quot;whole again&quot;, not &quot;integral&quot;, and now is &quot;incomplete&quot;, not &quot;divided&quot; . romanian word &quot;intreg&quot; means 'whole; entire' -- [[User:Criztu|Criztu]] 19:41, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::I'm sorry, I'd misread, even while copying: I'd thought the root was ''integral&amp;#259;''. 
::Perhaps &quot;The Entirety of Romania&quot; or &quot;The Whole of Romania&quot;? &quot;Whole Romania&quot; just isn't likely English. -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 23:41, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)

== The whole Romania is greater than the 1920-1940 border in the original 'Greater Romania' idea ==

This idea said, that every land is a Romanian territory, whereever the great rivers (Tisza with the river Bodrog and Dnister) of the Romanian Carpathian Mountains (Eastern and Southern Carpathians) spread out their alluvial deposit. So Greater Romania is the territory between the River Tisza and River Dnister. It consist of the Carpathian Ruthenia and North-Bukovina (nowdays in Ukraine and East-Slovakia - Presov and its vicinity), the Hungarian territory east of the river Tisza, Republic of Moldova (without Transnistria), Lower-Moldavia (nowdays in Ukraine) South-Dobruja (nowdays in Bulgaria), and West-Banat (nowdays in Serbia: East part of the former Province - Vojvodina) and - naturally - Romania.

== Misused quote from Kessler ==

I removed the misued quote from Kessler, after the discussion at [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Misused_quote.3F]], [[Special:Contributions/86.127.5.62|86.127.5.62]] ([[User talk:86.127.5.62|talk]]) 08:23, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

I can't find the phrase &quot;ethnocentric nationalism&quot; from [[User:Fakirbakir]]'s version in the given source. Another aspect: Kessler's article is called &quot;Ideas And Ideology In '''Interwar''' Romania&quot;, so it refers to a period from the past, while the phrase from this wiki article uses present tense: &quot;The Romanian ideology '''is''' a typical example of ethnocentric nationalism&quot;. [[Special:Contributions/79.117.157.156|79.117.157.156]] ([[User talk:79.117.157.156|talk]]) 15:19, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
:Kessler's version is much harsher (he uses the term &quot;xenophobic nationalism&quot;). [[User:Fakirbakir|Fakirbakir]] ([[User talk:Fakirbakir|talk]]) 16:17, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
::So [[A. C. Cuza]] is described as an xenophobic nationalist. I don't understand how is this related to the concept of &quot;Greater Romania&quot;. 
::P.S. I am not even sure that these terms (&quot;xenophobic&quot; amd &quot;ethnocentric&quot;) are synonyms. [[Special:Contributions/86.126.63.196|86.126.63.196]] ([[User talk:86.126.63.196|talk]]) 16:43, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
:::xenophobic: &quot;racist, nationalist, bigoted, parochial, insular, isolationist, ethnocentric, racialist&quot; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/xenophobic] [[User:Fakirbakir|Fakirbakir]] ([[User talk:Fakirbakir|talk]]) 17:02, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
:::No, Kessler says that Cuza's writings are a good example for depicting the Romanian &quot;psyche&quot;. [[User:Fakirbakir|Fakirbakir]] ([[User talk:Fakirbakir|talk]]) 17:08, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
::::Ok, then I have nothing agaisnt the replacement of &quot;xenophobic&quot; with &quot;ethnocentric&quot;. But the other problem presists:  Kessler's article is called &quot;Ideas And Ideology In '''Interwar''' Romania&quot;, so it refers to a period from the past, while the phrase from this wiki article uses present tense: &quot;The Romanian ideology '''is''' a typical example of ethnocentric nationalism&quot;. [[Special:Contributions/86.126.63.196|86.126.63.196]] ([[User talk:86.126.63.196|talk]]) 17:31, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::Hey, I have already fixed it. &quot; in the first decades of the twentieth century was &quot; (early decades). [[User:Fakirbakir|Fakirbakir]] ([[User talk:Fakirbakir|talk]]) 17:48, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::Another (the third) editor commented at [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Misused_quote.3F]] and rejected your text. [[User:Fakirbakir]], are you sure that you still want that phrase in the article? [[Special:Contributions/86.124.223.11|86.124.223.11]] ([[User talk:86.124.223.11|talk]]) 21:19, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

[[User:Fakirbakir]], I appreciate your gesture to remove the unecyclopedic quote, but in my opninion the remaining sentence (&quot;The Romanian national ideology in the first decades of the twentieth century was a typical example of ethnocentric nationalism&quot;) is still problematic (And I am not the only one, [[User:Markbassett]] agreed with me [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&amp;diff=675423266&amp;oldid=675422764 here]) 

[[User:Kingofaces43]], what do you think? Should this sentence be removed / rephrased? In my opninion, it does not refer to the general concept of Greater Romania and it is also a slight difference between the original text (from the source) and the text added to the article. The original phrase does not refer to &quot;the Romanian national ideology&quot;. [[Special:Contributions/79.117.202.93|79.117.202.93]] ([[User talk:79.117.202.93|talk]]) 23:03, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
:Kindgofaces43 the debate is still on at [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Misused_quote.3F]]. [[User:Fakirbakir|Fakirbakir]] ([[User talk:Fakirbakir|talk]]) 12:06, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
::As I said at RSN, I think it's better just to remove the content and source. The slight difference mentioned is not so much of a big deal. The issue I'm seeing is that a source is being used as an opinion. That's ok in some instances, but for something like the ideals held by a group of people at a certain time, there really should be a more scholarly source being used instead. The snobbish, etc. language is an indication that this source is more of a commentary by a single person rather than a scholarly review of the topic, so just find a source that plainly states what ideals were held without what appears to be more political commentary. I don't have a horse in this race, so that's all I'll say here at least. [[User:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43]] ([[User talk:Kingofaces43|talk]]) 12:44, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
:::[[User:Fakirbakir]], I agree with [[User:Kingofaces43]] 's statement that &quot;it's better just to remove the content and source&quot;. If you have no objections, I will proceed to the deletion of the phrase &quot;The Romanian national ideology in the first decades of the twentieth century was a typical example of ethnocentric nationalism&quot;. Otherwise, I will keep it as it is and I will try to get more opinions from other users.

::::User:Fakirbakir, I hope that I am right to interpret your non-response in the last days, when you were nevertheless active on the site, as a tacit approval. [[Special:Contributions/86.126.52.131|86.126.52.131]] ([[User talk:86.126.52.131|talk]]) 21:32, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::What is wrong with it? I still don't get it.
