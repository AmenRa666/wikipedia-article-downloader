'''Overwatch Battle Group (West)''' was an [[Australian Army]] [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] that [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|represented Australia's largest contribution]] to the [[Multinational force in Iraq]]. The Battle Group was established in July 2006 and was based at [[Tallil Airbase]] in [[Dhi Qar Governorate]], consisting of units previously assigned to the third, and final, rotation of the [[Al Muthanna Task Group]]. It was withdrawn in June 2008.

==History==
Upon its formation Overwatch Battle Group (West) consisted of units which were previously assigned to the third, and final, rotation of the [[Al Muthanna Task Group]], following the handover of Camp Smitty to Iraqi Forces in July 2006.&lt;ref name=CampSmitty&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=5858 |title=Australian Troops Depart Camp Smitty |work=Media Release: Department of Defence |date=28 July 2006 |publisher=Australian Government, Department of Defence |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horner (2008), pp. 335–336.&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle Group formed part of [[Multi-National Division (South-East) (Iraq)|Multi-National Division (South-East)]]. An additional 38 personnel and four [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster infantry mobility vehicles]] were deployed in late 2006 to increase the size of the force to over 500 soldiers supported by 40 [[ASLAV]]s and 19 Bushmasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/NelsonMintpl.cfm?CurrentId=5977 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311051242/http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/NelsonMintpl.cfm?CurrentId=5977 |title=Additional Troops for Operation Overwatch |work=Media Release: Minister for Defence |author=Nelson, Brendan |publisher=Australian Government |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=9 March 2014 |archivedate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total Australian strength in southern Iraq rose to over 500 personnel.&lt;ref name=Horner336&gt;Horner (2008), p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overwatch Battle Group (West)'s main role was to provide support to [[Iraqi Security Forces]] in a crisis if requested by the Iraqi Government and the [[Multinational force in Iraq|Multi-National Force – Iraq]]. Whilst it was never called upon to act in this role, the Battle Group did conduct combat and security operations within the cities of An Nasiriyah and As Samawah, the provincial capitals of Dhi Qar and Al Muthana respectively, extensive patrolling within rural areas and on [[Main Supply Route]]s (MSRs) to counter the indirect fire and improvised explosive device threat, training and mentoring of the Iraqi Army and Police, support to strike operations undertaken by United States Special Forces, and construction and re-construction work. The Battle Group's training team was responsible for providing basic training to [[Iraqi Army]] personnel at the Basic Training Centre in Tallil.&lt;ref name=Horner336&gt;Horner (2008), p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the four rotations of the deployment, the battle group took part in a number of engagements, including the [[Battle of Al Rumaythah]], which occurred on 26 September 2006 and involved OBG(W) 1,&lt;ref name=Noonan&gt;Noonan, Gerard, Skehan, Craig and Desmond O'Grady, &quot;Australian Troops Close Shave in Iraq Firefight&quot;, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;Wright, Lincoln. &quot;Diggers Kill Five in Iraq Battle&quot;, ''The Sunday Mail'', 8 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Battle of Route Bismarck]], involving OBG(W) 2 over the period 23–24 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Combat Ops Iraq: OP CATALYST JTF-633 IRAQ|journal=Australian and New Zealand Defender Magazine|volume=|issue=58|pages=42–46|publisher=Fullbore Magazines|location=Brisbane Market|date=Winter 2007|url=|issn=1322-039X|doi=|id=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] led by [[Kevin Rudd]] pledged in the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]], Australian combat forces began withdrawing from Iraq on 1 June 2008.&lt;ref name=withdraws&gt;{{cite news| url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL0164801020080601?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 | title = Australia withdraws troops from Iraq | accessdate =1 June 2008 | date = 1 June 2008| publisher = ''[[Reuters]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Overwatch Battle Group (West) and Australian Army Training Team formally ceased combat operations on the 2 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/DefenceBlog/2008/0602_0608.htm#drawdown |title=Cessation of ADF Operations in Southern Iraq |work=Defence news: 2 June &amp;ndash; 8 June 2008 |publisher=Australian Government, Department of Defence |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-iraq-02jun02,0,2998689.story | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Topic Galleries - chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No Australian military personnel were killed in the course of the deployment, during which the Australian contingent helped train 33,000 Iraqi soldiers. Approximately 200 Australian personnel remained in Iraq on logistical and air surveillance duties after its withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7430600.stm &quot; Australia ends Iraq combat role&quot;], ''BBC News'', 2 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
