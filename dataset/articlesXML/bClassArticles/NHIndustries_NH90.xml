The '''NHIndustries NH90''' is a medium-sized, twin-engine, multi-role [[military helicopter]]. It was developed in response to [[NATO]] requirements for a battlefield helicopter which would also be capable of being operated in [[navy|naval]] environments. The NH90 was developed and is manufactured by [[NHIndustries]], a collaborative company, which is owned by [[Airbus Helicopters]], [[Leonardo-Finmeccanica]] (formerly [[AgustaWestland]]) and [[Fokker Aerostructures]]. The first prototype conducted its [[maiden flight]] in December 1995; the type began to enter operational service with some customers in 2007. As of 2013, a total of thirteen nations have placed orders for the NH90.

The NH90 has the distinction of being the first production helicopter to feature entirely [[fly by wire]] flight controls.&lt;ref name =&quot;top 10&quot;&gt;Perry, Dominic. [http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/rotor-club-our-top-10-most-influential-helicopters-405973/ &quot;Rotor club: Our top 10 most influential helicopters.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 21 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main variants, the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) for army use and the navalised NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH); each customer typically has various alterations and customisations made to their own NH90 fleets, such as different weapons, sensors and cabin arrangements, to meet their own specific requirements. In early service, the NH90 has suffered several teething issues, which has in turn delayed active deployment of the type by some operators.

==Development==

===Origins===
In 1985, [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]] teamed to develop a [[NATO]] battlefield transport and anti-ship/anti-submarine helicopter for the 1990s. The United Kingdom left the team in 1987.&lt;ref name=Frawley_NH_90&gt;Frawley, Gerald. &quot;NHIndustries NH 90&quot;. ''The International Directory of Military Aircraft, 2002/2003''. Aerospace Publications, 2002. ISBN 1-875671-55-2.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 1992, NH Industries signed an NH90 design-and-development contract with NAHEMA (NATO Helicopter Management Agency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transnet.act.nato.int/WISE/Entities/NAHEMA |title=NAHEMA |date=January 19, 2007 |publisher=Coleman.t |accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agency represented the four participating nations: France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. [[Portugal]] later joined the agency in June 2001. Design work on the helicopter started in 1993.&lt;ref name=Prototype&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocopter.com/site/en/press/NH90-Helicopter-3rd-Prototype-in-Flight_170.html |title=NH90 Helicopter – 3rd Prototype in Flight |date=November 27, 1998 |work=Press Release |publisher=Eurocopter |accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first prototype, PT1, made the type's first flight on 18 December 1995.&lt;ref name=Frawley_NH_90/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prototype/&gt; The second prototype, PT2, first flew on 19 March 1997 and the third prototype, PT3, on 27 November 1998.&lt;ref name=Prototype/&gt; On 12 December 2002, PT3 became the first helicopter to fly exclusively with [[fly-by-wire]] controls following the removal of mechanical back-up controls.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Christina. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2003/2003%20-%202913.html &quot;NH90 prototype takes off with fly-by-wire controls.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 5 January 2004. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NH90 was developed into two main variants: the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) and the NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH).&lt;ref name=Frawley_NH_90/&gt; These two main variants share about 75% commonality with each other.&lt;ref name = &quot;flight cuts teeth&quot;&gt;Hoyle, Craig.

During the development phrase of the programme in the 1990s, both technical and funding problems were experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/landingpage/nh90.html |title=Aircraft profile: NH Industries NH90 |publisher=''[[Flightglobal.com]]'' |accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2000, the partner nations placed a large production order, worth US$8.6&amp;nbsp;billion, for a total of 366 helicopters.&lt;ref name=Frawley_NH_90/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62695767.html|title=Germany, Italy, France, Netherlands Place $8.6 Billion Order for NH-90|work=Defense Daily|date=9 June 2000|accessdate=6 August 2015|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional orders have since followed from customers in Europe, Asia, and Australia. By April 2013, a total of 529 NH90s of all variants were on order by various customers.&lt;ref name=DN20130408 /&gt;

===Production===
[[File:Maquette NH 90.jpg|thumb|upright|Cockpit of an NH90 during a public display]]
The NH90 was initially intended to be produced at three exporting final assembly lines (FAL); Cascina Costa in Italy for AgustaWestland, Marignane in France and Donauwörth in Germany for Airbus Helicopters. The Nordic and Australian contracts stipulated production locally (the Nordic ones at [[Patria (company)|Patria]] in Finland and the Australian ones in Brisbane). Spain has a final assembly line at [[Albacete]].&lt;ref name=&quot;awst_20070101&quot;&gt;&quot;News Breaks&quot;, ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'', 1 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurocopter.com/site/en/press/Eurocopter-s-first-NH90-TTH-tactical-transport-helicopter-for-Spain-performs-its-maiden-flight_741.html?iframe=true&amp;width=700|title= Spain performs its maiden flight of NH 90 |publisher= eurocopter.com |date= |accessdate= 3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marignane assembly line can reportedly complete up to 22 NH90s per year.&lt;ref name = &quot;flight cuts teeth&quot;/&gt;

Major components are produced by each of the shareholding companies:
*Airbus Helicopters France 31.25% (Engines, Rotors, the Electrical, flight control and the core avionics systems)
*Airbus Helicopters Deutschland 31.25% (Forward and centre fuselage, the fuel, communications and avionics control systems)
*Fokker 5.5% (Tail structure, doors, sponsons, landing gear and the intermediate gearbox)
*AgustaWestland 32% (Rear fuselage, main gearbox, hydraulic system, automatic flight control and plant management systems, power plant and the NFH mission system)
Items built by the shareholding companies are then distributed to the six locations for assembly and flight test (Marignane, France; Tessera, Italy; Donauworth, Germany; Halli, Finland; and Brisbane, Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhindustries.com/site/en/ref/The-Company_21.html|title=NH Industries - The Company|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, the German Army, the first customer to receive production aircraft, accepted delivery of its first NH90 TTH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airbushelicopters.com/w1/jrotor/69/first-nh90.html &quot;First Delivery.&quot;] ''Rotor Online'', December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, the Royal Netherlands Navy was the first customer to receive the navalised NH90 NFH variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2010/04/first-dutch-nh90-nfh-delivered/|title=First Dutch NH90 NFH delivered - Australian Aviation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the consortium announced that they had completed delivery of the 200th NH90; at that point, the backlog of orders was reported as reaching out to 2020.&lt;ref name = &quot;simplify 90&quot;&gt;Perry, Dominic.

In 2014, worldwide production of the NH90 peaked at 53 helicopters.&lt;ref name = &quot;prod down&quot;/&gt; In October 2015, the delivery of the 250th NH90 was formally accepted by the Italian Army.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/nhindustries-delivers-nh90-italian-army/ &quot;250th NH90 helicopter delivered.&quot;] ''Shepard Media'', 16 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the rate of NH90 production declined, reportedly due to countries choosing to delay their orders and some contracts having been fulfilled; in 2016, the Finnish final assembly line became the first to close with orders for that line had been completed.&lt;ref name = &quot;prod down&quot;/&gt;

===Concerns over performance===
[[File:ILA 2010 Samstag 101.JPG|thumb|The lowered rear cargo ramp of a German Army NH90]]

In 2010, German newspaper ''[[Bild]]'' reported that German Army experts had concerns that the helicopter was not yet ready for the transportation of combat troops. They stated that the seats were only rated for 110&amp;nbsp;kg (240&amp;nbsp;lb), not considered enough for a fully equipped soldier. Heavy infantry weapons could not be adequately secured and the cabin floor was prone to damage, citing an anecdote of damage caused by footwear. The helicopter could only land on firm ground, with obstacles not exceeding 16&amp;nbsp;cm (6.3&amp;nbsp;in). Troops carrying full equipment could not use the rear ramp due to weight-limitations placed on it. Adding a door machine gun was not possible due to space taken by troop ingress and egress; there was also no provision for fast roping or paratroop equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2010/02/23/bundeswehr-nato-hubschrauber-nh90/modernster-helikopter-der-welt-hat-viele-maengel.html Bundeswehr NATO-Hubschrauber NH90: Modernster Helikopter der Welt hat viele Mängel – Politik]. Bild.de&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[German Defense Ministry]] proclaimed that this article referred to a prototype, not to the production model; the specifications for which were not even finalised at the time. The prototype evaluation and its results were described as a normal procedure in an ongoing design process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/hubschrauber110.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226222546/http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/hubschrauber110.html |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the MRH90 program was placed on the Australian Department of Defence's &quot;Projects of Concern&quot; list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Projects of Concern Update |url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/2011/11/28/minister-for-defence-and-minister-for-defence-materiel-projects-of-concern-update-2/ |work=Minister for Defence and Minister for Defence Materiel press release |publisher=Department of Defence (Australia) |accessdate=11 January 2012 |date=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious problem identified by a diagnostic review, which caused a brief grounding in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MRH90 recommencement of flying operations |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/departmentaltpl.cfm?CurrentId=10641 |work=Ministerial press release |publisher=Department of Defence (Australia) |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Axial compressor|compressor blade]] rubbing caused by the bending of a spool in the [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322]] engine due to uneven cooling after shutdown. Other problems identified include failure of transmission oil cooler fans, windscreen cracking, an inertial navigation system that is slow to align, and the weakness of the cabin floor to withstand the impact of soldiers’ boots – a problem also encountered in German service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perrett |first=Bradley |title=Australian NH90 Delayed Further |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/asd/2012/01/10/02.xml&amp;headline=Australian%20NH90%20Delayed%20Further |work=Aerospace Daily and Defense Report |publisher=Aviation Week |date=10 January 2012 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, it was announced that a Dutch NH90 had suffered higher than expected fuselage wear and corrosion following an extended deployment at sea; analysis by the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory attributed the corrosion to design and assembly flaws. In response, NHI Industries launched a corrosion prevention programme and enacted several design modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/dutch-maritime-nh90s-suffer-corrosion-397191/ |title=Dutch maritime NH90s suffer corrosion |last1=Gravemaker |first1=Anno |date=19 March 2014 |website= flightglobal.com |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Dutch NH90 deliveries, which had been temporarily halted earlier in the year, restarted after the majority of identified points were addressed and an agreement was made by the manufacturer to bear the cost of developing modifications, repairs, and preventive measures against corrosion.&lt;ref name = &quot;nh90 dutch resume&quot;&gt;Perry, Dominic.

==Design==
[[File:NHIndustries NH-90 NFH MM81581 ILA 2012 02.jpg|thumb|Italian Navy NH90 NFH in flight, 2012]]
The NH90 was designed to fulfill a NATO staff requirement for a multi-role, medium-sized military helicopter for both land and maritime operations.&lt;ref name = &quot;nhi require&quot;/&gt; According to Flight International, the NH90 has the distinction of being the first helicopter in the world to be developed in line with NATO requirements.&lt;ref name = &quot;flight wired 92&quot;&gt;Moxon, Julian.

In July 2014, the [[Australian National Audit Office]] released a report on the MRH90, citing a series of procurement errors and development deficiencies delaying final operational capability (FOC), originally planned for that month, until April 2019, nearly five years later than planned.  Some nine years after the initial contract was signed, the models first delivered in 2007 had not validated any of the 11 set operational capability milestones, and forced redesigns including bolstered cabin floors and windscreens, rappelling hooks, and door gunner positions; obtaining spare parts and sustaining the helicopters has also been more costly.

By November 2015, Sweden had ordered 18 NH90s with ten helicopters delivered.&lt;ref name=FI_WAF_2013/&gt;  Sweden did not expect their NH90s to be operational until 2020 and ordered 15 [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60M Black Hawks]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article12855753.ab |title= Sverige köper Black Hawk |publisher= aftonbladet.se |date= |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden deployed four of their new Black Hawks to Afghanistan in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikorsky.com/pages/AboutSikorsky/PressreleaseDetails.aspx?pressreleaseid=211 &quot;Sikorsky Meets Accelerated UH-60M BLACK HAWK Helicopter Deliveries for Sweden&quot;.] ''Sikorsky'', 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the first Swedish NH90 in a full ASW configuration was delivered.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, Chris.

===Cancelled orders===
;Portugal
Portugal was the fifth nation to join the programme with an order for ten transport NH90 in June 2001; it was intended for these to equip the [[Portuguese Army Light Aviation Unit]]. However, in July 2012, fiscal consequences of the [[Great Recession]] led Portugal to cancel the order, despite having already spent €87m on the project, in order to save another €420m in acquisition and running costs to 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?id=1065969205 |title=Portugal ducks out of NH90 programme |first=Victor |last=Barreira |date=3 July 2012 |work=Jane's: Defense &amp; Security Intelligence &amp; Analysis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710032719/http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065969205 |archivedate=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Dominic.

;Saudi Arabia
In July 2006, the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] Government agreed to purchase 64 NH90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.defense-aerospace.com/cgi-bin/client/modele.pl?session=dae.16783124.1132671768.Q4MzGMOa9dUAAF6SoX0&amp;modele=jdc_34 |author= de Briganti, Giovanni |title= Saudi Arabia Launches Huge Arms Buying Spree; France to Net Most Orders |work= Defense Aerospace |date= 25 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in October 2007 the government changed its plans, and agreed to buy 150 Russian-made [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-35]] and [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17]] helicopters instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/feature/87615/france-loses-out-as-saudis-sign-%242.2-billion-deal-for-russian-helos-%3Ci%3E(updated)%3C%C2%A7i%3E.html |title= France Loses Out as Saudis Sign $2.2 Billion Deal for Russian Helos |publisher= defense-aerospace.com |date= 2 November 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===NFH: NATO Frigate Helicopter===
The primary role of the NFH version is autonomous [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) and [[Anti-surface warfare|anti-surface unit warfare]] (ASuW), mainly from naval ships. These aircraft are equipped for day and night, adverse weather and severe ship motion operations.  Additional roles include anti-air warfare support, vertical replenishment ([[VERTREP]]), [[search and rescue]] (SAR) and troop transport. France are splitting their purchase between the &quot;NFH version combat&quot; costing €43.3m in FY2013 and the &quot;NFH version soutien&quot; (support) at €36.4m in FY2013.&lt;ref name=Francebudget2013&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/a13-158-8/a13-158-813.html#toc178 | title=Projet de loi de finances pour 2014 : Défense : équipement des forces et excellence technologique des industries de défense | language=French | publisher=Senate of France | date=21 November 2013 | accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TTH: Tactical Transport Helicopter===
[[File:20131105 WB N1026341 0017.jpg - Flickr - NZ Defence Force.jpg|thumbnail|right|Papua New Guinean troops seated combat laden in a New Zealand NH-90.]]
The primary role of the TTH version is the transport of 20 troops or more than 2,500&amp;nbsp;kg of cargo, heliborne operations and search &amp; rescue. It can quickly be adapted to MEDEVAC/CASEVAC missions by fitting up to 12 stretchers or cargo delivery capability.  Additional roles include special operations, electronic warfare, airborne command post, parachuting, [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] transport and flight training.

Sweden has bought the High Cabin Version (HCV) of the TTH, in which the cabin height is increased by {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1.82|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NH20070620&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhindustries.com/publications/en/ref/NH90-FIRST-DELIVERY-FOR-SWEDEN_343.html |title=NH90 First Delivery For Sweden |publisher=NH Industries |date=20 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish aircraft have a Tactical Mission System developed by SAAB&lt;ref name=NH20070620 /&gt; and are designated HKP14. Finnish and Swedish TTHs are called Tactical Troop Transports (TTT) in some contexts.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
On 1 June 2008, a NH90 tactical transport helicopter struck the water and sank into [[Lake Bracciano]], northwest of [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The helicopter was diving after completing a [[Fieseler (aerobatics)|Fieseler Maneuver]] at the Lake Bracciano Air Show.  Aircraft Commander Captain Filippo Fornassi was killed and co-pilot Captain Fabio Manzella was injured in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Peruzzi |first= Luca |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Italian army NH90 TTH fatal crash; no flying restrictions to remaining fleet |work= |publisher= Flight International |date= 2008-06-05 |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/06/05/224481/picture.html |doi= |accessdate= 27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The helicopter was a [[hull-loss]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helis.com/database/cn/16199/ &quot;MM81519&quot;] ''Helis''.
