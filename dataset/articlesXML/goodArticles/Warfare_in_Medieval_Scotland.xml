'''Warfare in Medieval Scotland''' includes all military activity in the modern borders of Scotland, or by forces originating in the region, between the departure of the [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Romans]] in the fifth century and the adoption of the innovations of the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century. In this period conflict developed from minor raids to major conflicts, incorporating many of the innovations of continental warfare.

In the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] war on land was characterised by the use of small war-bands of household troops often engaging in raids and low level warfare. The [[Viking expansion|arrival of the Viking]]s brought a new scale of naval warfare, with rapid movement based around the Viking [[longship]]. The [[Birlinn]], which developed from the longship, became a major factor in warfare in the Highlands and Islands. By the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], the [[kings of Scotland]] could command forces of tens of thousands of men for short periods as part of the &quot;common army&quot;, mainly of poorly armoured spearmen and bowmen. After the &quot;[[Davidian Revolution]]&quot; of the twelfth century, which introduced elements of [[feudalism]] to Scotland, these forces were augmented by small numbers of mounted and heavily armoured knights. Feudalism also introduced castles into the country, originally simple wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] constructions, but these were replaced in the thirteenth century with more formidable stone &quot;[[enceinte]]&quot; castles, with high encircling walls. In the thirteenth century the threat of Scandinavian naval power subsided and the kings of Scotland were able to use naval forces to help subdue the Highlands and Islands.

Scottish field armies rarely managed to stand up to the usually larger and more professional armies produced by England, but they were used to good effect by [[Robert the Bruce|Robert I of Scotland]] at [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 to secure Scottish independence. He adopted a policy of [[slighting]] castles and made use of naval power to support his forces, beginning to develop a royal Scottish naval force. In the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]] under the [[Royal House of Stewart|Stewart kings]] these forces were further augmented by specialist troops, particularly [[men-at-arms]] and [[archery|archers]], hired by bonds of ''[[manrent]]'', similar to English [[indentures]] of the same period. New &quot;[[livery and maintenance]]&quot; castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons. The Stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare, such as longer pikes, the extensive use of artillery, and they built up a formidable navy. However, one of the best armed and largest Scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at the hands of an English army at [[the Battle of Flodden]] in 1513, which saw the destruction of a large number of ordinary troops, a large section of the nobility and the king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]].

===Warriors===
In the politically divided world of early medieval Scotland the nucleus of most armed forces was a leader's bodyguard or war-band. In the [[Brythonic languages|British language]], this was called the ''teulu'', as in ''teulu Dewr'' (the &quot;War-band of Deira&quot;). In Latin the most common word in this period is ''tutores'', and derives from the Latin verb ''tueor'', meaning &quot;defend, preserve from danger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;L. Alcock, ''Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550–850'' (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 2003), ISBN 0-903903-24-5, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In peace-time, the war-band's activity was centred around the &quot;Great Hall&quot;. Here, in both Germanic and Celtic cultures, the feasting, drinking and other forms of male bonding that kept up the war-band's integrity would take place. In the contemporaneous [[Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', the war-band was said to sleep in the Great Hall after the lord had retired to his adjacent bedchamber.&lt;ref name=Alcock&gt;L. Alcock, ''Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550–850'' (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 2003), ISBN 0-903903-24-5, pp. 248–9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not likely that any war-band in the period exceeded 120–150 men, as no hall structure having a capacity larger than this has been found by archaeologists in northern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;L. Alcock, ''Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550–850'' (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 2003), ISBN 0-903903-24-5, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The war-band was the core of the larger armies that were mobilised from time to time for campaigns of significant size.&lt;ref name=Alcock/&gt; These wider forces depended on the obligations to defend a province or kingdom by land and sea. Early sources from [[Dál Riata]] indicate an attempt to define this as an obligation based on landholding, with obligations to provide a specified number of men or ships based on the amount of land held by an individual.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. M. Duncan, &quot;The Making of the Kingdom&quot; in, R. Mitchison, ed., ''Why Scottish History Matters'' (Edinburgh: Saltire Society, 1997), ISBN 0854110704, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictish stones, like that at [[Aberlemno]] in Angus, show warriors with swords, spears, bows, helmets and shields.&lt;ref name=Yorke2009&gt;B. Yorke, &quot;Kings and kingship&quot;, in P. Stafford, ed., ''A Companion to the Early Middle Ages: Britain and Ireland, c.500-c.1100'' (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), ISBN 1-4051-0628-X, pp. 76–90.&lt;/ref&gt; These images may show infantry in formation, or gathered together for protection, and they show mounted troops, sometimes heavily armoured, suggesting a mounted warrior elite.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mersey, ''Warriors'' (Conway: Maritime Press, 2007), ISBN 1-84486-039-6, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hill forts===
{{Main|Hill forts in Scotland}}
Early fortifications in Scotland, particularly in the north and west, included modest stone built towers known as [[brochs]] and [[dun]]s and, particularly in the south and east larger [[hill forts]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Piggott and J. Thirsk, ''The Agrarian History of England and Wales: Prehistory: Volume 1 of Agrarian History of England and Wales'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), ISBN 0-521-08741-4, pp. 124–5.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age [[List of hill forts in Scotland|hillforts in Scotland]], most located below the Clyde-Forth line.&lt;ref name=Lepage2010pp25-31/&gt; They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.&lt;ref&gt;A. Konstam, ''Strongholds of the Picts: The Fortifications of Dark Age Scotland'' (Botley: Osprey, 2010), ISBN 1846036860, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most are circular, with a single [[palisade]] around an enclosure.&lt;ref name=Lepage2010pp25-31&gt;J-D. G. G. Lepage, ''British Fortifications Through the Reign of Richard III: An Illustrated History'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2012), ISBN 0-7864-5918-2, pp. 25 and 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Forts of the Early Medieval era were often smaller, more compact, &quot;nucleated&quot; constructions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=S. Piggott |contribution= |date= |title=The Prehistoric Peoples of Scotland |journal= |editor= |edition= |oclc = 560286204|= |issn= |volume= |page= 141|place=London |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, 1962 |url= |accessdate= |authorlink= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes utilising major geographical features, as at [[Dunadd]] and [[Dumbarton Castle|Dunbarton]].&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland, C. AD 400–1200'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 2006), ISBN 0-521-54740-7, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of hill forts in Scotland may have made open battle less important than it was in contemporaneous Anglo-Saxon England, and the relatively high proportion of kings who are recorded as dying in fires, suggest that sieges were a more important part of warfare in Northern Britain.&lt;ref name=Yorke2009/&gt;

===Ships===
{{Main|Medieval ships}}
[[File:Vidfamne-01.jpg|thumb|left|Modern replica of a Viking [[Knarr]]]]
Sea power may also have been important. Irish annals record an attack by the Picts on Orkney in 682, which must have necessitated a large naval force,&lt;ref name=RitchieandRichie1991pp171-2&gt;J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0291-7, pp. 171–2.&lt;/ref&gt; and also they lost 150 ships in a disaster in 729.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Edwards and I. Ralston, ''Scotland after the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), ISBN 0-7486-1736-1, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Ships were also vital in the amphibious warfare in the Highlands and Islands and from the seventh century the ''[[Senchus fer n-Alban]]'' indicates that Dál Riata had a ship-muster system that obliged groups of households to produce a total of 177 ships and 2,478 men. The same source mentions the first recorded naval battle around the British Isles in 719 and eight naval expeditions between 568 and 733.&lt;ref&gt;N. A. M. Rodger, ''The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660–1649'' (London: Harper, 1997), ISBN 0-14-191257-X, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The only vessels to survive form this period are [[dugout canoe]]s, but images from the period suggest that there may have been skin boats (similar to the Irish [[currach]]) and larger oared vessels.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. AD 400–1200'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 2006), ISBN 0-521-54740-7, pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Viking raids and invasions of the British Isles were based on superior sea-power, which enabled the creation of the [[thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] (sea-based lordships) of the north and west. The [[Viking ships|long-ship]], the key to their success, was a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over [[portage]]s. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/exhibitions/the-skuldelev-ships/skuldelev-2/ &quot;Skuldelev 2 – The great longship&quot;], Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde, retrieved 25 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.

===Land forces===
[[File:DavidI&amp;squire.jpg|thumb|right|[[David I of Scotland|David I]] knighting a squire.]]
By the twelfth century the ability to call on wider bodies of men for major campaigns had become formalised as the &quot;common&quot; (''communis exercitus'') or &quot;Scottish army&quot; (''exercitus Scoticanus''), based on a universal obligation linked to the holding of variously named units of land.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. S. Barrow, ''Scotland and its Neighbours in the Middle Ages'' (London: Continuum, 1992), ISBN 1-85285-052-3, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be used to produce a regional army, as the future [[Robert the Bruce|Robert I]] did when from 1298–1302 when, as Earl of Carrick, he raised &quot;my army of Carrick&quot;, but also a national Scottish army, as he did later in the [[Scottish Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Brown, ''Bannockburn: the Scottish War and the British Isles, 1307–1323'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2008), ISBN 0-7486-3333-2, pp. 95–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Later decrees indicated that the common army was a levy of all able-bodied freemen aged between 16 and 60, with 8-days warning.&lt;ref name=Brown2004&gt;M. Brown, ''The Wars of Scotland, 1214–1371'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), ISBN 0-7486-1238-6, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; It produced relatively large numbers of men serving for a limited period, usually as unarmoured or poorly armoured bowmen and spearmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;J. Stringer, 1993 pp. 30-1&quot;&gt;K. J. Stringer, ''The Reign of Stephen: Kingship, Warfare, and Government in Twelfth-Century England'' (London: Psychology Press, 1993), ISBN 0-415-01415-8, pp. 30–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period it continued to be mustered by the [[Mormaer|earls]] and they often led their men in battle, as was the case in the [[Battle of the Standard]] in 1138. It would continue to provide the vast majority of Scottish national armies, potentially producing tens of thousands of men for short periods of conflict, into the early modern era.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-58602-X, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

There also developed obligations that produced smaller numbers of [[feudal]] troops. The introduction of feudalism to Scotland is usually attributed to the [[Davidian Revolution]] of the twelfth century. When [[David I of Scotland|David I]] acceded to the Scottish throne in 1124 after spending much of his life living as a baron in England, he brought with him a number of Anglo-Norman vassals, to whom he distributed lands and titles, first in the lowlands and borders and then later in buffer zones in the North and West. Geoffrey Barrow wrote that among other changes this brought &quot;fundamental innovations in military organization&quot;. These included the [[knight's fee]], [[Homage (feudal)|homage and fealty]], as well as castle-building and the regular use of professional cavalry,&lt;ref&gt;G. W. S. Barrow, &quot;David I of Scotland: The Balance of New and Old&quot;, in G. W. S. Barrow (ed.), ''Scotland and Its Neighbours in the Middle Ages'' (London: Continuum, 1992), ISBN 1-85285-052-3, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; as knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2004&quot;/&gt; David's Norman followers and their retinues were able to provide a force of perhaps 200 mounted and armoured knights, but the vast majority of his forces were the &quot;common army&quot; of poorly armed infantry, capable of performing well in raiding and guerrilla warfare, but only infrequently able to stand up to the English in the field, as they managed to do critically in the wars of independence at [[Battle of Stirling Bridge|Stirling Bridge]] in 1297 and [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] in 1314.&lt;ref name=&quot;J. Stringer, 1993 pp. 30-1&quot;/&gt;

===Castles===
{{Main|Castles in Britain}}
Castles, in the sense of a fortified residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands.&lt;ref name=Simpson&amp;Webster2003p225&gt;G. G. Simpson and B. Webster, &quot;Charter Evidence and the Distribution of Mottes in Scotland,&quot; in R. Liddiard, ed., ''Anglo-Norman Castles'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2003), ISBN 978-0-85115-904-1, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Tabraham, ''Scotland's Castles'' (London: Batsford, 2005), ISBN 978-0-7134-8943-9, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Hull, ''Britain's Medieval Castles'' (Westport: Praeger, 2006), ISBN 978-0-275-98414-4, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; These were primarily wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;West1985p26&quot;&gt;T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They varied in size from the very large such as the [[Inverurie|Bass of Inverurie]], to more modest designs like [[Balmaclellan]].&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Tabraham, ''Scotland's Castles'' (London: Batsford, 2005), ISBN 978-0-7134-8943-9, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunstaffnage Castle 20080428.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dunstaffnage Castle]], one of the oldest surviving &quot;castles of enceinte&quot;, mostly dating from the thirteenth century]]
In England many of these constructions were converted into stone &quot;[[keep|keep-and-bailey]]&quot; castles in the twelfth century, but in Scotland most of those that were in continued occupation became stone castles of &quot;[[enceinte]]&quot;, with a high [[battlements|embattled]] curtain wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;West1985p26&quot;/&gt; In addition to the baronial castles there were royal castles, often larger and providing defence, lodging for the itinerant Scottish court and a local administrative centre. By 1200 these included fortifications at [[Ayr Castle|Ayr]] and [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]].&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Tabraham, ''Scotland's Castles'' (London: Batsford, 2005), ISBN 978-0-7134-8943-9, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[wars of Scottish Independence]] Robert I adopted a policy of castle destruction, rather than allow fortresses to be easily taken or retaken by the English and held against him, beginning with his own castles at Ayr and [[Dumfries]],&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Hamilton, ''The Plantagenets: History of a Dynasty'' (London: Continuum, 2010), ISBN 1-4411-5712-3, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and including [[Roxburgh Castle|Roxburgh]] and [[Edinburgh Castle|Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D.

===Marine forces===
{{Main|Medieval ships}}
In the Highlands and Islands, the longship was gradually succeeded by (in ascending order of size) the [[birlinn]], highland [[galley]] and [[lymphad]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Murdoch, ''The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513–1713'' (Leiden: Brill, 2010), ISBN 90-04-18568-2, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; which, were [[clinker-built]] ships, usually with a centrally-stepped mast, but also with oars that allowed them to be rowed. Like the longship, they had a high stem and stern, and were still small and light enough to be dragged across portages, but they replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mallaigheritage.org.uk/exhibit/galleys.htm &quot;Highland Galleys&quot;] Mallaig Heritage Centre, retrieved 25 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They could fight at sea, but rarely were able to match armed ships of the Scottish or English navies. However, they could usually outrun larger vessels and were extremely useful in quick raids and in aiding escape.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''The Politics of Religion in the Age of Mary, Queen of Scots: The Earl of Argyll and the Struggle for Britain and Ireland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), ISBN 0-521-80996-7, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of [[ounceland]]s and [[pennyland]]s, which have been argued to date back to the muster system of Dál Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Williams, &quot;Land assessment and the silver economy of Norse Scotland&quot;, in G. Williams and P. Bibire, eds, ''Sagas, Saints and Settlements'' (Leiden: Brill, 2004), ISBN 90-04-13807-2, pp. 66–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to feudal obligations, with Celtic-Scandinavian lords, who had previously contributed as a result of a general levy on landholding, coming to hold their lands in exchange for specified numbers and sizes of ships supplied to the king. This process probably began in the thirteenth century, but would be intensified under Robert I.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. S. Barrow, ''Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 4th edn., 2005), ISBN 0-7486-2022-2, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of these ships was underlined by their becoming common in depictions on grave markers and in heraldry throughout the Highlands and Islands.&lt;ref&gt;D. Goudsward, ''The Westford Knight and Henry Sinclair: Evidence of a fourteenth Century Scottish Voyage to North America'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010), ISBN 0-7864-4649-8, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish victories in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries have been seen as part of a wider &quot;[[Military Revolution#The infantry revolution and the decline of cavalry|infantry revolution]]&quot;, that saw a decline in the primacy of the mounted knight on the battlefield. However, it has been pointed out that Scottish medieval armies had probably always been dependent on infantry forces.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Kaeuper, ''Violence in Medieval Society'' (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2000), ISBN 0-85115-774-2, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late medieval period Scottish men-at-arms often dismounted to fight beside the infantry, with perhaps a small mounted reserve, and it has been suggested that these tactics were copied and refined by the English, leading to their successes in the Hundred Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;H.-Henning Kortüm, ''Transcultural Wars from the Middle Ages to the 21st Century'' (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2006), ISBN 3-05-004131-5, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the English, the Scots deployed mounted archers, and even spearmen, who were particularly useful in the mobile raids that characterised border warfare, but like the English they fought on foot.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2006p24&gt;P. Armstrong, ''Otterburn 1388: Bloody Border Conflict'' (Botley: Osprey, 2006), ISBN 1-84176-980-0, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the fourteenth century, in addition to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of ''bonds'' or ''bands of [[manrent]]'', similar to English [[indentures]] of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular [[men-at-arms]] and [[archery|archers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2004&quot;/&gt; In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred.&lt;ref name=Brown2004/&gt; These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of [[shiltron]]s, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at [[The Battle of Otterburn|Otterburn]] in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later [[artillery]] fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] in 1333 and [[Battle of Humbleton Hill|Humbleton Hill]] in 1402.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2006p108&gt;P. Armstrong, ''Otterburn 1388: Bloody Border Conflict'' (Botley: Osprey, 2006), ISBN 1-84176-980-0, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-58602-X, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were attempts to replace spears with longer pikes of {{convert|15.5|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|18.5|ft|m|0}} in the later fifteenth century, in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland, but this does not appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cooper, ''Scottish Renaissance Armies 1513–1550'' (Botley: Osprey, 2008), ISBN 1-84603-325-X, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; There were smaller numbers of archers and men-at-arms, which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Contamine1992/&gt; Scottish archers were mainly drawn from the border regions, with those from [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]] Forest gaining a particularly reputation.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2006p24/&gt; They became much sought after as mercenaries in French armies of the fifteenth century, in order to help counter the English superiority in this arm, becoming a major element of the French royal guards as the [[Garde Écossaise]].&lt;ref name=Contamine1992&gt;P.

[[File:Ravenscraig Castle 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ravenscraig Castle]], perhaps the first fortification in the British Isles to take account of gunpowder artillery: the large D-plan bastion towers can be seen on either wing]]
After the Wars of Independence, new castles began to be built, often on a grander scale as &quot;[[livery and maintenance]]&quot; castles, to house retained troops, like [[Tantallon Castle|Tantallon]], Lothian and [[Doune Castle|Doune]] near Stirling, rebuilt for [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;West1985p26&quot;/&gt; The largest number of Late Medieval fortifications in Scotland built by nobles, about 800,&lt;ref&gt;A.

D. Whyte, and K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500–1800'' (London: Routledge, 1991) ISBN 978-0-415-02992-6, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&amp;MacKechniep6&gt;M.

Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture, with existing castles being adapted to allow the use of gunpowder weapons by the incorporation of &quot;keyhole&quot; gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls being adapted to resist bombardment. [[Ravenscraig Castle|Ravenscraig]], Kirkcaldy, begun about 1460, is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an artillery fort, incorporating &quot;D-shape&quot; bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted.&lt;ref name=West1985p27&gt;T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the period royal builders in Scotland adopted European Renaissance styles in castle design. The grandest buildings of this type were the royal palaces in this style at [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]], [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]], [[Falkland Palace|Falkland]] and the remodelled [[Stirling Castle]], begun by James IV.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Vanderjagt, ''Princes and Princely Culture, 1450–1650, Volume 1'' (Leiden: Brill, 2003), ISBN 90-04-13572-3, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong influence from France and the Low Countries can be seen in the fashionable design of a quadrangular court with stair-turrets on each corner.&lt;ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&amp;MacKechniep34&gt;M.

===Siege engines and artillery===
The Wars of Independence brought the first recorded instances of major mechanical artillery in Scotland. Edward I used a range of [[siege engine]]s, which were carefully constructed, transported, deployed, dismantled and stored for reuse. This began with the siege of [[Caerlaverock Castle]] in 1300. Here, after the failure of an initial assault, a small rock-throwing engine was employed, while three large engines (probably [[trebuchet]], using a counter-weight mechanism), were constructed. Their destruction of walls demoralised the garrison and forced a surrender. Edward's armies deployed several such engines, often named, with &quot;[[Warwolf]]&quot;, one of 17 used in the capture of [[Stirling Castle]] in 1304, being the best known. They also deployed lighter bolt-shooting [[balista]]s, belfry [[siege towers]] and on one occasion a covered sow. Some of these were supplied by Robert Earl of Carrick, the future Robert I, who was present on the English side.&lt;ref&gt;D. Cornell, ''Bannockburn: The Triumph of Robert the Bruce'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009), ISBN 0-300-14568-3, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish armies, with more limited resources and expertise tended to rely on assault, blockade and subterfuge as siege tactics. Robert I is known to have employed siege engines against the English, but often with little success, as at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in 1315 where his siege tower floundered in mud.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brown, ''Scottish Baronial Castles 1250–1450'' (Botley: Osprey, 2009), ISBN 1-84603-286-5, pp. 33–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity in siege technology has been seen as resulting in a policy of castle destruction by Robert I.&lt;ref name=&quot;D. Cornell, 2009 p. 124&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Mons Meg, Medieval Bombard, Edinburgh, Scotland. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mons Meg]] at Edinburgh Castle, with its 20&quot; (50 cm) calibre [[Round shot|cannonballs]]]]
Edward I had the major ingredients for gunpowder shipped to Stirling in 1304, probably to produce a form of [[Greek fire]], to be shot into the town in earthenware pots by siege engines.&lt;ref&gt;M. Prestwich, ''Edward I'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1988), ISBN 0-520-06266-3, p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt; The English probably had projectile gunpowder artillery in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade.&lt;ref name=Caldwell2007/&gt; The first clear recorded use in Britain was when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] besieged Berwick in 1333, where it was used alongside mechanical siege engines.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Wagner, ''Encyclopedia of the Hundred Years War'' (London: Greenwood, 2006), ISBN 0-313-32736-X, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341.&lt;ref name=Caldwell2007/&gt; Gunpowder artillery began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;P. Purton, ''A History of the Late Medieval Siege, 1200–1500'' (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2009), ISBN 1-84383-449-9, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an artillery train. The abortive siege of Roxburgh in 1436 under James I was probably the first conflict in which the Scots made serious use of artillery.&lt;ref name=Caldwell2007&gt;D. H. Caldwell, &quot;The Scots and guns&quot;, in A. King and M. A. Penman, eds, ''England and Scotland in the Fourteenth Century: New Perspectives'' (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2007), ISBN 1-84383-318-2, pp. 60–72.&lt;/ref&gt; James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of artillery from the continent, including two giant bombards made for [[Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy]], one of which, [[Mons Meg]], still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kinard, ''Artillery: An Illustrated History of its Impact'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2007), ISBN 1-85109-556-X, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life and demonstrated some of the dangers of early artillery, when a gun exploded at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue [[Norham Castle]] in the Flodden campaign.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Navy===

[[File:Model of 'The Michael', Newhaven Primary School, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|right|A model of [[Michael (ship)|the Great Michael]], the largest ship in the world when launched in 1511]]
English naval power was vital to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s successful campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland and his allies in the Islands to transport and supply his armies.&lt;ref name=Rodger1997pp74-90&gt;N. A. M. Rodger, ''The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660–1649'' (London: Harper, 1997) pp. 74–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason for Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea.&lt;ref name=Rodger1997pp74-90/&gt; The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314.&lt;ref name=Rodger1997pp74-90/&gt; Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.&lt;ref name=Rodger1997pp74-90/&gt;

After the establishment of Scottish independence, Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal [[man-of-war]] near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]]. In the late fourteenth century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;J. Grant, &quot;The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710&quot;, ''Publications of the Navy Records Society'', 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913-4), pp. i–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; James I took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424, he established a shipbuilding yard at [[Leith]], a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429. The office of [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland|Lord High Admiral]] was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the ''Flower'' and the ''King's Carvel'' also known as the ''Yellow Carvel''.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

James IV put the enterprise on a new footing, founding a harbour at [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]] in May 1504, and two years later ordering the construction of a dockyard at the Pools of [[Airth]]. The upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on [[Inchgarvie]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Macdougall, ''James IV'' (East Lothian: Tuckwell, 1997), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The king acquired a total of 38 ships for the [[Royal Scottish Navy]], including the ''[[Scottish warship Margaret|Margaret]]'', and the [[carrack]] ''[[Michael (ship)|Michael]]'' or ''Great Michael''.&lt;ref name=Smout1992p45&gt;T.

After a raid on Carrickfergus in Ireland, it joined up with the French and had little impact on the war. After the disaster at Flodden the Great Michael, and perhaps other ships, were sold to the French and the king's ships disappeared from royal records after 1516.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;{{clear}}
