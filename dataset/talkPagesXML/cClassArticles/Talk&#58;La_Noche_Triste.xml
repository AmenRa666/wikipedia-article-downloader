==Creation==
I have copied this section from [[Hernan Cortes]]. It is not very encyclopedic but I didn't want to remove it. [[User:Pietdesomere|Piet]] 13:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

==Disagree with decision to move this section from Hernan Cortes==
I think it is a mistake to have moved this section from [[Hernan Cortes]].  I agree that both that article and this one need quite a bit of editing but I think we should consider moving some or all of this back to the [[Hernan Cortes]] article.  I'm not going to do that but I think the idea deserves discussion.  It is true that some of the text is &quot;not encyclopedic&quot; but most of the content of the [[La Noche Triste]] article is and so the &quot;not encyclopedic&quot; criticism is not sufficient to warrant moving this out of the [[Hernan Cortes]] article.  

If it make sense to move [[La Noche Triste]] out of the [[Hernan Cortes]] article, then it would also make sense to move other descriptions of military campaigns e.g. the defeat of the Tlaxcaltecas or the Destruction of Cholula.

==WP:MilHist Assessment==
I feel bad to assess this differently from how the Aztec Project already has. But this is a pretty short article, with no infoboxes or pictures. I suppose the existence of so many other closely related articles ([[Siege of Tenochtitlan]], [[The massacre in the Main Temple, Tenochtitlán]]) force this article to be shorter; so much of what could be said here is already covered in other places. Still, there are plenty of articles much longer and much more detailed that have a B-class designation... [[User:LordAmeth|LordAmeth]] 17:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

==Unclear section==
However he did despair and of all he lost he asked after only one, Martin Lopez, the shipbuilder. When told he was alive he said, ''&quot;Vamos, que faltamos nada.&quot; (&quot;Let's go for we lack nothing.&quot;)'' What the fuck is this supposed to mean? Especially that first sentence... it's unsalvageable! Can the original author clarify? 
[[User:Stormchaser|Stormchaser]] ([[User talk:Stormchaser|talk]]) 16:31, 1 May 2008 (UTC)

:Not the ''original'' author (whom I suspect may have been dead for quite some time) or the one who put it here (I only just arrived), and it appears that the passage is no longer present in the article, but its grammar is entirely correct and its meaning perfectly clear: it is merely written in a style now somewhat old fashioned. (Sounds like Prescott, which would make it 1840's.) Perhaps explication would demonstrate if any of the information is worth retaining. Here goes:
::However &lt;s&gt;he&lt;/s&gt; ''Cortés'' &lt;s&gt;did&lt;/s&gt; despair''ed because so many of his personnel had been killed or captured'' and of all ''those'' he ''thought he had'' lost he asked after only one ''man'', Martin Lopez, the shipbuilder. When told &lt;s&gt;he&lt;/s&gt; ''Lopez'' was alive he said, ''&quot;Vamos, que faltamos nada.&quot; (&quot;Let's go for we lack nothing.&quot;), since as long as they had someone who could build boats they could still escape''.

== María Estrada ==

This article says she was Cortés' mistress but her article says she was someone else's wife.  I think it is highly unlikely she was both at the same time. [[User:GS3|GS3]] ([[User talk:GS3|talk]]) 19:41, 24 February 2014 (UTC)</text>
