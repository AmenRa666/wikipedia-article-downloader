== 1453 or 1456 ==

This article contradics itself . One sentence claims that Veli Mahmut was  appointed as the Grand Vizier in 1456 and another one claims that he was named Grand Vizier within months after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. (According to my sources the former claim is correct) I'll call the editor. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 09:02, 7 March 2011 (UTC)

:Fixed it. For some reason, I probably confused him with [[Zağanos Pasha]]. For the life of me I can't remember why however. I also added some more info on Mahmud's independent campaigns and his end. It strikes me however that this article should be at [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović]], as this form is by far more common in English sources. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 17:14, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

I don't agree. ''Mahmut'' was his name and ''Pasha'' was his title. In old Turkish (unlike European languages) the titles always follow the proper nouns. If the proposed  Mahmud Pasha Angelović is used as a article title, you see that the title would be replaced between the two proper nouns. This type of naming is neither Turkish nor European. [[User:Nedim Ardoğa|Nedim Ardoğa]] ([[User talk:Nedim Ardoğa|talk]]) 12:06, 9 March 2011 (UTC)

:The fact remains that this is the more commonly used form of the name, used in most English-language books, even those where the Turkish form of the names is otherwise preserved intact (Finkel for instance). Per WP:COMMONNAME, the article belongs at [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović]]. The fact that &quot;pasha&quot; comes between the first name and the surname is not really an argument, if this name is standard scholarly usage. I also point out that all the other-language wikis use either plain &quot;Mahmud Pasha&quot; or &quot;Mahmud Pasha Angelović&quot;. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 10:33, 21 March 2011 (UTC)

==Why Mahmud Pasha Anđelović is a Croat?==
What conclusions result that he was a Croat, except that any sources are cited? The Anđelović, Mahmud and his brother Mihailo, were Serbs with Greek descent of the Philanthropenoi family. Are there any Croatian ancestors known, that we could say that they were Croats or with Croatian descent?--[[User:Carski|Carski]] ([[User talk:Carski|talk]]) 22:22, 7 June 2011 (UTC)
Ottoman sources claim he was Croat and they are 100 per cent correct.

[[:Mahmud Pasha]] → {{no redirect|Mahmud Pasha Angelovic}} – This Mahmud Pasha is not [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]] because there are two more Grand Viziers by the same name ([[Mahmud Nedim Pasha]] and [[Mahmud Shevket Pasha]]) and an admiral, among others, see some of them listed in [[Mahmud Pasha (disambiguation)]]. &quot;Mahmud Pasha Angelovic&quot; yields 30-odd results in Google Books, and 25 results in Google Scholar while Mahmud Shevket Pasha alone yields similar number of results in Google Books and 37 results in Google Scholar. According to WP:PRIMARYTOPIC, &quot;A topic is primary for a term, with respect to usage, if it is highly likely—much more likely than any other topic, and '''more likely than all the other topics combined'''—to be the topic sought when a reader searches for that term&quot;, a criteria which Mahmud Pasha Angelovic fail to fulfill. Therefore I suggest renaming the article. &lt;small&gt;''Relisted''. [[User:Jenks24|Jenks24]] ([[User talk:Jenks24|talk]]) 07:03, 14 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;Relisted.

* '''Weak support''' - he seems to have strongest claim to primary, but disamb won't hurt. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 10:45, 5 March 2013 (UTC)

* I concur that this person isn't the primary topic - in the top 10 gbooks search results there are several that don't discuss him. However, the disambiguation marker seems a bit off. http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Mahmud+Pasha%22+1474&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;pws=0 says around 1,300 results; http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Mahmud+Pasha%22+Angelovic+1474&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;pws=0 gives only around 177 results. But when I click through to the last page on each search, the ratio goes to 21 vs. 51. Looking for this 'Angelovic' surname in this context, I found that there's ambiguity whether it was actually &quot;Anđelović&quot;, &quot;Abogović&quot; or &quot;Bogojević&quot;. Some other disambiguation marker should be used, rather than conjecture. --[[User:Joy|Joy &amp;#91;shallot&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Joy|talk]]) 14:29, 5 March 2013 (UTC)

*'''Support''' [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović]]. I get 61 genuine gbooks hits for the this title and either 1 or 0 for Joy's, looks to me like &quot;Mahmud Pasha Angelović&quot; is the clear common name. Of the eight sources I checked through gbooks, six used the diacritic and this was a previous title of the article. [[User:Jenks24|Jenks24]] ([[User talk:Jenks24|talk]]) 12:37, 26 March 2013 (UTC)

== Misquoting source ==

Stavrides quite explicitly explains that Mahmud Pasha was not a Croat in any sense other than political -- using the South Slavic ambiguity in defining Serbs and Croats for personal diplomatic purposes. He lists quite in detail reasons why the subject was a Serb-Greek. Why is the preposterous and insane idea of Mahmud Pasha's quasi-croatness being pushed forth by misquoting sources?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/59.41.252.228|59.41.252.228]] ([[User talk:59.41.252.228|talk]]) 21:12, 19 April 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Missing diacritic ==

The best sources elaborating on him use &quot;ć&quot;. The common name is ''Mahmud Pasha Angelović''. This was neglected in the previous move request, although stated. This was the article name in 2011‎.--[[User_talk:Zoupan|Z&lt;small&gt;oupan&lt;/small&gt;]] 20:58, 20 February 2016 (UTC)
