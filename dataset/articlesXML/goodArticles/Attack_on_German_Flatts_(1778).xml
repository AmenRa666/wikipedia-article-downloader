The '''Attack on German Flatts''' (September 17, 1778) was a raid on the frontier settlement of [[German Flatts, New York]] (which then also encompassed what is now [[Herkimer (town), New York|Herkimer]]) during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The attack was made by a mixed force of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and [[Iroquois]] under the overall command of [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leader [[Joseph Brant]], and resulted in the destruction of houses, barns, and crops, and the taking of livestock for the raiders' use.  The settlers, warned by the heroic run of [[Adam Helmer]], took refuge in local forts but were too militarily weak to stop the raiders.

Brant's attack was one of a series executed under his command or that of Loyalist and [[Seneca people|Seneca]] leaders against communities on what was then the frontier of western [[New York (state)|New York]] and northern [[Pennsylvania]].  New York authorities responded by ordering an expedition that [[Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga|destroyed]] Brant's forward operating bases in Iroquois territory.

==Background==
{{main|Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga}}
With the failure of British General [[John Burgoyne]]'s [[Saratoga campaign|campaign to the Hudson]] after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the [[American Revolutionary War]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] became a frontier war.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;  British leaders in the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] supported [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;  During the winter of 1777–78 Brant and other British-allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at [[Onaquaga]] (present-day [[Windsor (village), New York|Windsor, New York]]).  He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in late May.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G165&gt;Graymont, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of [[John Butler (pioneer)|John Butler]], who was planning operations in the [[Susquehanna River]] valley.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;  His first expedition was a [[Battle of Cobleskill|raid on Cobleskill]], and he raided other frontier communities throughout the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt;

German Flatts was located about one third of the way east from there to Albany, along the Mohawk River.  The Indian towns of Unadilla and Onaquaga were located near the mouth of the Unadilla River, where it empties into the Susquehanna.]]
When he raided settlements at [[Springfield, New York|Springfield]] and Andrustown (present-day [[Jordanville, New York|Jordanville]]) in July, Brant left the survivors with warnings that German Flatts would soon also be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;  The settlement of German Flatts (now known as [[Herkimer (village), New York|Herkimer]] due to a survey error in 1788 that reversed the names of Herkimer and what is now [[German Flatts, New York|German Flatts]] on the south bank of the [[Mohawk River]])&lt;ref&gt;Perkins and Hopson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1723 by [[German Palatines|Palatine German]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The district was defended by a local militia regiment under the command of Colonel [[Peter Bellinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, pp. 31, 66&lt;/ref&gt; There were two main forts, [[Fort Dayton]] and [[Fort Herkimer]], on either side of the Mohawk.&lt;ref name=Halsey226/&gt;

==Prelude==
Although Brant had planned on raiding German Flatts sooner than September, the absence of John Butler delayed his plans.  Butler had returned to [[Fort Niagara]] after his [[Battle of Wyoming|attack]] on the Wyoming Valley communities in July, sending Captain [[William Caldwell (ranger)|William Caldwell]] to Unaquaga to recruit men for the unit known as [[Butler's Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  By early September it was clear that Butler was not returning to the area, so Brant and Caldwell launched the expedition with the men they had.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact composition of the force that left [[Unadilla (village), New York|Unadilla]] is unclear.  Sources generally agree that 152 Iroquois, principally [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], were in the force, but that the Loyalists (in either Caldwell's Ranger company or in [[Brant's Volunteers|Brant's company of volunteers]]) numbered between 200 and 300.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B151&gt;Barr, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fryer, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Brant by Gilbert Stuart 1786 oil on canvas.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Brant]], portrait by [[Gilbert Stuart]]]]
Because of warnings received earlier that Brant was planning an attack, Colonel Bellinger had been sending out scouts in the direction of Unadilla to gather intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 16 Brant's company overwhelmed a scouting party of nine, killing a few and scattering the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the survivors was [[Adam Helmer]], who ran {{convert|26|mi|km}} ahead of the advancing force to warn German Flatts.  Colonel Bellinger sounded the call to arms of his regiment and sent an urgent request to Colonel [[Jacob Klock (colonel)|Jacob Klock]] for the assistance of his regiment, while the settlers took refuge in the forts.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raid==
Caldwell, Brant, and their men arrived at German Flatts not long after Helmer's warning, on the evening of September 16, and began their attack the next morning.&lt;ref name=Halsey226&gt;Halsey, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the settlers had taken refuge in the forts, there was no significant opportunity for the raiders to take prisoners or scalps.  They demonstrated before the forts, but lacked heavy weapons with which to properly assault them.&lt;ref name=B151/&gt;  They instead rampaged through the communities on both sides of the Mohawk, destroying 63 homes, a similar number of barns, three grist mills, and one saw mill.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  They drove off a large number of horses, cattle, and sheep, killing those they could not take with them.  The only buildings left standing were the forts, a barn, the church, and the homes of the minister and a few Loyalists.  More than 700 people were made homeless by their destruction.  Because of Helmer's warning only three Americans were killed.  Captain Caldwell wrote that his men &quot;would have in all probability killed most of the inhabitants of German Flatts had they not been apprised of our coming by one of the scouts getting in and warning of our approach, and perhaps got to their forts&quot;.&lt;ref name=G179&gt;Graymont, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Klock's regiment did not arrive until after the raiders had left.  The militia pursued the raiders, but were unable to catch up with them.  Some friendly [[Oneida people|Oneidas]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscaroras]], however, capitalized on Brant's absence from Unadilla to raid that town, freeing prisoners that Brant had taken while en route to German Flatts.&lt;ref name=G179/&gt;

The Americans launched [[Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga|retaliatory raids]] in early October that destroyed Unadilla and Onaquaga.  Brant and John Butler's son [[Walter Butler (Loyalist)|Walter]] organized a retaliatory expedition against [[Cherry Valley (village), New York|Cherry Valley]], which was the scene of [[Cherry Valley massacre|a massacre]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, pp. 181–190&lt;/ref&gt;  This action and others by Brant and Butler contributed to the decision by the [[Continental Congress]] to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Commanded by Generals [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] and [[James Clinton]], the [[Sullivan Expedition|1779 expedition]] systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British, but did little to stop the frontier war.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, pp. 194–223&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Flatts area in particular was the subject of repeated raids.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, pp. 89–106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter D. Edmonds]]' 1936 novel ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk (novel)|Drums Along the Mohawk]]'' recounts the story of Adam Helmer's run and gives an overview of the German settlements along the river.  It was adapted as a [[Drums Along the Mohawk|film by the same name]], directed by [[John Ford]] and released in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and O'Connor, pp. 45–53&lt;/ref&gt;
