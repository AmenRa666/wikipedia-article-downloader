''it forms a new isotope U-239, and this isotope's nucleus rapidly emits an electron decaying into new element with a mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93.''

I'm pretty sure there are no electrons in the nucleus of a Uranium 239 atom. Somebody who knows what they're talking about needs to check the science behind this. [[User:58.164.129.211|58.164.129.211]] 23:32, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

A nucleus can emit an electron.  They are known as [[Beta particle]]s. [[User:Jmcc150|JMcC]] 13:26, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

== The US heavy water plant ==

If it was a US heavy water plant, why is it located in Trail, British Columbia? BC is a Canadian province. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/70.54.180.127|70.54.180.127]] ([[User talk:70.54.180.127|talk]]) 16:04, 15 March 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

:IIRC heavy water requires access to lots of electric power, hence the predominance in areas of hydroelectric power (and Norway's early lead in the field), but I'm no physicist so i can't really say authoritatively. [[User:Pickle UK|Pickle]] 16:57, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::The whole Manhattan Project was a tri-national (US/UK/CAN) one - something that wasn't admitted in many US histories until comparatively recently, and so various parts of the project were carried in various places, sometimes overlapping in nationalities.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.40.251.192|213.40.251.192]] ([[User talk:213.40.251.192|talk]]) 12:37, 30 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Tube Alloys vs. TUBE ALLOYS ==

I've seen &quot;Tube Alloys&quot; spelled in all caps in a few other articles related to the Manhattan Project. Is there a difference? Is one way correct and the other incorrect??[[User:Jedi Shadow|Jedi Shadow]] 03:58, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

Much of my information comes from Richard Rhodes's Pulitzer Prize winning book &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;. I regard it as definitive. In it, Tube Alloys has its two initial letters capitalised. However in correspondence at the time, it was sometimes all in lower case to give the impression that the subject was nothing more special than a generic material. The current title and its case is correct. However MAUD is correctly capitalised as if it was an acronym, but it did not stand for anything other than Bohr's sons' governess. I think the confusion arises because some people think that all projects should be in upper case. [[User:Jmcc150|JMcC]] 07:42, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

:From reading many essays and other books on the subject of military secret projects and operations it seems that the USA predominately spells out the name of secret projects and operations in upper case whereas Great Britain and other countries refer to the names in lower case to aid in confusing the enemy. eg &quot;Tube Alloys&quot; as opposed to &quot;MANHATTEN PROJECT&quot;.

== Success Has Many Fathers ==

I have clarified the second paragraph, previously it gave far more weight than was due to French And German 'involvement.' [[User:Twobells|Twobells]] ([[User talk:Twobells|talk]]) 18:49, 19 November 2011 (UTC)

== Bloody Union Jack ==

I am pretty sure that is not the motto. I am not even sure that kind of thing would have a motto. Seems to be vandalism. Can someone confirm? [[Special:Contributions/71.178.17.40|71.178.17.40]] ([[User talk:71.178.17.40|talk]]) 14:10, 14 August 2012 (UTC)

== Synthetic? ==

&quot;synthetic element plutonium&quot;

I don't believe plutonium is synthetic, it's very rare in nature and I'm sure the plutonium used in the &quot;Fat Man&quot; bomb was harvested from a reactor, but the element it's self is naturally occurring. A small point perhaps but worth noting.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/96.52.124.136|96.52.124.136]] ([[User talk:96.52.124.136|talk]]) 05:51, 12 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
