'''Sir Charles Bullen''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCB|KCH}} (10 September 1769 – 2 July 1853) was a highly efficient and successful naval officer who served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[French Revolutionary War|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] and distinguished himself at the [[Glorious First of June]], the [[battle of Camperdown]] and the [[battle of Trafalgar]].

==Early life==
Charles Bullen was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1769 but spent much of his early childhood in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Dorset]].&lt;ref name=BB246&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.246&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John Bullen, also served in the [[Royal Navy]] and was the Surgeon General on the [[North American Station]] between 1779 and 1781. Charles' mother, Ruth (née Liddel), was a cousin of [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]] who served as Lord Chancellor of Great Britain between 1801 and 1806 and again between 1807 and 1827.&lt;ref name=HC17/&gt; Richard Bullen, Charles younger brother by 10 years, became a captain in the [[Scots Greys]], dragoons.&lt;ref name=BB246/&gt; Charles entered the navy when he was just ten years old as a volunteer (1st class) aboard the 64 gun, third rate, [[HMS Europa (1765)|HMS Europe]].&lt;ref name=HC17&gt;Heathcote (2005) p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===American Revolutionary War===
{{Main article|American Revolutionary War}}
When his father was appointed Surgeon-General to the North American station in 1779, the 10-year-old Charles went with him aboard [[HMS Europa (1765)|HMS Europe]], which arrived in [[New York City]] on 25 August.&lt;ref name=BB246/&gt; On 23 December, Charles transferred to HM Sloop ''Loyalist'' and assisted in the capture of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] on [[Siege of Charleston|12 May 1780]]. He spent a short period aboard [[HMS Renown (1774)|HMS ''Renown'']], which was dismasted in a gale while escorting a convoy to [[Quebec]], before returning to ''Loyalist'' where he was promoted to [[Able Seaman (rank)|Able Seaman]] and then [[Midshipman]].&lt;ref name=HC17/&gt; Bullen returned to England in July 1781 aboard [[USS Ranger (1777)|HM Sloop ''Halifax'']] along with his father and [[Mariot Arbuthnot|Rear Admiral Arbuthnot]], who had had some differences of opinion with [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]].&lt;ref name=BB248&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.248&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace===
Charles stayed ashore until 1786 and finished his schooling.&lt;ref name=BB248/&gt; At the age of 17, he joined [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']] a [[Seventy-four (ship)|74-gun]], [[third rate]] stationed in [[English Channel|the Channel]], in which he spent the next two years under Captain [[Thomas Rich (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Thomas Rich]].&lt;ref name=HC17/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB248/&gt; In October 1789, he joined [[Joseph Peyton (Royal Navy officer)|Rear Admiral Peyton]] aboard his flagship [[HMS Leander (1780)|HMS ''Leander'']] and began a spell of service in the [[Mediterranean]] that lasted two and a half years.&lt;ref name=BB248/&gt; Bullen was promoted to acting lieutenant on 9 January 1791 and the following month transferred to the frigate {{HMS|Mercury|1779|6}}.&lt;ref name=HC17/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB248/&gt; His promotion was confirmed when he joined the 24-gun, [[post ship]], {{HMS|Eurydice|1781|6}} on 9 August.&lt;ref name=HC17/&gt; By the end of the year however, Bullen was back in England on half pay, during which time he married his cousin, a Miss Wood of [[Martock]].&lt;ref&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) pp.248-249&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolutionary War===
{{Main article|French Revolutionary War}}
When war broke out, Bullen returned to HMS ''Culloden'', which was still under the command of Thomas Rich and sailed for the [[West Indies]] where they took part in the unsuccessful invasion of [[Martinique]].{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} Returning home in March 1794, Bullen transferred to [[HMS Ramillies (1785)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] in which he took part in the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]] and the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]]. The captain, [[Henry Harvey]], was subsequently promoted and replaced by [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton]], who took the ship to the West Indies. Bullen continued to serve in ''Ramillies'' in the waters around the West Indies and Newfoundland until the end of 1795 when she returned to English waters, joining the [[North Sea Fleet]] under [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Admiral Duncan]].&lt;ref name=BB249&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.249.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 1796, Bullen re-joined Admiral Peyton in his then flagship, the 64-gun, [[third rate]], [[HMS Overyssel|''Overyssel'']]. This appointment didn't last long however and by [[Christmas]], Bullen was again on half pay.&lt;ref name=BB249/&gt;

===Mutiny===
{{Main article|Nore mutiny}}
At the beginning of 1797, Bullen was appointed first lieutenant to [[HMS Monmouth (1796)|HMS ''Monmouth'']] and it was here he first met his new commanding officer, [[William Carnegie, 7th Earl of Northesk]] and the two became fast friends. During the [[Nore mutiny]] when rebellion broke out on the ''Monmouth'', Bullen drew a line across the deck and threatened to shoot dead the first man to cross it.&lt;ref name=BB249/&gt; His prompt action probably saved his life and the lives of his fellow officers, including the Earl of Northesk, who was later chosen to take the rebels demands to the government.&lt;ref name=BB249/&gt;&lt;ref name=DFY&gt;{{cite web | year =| url = http://www.dorsetforyou.com/160578| title = Charles Bullen| work= Dorset and Trafalgar | author= Dorset For You| publisher =Dorset County Council |accessdate =13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie, who had some sympathy with the rebels, resigned following suppression of the mutiny but Bullen remained on board under the new captain, [[James Walker (Royal Navy officer)|James Walker]] and together they fought at the battle of Camperdown later that year, the crew of the ''Monmouth'' fighting hard to absolve themselves of their part in mutiny.&lt;ref name=BB250&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camperdown===
{{Main article|Battle of Camperdown}}
The battle of Camperdown took place on 11 October 1797. As the ''Monmouth'' was bearing down on the Dutch fleet, Captain Walker spoke to the crew, ''&quot;My lads, you see your enemy; I'll lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters in the blood of your foes. Now go to your quarters and do your duty&quot;''.&lt;ref name=BB250/&gt; ''Monmouth'' battled with two 50 gun Dutch ships, ''Alkmaar'' and ''Delft'', capturing both in a brutal encounter. Bullen was placed in charge of the ''Delft'', which he found to have been greatly damaged during the battle and leaking badly. 43 members of her crew had been killed, including the captain, and 76 injured.&lt;ref name=BB250/&gt; To add to Bullen's woes, on 14 November, a storm blew up.&lt;ref name=HC17/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB250/&gt; Unable to plug the leaks or pump the ship out, and with ten foot of water in the hold, the decision was taken to abandon her. However, when the ''Delft's'' commanding officer, Lieutenant Heilburg, was invited into one of the longboats, he refused. Indicating the wounded, he asked, &quot;How can I leave these unfortunate men?&quot;. Bullen agreed to stay behind and help evacuate the wounded but few could be got off. When the ''Delft'' suddenly sank, Heilburg went down with her but Bullen jumped into the sea where he was later rescued.&lt;ref name=HC18&gt;Heathcote (2005) p.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BB250-1&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) pp.250-251&lt;/ref&gt; He was praised for marshalling the evacuation of the ship and controlling the survivors in the water until they could be rescued by the boats of [[HMS Veteran (1787)|HMS ''Veteran'']], [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']] and other neighbouring vessels.&lt;ref name=HC18/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB251&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.251&lt;/ref&gt; Bullen was promoted to commander{{Ref label|B|b|none}} for his actions and returned to his Dorset home on half pay, where he spent the next three and a half years with his wife and family.&lt;ref name=DFY/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC18/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB251/&gt;

===Return to sea===
In June 1801, Bullen was despatched in the sloop [[HMS Wasp (1800)|HMS ''Wasp'']] to [[Sierra Leone]], where a powerful allegiance of native tribal leaders were threatening British trade interests. He was rewarded with a promotion to [[Post Captain]]{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} and returned to England in August 1802.&lt;ref name=HC18/&gt; When hostilities with France were renewed the following year, Bullen was given temporary command of [[HMS Minerve (1795)|HMS ''Minerve'']].&lt;ref name=HC19&gt;Heathcote (2005) p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The previous captain, [[Sir Jahleel Brenton, 1st Baronet|Jahleel Brenton]] was injured when a block fell on his head and Bullen, who was conveniently close by in Weymouth, commanded the vessel between 8 May and 3 June in 1803.&lt;ref name=HC19&gt;Heathcote (2005) p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Patrolling the waters off [[Cherbourg]], Bullen captured 23 merchantmen and the frigate sent to protect them.&lt;ref name=BB252&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.252&lt;/ref&gt; Between 14 July 1803 and 15 May 1804, Bullen commanded the [[Plymouth]] division of [[Sea Fencibles]], protecting the south-west of England from an invasion which, fortunately, never came.&lt;ref name=DFY/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB252/&gt; In November 1803, he was additionally given command of a flotilla which was being fitted out in the Thames for the defence of tidal estuaries and creeks.&lt;ref name=HC19/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB252/&gt; When Northesk was given the [[first rate]] flagship [[HMS Britannia (1762)|HMS ''Britannia'']] in 1804{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} he asked for Bullen as his flag captain especially. Initially serving with the [[Channel Fleet]] off Brest under [[William Cornwallis]]; ''Britannia'' was sent to join a squadron under Vice Admiral [[Robert Calder]] which, in August 1805, was sent to join [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] off [[Cadiz]].&lt;ref name=BB252/&gt;

===Battle of Trafalgar===
{{main article|Battle of Trafalgar}}
On 30 August, the ''Britannia'' joined the blockade of the Franco-Spanish fleet and so was present on 21 October for the battle of Trafalgar. On the day of the battle, ''Britannia'', [[HMS Prince (1788)|''Prince'']] and [[HMS Dreadnought (1801)|''Dreadnought'']] being the slowest ships present, were ordered to &quot;...take station as convenient&quot;.&lt;ref name=HC19/&gt; At this point Bullen and Northesk had a serious disagreement about the meaning of the order with Bullen refusing to shorten sail.&lt;ref name=BB253/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robson (2005) p.129&lt;/ref&gt; ''Britannia'' fell in 5th behind [[HMS Victory]] and with no particular role allocated, attacked three ships including the ''[[Bucentaure]]'' and the 130 gun [[Spanish ship Santissima Trinidad|''Santissima Trinidad'']], before turning to pursue the enemy's flying van. After the battle, ''Britannia'' was still relatively undamaged despite having suffered 52 casualties,{{Ref_label|E|e|none}} and so she was able to aid other more seriously damaged ships in the storm which followed.&lt;ref name=HC19/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB253&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Bullen brought three ships back to England and received prize money in excess of £3000, along with the usual awards from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund of the gold medal and sword given to Trafalgar captains. His ship was paid off on 20 June and Bullen spent the next 15 months on half pay.&lt;ref name=BB253/&gt;

===Mediterranean service===
Bullen was appointed to 38 gun frigate, [[French frigate Volontaire (1796)|HMS ''Volontaire'']] on 7 September 1807 and spent the next three years helping to maintain the blockade of [[Toulon]] and in operations along the French and Spanish coasts including the conveyance of the [[Louis Philippe I|Duc D'Orleans]] and his brother the [[Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Comte de Beaujolais]] to [[Malta]].&lt;ref name=BB253/&gt; When Spain declared war on France in May 1808, Bullen was ordered to undertake an overland expedition from [[Fes|Fez]] to [[Tangiers]] to purchase arms for the Spanish rebels. In 1809 he undertook a series of raids along the French coast, capturing the island of [[Frioul archipelago|Pomegues]] and destroying Fort Rioux near Cape Croisette.&lt;ref name=HC20&gt;Heathcote (2005) p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The latter action also led to the capture of five vessels sheltering under the 14 gun battery.&lt;ref name=BB254&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.254&lt;/ref&gt; Bullen also assisted in a boat action off [[Roses, Girona|Rosas]], which resulted in the taking of seven merchantmen and their three armed escorts.&lt;ref name=HC20/&gt; On 13 December 1810, an amphibious assault on [[Palamós]] was forced to retreat and [[Francis Fane (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Francis William Fane]], was captured.&lt;ref name=James363&gt;James, Vol. 5, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, on 1 January 1811, Bullen took command of Fane's ship, [[HMS Cambrian (1797)|HMS ''Cambrian'']].&lt;ref name=BB255&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.255&lt;/ref&gt; Bullen continued to support the Spanish in operations along the Catalonian coast, destroying the shore batteries at Palamos and St Phillion in April that year. Returning to the [[Gulf of Roses|bay of Rosas]], Bullen captured 19 merchant vessels off [[Cadaques]] before sailing south to [[Tarragona]] in April, where, together with other ships from the squadron he aided the early defence during the siege, at one point risking running his ship aground by taking it close in shore to deliver broadsides on the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives,  Kew, London: ADM 7/44, f320-325 letter from Charles Bullen to Capitán Edward Codrington 8th may 1811&lt;/ref&gt; Later, whilst serving in a battery ashore in Selva, he was badly wounded.&lt;ref name=HC20/&gt; Bullen quit ''Cambrian'' on 9 December and returned to England invalided.&lt;ref name=BB256&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later service===

Bullen did not go to sea again until 10 November 1814 when he was appointed to [[HMS Cornwallis (1805)|HMS ''Akbar'']] as flag captain to Admiral [[Thomas Byam Martin]], helping to supervise the partition of naval supplies at [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=BB256/&gt; Bullen and the ''Akbar'' then proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia with [[Edward Griffith Colpoys|Rear Admiral Edward Griffith]]. In June 1815, Bullen was made a companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] for his services. The ''Akbar'' was paid off on 1 January 1817.&lt;ref name=HC20/&gt;

After nearly seven years ashore, Bullen returned to active duty on 12 December 1823, when he was appointed commodore on the west coast of Africa. With his broad pennant in the fifth rate {{HMS|Maidstone|1811|6}}, he supported operations along the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] during the [[Anglo-Ashanti Wars|First Ashanti War]].&lt;ref name=HC20/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB256/&gt; While defending the British depot at [[Cape Coast]], his men were forced to strip the lead from the roof to cast extra bullets.&lt;ref name=HC20/&gt; In anti slave trade operations, Bullen was responsible for freeing almost 10,000 would be slaves before his return home in September 1827.&lt;ref name=DFY/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC20/&gt;&lt;ref name=BB256/&gt;

In July 1830, he was given the job of commissioner for [[Chatham Dockyard]] and then [[Pembroke Dockyard]] before being given command of the [[Royal Yacht]] ''Royal Sovereign''.&lt;ref name=BB257/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC21/&gt; In 1835, Bullen became a Knight Commander of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]],{{Ref_label|F|f|none}} and was dubbed a [[Knight Bachelor]].{{Ref_label|G|g|none}} He gained promotion to [[Rear Admiral]] in January 1837{{Ref_label|H|h|none}} and although he retired in March the same year{{Ref_label|I|i|none}}, he continued to receive awards and promotions.&lt;ref name=BB257/&gt; Bullen was awarded the [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]]{{Ref_label|J|j|none}} in 1839, a good service pension of £300 a year in 1843 and was promoted to [[Vice Admiral]] in 1846.{{Ref_label|K|k|none}} In 1852 he was made a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]]{{Ref_label|L|l|none}} followed by promotion to full Admiral in July that year.{{Ref_label|M|m|none}} &lt;ref name=BB257&gt;Broadley &amp; Bartelot (1906) p.257&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Charles Bullen died aged 84 on 2 July 1853, the last surviving captain of the British fleet at Trafalgar.{{Ref_label|N|n|none}}&lt;ref name=HC21&gt;Heathcote (2005) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;
