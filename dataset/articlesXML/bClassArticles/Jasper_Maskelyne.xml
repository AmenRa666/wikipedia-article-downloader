'''Jasper Maskelyne''' (1902–1973) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[stage magician]] in the 1930s and 1940s. He was one of an established family of stage magicians, the son of [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]] and a grandson of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. He is most remembered, however, for his entertaining accounts of his work for British military intelligence during the [[Second World War]], in which he claims that he created large-scale ruses, deception, and camouflage.

==Stage magician==
Maskelyne was a successful stage magician. His 1936 ''Book of Magic'' describes a range of stage tricks, including sleight of hand, card and rope tricks, and illusions of &quot;mind-reading&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maskelyne|Groom|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stellabooks.com/articles/featuredbooks/maskelyne_book_magic.php | title=Maskelyne's Book of Magic by Jasper Maskelyne and Arthur Groom | publisher=Stella &amp; Rose's Books | accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1937 [[Pathé]] film, ''The Famous Illusionist'', was made of Maskelyne, looking dapper and apparently eating a boxful of razor blades, one at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/jasper-maskelyne | title=Jasper Maskelyne 1937 | publisher=British Pathé | work=The Famous Illusionist | accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime trickery==
[[File:DummyShermanTank.jpg|thumb|An inflatable dummy [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] tank, one of many deceptions that Maskelyne claimed to have created]]

Maskelyne joined the [[Royal Engineers]] when the Second World War broke out, thinking that his skills could be used in [[camouflage]]. A story runs that he convinced sceptical officers by creating the illusion of a German warship on the Thames using mirrors and a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskelyne was trained at the Camouflage Development and Training Centre at [[Farnham Castle]] in 1940. He found the training boring, asserting in his book that &quot;a lifetime of hiding things on the stage&quot; had taught him more about camouflage &quot;than rabbits and tigers will ever know&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newark|2007|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of camoufleurs|camoufleur]] [[Julian Trevelyan]] commented that he &quot;entertained us with his tricks in the evenings&quot; at Farnham, but that Maskelyne was &quot;rather unsuccessful&quot; at actually camouflaging &quot;concrete [[Pillbox (military)|pill-boxes]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Newark101&gt;{{harvnb|Newark|2007|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brigadier [[Dudley Clarke]], the head of the 'A' Force deception department, recruited Maskelyne to work for [[MI9]] in Cairo. He created small devices intended to assist soldiers to escape if captured and lectured on escape techniques.&lt;ref name=Mure95&gt;{{harvnb|Mure|1980|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included tools hidden in [[cricket bat]]s, saw blades inside combs, and small maps on objects such as playing cards.&lt;ref name=Mure95/&gt;

Maskelyne was then briefly a member of [[Geoffrey Barkas]]'s [[Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate|camouflage unit]] at [[Helwan]], near Cairo, which was set up in November 1941. He was made head of the subsidiary &quot;Camouflage Experimental Section&quot; at [[Abbassia]]. By February 1942 it became clear that this command was not successful, and so he was &quot;transferred to welfare&quot;&amp;mdash;in other words, to entertaining soldiers with magic tricks.&lt;ref name=Newark101/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Middle East Camouflage Report No. 1 | publisher=War Office | authorlink=NA/WO 201/2843 | date=28 February 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Peter Forbes writes that the &quot;flamboyant&quot; magician's contribution was&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|2009|page=156, 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|either absolutely central (if you believe his account and that of his biographer) or very marginal (if you believe the official records and more recent research).&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;}}

His nature was &quot;to perpetuate the myth of his own inventive genius, and perhaps he even believed it himself&quot;.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; However, Clarke had encouraged Maskelyne to take credit for two reasons: as cover for the true inventors of the dummy machinery and to encourage confidence in these techniques amongst Allied high command.&lt;ref name=Mure95/&gt;

Maskelyne's book about his exploits, ''Magic: Top Secret'', ghost-written, was published in 1949. Forbes describes it as lurid, with &quot;extravagant claims of cities disappearing, armies re-locating, dummies proliferating (even submarines)&amp;mdash;all as a result of his knowledge of the magic arts&quot;. Further, Forbes notes, the biography of Maskelyne by David Fisher was &quot;clearly under the wizard's spell&quot;.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; In his book, Maskelyne claims his team produced&lt;ref name=MTS&gt;{{harvnb|Maskelyne|Stuart|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|dummy men, dummy steel helmets, dummy guns by the ten thousand, dummy tanks, dummy shell flashes by the million, dummy aircraft...&lt;ref name=MTS/&gt;}}

==Reception==
A study by Richard Stokes argues that much of the story concerning the involvement of Maskelyne in counterintelligence operations as described in the book &quot;Magic: Top Secret&quot; was pure invention and that no unit called the &quot;Magic Gang&quot; ever existed. Maskelyne's role in the deception war was marginal.&lt;ref&gt;In a series of twenty-one articles published between November 1997 and October 2005 in the magazine ''Genii Magic Journal'' (Sydney, Australia), magician Richard Stokes criticizes ''The War Magician'', contextualizing David Fisher’s account within contemporary literary and military sources and with reference to the recollections of Jasper Maskelyne’s surviving son, Alistair Maskelyne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maskelynemagic.com/ | title=Jasper Maskelyne | work=The War Magician | accessdate=22 October 2012 | author=Stokes, Richard J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian House, reviewing Rick Stroud's book ''The Phantom Army of Alamein'' in [[The Independent]], describes Maskelyne as &quot;one of the more grandiose members&quot; of the Second World War desert camouflage unit and &quot;a chancer tasked with experimental developments, who fogged his own reputation as much as any desert convoy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-phantom-army-of-alamein-by-rick-stroud-8219360.html | title=The Phantom Army of Alamein, By Rick Stroud | work=Wartime smoke and mirrors | date=21 October 2012 | agency=The Independent | accessdate=22 October 2012 | author=House, Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stroud|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hambling, writing on [[Wired (website)|Wired]],&lt;ref name=WIRED&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/05/wwii-strobe-t-1/ | title=Secret Strobelight Weapons of World War II | publisher=Wired | date=17 May 2008 | accessdate=22 October 2012 | author=Hambling, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; critiques David Fisher's uncritical acceptance of Maskelyne's stories: &quot;A very colorful account of Maskelyne's role is given in the book ''The War Magician''—reading it you might think he won the war single-handed&quot;. Hambling denies Maskelyne's supposed concealment of the Suez Canal: &quot;[I]n spite of the book's claims, the dazzle light[s] were never actually built (although a prototype was once tested)&quot;.&lt;ref name=WIRED/&gt;

In 2002 [[The Guardian]] wrote: &quot;Maskelyne received no official recognition. For a vain man this was intolerable and he died an embittered drunk. It gives his story a poignancy without which it would be mere chest-beating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' 28 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
