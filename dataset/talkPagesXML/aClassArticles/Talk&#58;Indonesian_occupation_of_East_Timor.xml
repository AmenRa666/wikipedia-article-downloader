== Major revision ==

I'm in the process of massively expanding this article (on a page in my userspace). Anyone thinking of contributing here may want to wait until I've implemented the work I've been doing. It shouldn't be later than 24 February. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 18:21, 17 February 2008 (UTC)
:I lied. After an intense editing blitz, I finished the first draft of the article today. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 01:23, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

== Red links ==

I know there are a number of red links in the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indonesian_occupation_of_East_Timor_%281975-1999%29&amp;oldid=192192309 right now]. I plan to create these pages over the next week or so. (A task force or WikiProject is also in the works.) –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 01:42, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

==Name==
The name should be simplify to as [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]], doesn't need the year. [[Special:Contributions/96.229.179.106|96.229.179.106]] ([[User talk:96.229.179.106|talk]]) 07:26, 18 February 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, I also wonder the reason for including the year. It implies that it's disambiguating some other occupation, is it? Are there objections to moving it? [[User:Rigadoun|Rigadoun ]] [[User_talk:Rigadoun|(talk)]] 20:17, 20 February 2008 (UTC)
::I put the dates in as I initially started the article (and a few others last week) as sequential 'chapters' in a series to cover East Timor history (see that history template on main page). While I still prefer using the dates, I won't slash my wrists if everyone else wants to lose them. :-)  regards --[[User:Merbabu|Merbabu]] ([[User talk:Merbabu|talk]]) 20:49, 20 February 2008 (UTC)
:::I'd also !vote for losing the dates. It just seems like an unnecessary disambiguation. The current title could (and probably should) stay as a redirect, so it could still be used in a &quot;chapter&quot; type setting. Oh, and while I'm here, good luck on any future Peer Review/FAC you choose to undertake; the article is very impressive, albeit with a few prose problems. [[User:GeeJo|GeeJo]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:GeeJo|(t)]]&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/GeeJo|(c)]]&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;22:47, 20 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
::::I took a look at what other history series do. [[History of Poland|Poland]] does just the years; [[History of Indonesia|Indonesia]] leaves the years out; [[History of Belarus|Belarus]] leaves them out too; and so does [[History of Italy|Italy]]. So it looks like most leave them out. Ergo that's what I vote for. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 12:43, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
I tried moving it, but needs an admin to do it. --[[User:Merbabu|Merbabu]] ([[User talk:Merbabu|talk]]) 21:03, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

==GA review==

* Prose is well-written, layout fine. &quot;Abuses by FRETILIN&quot; is a tad stubby but there's no point in adding text for the sake of it.
* Copiously referenced.
* Covers the subject comprehensively.
* No POV issues. 
* No indications of instability.
* Adequately illustrated. I'd prefer more action pix but you can only work with what you have.
* No reservations. Suggest taking it to Milhist for a Class-A review immediately (to give military input) then FAC.

:PS: I have ''not'' proof-read this. I read it for content. Nothing jumped out. --[[User:Roger Davies|&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;'''R&lt;small&gt;OGER&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;D&lt;small&gt;AVIES'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Roger Davies|'''talk''']]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:50, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

== Australian commentary ==

I'm fine with removing commentary, but I think the paragraph about Australia's involvement in the Timor Gap needs a transition at the start. Can we find an NPOV way to do this? –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 15:05, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

==Salicine suggestions==

Hi, I was asked by [[User:Scartol|Scartol]] to look over the article and make suggestions.  I think the article is excellent as is, but there might be a few points on which it could be improved. [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 15:22, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

* '''Did this; hope it's OK.''' I would move the navigational template, {{tl|History of East Timor}}, upwards into the lead, so that it runs parallel to the Table of Contents.  Right now, it interrupts the flow of the writing and I fear wouldn't be found easily by people wanting to navigate. [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 15:22, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* It looks lovely. Thanks. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:39, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

* I'm concerned that some readers will be ignorant of geography, and not know who East Timor's neighbours are, nor even where Indonesia is.  I would suggest that you replace or augment the present map [[:Image:LocationEastTimor.svg]] with another that shows Indonesia and Australia and possibly Malaysia as well.  Bonus points for Japan, the other Asian country mentioned in the lead, but you might need a second map at larger scale, which might make East Timor tiny; perhaps you could combine them so that the &quot;close-up&quot; on East Timor is an inset? [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 15:22, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* Agreed, but I don't have an SVG editor. I'm working on getting what I need to install one, so it may be a few days. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:47, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

*I would also include a close-up map of East Timor proper, one where you can see the major towns, such as [[:Image:East Timor map mhn.jpg|this one]].  Some readers might never have heard of [[Dili]], or might not know it to be the capital. [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 15:55, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* Done and done. I worry somewhat that it's not too readable at thumbnail size, and maybe we should use [[:Image:East Timor-CIA WFB Map.png|this one]], but I do like the color of the one you suggested (and it's more detailed). –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:47, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

* I'm also worried that readers will know little of the history of Portugal, so that the [[Carnation Revolution]] in the lead at least might warrant more contextual discussion.  I know that it's all covered in other Wikipedia articles and the reader could just follow the links, but I think it'd be helpful to have more context ''here'' for the history of Portugal in East Timor and why events in Portugal had such disastrous consequences so far away. [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 15:22, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* Fair enough. Added. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:49, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

* It might be helpful if more could be added about the advantages/disadvantages to Indonesia of its invasion and the benefits derived by other nations in turning a blind eye.  Such topics can naturally be contentious and may be difficult to source adequately, but I think it would help the article.  I'm thinking of something like the discussion of the role of American business interests in the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy]]. [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 15:22, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* I can add this, but I hesitated, since it's mostly speculation. (As always, occupiers rarely discuss openly the benefits of their occupation.) Things like the Ombai-Wetar straits (which were highly prized by US planners) and resources like sandalwood and coffee were important (not to mention oil, which is in the Australia section), but I worried first about length and second about making the connections. I wanted to stick to the facts as they can be proven. (Scholarship on East Timor often veers into the speculative and I wanted to avoid that.) But encourage me again and I'll add it. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:26, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

* I would use the &quot;ABRI&quot; abbreviation sparingly.  Admittedly, it's slightly shorter than &quot;Indonesia&quot;, but it comes at a cost of comprehensibility, especially with all the other abbreviations in the article, such as UDT, FRETILIN, etc.  Is there some advantage to using ABRI? [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 16:00, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* No, I just did it because it was easier and is very common in the literature (probably because it's easier). I also like varying my wording as much as possible, and seeing the word &quot;Indonesian&quot; so often gets tedious. (There's also the fairly academic issue of potentially associating, in the mind of the reader, the Indonesian people or even the government with the military. Admittedly there wasn't much difference between government and military during Suharto's reign, but still.) I've gone through and limited the use of ABRI and TNI. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:26, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

::Helpful feedback as always. Thanks, Willow. I'll get on these as soon as I can. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:02, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

* I foresee that the &quot;US involvement&quot; section will be a flash-point for criticism.  You might want to reference every single sentence in the first paragraph, especially since you give Ford's and Kissinger's remarks in quotation marks.  The very first sentence might be nicely referenced to some contemporary ''[[New York Times]]'' article.  [[User:WillowW|WillowW]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/WillowW|contribs]]) 16:14, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:*Citations on every sentence done. Given that the PDF of the State Dept memo is online, I'm not sure I understand the usefulness of the first sentence being referenced to the NYT. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:37, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

* It would be helpful to have more exact figures for Presidents Carter and Clinton.  Was Carter's figure $112 million per year, or total from 1977-1981?  For Clinton, how many is &quot;several hundred&quot; million? [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 16:25, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* I agree that they're vague, and I'll try to find more precise numbers. I got as specific as my current stack of sources went. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:37, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
::* Done and done. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:39, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

*An exact date for [[Gough Whitlam]]'s comment that East Timor was part of Indonesia?  Can we find the exact newspaper article? [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 16:36, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:*No, I can't find the article(s) in question, but I did some more digging and I found out that he met with Suharto in September 1974, so I added that instead. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:26, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

* A discussion of East Timor's role in World War II might be good in the initial Background section, so that it doesn't come out of the blue in the Australian section.  It's interesting to me, too, since I'd somehow gotten the impression that officially neutral [[Portugal]] favored the [[Axis powers]] in WWII.  [[User:WillowW|Willow]] ([[User talk:WillowW|talk]]) 16:36, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
:* Done. Thanks again for your review. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:39, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

== Invasion -- NPOV ==

The section titled as Invasion isnt neutral, the major points are the subsections going into details about countries selling arms in the 1990's to Indonesia, trade agreements signed in 1989. While these may be relevant to the continued occupation they have nothing to do with an invasion that occurred 7th December 1975. [[User:Gnangarra|Gnan]][[User_talk:Gnangarra|garra]] 13:48, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
:Those sections discuss the ongoing support for Suharto's regime by the governments of Australia, the US, and Britain (among others). We could split discussion of that support into other sections (would that allay your concerns?), but it would get messy. In any case, I don't understand how the placement of this information is POV. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:58, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
::Its NPOV because it implies that the sale of weapons in the 1990's is a cause and contributed to the invasion in 1975. [[User:Gnangarra|Gnan]][[User_talk:Gnangarra|garra]] 13:04, 24 February 2008 (UTC)
:::That certainly was not my intention – I merely wanted to group the discussion of foreign governments' support for Indonesia in one area, and since the US and Australia began supporting Indonesia's annexation of East Timor before the invasion took place, I originally put that discussion in the invasion section. However, I appreciate your concern, and I have rearranged the article to put that discussion after the section on the 1991 massacre. Hopefully this makes it satisfactorily NPOV. –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 15:23, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

== [[WP:GAR|Good article reassessment]] ==

* Listed due to above POV issues. [[User:Gnangarra|Gnan]][[User_talk:Gnangarra|garra]] 13:35, 24 February 2008 (UTC)
:Are these still a problem? If so, could you explain? If not, could we remove the POV tag and rescind the reassessment request? –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 01:04, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

== Further Issues ==

In lead ''Its limited scope and the small number of sentences delivered by Indonesian courts have caused numerous observers to call for an international tribunal for East Timor.'', while I not a big fan of citations in lead such a strong generalised statement which reads as the writers POV should have a citation or be removed. [[User:Gnangarra|Gnan]][[User_talk:Gnangarra|garra]] 00:47, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
:Alas, I did not add this sentence. Could the person who did please add a citation? –&amp;nbsp;[[User:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;Scartol&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Scartol|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tok&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 01:03, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
::My personal preference is also not to have citations in the lead, but ensure the lead only mentions items in the main body - that are of course cited. As for that particular point, words to that effect are at the end of the article, however, the lead does express it in a somewhat weaselly manner.

===citation 94===
From the article section '''deliberate starvation''' ''It concluded that a minimum of 84,000 people starved to death during the occupation.[94]'' cite 94 ^ CAVR, ch. 7.3, p. 143.

This is ch. 7.3 p143 from http://www.etan.org/etanpdf/2006/CAVR/Chega!-Report-Executive-Summary.pdf as cited 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to an adequate standard of living
Development and government spending
Ø Despite the Indonesian Government’s large investment in Timor-Leste and the rapid economic growth that it produced, particularly when compared with the performance of the Portuguese colonial power, government security concerns rather than the interests of the majority of the population guided the distribution of that investment. The contrast between investment and growth in such sectors as transport and communications and government administration, and that in agriculture on which the vast majority of the population depended for its livelihood, strikingly illustrates the occupying power’s distorted priorities. Income and poverty indicators at the end of the Indonesian occupation, which show Timor-Leste lagging behind most other countries and all the provinces of Indonesia itself, provide strong evidence of the harmful effects that this choice of priorities had on the living conditions of the majority of East Timorese.
Rights over natural resources
Ø The Commission is satisfied that trading companies with direct links to the military and the Indonesian government deliberately and systematically underpaid coffee smallholders, thereby abridging their right to an adequate livelihood.
Ø The arrangements that the Indonesian authorities put in place in the coffee industry was one of several instances where Indonesia denied the people of Timor-Leste an essential component of their right to self-determination, namely their right to dispose of their natural wealth and resources freely. The Indonesian authorities committed similar violations by exploiting other resources, including sandalwood and timber, without regard to sustainability and by failing to regulate the exploitation of these resources by others. These forms of exploitation of natural resources were also positively harmful to the well-being of the population and were sometimes used to fund military operations, and as such violated the duties of an occupying power.
Ø In a further breach of the people of Timor-Leste’s right to dispose of its natural resources, the Commission finds that Indonesia and Australia concluded the Timor Sea Treaty in 1989 without consulting the people of Timor-Leste or paying due regard to their interests.
The right to adequate food
Ø The Indonesian government took measures that worsened the food situation of the people of Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste’s climate and the uneven quality of its soils make the food situation precarious at the best of times, and survival dependent on the population’s ability to move freely. The Commission has found that the Indonesian authorities did not just neglect agriculture; they also took security measures that positively worsened the chances of the farming population to make a living, primarily by forcibly settling them in infertile areas under conditions in which their movement was restricted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In all of this text I see nothing that supports the claim nor any specific numbers that could be generalised to make such a statement ''that a minimum of 84,000 people starved to death during the occupation'' [[User:Gnangarra|Gnan]][[User_talk:Gnangarra|garra]] 03:23, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

:The Chega report uses the figure 84,200 four times in the report (pp44, 72, 73, 146.) For example: p73
&lt;blockquote&gt;At a minimum, during the period 1975-1999, 84,200 people died due to hunger and illness in excess of the peacetime baseline for these causes of death, and the figure could be as high as 183,000. The overwhelming number of these deaths occurred in the years 1977-1978 and during the period of large-scale Indonesian military attacks on Fretilin bases in the interior where large numbers of civilians were living and in 1979 during the subsequent period of Indonesian military detention camps, and ABRI/TNI-controlled resettlement areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;.

He's been open to discussion throughout the entire process, has posted several kind requests on your talk page, has been taking into advisement the thoughts of many different reviewers.  Is having been involved in a political advocacy issue a COI for ever writing about the subject?  Nobody who's been to a Free Tibet concert can write about China?  I've donated to the zoo, should I stop writing about hippos?  The point is, he's been upfront about the association, open to feedback all along, and I don't feel that a COI tag on this article, (or [[WP:DTTR|a template on his user page]]!!) is a productive step in resolution.

::To be perfectly honest, I don't see what Gnangarra is getting at.

The response of the international community, both government and non-government is a large part of the story of the occupation.I'm not convinced we've got the tone exactly right yet, but the way to do that is to edit collaboratively, not remove the section.

:I agree that this section isn't a NPOV account. It basically presents a narrative of the world's governments never caring about East Timor - this isn't entirely incorrect (as East Timor is a small and possibly marginally viable country a long way from anywhere), but it is an oversimplification. A particular problem with this section is that it doesn't provide a global perspective on the issue.

The international support for East Timorese self determination in 1999 seems worth mentioning here as well, as it suggests that governmental attitudes changed over time - the Australian government provided fairly strong support for the process which led to independence, including preparing a large peacekeeping force to intervene if things went bad several months ahead of the referendum. At the risk of being controversial, it may also be worth mentioning that there appeared to be some good reasons to support the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. East Timor was clearly economically marginal and was suffering from a de-facto civil war, so it's wrong to assume that democratic governments were acting without regard for East Timor's people when they supported or ignored the initial invasion. --[[User:Nick Dowling|Nick Dowling]] ([[User talk:Nick Dowling|talk]]) 09:32, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

::It might also be worth mentioning the public opposition to Indonesia's actions in Australia and the US, and the impact this had on governmental policy.

Additionally Australia political stability wasnt what it is now, with the sacking of the Whitlam government in November 1975 and the elections on 13th December(6 days after the invasion), if anything it shows that Indonesia was given a unique opportunity to take action when the nearest country considered capable of doing anything wasnt in a position to do anything, nor were any other countries able to as there wasnt a Government to authorise the use of Australian facilities because of the conditions imposed on Fraser until after the election. Then add to that the political legacies on Australia and the US from the Vietnam war which ended only 6 months before, neither country could take any military action.

== Integration monument image ==

I had [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indonesian_occupation_of_East_Timor_%281975-1999%29&amp;oldid=193707809 originally placed] the image of the integration monument at the top of the page, since I feel it is a powerful representation of Indonesia's stated goals, and how different those were from the East Timorese reception. I attempted to explain this with a caption cited to a reliable source.

There definitely needs to be mention of the May 31st 'Popular Assembly' and Act of Integration, and their recognition and 'observation' by a number of external powers.

The info mentioning &quot;400 Indonesian paratroopers killed&quot; in the airborne assault on Dili are pure fantasy. There were only 35 soldiers killed during the day-long battle to expel FALINTIL gunmen from the city, while there are 250 dead FALINTIL gunmen recovered by Indonesian soldiers in the city. Also recovered from the dead FALINTIL gunmen was hundreds of NATO-issue weapons that has been abandoned by the Portuguese, looted by the FALINTIL, and later entered the service of Indonesian army.

LOL, I don't think Scartol's source has any credibility at all. It does not even make sense. There were only around 641 Indonesian paratroopers who jumped into Dili to take that city on the morning (06:00 am) of December 7, 1975. They engaged in day-long combat against hundreds of FALINTIL gunmen who have looted the well-stocked Portuguese arsenal, in which they managed to expel the FAILINTIL from the city by 12 o'clock of the same day, so the combat took only six hours before Indonesian victory. By three PM, Indonesian armed forces chief General Benny Moerdani can safety tour the city of Dili. 

If 400 Indonesian paratroopers were &quot;killed&quot; as alleged by Scartol and his source, then that means two-thirds of the airborne troopers were killed. FALINTIL must be such a hapless bunch of rabble so that a force that supposedly been practically wiped-out managed to throw them out of Dili in only six hours.

It is clear that Scartol's source is most likely just propaganda material by the leftist anti-Indonesian propagandist Carmel Budiardjo (a British she-communist married to an Indonesian communist), material unfit to be displayed in Wikipedia. The truth is there were only 35 Indonesian paratroopers who died on the invasion day.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/222.124.120.37|222.124.120.37]] ([[User talk:222.124.120.37|talk]]) 13:30, 18 March 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

There are only 641 Indonesian paratroopers who jumped into Dili on December 7th, 1975, and only 35 died. It is logically impossible that a force that has supposedly been wiped-out (if Scartol's hilarious claim of &quot;400 paratroopers killed&quot; is taken seriously), could defeat hundreds of well-armed gunmen in only six hours.

:::I'm not sure that I have got my point across. We need to give both sets of sources/views a presence. We've established that both sources have significant credibility - but, this does not necessarily equal accuracy/fact. On the other hand, we haven't shown that one or the other is clearly false. I understand your position on the Angkasa article, however, your argument that the others are false is based on the unproven assumption that Angkasa is correct (eg, there were also marines). In light of that uncertainty, we need to list both. Unfortunately, these kind of topics are inherently contentious, and when editing wikipedia, we are not here to judge what is correct or not - rather, we are here to present verifiable view points (but verifiable viewpoints, are not the same as accurate facts). The assumption of one single accurate point of view misses the point wikipedia. We are not here to judge what version is the &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;fact&quot; - you are trying to rationalise another source to discredit it - that's not our job. See [[WP:OR]], [[WP:SYN]].

== Displacements ==

This article is about occupation, differentiated somewhat from the one on invasion. So, my opinion is that info should be added in three places in regard to displaced persons:

1. Demography and economy, second paragraph. Reference is made to Indonesia's '''transmigrasi''' program, citing Otten's tally of 150,000 Indonesians migrating in. This paragraph could be improved by indicating the status of land ownership by the migrants, rather than assuming that the reader knows what the '''transmigrasi''' program is. Further, mention should be made about the fate of these people and who got their land after Timorese independence.

2. 1999 Referendum, second-to-last paragraph. Cites Human Rights Watch for the figure of 200,000 Timorese interned in a camp in West Timor. I was living in Indonesia at that time and saw abundant media coverage. Some commentators said most of these people were scared, tricked, or even forced onto boats to &quot;evacuate&quot;. The fate of the 200,000 is omitted from the article, but their repatriation (or whatever happened to various segments of the group) is relevant to the title of the article because it is a consequence of occupation.

3. Indonesian withdrawal and peacekeeping force. The last paragraph of the lead refers to Indonesian paramilitary groups damaging infrastructure after independence. I believe the damage continued after the official withdrawal -- if a source can be found, that info should be included in this section. The section could be rounded out by noting that &quot;integrationist&quot; sentiment persisted for several years after independence, with former residents of Timor Timur (e.g., Guterres) getting occasional media coverage of speeches made in Jakarta. I think Jakarta Post ran an article about Indonesians receiving land as a reward for assistance during the invasion and losing it after independence. I believe the reward was prior to the application of transmigrasi to Timor Timur.

The main article on East Timor might be a better place for item #2. [[User:Martindo|Martindo]] ([[User talk:Martindo|talk]]) 09:12, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

If all this info is to be retained in its entirety (or even expanded as suggested ), then it needs to be split into a separate article – say [[US involvement in East Timor 1974-1999]] (or similar). --[[User:Merbabu|Merbabu]] ([[User talk:Merbabu|talk]]) 01:58, 4 May 2011 (UTC)

If I may add my two cents here, I think this problem can be easily solved. It's best for us not to get into the politics of this ourselves. What we believe is not relevant, i.e. if we believe a green light was given or if that claim is nonsense. That is our personal view and as such as no place here as impartial editors. But if there is a reputable source that claims a green light was given, then we should report on that view, properly attributed. Likewise, if there is a good source that calls it &quot;nonsense,&quot; we report that too. How much weight to give the various views is a matter of how much influence such views have within the academy, i.e. historians, and other writers who have studied the issue. Reporting on arms sales is part of the argument made, and if any arms sales slowed or stopped after the carnage started, or if they increased despite it, are all relevant facts to report. We allow the reader to make up his own mind as to the degree of culpability that actors played in the unfolding of the events. We just report what good sources have to say about it. I hope this helps. [[User:BernieW650|BernieW650]] ([[User talk:BernieW650|talk]]) 17:20, 3 May 2011 (UTC)

==Chomsky==
Reviewing the recent content changes, I see a problem. The Chomsky citation and text was removed on the grounds that Chomsky is hardly a NPOV source. I think this reasoning is mistaken. Source can have POV's. We report on those POV's. NPOV comes into play in ''how'' we handle and present those povs's, i.e, &quot;according to,&quot; etc. These pov's have to be attributed and clearly stated as such, not as uncontested facts. Also, that we include other pov's that even counter Chomsky's. So that is the solution, not to remove the Chomsky source as POV. [[User:BernieW650|BernieW650]] ([[User talk:BernieW650|talk]]) 18:04, 3 May 2011 (UTC)
:Actually, a number of the Chomsky based sources were presented as fact. The others did indeed say &quot;Chomsky says&quot; Or similar. The former is clearly a problem as you described above. AS for the latter, why is Chomsky's opinion of particular note? Because other editors also agree with that POV? Why not strip out all that opinion? One part was particularly silly when there was a whole section countering Chomsky's opinion. Is this an encyclopaedia or an undergrad political science position paper?--[[User:Merbabu|Merbabu]] ([[User talk:Merbabu|talk]]) 21:41, 3 May 2011 (UTC)

== An editoral in the lead.  ==

The statement &quot;U.S. President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger met with Indonesian President Suharto on the day before the invasion and reportedly gave their approval for the invasion.[3]&quot; is sourced to a dead link at John Pilger.com called “Blood on Our Hands”. This is an editorial, obviously and would need to be attributed as such. It doesn’t belong in the lead (nor is it accurate).[[User:V7-sport|V7-sport]] ([[User talk:V7-sport|talk]]) 21:50, 24 May 2011 (UTC)
:John Pilger made one of the only independent documentary films ever produced during the occupation, ''Death of a Nation''. He is a journalist, and the item in question contains both opinion and fact. The article to which the claim (&quot;reportedly gave their approval for the invasion&quot;) is sourced (an updated link for which I quickly found, thanks to the site's handy &quot;search&quot; function) includes an interview with an agent of the US government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The CIA's senior operations officer in Jakarta at that time was C Philip Liechty, whom I found, in retirement, in Washington.

'Suharto was given the green light by President Ford and [Secretary of State] Kissinger to do what he did,' he told me. 'There was discussion in [signals] traffic with the State Department about the problems that would be created for us if the public and Congress become aware of the level and type of military assistance that was going to Indonesia at that time. The decision was taken to get the stuff on the high seas before someone pulled the chain. Most of it went straight into East Timor and was used against non-combatants... 200,000 people died.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:This is neither editorializing nor inaccurate. The wording in the lead (&quot;U.S. President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger met with Indonesian President Suharto on the day before the invasion and reportedly gave their approval for the invasion.&quot;) is, I believe, quite fair. I recall adding this same wording elsewhere in the article; perhaps it has been removed, or perhaps my memory is betraying me.

::Hi Scartol, Thanks for updating the link. John Pilger isn't an unbiased source and it's an editorial as you acknowledge. (&quot;contains opinion&quot;) According to the [http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB62/doc4.pdf department of state] what was said at the time by ford was  “We will not press you on the issue. “ Kissinger stated that it was “important whatever you do succeed quickly.” This wasn't an endorsement of their actions. &quot;Gave their approval for the invasion&quot; is a characterization of the event by Pilger and should be attributed as such.

:::I would not object to moving it out of the lead, mostly because I don't feel like arguing with you about it. (Though I will be interested to see what others have to say about it.)

== Can somebody address ethnic cleansing in this article, including the indonesian government systematically targetting and wiping out Chinese in East Timor in 1975 ==

I believe this is important and shouldn't be whitewashed.
http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/AC13Ae02.html


&quot;War, Genocide, and Resistance in East Timor, 1975–99: Comparative Reflections on Cambodia&quot; by Ben Kiernan, p. 202

&quot;But the crimes committed a decade later in East Timor, with a toll of 150,000 in a population of 650,000, clearly meet a range of sociological definitions of genocide used by
most scholars of the phenomenon, who see both political and ethnic groups as possible victims of genocide. 13

The victims in East Timor included not only that substantial “part” of the Timorese “national group” targeted for destruction because of their resistance to Indonesian annexation—along with their relatives, as we shall see—but also most members of the twenty-thousandstrong ethnic Chinese minority prominent in the towns of East Timor, whom Indonesian forces singled out for destruction, apparently because of their ethnicity “as such.”&quot;

== Chomsky in Lede ==

As much as I dislike Chomsky, I certainly have no problem with his opinion being cited in the article, even though he is not an expert on Indonesia.  But should he really be quoted in the opening as calling it the worst massacre since the Holocaust?  The subsequent analysis in this article leads me to suspect that about 13% of the Timorese were killed--which is notably less than Cambodia, Rwanda, and potentially the Hmong of Laos.  It seems, in both absolute and percentage terms, comparable to the massacre of many tens of thousands of Lebanese Christians in the late seventies/early eighties.  Actually, if Afghanistan had a 1979 population of 15 million, 5-10 million fled the Soviet invasion, and 1-2 million were killed; then it would seem just as grave a tragedy, if not worse.  East Timor is definitely not in a league of its own.  Of course, Chomsky denies or minimizes these crimes (his friend Ed Herman even denied that the Rwandan genocide ever took place).[[User:TheTimesAreAChanging|TheTimesAreAChanging]] ([[User talk:TheTimesAreAChanging|talk]]) 08:27, 6 May 2012 (UTC)

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:2|one external link|2 external links}} on [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=706486301 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20120513220045/http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm to http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm
