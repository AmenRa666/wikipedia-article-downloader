His forehead is furrowed and his nasolabial lines are well-defined.]]

[[Philip the Arab]] was one of the few 3rd-century [[Roman Emperor|Roman emperors]] sympathetic to Christians, although his relationship with [[Christianity]] is obscure and controversial. Philip was born in [[Auranitis]], an Arab district east of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The urban and Hellenized centers of the region were Christianized in the early years of the 3rd century via major Christian centers at [[Bosra]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]; there is little evidence of Christian presence in the small villages of the region in this period, such as Philip's birthplace at [[Shahba|Philippopolis]]. Philip served as [[praetorian prefect]], commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], from 242; he was made emperor in 244. In 249, after a brief civil war, he was kiled at the hands of his successor, [[Decius]].

During the late 3rd century and into the 4th, it was held by some churchmen that [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] had been the first Christian emperor; he was described as such in [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' (''Chronicle''), which was well known during the Middle Ages, and in [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' highly popular ''Historia Adversus Paganos'' (''History Against the Pagans''). Most scholars hold that these and other early accounts ultimately derive from [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (''Ecclesiastical History'').&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Gregg, 43; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 466; E. Stein ''apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important section of Eusebius' ''Historia'' on Philip's religious beliefs describes the emperor's visit to a church on [[Holy Saturday|Easter Eve]] when he was denied entry by the presiding bishop until he confessed his sins. The account is paralleled by Chrysostom's homily, which celebrates Saint Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, for denying a sinful emperor entry to his church; and quotations of Leontius in the ''Chronicon Paschale'' which describe Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor. Given the parallels between the accounts, most scholars believe that Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Leontius are referring to the same event (or legend).

With the growth of scholarly criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christian&amp;mdash;and which, indeed, recorded him participating as ''pontifex maximus'' (chief priest) over the millennial [[Secular Games]] in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, [[Irfan Shahîd]], and [[Warwick Ball]], argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip can be described as a Christian; still others, like [[Glen Bowersock]], argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to call him a Christian.

==Background==

===Biography of Philip the Arab===
{{Main|Philip the Arab}}
Philip was born in a village in [[Hauran|Auranitis]], part of the district of [[Trachonitis]], east of the [[Sea of Galilee]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern [[Shahba|al-Shahbā']], [[Syria]]) during his reign as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Cities'', 234; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 468; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 37, 72. On the foundation of Philippolis, see also: Jones, ''Cities'', 286. For details and arguments regarding the boundaries of the Provincia Arabia at Philip's birth, see Millar, 530–31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were [[Elagabalus]] and [[Alexander Severus]]). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Anderson, ''Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism'' (London: NLB, 1974), 87&amp;ndash;88.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and that he must have been prominent in his community.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLAIMANTS&quot;&gt;Michael L. Meckler and Christian Körner, &quot;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/philarab.htm Philip the Arab and Rival Claimants of the later 240s]&quot;, ''De Imperatoribus Romanus'' (1999), citing ''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01331&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1331]. Accessed 6 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early details of Philip's career are obscure, but his brother, [[Gaius Julius Priscus]], was made [[praetorian prefect]] under Emperor [[Gordian III]] (r. 238–44). If a fragmentary inscription (''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 1331) refers to Priscus, he would have moved through several equestrian offices (that is, administrative positions open to a member of the [[equestrian order]]) during Gordian's reign. In the spring of 242, Philip himself was made praetorian prefect, most likely with the help of his brother. Following a failed campaign against Persia in the winter of 243–44, Gordian died in camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLAIMANTS&quot;/&gt; Rumors that Philip had murdered him were taken up by the senatorial opposition of the later 3rd century, and survive in the Latin histories and epitomes of the period.&lt;ref&gt;York, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was acclaimed emperor, and was secure in that title by late winter 244. Philip made his brother ''rector Orientis'', an executive position with extraordinary powers, including command of the armies in the Eastern provinces. Philip began his reign by negotiating a peaceful end to his predecessor's war against Persia. In 248, Philip called the [[Secular Games]] to celebrate the 1000-year anniversary of the founding of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLAIMANTS&quot;/&gt;

In the Near East, Philip's brother Priscus' tax collection methods provoked the revolt of [[Jotapianus]]. At the same time, [[Silbannacus]] started a rebellion in the Rhenish provinces. He faced a third rebellion in 248 when the legions he had used in successful campaigns against the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] on the Danubian frontier revolted and proclaimed an officer named Pacatianus emperor. All three rebellions were suppressed quickly. In 249, to restore order after the defeat of Pacatianus, Philip gave Senator [[Decius]], a native of the region, command of the Danubian armies. In late spring 249, the armies proclaimed Decius emperor. The civil war that followed ended in a battle outside Verona. Decius emerged victorious, and Philip either died or was assassinated. When news of Philip's death reached Rome, the [[Praetorian Guard]] murdered his son and successor [[Philippus II|Marcus Julius Severus Philippus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CLAIMANTS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Nathan and Robin McMahon, &quot;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/decius.htm Trajan Decius (249-251 A.D.) and Usurpers During His Reign]&quot;, ''De Imperatoribus Romanus'' (2002). Accessed 11 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity and Philip's early life and career====
No account or allusion to Philip's presumed conversion to Christianity survives. The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd, who argues in favor of Philip's Christianity in ''Rome and the Arabs'', assumes that he had been a Christian before becoming emperor. He argues, therefore, that there is no need to explain the absence of evidence for Philip's conversion in contemporary Christian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69–70. Allard came to a similar position on Philip's childhood: &quot;because Philip was, in St. Jerome's phrase, the first of the Christian sovereigns of Rome, and, because no historian marks the occasion or cause of his conversion, we must believe that he was a Christian from birth&quot; (Allard, ''Histoire des persécutions'', 217).&lt;/ref&gt; Trachonitis, equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south, and sited on a road connecting the two, could have been Christianized from either direction.&lt;ref&gt;Allard, ''Histoire des persécutions'', 217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if he was not himself Christian, Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 126; cf. Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Pohlsander, a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip's Christianity, allows that Philip &quot;''may have been'' curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth. As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian, he ''may not have been'' so intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not keep an open mind on other religions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohlsander&quot; /&gt; He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip's childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohlsander&quot;&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 468; the italics are his. Pohlsander points to Alexander Severus and [[Julia Avita Mamaea|Julia Mamaea]], fellow Arabs and Syrians, as examples and precedents for such open-mindedness on religious matters (Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 468); Glen Bowersock traces this religious curiosity back to [[Julia Domna]], Mammaea's aunt (Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 126).&lt;/ref&gt; For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley, however, the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited.&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.347 n. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

If Philip had been a Christian during his military service, he would have not been a particularly unusual figure for his era&amp;mdash;although membership in the army was prohibited by certain churchmen, and would have required participation in rites some Christians found sacrilegious, it was not uncommon among the Christian laity.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 24, 24 n. 39, citing Tertullian, ''De corona'' 11, cf. ''Apologeticum'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of an emperor, however, was more explicitly pagan—emperors were expected to officiate over public rites and lead the religious ceremonies of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 24, citing A. D. Nock, &quot;The Roman Army and the Roman Religious Year&quot;, ''Harvard Theological Review'' 45 (1952): 186–252, rept. in ''Essays on Religion and the Ancient World'' (Oxford, 1972), ed. Zeph Stewart, 2.736–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian scripture contains explicit prohibitions on this sort of behavior, such as the [[Ten Commandments|First Commandment]]: &quot;You shall have no other gods before me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Jews, who faced the same prohibitions on &quot;idolatry&quot; and &quot;false gods&quot;, were granted exemption from Roman military service and public religion.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman rule from Pompey to Diocletian: A study in political relations'' (Leiden: BRILL, 2001), 137.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Whatever the prohibitions, people raised on the &quot;more tolerant Christianity of the camp&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott26&quot;&gt;Elliott, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; would have been able to justify participation in pagan ritual to themselves. We know that these people exist: the historical record includes Christian army officers, who would have been regularly guilty of idolatry, and the [[Military saint|military martyrs]] of the late 3rd century.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott26&quot;/&gt; Their ritual sacrifice excluded them from certain parts of the Christian community (ecclesiastical writers tended to ignore them, for example&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 26, 26 n. 48, citing Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.1.8 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;) but these people nonetheless believed themselves to be Christian and were recognized by others as Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 26–27, with an additional citation (at 26 n. 47) to J. Straub, &quot;Konstantins Verzicht auf den Gang zum Kapitol&quot;, ''Historia'' 4 (1955) 306, on apostates among Christian civilians.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity in Auranitis===
Thanks to its proximity to the first Christian communities of Palestine, [[Arabia Petraea|Provincia Arabia]], of which Philippopolis was a part, was among the first regions to convert to Christianity. By the time of Philip's birth, the region had been extensively Christianized,&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 468; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 36, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the north and in Hellenized settlements like those of Auranitis.&lt;ref name=&quot;CL599&quot;/&gt; The region is known to have had a fully developed [[synod]]al system (in which bishops from the dioceses in the region met to discuss Church affairs) by the mid-3rd century. The region sent six bishops to the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325,&lt;ref&gt;From Bosra, Philadelphia, Dionysias, Isbounta, Sodom and Beritaneus (Clarke, 599).&lt;/ref&gt; and Eusebius' ''Onomasticon'', a gazetteer of Biblical place-names, records a wholly Christian village called Cariathaim, or Caraiatha, near [[Madaba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CL599&quot;&gt;Clarke, 599.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the cities, however, there is less evidence of Christianization. Before the 5th century there is little evidence of the faith, and many villages remained unconverted in the 6th. Philippopolis, which was a small village for most of this period, does not have a Christian inscription that can be dated earlier than 552.&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.346.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known when the village established a [[prelate]]ship,&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.373.&lt;/ref&gt; but it must have been sometime before 451, when it sent a bishop to the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.346–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian beliefs were present in the region's Arab community since about AD 200, when [[Abgar VIII]], an ethnic Arab and king of the Roman [[client state]] [[Osroene]], converted to Christianity.  The religion was propagated from Abgar's capital at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] until its destruction in 244.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-3rd century, the city of [[Bosra]] had a Christian bishop, Beryllos. Beryllos offers an early example of the heretical beliefs Hellenic Christians imputed to the Arabs as a race:&lt;ref&gt;It was said that &quot;''Arabia haeresium ferax''&quot;, that Arabia was the breeding ground of heresies. On this theme in later Christian literature, see Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 107&amp;ndash;8, 154, 158; ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century'', 201, 278&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllos believed that Christ did not exist before he was made flesh at the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], his views were condemned as heresy following debate at a local synod.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.20.2; 6.33.1–3; Clarke, 599–600; Millar, 400.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was most likely conducted in Greek, a language in common use among the well-Hellenized cities of the region.{{#tag:ref|The large cities of Auranitis were well-Hellenized; by the mid-3rd century, fourteen cities of the Hauran, including Philippopolis, were minting coins in Greek and Latin. A mass of inscriptions in colloquial Greek also give evidence for contemporary linguistic practice.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

===Christianity in the mid-3rd century===
{{Further|Christianity in the 3rd century}}
The 3rd century was the age in which the initiative for persecution shifted from the masses to the Imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, ''Bishops'', 113–14; Frend, &quot;Genesis and Legacy&quot;, 511; Lane Fox, 450.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st and 2nd centuries, persecutions were carried out under the authority of local government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 616; Frend, &quot;Genesis and Legacy&quot;, 510. See also: Barnes, &quot;Legislation&quot;; de Sainte-Croix, &quot;Persecuted?&quot;; Musurillo, lviii–lxii; and Sherwin-White, &quot;Early Persecutions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Septimius Severus]] (r. 193–211) and [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximin]] (r. 235–38) are alleged to have issued general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, but the evidence for their acts is obscure and contested.&lt;ref&gt;On S. Severus: ''SHA Septimius Severus'' 17.1; Frend, &quot;Genesis and Legacy&quot;, 511; cf. Barnes, &quot;Legislation&quot;, 40–41; idem., ''Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), 151. On Maximin: Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.28; Barnes, &quot;Legislation&quot;, 43; Clarke, 621–25 Frend, &quot;Genesis and Legacy&quot;, 513.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status. [[Pogrom]]s against the Christians in Alexandria took place while Philip was still emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.41.1–9; Barnes, &quot;Legislation&quot;, 43; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 468.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Philip punished,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, &quot;Legislation&quot;, 43; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 468.&lt;/ref&gt; participated in or assisted the pogrom.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

No historian contests that Philip's successor [[Decius]] (r. 249–51), called a general persecution against the Church, and most would list it as the first. Decius was anxious to secure himself in the imperial office. Before mid-December 249, Decius issued an edict demanding that all Romans, throughout the empire, make a show of sacrifice to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, 450–54.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Libellus|Libelli]]'' were signed in [[Faiyum|Fayum]] in June and July 250 as demonstrations of this sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, &quot;Legislation&quot;, 43. See also: J. B. Rives, &quot;The Decree of Decius and the Religion of Empire&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 89 (1999), 135&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt; If the persecutions of Maximin and Septimius Severus are dismissed as fiction, Decius' edict was without precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, 450–51, 452–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Christians were believed to be Philip's friends (as Dionysius of Alexandria presents them), however, it might help explain Decius' motivations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane Fox, 453–54&quot;&gt;Lane Fox, 453–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Greek ecclesiastical writing==
The ancient traditions regarding Philip's [[Christianity]] can be divided into three categories: the Eusebian, or [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarean]]; the [[Antioch]]ene; and the Latin. The Eusebian tradition consists of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea]]'s ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' and the documents excerpted and cited therein, including the letters of Origen and Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria. The Antiochene tradition consists of the [[John Chrysostom]]'s homily ''de S. Babyla'' and Leontius, bishop of Antioch's entries in the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]''. Most scholars hold that these accounts ultimately derive from [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (''Ecclesiastical History''), but some, like Irfan Shahîd, posit that Antioch had an independent oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Gregg, 43; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 466; E. Stein ''apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eusebius===
The most significant author to discuss Philip the Arab and Christianity is [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], who served as bishop of [[Caesarea]] in Roman Palestine from ''ca''. 314 to his death in 339.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius' major work is the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', written in several editions dating from ''ca''. 300 to 325. The ''Historia'' is not an attempt at a full history of the Church in the classical style, but rather a collection of facts addressing six topics in Christian history from the [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic times]] to the late 3rd century: (1) lists of bishops of major [[Episcopal see|sees]]; (2) Christian teachers and their writings; (3) heresies; (4) the tribulations of the Jews; (5) the persecutions of Christians by pagan authorities; and (6) the martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 1.1; Barnes, &quot;Eusebius of Caesarea&quot;, ''The Expository Times'' 121:1 (2009): 5–6; Quasten, 3.314–15.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Vita Constantini'', written between Constantine's death in 337 and Eusebius' own death in 339, is a combination of [[eulogy|eulogistic]] [[encomium]] and continuation of the ''Historia'' (the two separate documents were combined and distributed by Eusebius' successor in the see of Caesarea, [[Acacius of Caesarea|Acacius]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five references in Eusebius' ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' speak to Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he describes Philip visiting a church on [[Holy Saturday|Easter Eve]] and being denied entry by the presiding bishop because he had not yet confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed.&lt;ref&gt;Gwatkin, 2.153 n. 1; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; At 6.36.3, he writes of letters from the Christian theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two references are quotations or paraphrases of [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria]], a contemporary of Philip (he held the [[patriarchate]] from 247 to 265).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that [[Alexander Severus]] (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philip's visit to the church====

=====Text, sources, and interpretation=====
Most arguments regarding Philip's Christianity hinge on Eusebius' account of the emperor's visit to a church at 6.34.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., e.g., Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125; Gregg, 43; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 466.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the 17th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont]], it is the &quot;''la ſeule action en laquelle on ſache qu'il ait honoré l'Église''&quot;, the &quot;only action in which we know him to have honored the Church&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tillemont, 3.262–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Gordianus had been Roman emperor for six years when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is reported that he, being a Christian, desired, on the day of the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.

:&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 90%&quot;&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.34, tr. A. C. McGiffert&lt;/div&gt;

In Shahîd's reconstruction, this event took place at Antioch on 13 April 244, while the emperor was on his way back to Rome from the Persian front.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 66, 70. Michael Peachin, in a reconstruction of Philip's journey, suggests that Philip might have taken a southerly route back from the Persian frontier—from Circesium to Dura via Palmyra, and then on to the coast—instead of stopping in Antioch, but he allows that the traditional route is still a viable possibility (Peachin, 333–34, 334 n. 16). In any case, Philip certainly visited the city later in the year, because the city minted coinage celebrating his ''adventus'' (Peachin, 334, 334 n. 22, citing ''Roman Imperial Coinage'' 4.3, 81). He may also have visited Antioch again after a brief trip north to Perge, Comana, Lake Ascania, and Apameia (Peachin, 336).&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th-century Byzantine historian [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]] repeats the story.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, ''Annales'' 12.19; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius introduces his account of Philip's visit with the words κατέχει λόγος' (''katechei logos''). The precise meaning of these words in modern European languages has been contested. Ernst Stein, in an account challenging the veracity of Eusebius' narrative, translated the phrase as &quot;''gerüchte''&quot;, or &quot;rumor&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68, citing ''Paulys Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft'' 10.1 (1918) cols. 768–70; cf. Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 467, Gwatkin, 2.152.&lt;/ref&gt; the scholar John Gregg translated it as &quot;the saying goes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 43&quot;&gt;Gregg, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other renderings are possible, however; modern English translations of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' have &quot;it is recorded&quot; or &quot;it is reported&quot;, as in the translation quoted above.&lt;ref&gt;McGiffert, ''loc cit''., 1.278; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 466; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68, citing J.E.L. Oulton, ''Ecclesiastical History'' (London: Heinemann, 1938), 2.89. Williamson (''loc cit''., 206) has &quot;there is reason to believe&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Robin Lane Fox]], who translates ''logos'' as &quot;story&quot; or &quot;rumor&quot; in [[scare quotes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane Fox, 453–54&quot;/&gt; emphasizes that Eusebius draws a distinction between his &quot;story&quot; about Philip and the other material in the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, 754 n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The substantiative issue involved is the nature of Eusebius' source; where &quot;''gerüchte''&quot; suggests hearsay (Frend explains that Eusebius'  κατέχει λόγος' &quot;usually means mere suggestion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frend, ''Rise of Christianity'', 333 n. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;), &quot;it is recorded&quot; suggests documentation. Given that Eusebius' major sources for 3rd-century history were written records, Shahîd contends that the typical translation misrepresents the original text.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His source here is probably one of the two letters from Origen to Philip and [[Marcia Otacilia Severa]], Philip's wife, mentioned at 6.36.3.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 351 n. 95; Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd argues that an oral source is unlikely given that Eusebius composed his ''Historia'' in Caesarea and not Antioch; but others, like Stein and theologian [[Arthur Cushman McGiffert]], editor and translator of the ''Historia'' for the ''[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]]'', contend nonetheless that the story has an oral source.&lt;ref&gt;McGiffert ed., ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' at n. 2040, online at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxxiv.html CCEL]; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahîd's position is reinforced by C. H. Roberts and [[A. N. Sherwin-White]], who reviewed his ''Rome and the Arabs'' before publication.  That is, that the proper interpretation of κατέχει λόγος is as a reference to a written account. Roberts notes that Χριστιανὸν ὄντα (''Christianon onta'', &quot;being a Christian&quot;) was probably an editorial insertion by Eusebius, and not included in the ''logos'' he relates in the passage. Shahîd takes this as an indication that Eusebius did indeed vouch for Philip's Christianity. Roberts suggested that κατέχει λόγος might be translated as &quot;there is a wide-spread report&quot;, but added that a broader study of Eusebius' use of the expression elsewhere would be useful. Sherwin-White points out Eusebius' use of the phrase in his passage on the [[Legio XII Fulminata|Thundering Legion]] (at ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.5), where it represents a reference to written sources.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically asserts that he has read the letters (he only says that he has compiled them&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt;) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68–69, 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Contexts and parallels=====
For many scholars, the scene at 6.34 seems to anticipate and parallel the confrontation between [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] and [[Ambrose]] in 390;&lt;ref&gt;Neale, 42; Kidd, 1.352; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 467; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] used the two situations as parallel ''[[exemplum|exempla]]'' in a letter written to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 1400 (Basel, 1 December 1523), in ''The Correspondence of Erasmus'', ed. R.A.B. Mynors, Alexander Dalzell (1992), 10.113–26, at 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt; That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, in a society that had already been significantly [[Christianization|Christianized]], the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69, paraphrasing Stein in the ''Realencyclopädie'' 10.1 (1918) cols. 768–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church on his way back to Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|[[Timothy Barnes]], a historian of the 3rd and 4th centuries, finds Eusebius' story &quot;suspiciously similar&quot; to a story the 5th-century church historian [[Philostorgius]] (a [[Anomoeanism|Eunomian]] sectary whose anti-Trinitarian history survives only in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]' epitome) gives about Babylas and another 3rd-century emperor, [[Numerian]] (r. 283–84).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, &quot;Legislation&quot;, 43 n. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 90%&quot;&gt;
:Babylas was bishop of Antioch; by inspiration of the devil, Numerian the Roman emperor, or as others say, Decius, was led to desire to enter the church of the Christians at the time when a very large concourse of people had assembled together. But the priest of God stood at the entrance porch and forbade his entry, declaring that, so far as in him lay, he would not suffer a wolf to climb into the fold. But the emperor immediately desisted from his effort, either because he feared a popular outbreak, or because he changed his mind on some other account. But as to the bishop, he first accused him of insolence, and afterwards commanded him to sacrifice to the heathen deities, as being the only sacrifice by which he could at once wash out his offence, and gain honour and glory from posterity. Babylas having resisted the proposals of the emperor with a stout and noble heart, received the crown of martyrdom.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Philostorgius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 7.8, tr. E. Walford&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shahîd draws a different comparison, calling Babylas &quot;the first after [[Nathan (prophet)|the prophet Nathan]] of Old Testament times to throw a challenge to a Christian ruler {{sic}}&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 88&quot; /&gt; After noting that Babylas–Philip serves as a prelude to Ambrose–Theodosius, he adduces two more encounters which embody the same general theme (&quot;the repentance of the emperor&quot;): the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Nicholas Mystikos]]' confrontation with Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] at Constantinople in 906/7, and [[Pope Gregory VII]]'s [[Walk to Canossa|confrontation]] with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]] at [[Canossa]] in 1077. Shahîd thus believes that Babylas' stand was all the more &quot;courageous&quot;, happening, as it did, during an era of persecution and instability.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 88&quot;&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 88.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that, if the historicity of Babylas' confrontation is accepted (and Mysticus' confrontation with Leo, brought to prominence by Nicolas Oikonomides, is recognized as significant), the four scenes are equally divided between East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 88 n. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

Other scholars, such as ecclesiastical historian [[Henry Melvill Gwatkin|H. M. Gwatkin]], explain Philip's alleged visit to the church as evidence of simple &quot;curiosity&quot;. That he was excluded from services is not surprising: as a &quot;heathen&quot; in official conduct, and, as an unbaptized man, it would have been unusual if he had been admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Gwatkin, 2.153.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd rejects idle curiosity as an explanation, arguing that 3rd-century churches were too nondescript to attract much undue attention. That Philip was unbaptized is nowhere proven or stated,&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 70; cf. Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 6.34; York, 327.&lt;/ref&gt; and, even if true, it would do little to explain the scene: Constantine participated in Christian services despite postponing baptism to the end of his life—and participation in services without baptism was not unusual for Christians of either period.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 70–71, 70 n. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria====
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 90%&quot;&gt;
:The mention of those princes who were publicly supposed to be Christians, as we find it in an epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. l. vii c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his family; and forms a contemporary evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian bishop, who lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome, expresses himself with becoming diffidence concerning the truth of the fact.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', ed. D. Womersley (London: Penguin, 1994 [1776]), 1.554 n. 119.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At 6.41, Eusebius quotes a letter from Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, to Fabius, bishop of Antioch, on the persecution at Alexandria under Decius. He begins (at 6.41.1) by describing the pogroms which began a year before Decius' decree of 250; that is, in 249, under Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes suggests (&quot;Legislation&quot;, 43 n. 138) that this passage be interpreted according to the date fixed in Egypt for compliance with the terms of Decius' decree, rather than its date of issuance as recorded at Rome (winter 249/50) or Alexandria.&lt;/ref&gt; At 6.41.9, Dionysius narrates the transition from Philip to Decius.

Dionysius is quoted saying that Valerian was so friendly to Christians that he outdid &quot;those who were said to be openly Christians&quot; (οἰ λεχθέντες ἀναφανδὸν Χριοτιανοὶ γεγονέναι, tr. Shahîd).&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 7.10.3, qtd. and tr. Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars, Shahîd and Stein included, understand this as a reference to Severus Alexander and Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 489 n. 123; Gregg, 43; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the reference is to a plurality of emperors, implying that Severus Alexander and Philip were both Christians, Stein dismissed the passage as entirely without evidentiary value. Shahîd, however, contends that genuine information can be extracted from the spurious whole, and that, while the reference to Severus Alexander is hyperbole, the reference to Philip is not.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; He explains the reference to Severus Alexander as a Christian as an exaggeration of what was actually only an interest in the Christian religion. Shahîd references a passage in the often-dubious ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]''{{'}}s biography of the emperor, which states that Alexander had statues of [[Abraham]], Christ, and [[Orpheus]] in his private chapel, and that he prayed to them each morning.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Alexander'' 29.2; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71; cf. Gregg, 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; He also adduces the letters sent from Origen to Alexander's mother [[Julia Avita Mamaea|Mamaea]] (Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.21, 6.28) to explain Dionysius' comment.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71; cf.

Origen's letters do not survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; However, most scholars believe that the letters that circulated in the era of Eusebius and Jerome were genuine. It is also reasonable that Origen, a man with close contacts in the Christian Arab community, would have taken a particular interest in the first Arab emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar K. J. Neumann argued that, since Origen would have known the faith of the imperial couple, he must have written about it in the letters listed at 6.36.3. Since Eusebius read these letters, and does not mention that the emperor was Christian (Neumann understands the passage at 6.34 to reflect Eusebius' disbelief in Philip's Christianity), we must conclude that Philip was not Christian, and was neither baptized nor made [[catechumen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Against Neumann, Shahîd argues that, if Eusebius had found anything in the letters to disprove Philip's Christianity, he would have clearly outlined it in this passage—as the biographer of Constantine, it would have been in his interest to undermine any other claimants to the title &quot;first Christian emperor&quot;. Moreover, this segment of the ''Historia'' is a catalog of Origen's works and correspondence; the contents of the letters are irrelevant.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

====Views on the Arabs====
Eusebius' understanding of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading of the [[Bible]] and his knowledge of the history of imperial Rome. He does not appear to have personally known any Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 95–109, esp. 108–9, 108 n. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Chronicon'', all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to [[Ishmael]]—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; To Eusebius, the [[Saracen]]s of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical [[Ishmaelites]], descendants of the handmaid, [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and the patriarch, [[Abraham]]. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's [[Covenant (biblical)#Covenant with Isaac|Covenant]] with the favored son of Abraham, [[Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 95–96, 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and ''latrones'', raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation an unhappy color.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 104–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 78, 78 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Historia'', Eusebius does not identify either Philip or [[Abgar V of Edessa]] (whom he incorrectly presumed to be the first Christian prince; he does not mention [[Abgar VIII]], who was actually the first Christian prince), as Arabs. He does, however, identify [[Herod the Great]] as an Arab, thus tarring the Arab nation with the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] and the attempted murder of Christ himself.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christianity of Provincia Arabia in the 3rd century also earns some brief notices: the heresy of Beryllos, bishop of Bostra, and his correction by Origen (6.33); the heretical opinions concerning the soul held by a group of Arabs until corrected by Origen (6.37); and the heresy of [[Elchasai|Helkesaites]] (6.38). Eusebius' account of Philip appears amidst these Arab heresies (at 6.34, 6.36, and 6.39), although, again—and in spite of the fact that Philip so often took on the epithet &quot;the Arab&quot;, in antiquity as today—he never identifies him as an Arab.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the Arabs as heretics would persist in later ecclesiastical historians (like [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 103, 103 n. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd, relating these facts, nonetheless concludes that &quot;Eusebius cannot be accused in the account he gave of the Arabs and their place in the history of Christianity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p109&quot; /&gt; The fact that he downplayed the role of Philip and Abgar in the establishment of Christianity as a state religion is understandable, given his desire to prop up [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;p109&quot;&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views on Constantine====
In Shahîd's judgment, the imprecision and unemphatic tone of Eusebius' passage at 6.34 is the major cause of the lack of scholarly consensus on Philip's Christianity. To Shahîd, Eusebius' wording choice is a reflection of his own lack of enthusiasm for Philip's Christianity, which is in turn a reflection of the special position Constantine held in his regards and in his written work.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68–69; 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars, following E. Schwartz, believe the later editions of Eusebius' ''Historia'' to have been extensively revised to adapt to the deterioration of [[Licinius]] in the public memory (and official ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'') after Constantine deposed and executed him in 324–25. Passages of the ''Historia'' incompatible with Licinius' denigration were suppressed, and an account of the last years of his life was replaced with a summary of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]]. Shahîd suggests that, in addition to these anti-Licinian deletions, Eusebius also edited out favorable notices on Philip to better glorify Constantine's achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 81, 81 n. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 335, Eusebius wrote and delivered his ''Laudes Constantini'', a [[panegyric]] on the thirtieth anniversary of the emperor's reign; his ''Vita Constantini'', written over the next two years, has the same laudatory tone. The ecclesiastical historian, who framed his chronology on the reigns of emperors and related the entries in his history to each emperor's reign, understood Constantine's accession as something miraculous, especially as it came immediately after the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]]. The final edition of his ''Historia'' has its climax in Constantine's reign, the ultimate &quot;triumph of Christianity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 77–78; cf. Ball, 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd argues, it was therefore in his authorial interest to obscure the details of Philip, the first Christian emperor; hence, because of Eusebius' skill in narrative and deception, modern historians give Constantine that title.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahîd further argues that the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also discourage Eusebius from celebrating that emperor. Firstly, Philip lacks an exciting [[conversion narrative]]; secondly, his religion was private, unlike Constantine's very public patronage of the faith; and, thirdly, his reign only lasted five years, not long enough to enact much amelioration of the Christians' condition.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of his reign to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain the tone and content of his account.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 79. Cf. also Lane Fox, 609, on Philip as an unworthy antecedent of Constantine.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Vita Constantini''====
F. H. Daniel, in Philip's entry in the Smith–Wace ''Dictionary of Christian Biography'', cites a passage of Eusebius' ''Vita Constantini'' as his first piece of evidence against Philip's alleged Christianity. In the passage, Eusebius names Constantine as (in the words of the dictionary) &quot;the first Christian emperor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;&gt;F.H. Blackburne Daniel, &quot;Philippus&quot; (5), in ''A Dictionary of Christian Biography'', ed. William Smith and Henry Wace (London: John Murray, 1887), 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahîd describes this passage as a mere flourish from Eusebius the panegyrist, &quot;carried away by enthusiasm and whose statements must be construed as rhetorical exaggeration&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;p82&quot; /&gt; he does not take it as serious evidence against Eusebius' earlier accounts in the ''Historia'', where he never refers to Constantine as the first Christian emperor. For Shahîd, the passage also represents the last stage in Eusebius' evolving portrait of the pair of emperors, Philip and Constantine: in the early 300s, in his ''Chronicon'', he had nearly called Philip the first Christian emperor; in the 320s, during the revision of the ''Historia'' and the ''Chronicon'', he turned wary and skeptical; in the late 330s, he could confidently assert that Constantine was the sole Christian emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;p82&quot;&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; John York argues that, in writing this passage, Eusebius was cowed by the anti-Licinian propaganda of the Constantinian era: as an ancestor of the emperor's last enemy, Philip could not receive the special distinction of the title &quot;first Christian emperor&quot;—Constantine had claimed it for himself.&lt;ref&gt;York, 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps, Shahîd observes, it is not coincidental that Eusebius would paint the Arabs in uncomplimentary terms (as idolaters and practitioners of human sacrifice) in his ''Laudes Constantini'' of 335.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Laudes Constantini'' 13.5, 7; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 82–83 n.  41, 101–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Excerpt from John Chrysostom, ''de S. Babylas'' 1, tr. T. P. Brandam&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Leontius was bishop of Antioch from 348 to 357. He is quoted in the ''Chronicon Paschale'', or ''Paschal Chronicle'', a universal chronicle of history based on the [[paschal cycle]], as an authority on the martyrdom of Babylas. The quotation describes Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;G. Salmon, &quot;Leontius, bp. of Antioch&quot;, in ''A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies'', ed. Henry Wace and William C. Piercy (London: John Murray, 1911, rept. Hendrickson, 1999), 658, online at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Leontius,%20bp.%20of%20Antioch CCEL], accessed 11 April 2010; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67, 68, citing ''Chronicon Paschale'', ed. Dindorf, 1.503f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysostom and Leontius both lived in Antioch, the site of Philip's alleged humiliation and repentance, and wrote in the mid-4th century, one hundred years after the event took place. Shahîd takes this, along with the fact that Babylas is not named in Eusebius' account, as evidence of an independent local tradition. This tradition would have been perhaps partially oral in nature, and far removed from the written accounts in Eusebius' library at Caesarea.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other historians trace Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts back to Eusebius: Hans Pohlsander counts Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts as later accretions to Eusebius original account, dependent on his ''Historia'' for their legendary core;&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 466.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gregg holds that this dependent relationship is most probable;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 43&quot;/&gt; and Stein claims all three Greeks as contributors to the same ''gerüchte''.&lt;ref&gt;''Apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Latin ecclesiastical writing==
The Latin tradition consists of three authors writing in the later 4th and early 5th centuries—Jerome, Orosius, and Vincent of Lérins. The tradition is represented in [[Jerome]]'s ''Liber de viris inlustribus'' and ''Chronicon'', [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', and [[Vincent of Lérins]]' ''Commonitorum Primum''. Most scholars hold that all of these accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's ''Historia''. These authors follow the Greek tradition, and probably takes all of their information from Eusebius, Eusebius' sources, or Jerome. These authors are more forceful in their claims than Eusebius, as demonstrated by their use of ''primus'', or &quot;first&quot;, as in &quot;first Christian emperor&quot;, when referring to Philip. Jerome is the most important, both since he is the earliest of the three, and because, as the editor and translator of Eusebius' ''Chronicon'' (''Chronicle''), he is closest to Eusebius.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerome===
Eusebius' first version of the ''Chronicon'' was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, translation and continuation dates to 380.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that the substance of the original survives.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 111–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the ''Chronicon'' only covers the period from 325 to 378&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 80 n. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 97 n. 15; citing J. Karst, ''Die Chronik'', ''Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten {drei} Jahrhunderte'' 20 (1911), 225–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome's ''Chronicon'' is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip ''primus'' in the ''Chronicon'' thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd believes that ''primus'' appeared in Eusebius first version of the ''Chronicon'', but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 80, cf. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Liber de viris inlustribus'', written twelve years later, in 392, Jerome mentions Philip in his chapter on Origen.

Sed et illud, quod ad Mammeam, matrem Alexandri imperatoris, religiosam feminam, rogatus venit Antiochiam, et summo honore habitus est: quodque ad Philippum imperatorem, qui primus de regibus Romanis Christianus fuit, et ad matrem ejus litteras fecit, quae usque hodie exstant.

Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was instructed at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.

{{col-end}}
:&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 90%&quot;&gt;Jerome, ''Liber de viris inlustribus'' 54, tr. E. C. Richardson&lt;/div&gt;

The passage contains two important features: first, the statement that the letters of Origen to Philip and his family were still extant in Jerome's time; and second, a strong affirmation of Philip's Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence also contains the false reference to Philip's mother (''matrem'') as the recipient of a letter from Origen—it was actually Philip's wife who received it. Jerome probably confused her with Alexander Severus' mother Mammaea.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 73 n. 21, also citing Nautin, 217 n. 99, 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowersock characterizes the whole passage as a &quot;confused copy&quot; of Eusebius' evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125 n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd understands &quot;''quae usque hodie extant''&quot; to mean that Jerome had read the letters; that he refers to Philip as ''primus'' would thus mean that he either found positive evidence for Philip's Christianity in them or, at least, that he found nothing to disprove it.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome otherwise had a dim view of the Arabs. His prejudices were those of a native Roman. Born in [[Stridon|Strido]] (in modern [[Croatia]] or [[Slovenia]]), near [[Aquileia]], and educated in Rome, Jerome was a lover of Latin, Italy, and the city of Rome. In about 374, he found himself accused in a dream while in Antioch on the way to Palestine: &quot;''Ciceronianus es, non Christianus''&quot;, &quot;you are a [[Cicero]]nian, not a Christian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 22.30; Shahîd, ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century'', 294, 294 n. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters, written while he was staying in the desert of [[Chalcis, Syria|Chalcis]], he tells of the joy he had when he discovered that his correspondents had written a letter to him in Latin. All he had to hear during the day were the &quot;barbarous&quot; languages of the natives (that is, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 7.2–3; Shahîd, ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century'', 294, 294 n. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; From this evidence, Shahîd concludes that Jerome would not honor the memory of an Arab emperor without a strong rationale.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 97 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orosius and the ''Origo Constantini Imperatoris''===
To Orosius, Constantine was the first Christian Roman emperor, except for Philip (he was the &quot;''primus imperatorum Christianus, excepto Philippo''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Orosius, ''Historiae adversum paganos'' 7.28; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; He probably took this judgment from Jerome—he had met the author in [[Bethlehem]] in 415, while on assignment from [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Although his judgment is thus not independent of Jerome, Shahîd contends that it is nonetheless valuable since Orosius did not have a bias towards either emperor. It presents Philip in the role Christian history merited: as precursor to Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Orosius' ''Historiae adversum paganos'' served as the standard manual of universal history during the middle ages, his judgment on this matter was inherited, and generally accepted, by medieval European writers.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83 n. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orosius' wording is echoed by the ''[[Origo Constantini|Origo Constantini Imperatoris]]'', an anonymous work usually dated to the late 4th century. &quot;Constantine was also the first Christian emperor, with the exception of Philippus, who seemed to me to have become a Christian merely in order that the one-thousandth year of Rome might be dedicated to Christ rather than to pagan idols.&quot; (&quot;''Item Constantinus imperator primus Christianus, excepto Philippo, qui Christianus admodum ad hoc tantum constitutus fuisse mihi visus est, ut millesimus Romae annus Christo potius quam idolis dicaretur''&quot;, tr. J.C. Rolfe&lt;ref&gt;''Origo Constantini'' 6.33; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83 n. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;) The scholar Samuel N. C. Lieu holds that this passage is a later interpolation, designed to give the work's pagan core a Christian gloss. According to Lieu, this passage, along with others, was probably taken from Orosius' history and [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|inserted]] into the ''Origo Constantini'' during the reign of [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]] (r. 417–21), a period that witnessed substantial anti-pagan polemic.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu and Montserrat, 40, 42, 48, 61 n. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd argues that, since the author of the ''Origo Constantini'' was a biographer of Constantine, and not a historian of the 3rd and 4th centuries, his reference to Philip is unnecessary. The conflicting claims of Philip and Constantine to primacy may have been at issue at the turn of the 5th century, when the ''Origo Constantini'' and ''Historia adversum paganos'' were written.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83 n. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vincent of Lérins===
In the chapter on Origen in Vincent of Lérins' ''Commonitorium primum'', Vincent writes: &quot;''quos ad Philippum imperatorem, qui primus romanorum principum Christianus fuit, Christiani magisterii acutoritate conscripsit.''&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''Commonitorium primum'', cols. 662–63, qtd. in Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;with the authority which [Origen] assumed as a Christian Teacher, he wrote to the Emperor Philip, the first Roman prince that was a Christian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent of Lérins, ''Commonitorium primum'' 17.43, tr. C. A. Heurtley.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent thus unites the commentary on Origen's letters with Philip's Christianity, as Jerome had done. It is possible that he was only following Jerome in so doing, but Shahîd argues that his note that the letters were written &quot;''Christiani magisterii auctoritate''&quot; implies that he has read the letters.  Additionally, the variance between his wording and Jerome's (Vincent refers to Philip as a ''princeps'', not a ''rex'', and he calls the letters ''epistolae'', not ''litterae''), speaks for Vincent's independence of Jerome.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 74–75, 74 n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zosimus]], a pagan writing at the turn of the 6th century, wrote a work titled the ''Historia Nova'' (''New History''). Its detailed sections cover the period from the 3rd century AD to 410. Zosimus, like all secular historians in his era, addressed himself to the governing class of the later Roman empire: officers, bureaucrats, and the landed aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 684–85.&lt;/ref&gt; There was relatively little overlap between the reading audience of secular histories and the ecclesiastical histories of Eusebius and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 688–89.&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the period it covers, the ''Historia'' is the most valuable—and sometimes the only—available source. Zosimus' history was written as a polemic, with the aim of establishing that barbarism and Christianity were the essential causes of the decline of the Roman state. Because of these themes, the ''Historia Nova'' is considered the first history of what moderns would call Rome's &quot;decline and fall&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Although skilled in literary rhetoric,&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, 413 n. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus was a poor historian. He confuses dates and persons, is ignorant of geography, and treats his sources with naive simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, 413.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 3rd century, Zosimus follows [[Eunapius|Eunapius of Sardis]] and [[Olympiodorus of Thebes|Olympiodorus of Thebes in Egypt]]. Since Eunapius' history began in 272, where the ''Chronicle'' of another historian, [[Dexippus]], ended, Zosimus probably used Dexippus' ''Chronicle'', and perhaps his histories of the German wars between 250 and 270. Dexippus, however, was as poor a historian as Zosimus. The surviving fragments of his work show an uncritical author, without strong sources, who prefers rhetoric to fact.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 232–34.&lt;/ref&gt; (The secular sources for this period are all quite weak.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 232.&lt;/ref&gt;) Zosimus, like all ancient secular historians of the era,&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125. Warwick Ball, against the silence of other historians, contends that Aurelius Victor gives evidence of Philip's Christianity in his  ''Liber de Caesaribus'' at section 28.2 (Ball, 489 n. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; says nothing of Philip's alleged Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14, 114 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zosimus had no great respect for Philip, and offers an unfavorable judgment on his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14, 114 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he offers a curiously detailed narrative of his reign.  He devotes five sections of his ''Historia Nova'' to the emperor (1.18–22)—more than Alexander Severus, who only gets half a section (1.8).&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14, 114 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He even reverts to Philip in the midst of a discussion of the Peace of [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] (363) two books later (at 3.32), taking the opportunity to recall Philip's own &quot;disgraceful&quot; peace with the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114 n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shahîd's judgment, Zosimus makes this editorial decision to emphasize his central theme—the decline and &quot;barbarization&quot; of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus' views on the latter phenomenon reflect his racial prejudice, and his account of Philip carries anti-Semitic overtones.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114, 114 n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In Zosimus' view, Philip was a barbarian operating at the highest levels of power. The unsavory character of Philip is contrasted with his ethnically Roman predecessor, Gordian (who Philip helped overthrow), and his Roman successor, Decius, who wins glowing praise from the historian.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he disliked both Arabs and Christians, some scholars, such as Bowersock, have taken Zosimus' silence on the matter as strong evidence against Philip's alleged Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like historian Warwick Ball, view Zosimus' evident distaste for Philip as noteworthy, and suggest that Zosimus' anti-Christian polemic is indirect in his writing on the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, 489 n. 125&quot;&gt;Ball, 489 n. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd construes Zosimus' silence as an argument for Philip's Christianity. Zosimus, he argues, would never have shown such distaste for a pagan. Septimius Severus was a &quot;barbarian&quot;, an African born at Leptis Magna whose mother tongue was Phoenician and whose wife, Julia Domna, was a provincial from Emesa. But Severus gets a good press from Zosimus (1.8). Nor would Philip's assistance in the execution of Gordian be enough: the 3rd century was hardly a stranger to such bloodshed and treachery.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus' hostility begins to makes sense, Shahîd contends, once we assume that he was aware of the tradition that viewed Philip as the first Christian emperor (and perhaps even accepted it). And it becomes perfectly clear once we understand the importance Zosimus attributes to the Secular Games, and the schematic incongruity he would behold when a Christian emperor was presiding over them.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 248, Philip held [[Secular Games]] (''Ludi Saeculares'') to celebrate the thousandth anniversary of [[Founding of Rome|Rome's legendary founding]] by Romulus. It is presumed that he would have officiated over the games in his capacity as ''pontifex maximus'', chief priest of the state cults.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 465.&lt;/ref&gt; Allard accepts that he made no public notice of his private religion, and that he ran the games as a &quot;prince païen&quot;, a &quot;pagan prince&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Allard, ''Christianisme et l'empire romain'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Pohlsander cites a number of early Christian theologians in support of his contention that &quot;Christians generally condemned 'games' of any kind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;page 465&quot; /&gt; Tertullian's ''de Spectaculis'', [[Antipope Novatian|Novatian]]'s treatise of the same name (which does not survive), and Cyprian's disapproving comments in his ''ad Donatum'' are offered as examples.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 465&quot;&gt;Tertullian, ''de Spectaculis'', ''passim''; Cyprian, ''Epistulae'' 1.7; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 465.&lt;/ref&gt; The later followers of Jerome, however, like Orosius and Bede, mention Philip's games approvingly—Orosius even claims that Philip did not sacrifice during the games.&lt;ref&gt;Orosius 7.20.2–3; Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 465–66, 466 n. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Pohlsander concedes that public games continued under Christian emperors throughout the 4th century (they were eventually outlawed in 404 under [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]).

Zosimus provides the lengthiest account of the games (at ''Historia Nova'' 2.1–7), but does not mention Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 465, 465 n. 35; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The games had a starring role in Zosimus' scheme of Roman history. To him, the fortune of the empire was intimately related to the practice of the traditional civic rites. Any emperor who revived or supported those rites—Augustus, Claudius, Domitian, Septimius Severus—earns Zosimus' credit, while the emperor who ended them, Constantine I, earns his condemnation. All the misfortune of the 4th century can be directly attributed to Constantine's discontinuation of the old rites.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Shahîd argues, Zosimus' silence on Philip's Christianity and Philip's involvement in the games makes sense.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt; First, it would have given lie to his thesis on that the practice of the traditional rites guaranteed the fortunes of empire, since the period following the games was hardly a happy one (and this argument remains valid even if both Philip's Christianity and Zosimus' awareness of the tradition is denied).&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 116, 116 n. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; And second, it would have dulled his attack on Constantine by disentangling the potent alignment between imperial disaster, Christianity, and the traditional cult. The last emperor to celebrate the games was also the first emperor to embrace Christianity. The incongruity of this fact proved too much for the historian to handle, so he ignored it.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
&lt;!--
===3rd and 4th centuries: three views===
====John York====
On the reconstruction of York, there were two great factions in the high politics of the 3rd century: the army and the senatorial order.&lt;ref&gt;York, 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Each had a geographic core: the army in the frontier provinces of the West and along the Danube; the senatorial elite in the East, Africa, and Italy. The senatorial core thus overlapped with areas of significant Christianization: Asia Minor, Syria, and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;York, 320–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Each had its propagandists, but the senatorial elite was much better-served by its litterateurs than the army was by theirs. The factions also divided on dynastic and confessional lines; Decius supported the Christians, Decius opposed them.&lt;ref&gt;York, 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Aelius Junius Cordus' writings, full of anecdotes and trivia, preserved some Decian propaganda that made its way into later histories. Philip is little respected by all surviving sources because his faction (senatorial Arab and Syriac Christians) failed to thrive in either his own century or the following. He is opposed by all pagan writers because of his Christianity, and he is opposed by most Christian writers because his alleged dynastic heir, Licinius,&lt;ref&gt;''HA Tres Gordiani'' 34.5; York, 322.&lt;/ref&gt; opposed Constantine, the great patron of the Church, and lost.&lt;ref&gt;York, 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia Augusta'', a collection of imperial biographies dating to the late 4th century by a single author, but which claims to be written by different authors under Diocletian and Constantine at the turn of the 4th century, exhibits particular dislike for the emperor. No biography of Philip survives, but the latter part of the ''Tres Gordiani'' (dealing with Philip's seizure and execution of Gordian III) show the emperor in a negative light, and the ''Divus Aurelianus'' lists him among a notorious group of &quot;bad emperors&quot;: &quot;For, to say nothing of the Vitelli, the Caligulae, and the Nerones, who can endure the Maximini, the Philippi, and the dregs of a disorderly multitude [the Gallieni]?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''HA Divus Aurelianus'' 42.6, qtd. and tr. York, 321.&lt;/ref&gt; York believes, following the scholar Henri Stern, that one of the major aims of the ''Historia Augusta'' is to burnish the memory of the Constantinian dynasty, and that it thus shares in the anti-Phillipic prejudices of the other extant histories.&lt;ref&gt;York, 322, citing Henri Stern, ''Date et Destinataire de l'«Histoire Auguste»'', ''Collection d'Études Latines, publiée par la Société des Études Latines, Serie Scientifique'', 27 (Paris: Société d'Édition «Les Belles Lettres», 1953), 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the revival of traditional religion begun by [[Julian the Apostate]] (r. 360–63) another set of historical traditions unfavorable to Phillip emerged. The major pagan historian of the period, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], represents this group (although his books covering the years before 353 are not extant, he makes unfavorable references to Philip during his account of Julian's campaign against Persia).&lt;ref&gt;York, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; 

All three traditions—Decian, Constantinian, and Julian—contend that Philip was responsible for the death of his predecessor, Gordian III. Their accounts of Gordian's deposition, however, are confused and inconsistent. The ''Historia Augusta'' offers the lengthiest account. After food shortages instigated by Philip turned the soldiers against Gordian, the ''Historia Augusta'' related, Philip was raised to an equal rank. Gordian, angered by Philip's promotion, demanded that he be dismissed. But, in the imperial council, Philip's supporters were more numerous, and he appealed to the officers and generals of the army to sentence Gordian to death instead. Gordian plead for his life, but failed to secure a majority vote, and was executed by their hands. And thus &quot;Philip, against the laws of gods and men, obtained the imperium&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Tres Gordiani'' 29–30, qtd. and tr., York, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammianus is not so detailed, but he does state that Gordian died at the hands of Philip's &quot;faction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus 23.5.17; York, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; John of Antioch blames young men under Philip's influence for Gordian's death.&lt;ref&gt;York, 325, citing Carolus Mullerus, ''Fragmentia Historicorum Graecorum'' (Parisiis: Editore Ambrosio Firmin Didot, 1868), IV, p. 597, no. 147 Gordianus.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus and Zonaras, state that Gordian died in food riots instigated by Philip,&lt;ref&gt;York, 325, citing Zosimus 1.18.4–1.19.2; Zonaras 12.18.3.&lt;/ref&gt; but, later on in his history, Zosimus writes that Gordian &quot;[fell] in battle, in the midst of an hostile land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus 3.32.4, qtd. and tr. York, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sibylline Oracle also states that Gordian died in battle, although it also attributes it to some unspecified treachery.&lt;ref&gt;York, 325–26, citing ''Oracula Sibyllina'' 13.13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The murals commissioned by [[Shapur I]] at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] and [[Bishapur]] also state that Gordian died in battle at the hands of Persians.&lt;ref&gt;York, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hans Pohlsander====
====Irfan Shahîd====
--&gt;
Because of the continuing popularity of Jerome's ''Chronicon'' and Orosius' ''Historia'', the medieval writers who wrote about Philip called him the first Christian emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 463.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chronica Gallica of 452|''Chronica Gallica'' of 452]], [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] (d. ''ca''. 455),&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Did Decius Kill the Philippi?&quot;, 222.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassiodorus]] (d. ''ca''. 585), [[Jordanes]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 551), [[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636), and [[Bede]] (d. 735) all follow Jerome on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 463; K. Hoeber, &quot;Philip the Arabian&quot;, ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York: Robert Appleton, 1911), online at [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12021b.htm New Advent] and [[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Philip the Arabian|Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; One early medieval historian writing at the eve of the millennium, the Lombard [[Landolfus Sagax]], held that Philip had confessed to [[Pope Fabian|Fabian, Bishop of Rome]], instead of Babylas.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 466, 466 n. 46, citing Landolfus Sagax 10.150.21 (''MGH'', ''AA'' 2.318); this fable is not repeated in ''Liber Pontificalis'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 17th century, when [[Tillemont]] wrote his ''Histoire des Empereurs'', it was no longer possible to make the argument that Philip was a Christian &quot;ſans difficulté&quot;, &quot;without difficulty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tillemont, 3.262.&lt;/ref&gt; And when [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier]] wrote his ''L'Histoire des empereurs des Romains, jusqu'à Constantin'' in 1749, he affirmed the contrary, that Philip was not a Christian at all: &quot;...it is easy to judge what degree of credit ought to be given to this story of his penance; which, besides, is not fully and exactly related by any ancient author. To make out an account of it any way tolerable, they have been obliged to patch several evidences together, and to supply and alter the one by the other. The shortest and safest course is not to admit of a perplexed and ill supported narrative. We have no great temptation to torture history in order to claim such a Christian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trans. John Mill, ''The History of the Roman Emperors from Augustus to Constantine'' (London: F.C.&amp;J. Rivington ''et al''., 1814), 9.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Gibbon]], in the first volume of his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776), would take the same position: &quot;The public and even partial favour of Philip towards the sectaries of the new religion, and his constant reverence for the ministers of the church, gave some colour to the suspicion, which prevailed in his own times, that the emperor himself was become a convert to the faith; and afforded some grounds for a fable which was afterwards invented, that he had been purified by confession and penance from the guilt contracted by the murder of his innocent predecessor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ed. Womersley, 1.554. See also: J. G. A. Pocock, ''Barbarism and Religion. Volume III: The First Decline and Fall'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 461–62.&lt;/ref&gt; And the fable has—&quot;as usual&quot;—&quot;been embellished&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ed. Womersley, 1.554, 1.554 n. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; To Gibbon, the matter is &quot;curious, rather than important&quot;, and the man he credits with disposing of it, [[Friedrich Spanheim]] (d. 1649), is said to have shown &quot;much superfluous learning&quot; in the task.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ed. Womersley, 1.554 n. 119, 1.554–55 n. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

French historians of the 19th and 20th century were more favorable to the notion. Paul Allard, in his ''Histoire des persecutions pendant la premiere moitié du troisième siecle'' (1881); René Aigrain, in his chapter &quot;Arabie&quot; in the ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie Ecclésiastique''; [[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]], in ''Les persécutions dans l'empire romain'' (1964); and [[Jean Daniélou]] and [[Henri-Irénée Marrou]], in ''The Christian Centuries'' 1: ''The First Six Hundred Years'' (English tr., 1964), all strongly supported the notion.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 463–64; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 65, 65 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; English and German scholars were less likely to accept it. Ecclesiastical historians of the 19th century, like John Mason Neale, B. J. Kidd, and H. M. Gwatkin, gave the notion some credence, but less than their full support.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, 42; Kidd, 1.352; Gwatkin, 2.153; cf. also H. Chadwick, ''The Early Church'' (London: Pelican, 1967), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical historians, like Ernst Stein, [[Karl Johannes Neumann]], and John Gregg, denied it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, a small number of articles and book chapters discussed the matter. John York's &quot;The Image of Philip the Arab&quot; (1972) argued that the literary material on Philip's reign was deeply biased against the emperor. York attempted to correct the narrative, and rehabilitate Philip's reputation. He held that Eusebius' ''logos'' was derived from an oral tradition originating in Antioch, and that Origen's letters cannot have definitively proven Philip's Christianity, since (he follows Jerome's ''Liber de viris inlustribus'' 54 here) those letters were addressed to Philip's son. Because of this fact, York declared that Philip's Christianity was only &quot;probable&quot;, not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; H. Crouzel's &quot;Le christianisme de l'empereur Philippe l'Arabe&quot; (1975) argued that the Antiochene tradition, as represented by Chrysostom and Leontius, was independent of Eusebius, and that Eusebius was, likewise, ignorant of it. The sources of Eusebius' ''logos'' were instead Origen's letters to Philip and Severa. Crouzel is not entirely certain on this point; it is only &quot;très probable&quot;, &quot;very probable&quot;. In spite of Crouzel's arguments, Pierre Nautin's ''Origène'' (1977) was very skeptical of accounts of Philip's Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hans Pohlsander's &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot; (1980), adducing Philip's commitment to traditional civic religion as evidence, denied all accounts of Philip's Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lengthy chapter of his 1984 book ''Rome and the Arabs'', Irfan Shahîd argued that Philip deserved the title of &quot;First Christian Emperor&quot;. The chapter is divided into five parts: (1) a brief listing of the sources; (2) a lengthy address to Ernst Stein's arguments against accounts of Philip's Christianity; (3) an explanation of Eusebius' caution and dissimulation; (4) an exposition of the Latin authors' accounts of Philip's Christianity; and (5) Eusebius' relationship with the unnamed bishop in his passage, Babylas, and Babylas' importance in ecclesiastical history. He follows the main body of the chapter with an appendix addressing the articles by York, Crouzel, and Pohlsander, &quot;Philip the Arab and Christianity&quot;, and noting the judgments of the scholars who reviewed his draft.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the issue of Philip's Christianity. Timothy Barnes, who reviewed Shahîd's chapters on &quot;The First Christian Emperor&quot; and &quot;Eusebius and the Arabs&quot; in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', xv, 108 n. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; would only say that Eusebius &quot;[presents] Philip as a Christian&quot;, in his ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick Ball, author of ''Rome and the East: The transformation of an empire'' (2000), argued in favor of Philip's Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 418.&lt;/ref&gt; David Potter, author of ''The Roman Empire at Bay'' (2004), treated the matter dismissively: accounts of Philip's Christianity were simply &quot;bogus&quot;, Potter wrote, and works that accepted them should be treated with less respect on that count alone.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 469.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, like Glen Bowersock, took a middle route. Bowersock, reviewing Shahîd's ''Rome and the Arabs'' for the ''Classical Review'' in 1986, wrote: &quot;I doubt many will be convinced by the extreme position that [Shahîd] has taken, but his arguments do offer some basis for believing that Philip was seriously interested in the religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, review of Shahîd, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated that view in his ''Roman Arabia'' (1980, 3rd rev. ed. 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125–27. For another example of the moderate view, see McGiffert ed., ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' at n. 2040, online at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxxiv.html CCEL]. Accessed 29 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the French Byzantinologist [[Gilbert Dagron]], Philip's Christianity is a legend - albeit a very old one - that intended, in a Late Roman/Early Byzantine context, to foster the idea of a Roman Empire that was Christian almost from the beginning, thereby melding Roman Imperial ideology and Christianism, and therefore offering a base for other later legends showing Roman emperors, beginning with [[Augustus]] , to be aware and/or sympathetic to Christian revelation, forming a legendary corpus that was brought together during the 6th century by the chronicler [[John Malalas]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagron, ''Emperor and Priest'', 128/129.&lt;/ref&gt;
