'''Katharine &quot;Kay&quot; Way''' (February 20, 1902 – December 9, 1995){{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}&lt;ref&gt;''Physics Today'' gives her year of birth as 1903 and her date of death as December 8.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] best known for her work on the Nuclear Data Project. During [[World War II]], she worked for the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in [[Chicago]]. She became an adjunct professor at [[Duke University]] in 1968.

== Education and early life ==
Katharine Way was born in [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania]], the second child of William Addisson Way, a lawyer, and his wife Louise Jones. She had an older brother and a younger sister. Originally named Catherine, she later changed the spelling to Katharine. Friends and colleagues generally knew her as Kay. Her mother died when she was twelve years old, and her father married an ear and throat specialist, who provided Kay with a role model of a career woman.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}

Way was educated at Miss Hartridge's [[boarding school]] in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], and [[Rosemary Hall (Greenwich, Connecticut)|Rosemary Hall]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. In 1920 she entered [[Vassar College]], but was forced to drop out after two years after becoming ill with suspected [[tuberculosis]]. After convalescing in [[Saranac Lake, New York]], she attended  [[Barnard College]] for a couple of semesters in 1924 and 1925.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}

From 1929 to 1934 she studied at [[Columbia University]], where [[Edward Kasner]] stoked an interest in [[mathematics]], and co-authored Way's first published academic paper.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}} She graduated with her [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics Today&quot; /&gt; She next went to the [[University of North Carolina]], where [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] stimulated an interest in [[nuclear physics]], and she became his first PhD student. Because jobs were hard to come by during the [[Great Depression]], she stayed on as a graduate student after completing the requirements of her PhD.{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|pp=42–43}}

In 1938, she became a Huff Research Fellow at [[Bryn Mawr College]], which allowed her to receive her PhD for her thesis on nuclear physics, &quot;Photoelectric Cross Section of the Deuteron&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thesis&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Photoelectric Cross Section of the Deuteron  |last=Way |first=Katharine  |journal=[[Physical Review]]  |volume=51  |issue=7  |pages=552–556  | date=April   1937 |publisher=American Physical Society  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.51.552|bibcode=1937PhRv...51..552W }}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently took up a teaching position at the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1939, becoming an [[assistant professor]] in 1941.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}

At a conference in New York in 1938, Way presented a paper, &quot;Nuclear Quadrupole and Magnetic Moments&quot;, in which she examined deformation of a spinning [[atomic nucleus]] under three models, including [[Niels Bohr]]'s [[liquid drop model]].{{sfn|Mehra|Rechenberg|1982|pp=990-991}} She followed this up with a closer examination of the liquid drop model in a paper entitled &quot;The Liquid-Drop Model and Nuclear Moments&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |title=The Liquid-Drop Model and Nuclear Moments

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she showed that the resulting cigar-shaped nucleus could be unstable. Wheeler later recalled that:
{{quote|One day [Katherine Way] came in and reported a difficulty. The equations gave no solution in the case of a sufficiently highly charged nucleus turning at a sufficiently great angular velocity. It was clear that one had to do in this case with a kind of instability. It took only 1939 and the discovery  of Hahn and Strasmann to recognize the nature of the instability: nuclear fission. Why did we not go to the analysis of the higher order terms in the deformation energy and predict fission in advance of its discovery? It was not any difficulty in mathematics. It was a difficulty in the model. It failed to give the right magnitudes and the right trends for nuclear magnetic moments.{{sfn|Mehra|Rechenberg|1982|pp=990-991}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1979|p=266}} }}

== Manhattan Project ==
In 1942, Wheeler recruited Way to work on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in Chicago. Working with physicist [[Alvin Weinberg]], Way analyzed [[neutron flux]] data from [[Enrico Fermi]]'s early [[nuclear reactor]] designs to see whether it would be possible to create a [[self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction]]. These calculations were put to use in the construction of [[Chicago Pile-1]]. Afterwards, she examined the problem of [[nuclear poisoning]] of reactors by certain [[fission products]]. With physicist [[Eugene Wigner]] she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|pp=42–43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ragheb |first=M. |date=March 22, 2011 |url=http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/F2011/EP/MaterialsforStudents/Petty/Ragheb-Ch8-2011.PDF |title=Decay Heat Generation in Fission Reactors |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Way also visited the [[Hanford Site]] and the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]. In mid-1945 she moved to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], where she continued her research into nuclear decay.{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|pp=42–43}} While there, she began to specialize in the collection and organization of nuclear data.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}

With [[Dexter Masters]], she co-edited the 1946 ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller ''One World or None: a Report to the Public on the Full Meaning of the Atomic Bomb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://thenewpress.com/books/one-world-or-none |title=One World or None |editor=Dexter Masters, Katharine Way |publisher=New Press |orig-year=1946 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59558-227-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book included essays by [[Niels Bohr]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]], and sold over 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/pubs/_pages/one_world_or_none.html |title=One World or None: A Report to the Public on the Full Meaning of the Atomic Bomb |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}

== Later life ==
Way moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1949, where she went to work for the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. Four years later, she persuaded the [[National Academy of Sciences]]' [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to establish the Nuclear Data Project (NDP), an organization with special responsibility for gathering and disseminating nuclear data, under her leadership. The NDP moved to the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in 1964, but Way remained its head until 1968.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}} Beginning in 1964, the NDP published a journal, ''Nuclear Data Sheets'', to disseminate the information that the NDP had gathered. This was joined the following year by a second journal, ''[[Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables]]''. She also persuaded the editors of ''[[Nuclear Physics (journal)|Nuclear Physics]]'' to add [[index term|keywords]] to the subject headings of articles to facilitate cross-referencing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics Today&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=December 1996 |url=http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/articles/way/way.html |title=Katharine Way |work=Physics Today |pages=75 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Way left the NDP in 1968 and became an [[adjunct professor]]  at [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], although she continued as editor of ''Nuclear Data Sheets'' until 1973, and ''Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables'' until 1982. In later life she became interested in the health problems of seniors, and lobbied for improved health care for them.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}

Way, who never married, died at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], on December 9, 1995.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=670–671}}
