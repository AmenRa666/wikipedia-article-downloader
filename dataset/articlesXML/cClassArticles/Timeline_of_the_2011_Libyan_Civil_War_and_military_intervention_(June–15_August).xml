The [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] began on 17 February 2011 as a civil protest and later evolved into a widespread uprising. After a [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]] led by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States (and later [[NATO]]) on 19 March turned the tide of the conflict at the [[Second Battle of Benghazi]], [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] regrouped and established control over [[Misrata]] and most of the [[Nafusa Mountains]] in [[Tripolitania]] and much of the eastern region of [[Cyrenaica]]. In mid-May, they finally broke an extended [[Battle of Misrata|siege of Misrata]].
		
This phase of the war saw an extended stalemate on the eastern front, with little movement between [[Ajdabiya]] and [[Brega]]. However, in the west, anti-Gaddafi fighters advanced from Misrata to seize control of surrounding areas, [[Battle of Tawergha|sacking]] the rival town of [[Tawergha]] as retribution for its support to the [[Libyan Army (1951–2011)|Libyan Army]] and allied [[mercenary]] fighters that had committed atrocities against their port city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/17/us-libya-displaced-idUSTRE79G2CY20111017|agency=Reuters|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011|title=Displaced black Libyans tell of beatings, expulsion at gunpoint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighters in the Nafusa Mountains also became better organized, with Qatari military advisers and increased involvement by the [[National Transitional Council]] based in [[Benghazi]] helping to train disparate militiamen from [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Berber people|Amazigh]] villages into something resembling a cohesive fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=38275&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=61&amp;cHash=3c9f22859e5e1e199f78116903cbf81c|agency=The Jamestown Foundation|first=Derek Henry|last=Flood|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011|title=Special Commentary from Inside Western Libya-- The Nalut Offensive: A View from the Battlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTC gained critical international recognition from the United States and other states during this period and began to open embassies and diplomatic offices in foreign capitals. But the opposition council was dealt a jarring setback by the murder of top military commander General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]] under mysterious circumstances in late July. Despite the muddled situation in the east, by mid-August, anti-Gaddafi units based in the Nafusa Mountains were mounting a bold [[2011 Libyan rebel coastal offensive|offensive]] north toward the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

===7 June===
*Gaddafi appeared live and vowed to stay in Libya &quot;dead or alive&quot; as NATO launched some of its most destructive airstrikes yet, targeting key loyalist military installations of the Libyan secret police, [[Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]] and Popular Guard.&lt;ref name=AJ_strikes_607&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/06/20116791428754691.html|title=NATO Strikes Rock Libyan Capital|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=7 June 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters_strikes_607&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/07/us-libya-idUSTRE7270JP20110607|title=Gaddafi Vows To Fight On, NATO Jets Pound Tripoli| agency= [[Reuters]]| author = Graff, Peter|date=7 June 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*It was reported on 7 June that Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr was executed by Gaddafi for refusing to carry out orders to kill protesters. It might be true since Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr had not appeared on national Libyan television, and there had been no outside communication with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;allvoices.com&quot;/&gt;

*The leader of a UN inquiry into [[international human rights law|human rights]] violations in Libya expressed his skepticism over any official rape policy by the Gaddafi administration. He cited that alleged statistical evidence was never received by officials and that the allegations were a result of &quot;mass hysteria&quot;. The allegations were based on surveys supposedly delivered through the postal system, but it was inoperable during the period it was claimed to have been used. Both loyalist and opposition parties accuse one another of committing war crimes according to the investigation. However, a [[Margot Wallström|senior U.N. official]] defended the validity of the claim, citing &quot;consistent reports from people, from organisations, from UN entities and others on the ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/libya-rape-claims-hysteria-investigator/story-e6frf7jx-1226072781882|title=Libya Rape Claims 'Hysteria' – Investigator|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/un-official-investigator-at-odds-over-libya-mass-rape-claim_155646.html|title=UN official, Investigator at Odds over Libya Mass Rape Claim|work= [[Expatica]]|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Rebels in [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]], a city just {{convert|50|km|abbr=off}} from Tripoli, won control of some sections, marking the first significant clashes between loyalist and opposition forces since [[First Battle of Zawiya|it was recaptured]] by Gaddafi's troops in March. Due to the ongoing fighting, loyalist forces closed down a highway that crosses the town, a key expressway for Gaddafi's war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/11/us-libya-idUSTRE7270JP20110611|title=Fighting in Zawiyah Shuts Libya Road to Tripoli|agency= [[Reuters]] | author =Graff, Peter|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the NTC explained that many of the rebels that fled Zawiya during its fall to Gaddafi in March had been training in the mountains in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyan-rebels-battle-for-key-oil-port-near-tripoli/2011/06/11/AGwUcoQH_story.html|title=Libyan Rebels Battle for Key Oil Port Near Tripoli|work=The Washington Post| author =Londono, Ernesto|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rebels reported that two of [[Muammar Gaddafi#Personal life and family|Gaddafi's sons]] were in command of the loyalist offensive at Zliten–Misrata front. One of these is [[Khamis Gaddafi]], commander of the [[Khamis Brigade]], a [[special forces]] brigade loyal exclusively to Gaddafi and reportedly one of the few loyalist brigades still intact. A day earlier he had been quoted telling his troops, &quot;Take Misurata or I will kill you myself.

*Human-rights organisations cast doubt on claims of mass rape and other abuses perpetrated by forces loyal to Gaddafi, which had been widely used to justify NATO's war in Libya. NATO leaders, opposition groups and the media had produced a stream of stories since 15 February claiming the Gaddafi government had ordered mass rapes, used foreign mercenaries and employed helicopters against civilian protesters. An investigation by [[Amnesty International]] failed to find evidence for these human-rights violations and in many cases discredited or cast doubt on them. It also found indications that on several occasions Benghazi rebels appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence. Liesel Gerntholtz, the head of women's rights at [[Human Rights Watch]], which also investigated the charge of mass rape, said: &quot;We have not been able to find evidence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/libya/news/article.cfm?l_id=467&amp;objectid=10734384|date=25 June 2011|accessdate=25 July 2011|last=Cockburn|first=Patrick|title=Amnesty Questions Libyan Mass Rape | work = [[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rebels have repeatedly charged that mercenary troops from [[Central Africa|Central]] and West Africa had been used against them. Amnesty International found there was no evidence for this. &quot;Those shown to journalists as foreign mercenaries were later quietly released,&quot; said Donatella Rovera, senior crisis response adviser for Amnesty, who was in Libya for three months after the start of the uprising. &quot;Most were sub-Saharan migrants working in Libya without documents.&quot; Others were not so lucky and were lynched or executed. Rovera found two bodies of migrants in the Benghazi morgue and others were dumped on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald&quot;/&gt;
*Amnesty International also stated that there was no proof of mass killing of civilians in Libya, which was the basis for NATO's military intervention. Most of the fighting during the first days of the uprising was in Benghazi, where 100 to 110 people were killed, and the city of [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]], where 59 to 64 were killed, said Amnesty International. Most of these were probably protesters, though some may have obtained weapons. There was no evidence that aircraft or heavy anti-aircraft machine guns were used against crowds. Spent cartridges picked up after protesters were shot at came from Kalashnikovs or similar calibre weapons. The Amnesty International findings confirmed a report by the authoritative [[International Crisis Group]], which found that although the government had a history of brutal repression, there was no question of genocide. It added that &quot;much Western media coverage has from the outset presented a very one-sided view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting the regime's security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald&quot;/&gt;
