A '''Quaker gun''' is a [[Military deception|deception tactic]] that was commonly used in warfare during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although resembling an actual [[cannon]], the Quaker gun was simply a wooden log, usually painted black, used to deceive an enemy. Misleading the enemy as to the strength of an [[Fortification|emplacement]] was an effective delaying tactic. The name derives from the [[Religious Society of Friends]] or &quot;Quakers&quot;, who have traditionally held a religious opposition to war and violence in the [[Peace Testimony]].

== The original &quot;Quaker gun trick&quot; ==
During the [[American War of Independence]], after nearly a year of brutal backcountry conflict between American Colonel [[William Washington]] and the fierce British commander Lieutenant Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]], Colonel Washington had retreated to [[North Carolina]] in October 1780.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Ordered to leave a regular force of colonial [[dragoons]] in the [[North Carolina]] theater by [[Brigadier General]] [[Daniel Morgan]], Colonel Washington still lacked the proper [[artillery]] to dislodge the Loyalists. On December 4, the Americans were able to trap the [[Loyalist]] Colonel [[Rowland Rugeley]] and his force of about 125 men in Rugeley’s house and barn near [[Camden, South Carolina]]. He told his cavalrymen to dismount and surround the barn. Out of Rugeley’s sight, Washington’s men prepared a pine log to resemble a cannon.&lt;ref name=revolution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/revwar/revolution_day_by_day/1780_bottom.html| title=December&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;1780|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Quaker gun Trick&quot; worked quite well. Colonel Washington aimed the wooden &quot;cannon&quot; toward the buildings the Loyalists had barricaded themselves in and threatened to open fire if they did not immediately surrender. Rugeley surrendered quickly his entire force without a single shot having been fired.&lt;ref name=revolution/&gt;

== Use during the American Civil War ==
[[File:QuakerGunPortHudson1863.jpg|thumb|250px|Quaker guns made of pine logs were mounted in a ruse to fool the Union into believing that the Confederates were much better armed at the [[Siege of Port Hudson]], Louisiana in 1863. Black rings were painted on the end of the logs to make the muzzles look convincing. It worked. After [[David Farragut|Admiral Farragut]]'s two vessels passed by Port Hudson, the Union chose to never attack from the river again.]]

Quaker guns were used by both the North and South in the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Confederate States Army]] frequently resorted to them because of its shortage of artillery. The wooden guns were painted black and positioned in fortifications to delay [[Union Army|Union]] assaults. Sometimes actual gun carriages were used in the deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/terms.htm|title=Definitions of Civil War terms|publisher=Shotgun's Home of the American Civil War |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous use of a Quaker gun was by Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], who placed them in his field works around [[Centreville, Virginia]] in March 1862, to give the appearance that the works were still occupied, while his men were actually withdrawing to the [[Rappahannock River]].{{cn|date=January 2013}}

Another example happened during the [[Siege of Corinth]]. &quot;During the night of May 29, the Confederate army moved out. They used the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to carry the sick and wounded, the heavy artillery, and tons of supplies. When a train arrived, the troops cheered as though reinforcements were arriving. They set up dummy Quaker guns along the defensive earthworks. Camp fires were kept burning, and buglers and drummers played. The rest of the men slipped away undetected...&quot;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Quaker guns were also used to bolster Confederate fortifications during the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and assisted in prolonging the Confederate's hold on their positions against the overwhelmingly superior numbers of Union troops.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Use during World War II ==
A similar idea was employed during the [[Doolittle Raid]], which occurred in the early stages of the [[Pacific War]] of World War II, where Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]] led a squadron of [[B-25 Mitchell]]s to bomb Tokyo. The early model B-25B had no guns installed in the tail section to help protect the planes from tail-end attacks. While modifying the bombers for the mission at [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]], Florida, Doolittle had fake machine guns consisting of a pair of broomsticks painted black mounted at the tail end of the fuselage to simulate tail guns.&lt;ref&gt;I Could Never Be So Lucky Again, by General James H. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Doolittle, with Carrol V. Glines, p. 228 (Bantum paperback edition, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, while preparing for the coming [[Normandy landings|invasion of France]], the [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces on [[Pointe du Hoc]] moved their artillery battery and replaced it with upturned logs and barrels in order to fool the invading [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  Dummy equipment was also used extensively by the Allies in [[Operation Fortitude]], to persuade the Germans that a non-existent field army was preparing to attack Calais.

The pre–World War I British battleship [[HMS Centurion (1911)|HMS ''Centurion'']] was obsolete and disarmed by World War II. However, from 1942 to 1944, she was fitted with wooden guns and stationed in the eastern Mediterranean, to make British naval forces in the area seem stronger than they were.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Wooden cannon ==
Unlike a Quaker gun, a [[wooden cannon]] is a functional weapon, albeit notoriously weak and only able to fire a few shots, sometimes even just one shot, before bursting. These were used by those without access to metal or the skill to engineer metallic cannons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carman64&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmQVan-M3ykC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22wooden+cannon%22 |title=A History of Firearms |author=W. Y. Carman |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2004 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
