==&quot;Believe&quot;==

I'm probably being ridiculously pedantic, but I think the wording in the fourth paragraph could be improved. The University's official statement was:

:::&quot;It is the academic conclusion of the University of Leicester that beyond reasonable doubt, the individual exhumed at Greyfriars in September 2012 is indeed Richard III, last Plantagenet king of England.&quot;

but in this article we use the word &quot;believe&quot;. I don't think that's an adequate synonym for &quot;academic conclusion&quot;. (In fact, I don't think &quot;conclusion&quot; would be an adequate synonym for &quot;academic conclusion&quot; either.) A belief is a claim; an academic conclusion is a judgment made on evidence. I suggest changing the relevant sentence to something like:

:::&quot;On the basis of these points and other historical, scientific and archaeological evidence, the University of Leicester has reached the academic conclusion that the Greyfriars remains exhumed in 2012 are those of Richard III.&quot;

==Roadmap to Featured Article status==

Having started this article in February last year, I'm pleased at how it's developed since then - well done to all the contributors. Now that the reburial date has been announced (26 March 2015) I suggest that we start thinking about how we can get it onto the Main Page as the Featured Article of the day - there will certainly be a lot of media coverage around the world and the article is certain to attract a good deal of interest on that day. 

This will require several things to be done over the next few months:

* Rename the article to '''Exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England''' - now that there is a significant amount of coverage of the reburial we can include it in the article. 
* Nominate the article for [[WP:GA|Good Article]] status as a precursor to a FA nomination. I see that the &quot;Burial site&quot;, &quot;Looking for Richard III&quot; and &quot;Greyfriars project and excavations&quot; have been converted into date lists rather than narratives (though I don't see any sign of this major change having been discussed in advance). This is ''not'' an approach that will be accepted for either GA or FA, so I will be reverting this back to narrative format.
* After the GA nomination, nominate the article for FA status.

I'm happy to take the lead on the GA and FA nominations, as I've got plenty of experience in that area. [[User:Prioryman|Prioryman]] ([[User talk:Prioryman|talk]]) 12:06, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

[[:Exhumation of Richard III of England]] → {{no redirect|Exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England}} – To reflect the fact that the article covers the reburial as well as the exhumation [[User:Prioryman|Prioryman]] ([[User talk:Prioryman|talk]]) 12:16, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt;'''Weak oppose'''&lt;/s&gt; as unnecessary.  Other options would have included mummification or similar desiccating, pickling, freezing, storage in a deoxygenated environment or conversely cremation.  I think most people are likely to assume reburial but this is POV.

*'''Weak oppose'''. I think the reburial ceremony, the new tomb, etc, will soon be generating enough content to become an article in its own right. We should stick with the status quo for the moment, but spin off most of the reburial debates to a new article when the content demands it, leaving a short section here. That's how this article came about, when the section at the main RIII article became too big. [[User:Paul Barlow|Paul B]] ([[User talk:Paul Barlow|talk]]) 19:37, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
*'''Relatively feeble oppose'''. More accurately [[Exhumation, prolonged storage and reburial of Richard III of England]]? Agree any move now would be premature. [[User:Martinevans123|Martinevans123]] ([[User talk:Martinevans123|talk]]) 19:52, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

== Format of timeline sections ==
:**''Discussion copied from [[User talk:Anthony Appleyard]]'':
* You've been making some major undiscussed changes to [[Exhumation of Richard III of England]] today, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to revert them. I will be nominating the article for GA and subsequently FA status soon. Unfortunately the list item format you've adopted for three sections of the article isn't compliant with the relevant section of the Wikipedia [[MOS:LISTBULLET|manual of style]], the first point of which states, &quot;Do not use lists if a passage is read easily as plain paragraphs&quot;. GA and FA reviewers will certainly pick up on that and the format will have to be reverted back to plain paragraphs. [[User:Prioryman|Prioryman]] ([[User talk:Prioryman|talk]]) 12:19, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
:**''New discussion here.''
* &quot;''is read easily as plain paragraphs''&quot;: some would say that that story is read easier in timeline format, and in the prose version some of the events were described out of time order. [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] ([[User talk:Anthony Appleyard|talk]]) 15:50, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
* Anthony, I'm definitely with Prioryman on this one - I don't think the bullet points improve the flow, and equally I don't think they're in line with the MOS guidance. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 16:13, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
* Bullet points aren't designed to improve the flow - they're intended to break it up. They might be appropriate for a timeline article but this isn't one of those - it's a narrative. It simply isn't appropriate to use such a format in an article like this, particularly as it's against the MOS. There's not the slightest chance that their use here would pass an FA review. If there's an issue with the chronological order of the content then let's discuss that, but changing the format radically without any prior discussion isn't the answer.

Is any wikipedian in the UK (or from wherever) going to the re-internment next year?  If so, it sure would be nice to take a bunch of pictures that we can put into the article.

==Featured Article Candidate review==

Please note that I've nominated this article for consideration as a Featured Article Candidate, with the intention of having it ready to appear on the Main Page on the date of Richard III's reburial in late March. Any input on the nomination would be very welcome - please see [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Exhumation of Richard III of England/archive1]].

== Link in lead section ==

I edited the wikilink to the [[University of Leicester Archaelogical Services]], an article which does not exist, and instead linked it to the [[University of Leicester]]. My edit was swiftly reverted. I believe that a link to the University of Leicester is better than a link to a non-existent article, especially as the university itself describes the archelogical services unit as being [http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/ &quot;embedded in the School of Archaeology and Ancient History&quot;] and describes ULAS as [http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/?uol_r=3aacf07a &quot;forming part of the School&quot;]. Hence, I think it's fair to link to the University of Leicester until an article for ULAS is created.

== Analysis of the discovery ==

Under the above section it says &quot;On 12 September, the University of Leicester team announced the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; there was severe scoliosis of the spine, possibly making one shoulder higher than the other (to what extent would depend on the severity of the condition)&quot;. None of this is supported by the citation given (ref 46). Is this the correct citation or should it be another one? Also in the lead it says &quot;As a condition of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the excavators agreed that, if Richard was found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral&quot; although there is nothing about this in the article. All it says is that this would be normal archaeological practice. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class = FA&quot;&gt;[[User:Richerman|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Richerman&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;   [[User talk:Richerman|'''(talk)''']] 21:03, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

== Marine radiocarbon ==

The article currently says &quot;marine organisms absorb carbon-14 at a different rate from land organisms, skewing the dating of any terrestrial organism that consumes a significant proportion of seafood&quot;: this is incorrect, and as far as I can see it's not supported by the source.  The sea's surface waters contain less radiocarbon than the atmosphere, because of mixing with very old (and hence radiocarbon-depleted) deep sea water.  As a result marine organisms contain less radiocarbon than land animals, so they appear older when tested unless a correction is made.  Perhaps rephrase this to &quot;marine organisms contain less carbon-14 than land organisms, skewing the dating of any terrestrial organism that consumes a significant proportion of seafood&quot;?  That skips all the technical details but is accurate.

:OK, that sounds good. Thanks - I'll make that change. [[User:Prioryman|Prioryman]] ([[User talk:Prioryman|talk]]) 13:07, 3 March 2015 (UTC)
:I still don't see why &quot;absorb carbon-14 at a different rate&quot; is wrong. It's just that, if the op is correct, they absorb it at a different rate ''because'' sea's surface waters contain less radiocarbon than the atmosphere.

::I thought about this and it's a little more complicated.  Surprisingly, it's not true that there's less carbon-14 in seawater; see [[Radiocarbon_dating#Isotopic_fractionation|here]] for an explanation.  Short version: fractionation and upwelling cancel each other out, so there is about as much carbon-14 in seawater as in animals on land.  That raises another point, however; if the lab wasn't correcting for either fractionation or the marine effect, I don't see how they came up with a different age.  I'll read the source this evening and see if I can understand what happened.  It might be better to simplify the statement even more but I don't want to suggest another change without looking at the source again.

::::Unsurprisingly I'm the one confused, not the lab!  Short version: I suggest we change the sentence to &quot;However, mass spectrometry carried out on the bones found evidence of the consumption of large quantities of seafood, which is known to cause samples tested by radiocarbon dating to appear to be older than they really are.&quot;  That avoids any reference to the technicalities.
::::Longer version, if anyone is interested: the lab corrected for fractionation, but not for marine origin, which is what they always do; I wasn't thinking straight.  The fractionation and marine origin changes cancel each other out, so the marine distortion in sample ages only shows up after correcting for fractionation.  Land samples are corrected for fractionation too.  See [[Calculation of radiocarbon dates]] for the gory details if interested.  The net effect of the fractionation and marine effect mean that the carbon-14 ratio in surface waters is (I think) close to the ratio in the atmosphere.  Because of fractionation, the ratio in the terrestrial biosphere is not actually the same as in the atmosphere, and hence there's a difference between the ratio in land animals and marine animals.

== Exhumed several other burials? ==

One of the captions reads 
* &quot;The July 2013 excavation, which uncovered more of Greyfriars and exhumed several other burials&quot;.
Do you normally exhume a burial? I presume it was bodies that were exhumed, but wondered if there was some reason for this choice of wording. --[[User:Boson|Boson]] ([[User talk:Boson|talk]]) 20:10, 6 March 2015 (UTC)

== Redirect created ==

I've noticed that the traffic stats for this article are relatively low considering the reburial takes place next week. A google search for &quot;Reburial of Richard III&quot; finds lots of hits but not this article, so I've created a redirect from [[Reburial of Richard III]]. Hopefully, once this comes up on google it will increase traffic stats considerably, so we need to watch for an increase in vandalism. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:Richerman|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Richerman&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;   [[User talk:Richerman|'''(talk)''']] 10:16, 19 March 2015 (UTC)

I was suggesting it as an option, as there are 'a number' of 'Death and funeral of...' articles (and several 'death of ...' articles) separate from those of the actual persons, and RIII's reburial can be seen as 'a different thing' to his 'rediscovery.' (An 'excess of quote marks' seems appropriate in the context.) [[User:Jackiespeel|Jackiespeel]] ([[User talk:Jackiespeel|talk]]) 23:01, 20 March 2015 (UTC)

*'''Weak oppose'''. I think they are two very different subjects and should be split into two separate articles. This article is about the ''archaeology'' and science pertaining to the discovery and identification of the remains. It's essentially about scholarship. The reburial is a ceremonial event. Of course it would not have happened without the exhumation, but they are such distinct kinds of events, I think yoking them together undermines the integirty of the article. An analagous case is [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] and [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]]. These are separate articles. Obviously the latter would not have happened without the former, but the separation is in essence because they a fundamentally different ''types'' of events and require different ''types'' of content.

The 'case for' - they are 'two separated but linked events' - the search, finding and analysis; and 'the service and re-interment.'

Can I suggest that a note of the decision with RIII be put on the Cervantes talk page (English and/or 'Spanish etc' pages): as there is a possibility that his grave has been rediscovered WP can then be consistent in naming 'the separate page or section of the author's article' (which it may remain, especially on the English WP page).

Anthony, as I'm sure you know, the fact that millions of people can corroborate something does not mean we can add it to wikipedia. This is a featured article and, as such, requires good quality, reliable sources. And when I say it needs to be archived I mean in a form available for someone who wants to check what is said, so it needs to be available in a format such as a DVD that can be bought, or obtained from a library. Then the reference should say which company made the programme, who produced it etc. Even then, I don't know if that sort of source would be acceptable for a featured article anyway - perhaps someone could enlighten me - but I've never seen TV references used in one so I couldn't say. However, the fact that we don't have a standard template for them makes me wonder. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:Richerman|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Richerman&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;   [[User talk:Richerman|'''(talk)''']] 18:44, 23 March 2015 (UTC)

:@[[User:Richerman|Richerman]], the relevant citation template is {{tl|Cite AV media}}—it's named that rather than &quot;cite television&quot; etc as for obvious reasons regarding verifiability it will generally be a YouTube link or a piece of embedded video being cited, rather than the actual broadcast. It's rare for a TV program to qualify as a reliable source when you get to FA level, unless the TV program itself is the subject of the article, but there are rare cases (in Britain, generally via the OU), where a TV program itself would be considered academically reliable enough to use as a source. There is no hard and fast rule, and you'd need to go to [[WP:RSN]] if it's not clear whether a source is reliable or not. (I find it extremely hard to imagine anything shown on Channel 4 ever qualifying.) There are also occasional cases where a legitimate academic posts a YouTube video explaining their work, which I would also consider reliable—see ''[[The Sirens and Ulysses]]'' for a current example of this usage.

{{ping|Anthony Appleyard}}  I'm sure you mean well but I would appreciate it if you would stop editing this article until you have taken the time to carry out some research on how to edit a featured article.

That means that when someone removes something you have added you take it to the talk page to discuss - you don't return it and tell the other party to take it to talk. The edits in point are the section you added on Michael Ibsen, which I have again removed. The reason why I removed it is that it is totally unnecessary as it is mostly repeating information already given. In the previous section it says: 

&quot;After two years' work he found that a British-born woman who emigrated to Canada after World War II, Joy Ibsen (née Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece)...Joy Ibsen died in 2008. On 24 August 2012 her son Michael Ibsen gave a mouth-swab sample to the research team to compare against samples from the human remains found at the excavation.[54] Analysts found a mitochondrial DNA match between the exhumed skeleton, Michael Ibsen, and the second unnamed direct maternal line descendant, who shares a relatively rare mitochondrial DNA sequence, mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J1c2c&quot;

You have then created a new section under that one which begins &quot;Michael Ibsen, born in 1958 in Canada, is a 17th generation descendant of Anne of York in the unbroken female line and a 17th great grandnephew of King Richard III of England, and proved to have the same mitochondrial DNA type. He is descended through his mother, Joy Ibsen, who died in 2008&quot; The only new information which is given in those two  sentences is that Michael Ibsen was born in 1958 - the rest of it repeats what is said a few lines above. The fact that he is the 17th grand nephew is clear from the fact that his mother was the 16th grand niece. Also you have linked [[Anne of York]], [[Richard III of England]] and [[mitochondrial DNA]] all of which are already linked see:[[wp:overlink]] In some articles links are given in the lead and once again in the text, but always at the next occurrence - and this article doesn't follow that convention.

You have then started a new paragraph with one sentence that says &quot;He is also a furniture maker, based in London, and made the coffin for Richard III, from British oak from the Duchy of Cornwall's estate&quot; Two things - we don't use single sentence paragraphs, and the word &quot;also&quot; is redundant. So what we are left with is that Michael Ibsen was born in 1958, he is a furniture maker, born in Canada, based in London, and he made the coffin for Richard III, from British oak from the Duchy of Cornwall's estate. Do you really think that information needs its own section? It can quite easily be included in other parts of the article.

The other problem is that you added information without references and then when challenged, argued that it was something millions of people can corroborate. Then when you did add references they were either bare urls [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exhumation_of_Richard_III_of_England&amp;diff=653171971&amp;oldid=653168224] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exhumation_of_Richard_III_of_England&amp;diff=653182515&amp;oldid=653182420] or you made up something that you thought looked about right, but had information that wasn't needed and was missing information that was needed.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exhumation_of_Richard_III_of_England&amp;diff=653222073&amp;oldid=653217629]. When we use someone elses work it is a matter of common courtesy to say who they are and cite their work correctly. There are citation templates at the top of the editing window for doing that - it really isn't difficult. Also many of your edit summaries are totally inadequate - &quot;ed&quot; doesn't tell anyone what you've done. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:Richerman|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Richerman&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;   [[User talk:Richerman|'''(talk)''']] 11:09, 24 March 2015 (UTC)

== Alderman Newton's School ==

I grew up in Leicester in the 60s and 70s, and the school was only even known as Alderman Newton Girls' School. It was a single sex grammar school. I don't know what happened to it after the 11-plus was abolished and whether it became a mixed sex comprehensive or sixth form college and changed its name, but I wonder if 'Alderman Newton's School' is correct?

(reset) I have read that the tomb was still visible for some time after 'the remains of the friary' passed into secular hands.
At the time of the discovery of the body it was said that there had been pipe laying works or similar through what became the car park in a previous era which had crossed the locality of Richard's grave (can't remember the exact details offhand).

== Third trench of initial excavation ==

Excellent article, very interesting and well written, and I'm happy to see it on King Richard's big day. I have an improvement to suggest, though.

[[Exhumation of Richard III of England#Greyfriars project and excavations|According to the article]], the plan for the September 2012 excavation was &quot;to open two trenches in the Social Services car park, with an option for a third in the playground.&quot; It is never explicitly stated in the article that the third trench was actually dug (as opposed to descriptions of the first two trenches, two paragraphs down), but excavations in the playground are hinted at in the last sentence of the aforementioned &quot;Excavations&quot; section, as well as in two captions. I believe a direct statement (and perhaps some detail about the trench's location, dimensions and orientation, as with the other trenches) would be desirable.

*Remarkable coincidences indeed, if the article is to be credited, Mr Appleyard, but not much help in our case. What I was asking for was something like [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9522570/Richard-III-search-archaeologists-find-church.html this], though it is a bit short on detail. Even better, one could use the same source as for the rest of that paragraph (fourth in its section), namely [http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/archaeology/1september.html the University of Leicester's webpage], which describes the excavation quite extensively. The problem is not how to cite the digging of the trench, but how to mention it without interrupting the flow of the text—which is why I am reluctant to do it myself. The article gives only the outline of that stage of the dig, and I shouldn't be suggesting introducing this particular detail if I didn't consider its omission confusing.

*How much a coincidence it was, depends on whether:-
*# The parking spaces were marked A B C D etseq, and Richard III was under space R.
*# Several or many of the parking spaces were marked R for &quot;reserved&quot;.

These coincidences do happen - the (dwarf) planet Pluto happened to be 'in the place calculated' for the ninth planet by a theory that was based on slightly flawed premises (though it had been seen but not identified previously, and would have been discovered eventually anyway).
