'''No. 81 Wing''' is responsible for operating the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] multi-role fighters of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Headquartered at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales, the [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] comprises three combat units, [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;3]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]] based at Williamtown and [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], Northern Territory, as well as an [[operational conversion unit]] at Williamtown.&lt;ref name=&quot;81WG&quot;&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/About_us/Structure_of_the_RAAF/Air_Command/Air_Combat_Group/No._81_Wing_/?RAAF-UInnSuKVCZ/AuQLnytaHcdNP6c14SIt0 No. 81 Wing] at Royal Australian Air Force.

They have also been employed to patrol high-profile events in Australia, including the [[Commonwealth Games]] and visits by foreign dignitaries.

Formed in April 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing comprised three flying units, [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;76]], 77 and [[No. 82 Squadron RAAF|82 Squadron]]s, operating [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Following the end of hostilities, the wing converted to [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] and was based in Japan as part of the Allied occupational forces; it disbanded there in November 1948. Re-formed at Williamtown in January 1961, its complement included Nos.&amp;nbsp;75 and 76 Squadrons, and [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Conversion Unit]], operating [[CAC Sabre]] jets. The Sabres were deployed to [[RAAF Base Darwin]], Northern Territory, in 1964 to guard against possible attack by Indonesian forces during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] with Malaysia. No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing converted to [[Dassault Mirage&amp;nbsp;III]] supersonic fighters before disbanding in December 1966. It was re-formed again at Williamtown in February 1987, to operate the Hornet. The wing also controlled [[No. 25 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;25]] (later [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|79]]) and 76 Squadrons, flying [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi]] lead-in fighters, until they were transferred to [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]] in 2000.

==History==

===World War II===
Established at [[Ballarat]], Victoria, on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing operated [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. [[Group Captain]] [[Gordon Steege]] set up headquarters on [[Los Negros Island|Los Negros]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]] on 30&amp;nbsp;August. Comprising [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;76]], [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77]] and [[No. 82 Squadron RAAF|82 Squadron]]s, the formation joined [[No. 77 Wing RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;77]] and [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|78 Wings]] on [[Noemfoor]] as part of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group in September 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF1994&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=81WG: then and now|magazine=RAAF News |volume=36 |issue=6|date=July 1994|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/15.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 249]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;10 Group was renamed the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|First Tactical Air Force]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 TAF) in October.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 298–299]&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing undertook offensive sweeps and ground attacks against targets in [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/18.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 304, 307–308]&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Nos.&amp;nbsp;77 and 82 Squadrons dive bombed Japanese airfields on [[Halmahera]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/18.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 312]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing's aircraft flew 1,125 sorties in October and November, dropping over {{convert|400000|lb|kg}} of bombs, for the loss of 15 Kittyhawks and 11 pilots. The relegation of No.&amp;nbsp;1 TAF to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale. In December 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing's new commander, Group Captain [[Wilfred Arthur]], produced a &quot;balance sheet&quot; to demonstrate that the formation's combat results were not worth the cost in ordnance and casualties, setting in train events that would culminate in the so-called &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/23.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 386–390]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 443–450]&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1945, the number of missions flown by No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing had dropped to less than 400, from over 1,000 the previous month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt; In March, the Kittyhawks carried out some 80 patrols around Noemfoor but encountered enemy activity on less than half of these.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 398]&lt;/ref&gt;

No. 81 Wing was slated to take part in Operation Oboe One, the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]], in May 1945 but was unable to move in time from Noemfoor to its new base on [[Morotai]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]; only No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron played any part in the battle, undertaking patrols and convoy escort.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 453]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waters, ''Oboe'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing flew close support missions for the Australian [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]] in Operation Oboe Six, the [[Battle of North Borneo|invasion of Labuan]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 466–473]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its three Kittyhawk squadrons, the wing's [[order of battle]] included [[No. 457 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;457 Squadron]] flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], No.&amp;nbsp;25 Air Stores Park, No.&amp;nbsp;24 Medical Clearing Station, No.&amp;nbsp;22 Repair and Servicing Unit, No.&amp;nbsp;9 Repair and Servicing Unit Detachment, No.&amp;nbsp;111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and seven Radar Stations—a total of over 2,000 personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, ''Oboe'', pp. 76, 110&lt;/ref&gt; Its commander on Morotai and [[Labuan]] was Group Captain [[Ian Dougald McLachlan|Ian McLachlan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077819.asp Air Vice Marshal Ian Dougald McLachlan] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 26 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing was to have provided two squadrons in support of Operation Oboe Two, the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|assault on Balikpapan]], in June but [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] airfield, from which it was to operate, was not ready in time.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/29.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 482]&lt;/ref&gt;  The wing was still based on Labuan when the Pacific War ended in August 1945. Calls soon came to serve with the formation as part of the proposed Commonwealth [[Occupation of Japan|occupation forces in Japan]], and many personnel volunteered to do so.&lt;ref name=Odgers495&gt;Odgers, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070415--1-.PDF ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 495–496]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allied occupation of Japan===
[[File:OG3829.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.28|Pilots of No. 81 Wing with a P-51D Mustang, shortly after arrival at Bofu, Japan, in March 1946|alt= Three men in dark military clothing standing before a P-51 Mustang single-engined fighter plane]]
The wing began re-equipping with [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51D Mustangs]] at Labuan in September 1945.&lt;ref name=Odgers495/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;481 (Maintenance) Squadron was formed in December from elements of No.&amp;nbsp;22 Repair and Servicing Unit, No.&amp;nbsp;25 Air Stores Park, and other units based on Labuan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=RAAF News |volume=37 |issue=6|date=July 1995|page=21|title=481WG to celebrate its 50th}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;381 (Base) Squadron, established in January 1946, also utilised personnel and equipment from No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing's specialist units at Labuan, including No.&amp;nbsp;47 Operational Base Unit, No.&amp;nbsp;24 Medical Clearing Station, No.&amp;nbsp;25 Air Stores Park and No.&amp;nbsp;2 Airfield Defence Squadron. RAAF base squadrons were administrative and logistical units, intended to make their wings self-supporting and mobile for potential deployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Glen Cooper]], No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing subsequently transferred to new headquarters at [[Hōfu, Yamaguchi|Bofu]], a former [[kamikaze]] base, where it formed the Australian air contingent of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF) in Japan until 1948, when the RAAF presence was reduced. The first of its units to arrive in Japan had been [[No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Airfield Construction Squadron]] (No.&amp;nbsp;5 ACS) in December 1945, followed by the three flying squadrons in March 1946. No.&amp;nbsp;82 Squadron lost three Mustangs and an escorting [[de Havilland Mosquito]] in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 213–216&lt;/ref&gt; The wing's strength was augmented by Nos.&amp;nbsp;381 and 481 Squadrons, and later No.&amp;nbsp;111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit (No.&amp;nbsp;111 MFCU).&lt;ref&gt;Mordike, ''The Post-War Years'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Also making the journey to Japan was the wing's mascot, [[Flying Officer]] (later [[Flight Lieutenant]]) Raleigh, &quot;a small yellow dog and combat-seasoned veteran with over 40 hours operational flying to his credit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Japanese offered no serious resistance to the Allied occupation, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing's prime operational duty was surveillance patrols. The RAAF personnel also helped maintain law and order, and supervised elections, while No.&amp;nbsp;5 ACS, as well as undertaking military construction, contributed to rebuilding local infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt; Otherwise they generally maintained a peacetime training regime.&lt;ref&gt;Mordike, ''The Post-War Years'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1946, No.&amp;nbsp;381 Squadron was providing technical support to all BCOF squadrons, including five from Britain, New Zealand and India, as well as to the RAAF contingent.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, ''Always There'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Group Captain [[Brian Eaton]] took over command of No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing from Cooper in September 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The wing transferred to [[Iwakuni]] in April 1948, the same month that the Federal government determined to reduce Australia's contribution to BCOF and disband the formation, retaining only No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=176 Occupation air group arrived in Japan] at Air Power Development Centre. Retrieved on 29 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Nos.&amp;nbsp;76 and 82 Squadrons disbanded in October, the former subsequently re-emerging and joining No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing when it deployed to Malta in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 86–88,94–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing headquarters and No.&amp;nbsp;481 Squadron were disbanded in November 1948, followed by No.&amp;nbsp;111 MFCU in January 1949.  Detachments of No.&amp;nbsp;381 Squadron and No.&amp;nbsp;5 ACS remained with No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron under the aegis of a new organisation called RAAF Component, eventually disbanding in February and April 1950, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=129 RAAF garrison in Japan downgraded] at Air Power Development Centre. Retrieved on 6 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron personnel were preparing to return to Australia when, on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1950, they were placed on standby for action in the [[Korean War]], which had just broken out; the unit began flying missions over Korea a week later.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-establishment and ''Konfrontasi''===

In January 1961, No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing was re-established at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF1994&quot;/&gt; Flying [[CAC Sabre]]s, its complement included [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]] and 76 Squadrons, as well as [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Conversion Unit]] (No.&amp;nbsp;2 OCU) and a re-formed No.&amp;nbsp;481 Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A94.htm CAC Sabre] at [[RAAF Museum]]. Retrieved on 30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1964, Nos.&amp;nbsp;76 and 481 Squadrons deployed to [[RAAF Base Darwin]], Northern Territory, as part of Operation Handover, a little-publicised contingency plan put into effect during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] between Indonesia and Malaysia. No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron's Sabres, armed with [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder missiles]], were to defend against possible attack by Indonesian forces following the recent establishment of the [[Federation of Malaysia]]. This was the first time since World War&amp;nbsp;II that an RAAF flying squadron was positioned &quot;in harm's way&quot; on Australian soil. As No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron was effectively out of action pending conversion to the [[Dassault Mirage&amp;nbsp;III]], the deployment meant that practically the entire mainland fighter force had been committed to the north. The Officer Commanding No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing, Group Captain A.F. Mather, took on the role of Area Air Defence Commander. No combat ensued, the Sabres' only interception being a [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bomber of [[No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Operational Conversion Unit]], but the experience did reveal deficiencies in the defence of Northern Australia and contributed to the decision to maintain a permanent detachment of No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing fighters in Darwin, and later at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], Northern Territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j37/darwin.htm &quot;Operation Handover&quot;&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, September 1964] at Australian War Memorial.
