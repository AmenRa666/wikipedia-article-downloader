{{Campaignbox Third Coalition}}
The '''[[Battle of Dürenstein]] order of battle''' included a Coalition force of Russian and Austrian troops, under the overall command of [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], and a single division of the ''Corps Mortier'' commanded by [[Édouard Mortier]]. 

In pursuing the Austrian retreat from Bavaria, Mortier had over-extended the three divisions of his newly formed VIII.&amp;nbsp;Corps, spreading them along the north bank of the Danube. Kutuzov enticed Mortier to send [[Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière|Théodore Maxime Gazan's]] 2nd Division into a trap; French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns, and were only rescued by the timely arrival of the 1st Division, under command of [[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang]].  The battle extended well into the night. 

Both sides claimed a victory. The French lost more than a third of the Corps, and Gazan's division experienced over 40 percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses—close to 16 percent—but arguably the most significant was the death in action of [[Johann Heinrich von Schmitt]], one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff.

==Battle==
{{main|Battle of Dürenstein}}
[[File:Battle of durenstein 1805.png|thumb|alt=A black and white lithograph of a battle scene in which several men stand on a cliff, looking at a piece of paper. In the intermediate ground, several small boats carry soldiers. In the distance, steep mountains surround a small village on three sides, and a moon shines through the clouds.|Much of the battle was fought after dark.]]
Early in the morning on 11 November, three coalition columns departed from the vicinity of [[Krems an der Donau]] and [[Melk]], circled around the promontory on which [[Dürnstein]] is located, to prepare to attack the French column that had encamped overnight at the village.  In the morning, responding to rumors of a Russian rear guard, attacked the Russian encampment at nearby Stein; the two forces engaged head-on until afternoon when one of the Russian columns finally made its way through the mountain defiles and attacked the French rear. The French were trapped in the Danube canyon, attacked from the front and the rear by the Russians.  A second French division, under command of Dupont, arrived and attacked the Russian column. Following this attack, another Coalition column arrived and attacked the French. The battle extended well into the night before both sides stopped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egger&quot;&gt;{{de icon}} Rainer. Egger. ''Das Gefecht bei  Dürnstein-Loiben 1805.''

The French lost more than a third of the VIII.&amp;nbsp;Corps, and Gazan's division experienced over 40&amp;nbsp;percent losses. Mortier had failed to protect his northern flank, despite specific instructions from Napoleon. The ''Corps Mortier'' was disbanded and distributed to other Corps, but Gazan received the Officers Cross of the [[Legion of Honor]]. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses—close to 16&amp;nbsp;percent—but arguably the most significant was the death in action of [[Johann Heinrich von Schmitt]], one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egger&quot;/&gt;

==French Order of Battle==

The French division was part of the newly created VIII. Corps, the Corps ''Mortier'', under command of [[Édouard Mortier]]. The role of this Corps was to pursue and defeat the retreating remnants of the Austrian army on the north bank of the Danube river, and to prevent the Russian army, under command of Mikhail Kutuzov, from crossing the river and uniting his force with either the Austrians or with an approaching Russian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Egger. ''Das Gefecht''; Goetz. pp. 70–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November  Édouard Adolphe Mortier commanded the following forces:&lt;ref name=&quot;Databook&quot;&gt;[[Digby Smith]]. ''Napoleonic Wars Databook: 1805'', London: Greenhill Publishing Co., 1998, ISBN 1-85367-276-9. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;
