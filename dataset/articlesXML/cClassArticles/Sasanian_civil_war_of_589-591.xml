The '''Sasanian civil war of 589-591''' was a conflict that broke out in 589, due to the great deal of dissatisfaction among the nobles towards the rule of [[Hormizd IV]]. The civil war lasted until 591, ending with the overthrow of the [[House of Mihran|Mihranid]] usurper [[Bahram Chobin]] and the restoration of the Sasanian family as the rulers of [[Iran]].

The reason for the civil war was due to king Hormizd IV's hard treatment towards the nobility and clergy, whom he distrusted. This eventually made Bahram Chobin start a major rebellion, while the two [[House of Ispahbudhan|Ispahbudhan]] brothers [[Vistahm]] and [[Vinduyih]] made a palace coup against him, resulting in the blinding and eventually death of Hormizd IV. His son, [[Khosrow II]], was thereafter crowned as king. 

However, this did not change the mind of Bahram Chobin, who wanted to restore [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] rule in Iran. Khosrow II was eventually forced to flee to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory, where he made an alliance with the Byzantine emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] against Bahram Chobin. In 591, Khosrow II and his Byzantine allies invaded Bahram Chobin's territories in [[Mesopotamia]], where they successfully managed to defeat him, while Khosrow II regained the throne. Bahram Chobin thereafter fled to the territory of the [[Turkic people|Turks]] in [[Transoxiana]], but was not long afterwards assassinated or executed at the instigation of Khosrow II.

==Background==
When [[Khosrow I]] ascended the Sasanian throne in 531, he began a series of reforms that was started by his father and predecessor [[Kavadh I]]. These reforms were mostly aimed at the elites of the Sasanian Empire, who had become too powerful and had been able to depose several Sasanian rulers. Khosrow I was quite successful in these reforms, and after his death in 579, he was succeeded by his son [[Hormizd IV]], who continued his father's policies, but in a harsher way; in order to control the elites, he, in the words of [[Alireza Shapour Shahbazi|Shapur Shahbazi]], &quot;resorted to harshness, denigration, and execution.&quot;{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2004|pp=466-467}} Hormizd IV was extremely hostile to the elites and did not trust them, therefore, he constantly sided with the lower classes.

Hormizd IV also declined the requests of the [[Zoroastrian]] priesthood to persecute the [[Christianity|Christians]], and like the elites, Hormizd IV did not like the Zoroastrian priesthood either, and therefore killed a great deal of them, including the chief priest (''[[mowbed]]'') himself. Furthermore, Hormizd IV also greatly reduced the payment of the military by 10 percent,{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}} and massacred many powerful and prominent members of elite, which included the famous [[House of Karen|Karenid]] ''[[vizier]]'' of his father, [[Bozorgmehr]],&lt;ref name=EI-BB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=BOZORGMEHR-E  BOḴTAGĀN|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume= Vol. 4|year=1990|first=Djalal|last=Khaleghi Motlagh|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bozorgmehr-e-boktagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the latter's brother [[Simah-i Burzin]]; the [[House of Mihran|Mihranid]] [[Izadgushasp]]; the ''[[spahbed]]'' (&quot;army chief&quot;) [[Bahram-i Mah Adhar]], and the [[House of Ispahbudhan|Ispahbudhan]] Shapur, who was the father of [[Vistahm]] and [[Vinduyih]]. According to the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] historian [[al-Tabari]], Hormizd is said to have ordered the death of 13,600 nobles and religious members.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=118}}

==Outbreak of the civil war==

===The rebellion of Bahram Chobin===
In 588, a massive [[Hephthalite]]-[[Turkic Khaganate|Turkic]] army [[First Perso-Turkic War|invaded]] the Sasanian province [[Harev (province)|Harev]]. [[Bahram Chobin]], a military genius from the [[House of Mihran]], was appointed as the ''spahbed'' of the [[Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr#Kusts of Eranshahr|kust]] of [[Khwarasan|Khorasan]]. He was thereafter appointed as the head of an army of 12,000 soldiers. He then made a counter-attack against the Turks, and successfully defeated them, killing their ruler [[Bagha Qaghan]] (known as Shawa/Sava/Saba in Sasanian sources).{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}} After some time, Bahram was defeated by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in a battle on the banks of the [[Aras River]]. Hormizd IV, who was jealous of Bahram Chobin, used this defeat as an excuse to dismiss Bahram Chobin from his office, and had him humiliated.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=167}}{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}

===The coup in Ctesiphon and the march of Bahram Chobin===
[[File:The Night Attack of Bahram Chubina on the Army of Khusraw Parvis LACMA M.2009.44.3 (2 of 8).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Bahram Chobin fighting Sasanian loyalists near [[Ctesiphon]].]]
Bahram Chobin, furious of Hormizd actions, responded by rebelling, and due to his noble status and great military knowledge, was joined by his soldiers and many others. He then appointed a new governor for Khorasan, and afterwards set for [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of the Sasanian Empire. Meanwhile, Hormizd tried to come to terms with Vistahm and Vinduyih, &quot;who equally hated Hormozd&quot;.{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}} Hormizd shortly had Vinduyih imprisoned, while Vistahm managed to flee from the court. After a short period of time, a palace coup under the two brothers occur in Ctesiphon, which resulted in the blinding of Hormizd and the accession of the latter's son [[Khosrow II]] (who was their nephew through his mother's side). The two brothers shortly had Hormizd killed. 

A few days later, Bahram reached the [[Nahrawan Canal]] near Ctesiphon, where he fought Khosrow's men, who were heavily outnumbered, but managed to hold Bahram's men back in several clashes. However, Khosrow's men eventually began losing their morale, and were in the end defeated by Bahram Chobin's forces. Khosrow, together with his two uncles, his wives, and a [[retinue]] of 30 nobles, thereafter fled to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory, while Ctesiphon fell to Bahram Chobin.{{sfn|James Howard-Johnston}}

===Khosrow's flight to Byzantium and restoration===
[[File:Southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] [[Mesopotamia]] and its surroundings.]]
In order to get the attention of the Byzantine emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582–602), Khosrow II went to [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], and sent a message to the Sasanian occupied city of [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Martyropolis]] to stop their resistance against the Byzantines, but with no avail.{{sfn|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=172}} He then sent a message to Maurice, and requested his help to regain the Sasanian throne, which the Byzantine emperor agreed with; in return, the Byzantines would re-gain sovereignty over the cities of [[Diyarbakır|Amida]], [[Carrhae]], [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] and [[Silvan, Turkey|Miyafariqin]]. Furthermore, Persia was required to stop intervening in the affairs of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] and [[Armenia]], effectively ceding control of [[Lazica|Lazistan]] to the Byzantines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Dinawari|Dinavari]], [[al-Akhbar al-tiwal]], pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 591, Khosrow moved to [[Viranşehir|Constantia]], and prepared to invade Bahram Chobin's territories in [[Mesopotamia]], while Vistahm and Vinduyih were raising an army in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] under the observation of the Byzantine commander [[John Mystacon]], who was also raising an army in Armenia. After some time, Khosrow along with the Byzantine commander of the south, [[Comentiolus]], invaded Mesopotamia. During this invasion, [[Nisibis]] and Martyropolis quickly defected to them,{{sfn|Howard-Johnston|2010}} and Bahram's commander Zatsparham was defeated and killed.{{sfn|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=173}} One of Bahram's other commanders, Bryzacius, was captured in [[Mosul|Mosil]] and had his nose and ears cut off, and was thereafter sent to Khosrow, where he was killed.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=251}}{{sfn|Rawlinson|2004|p=509}}

Some time later, Khosrow, feeling disrespected by Comentiolus, convinced Maurice to replace the latter with [[Narses (general under Maurice)|Narses]] as the commander of the south.{{sfn|Howard-Johnston|2010}}{{sfn|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=173}} Khosrow and Narses then penetrated deeper into Bahram's territory, seizing Dara and then [[Mardin]] on February, where Khosrow was re-proclaimed king.{{sfn|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=173}} Shortly after this, Khosrow sent one of his Iranian supporters, Mahbodh, to capture Ctesiphon, which he managed to accomplish.{{sfn|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=174}} 

Meanwhile, Khosrow's two uncles and John Mystacon, conquered northern Azerbaijan, and went further south in the region, where they defeated Bahram at [[Battle of Blarathon|Blarathon]], who fled to the [[Turkic people|Turks]] of [[Ferghana]].{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=28}} However, Khosrow managed to deal with him by either having him assassinated{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=28}} or convince the Turks to execute him.{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=28}}

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Roman-Persian Frontier in Late Antiquity.svg|thumb|Map of the Roman-Persian frontier during Late Antiquity, including the 591 border between the two empires.|280px]]
Peace with the Byzantines was then officially made. Maurice, for his aid, received much of [[Persian Armenia]] and western Georgia, and received the abolition of tribute which had formerly been paid to the Sasanians.{{sfn|Howard-Johnston|2010}} This marked the beginning of a peaceful period between the two empires, which lasted until 602, when Khosrow decided to [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|declare war against the Byzantines]] after the murder of Maurice by the usurper [[Phocas]].{{sfn|Oman|1893|p=155}}{{sfn|Foss|1975|p=722}}
