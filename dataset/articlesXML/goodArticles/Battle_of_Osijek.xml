{{Campaignbox Croatian War of Independence}}
The '''Battle of Osijek''' ({{lang-hr|Bitka za Osijek}}) was the artillery bombardment of the [[Croatia]]n city of [[Osijek]] by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) which took place from August 1991 to June 1992 during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Shelling peaked in late November and December 1991, then diminished in 1992 after the [[Vance plan]] was accepted by the combatants. [[Airstrike]]s and attacks by JNA infantry and armored units against targets in the city accompanied the bombardment, which caused approximately 800 deaths and resulted in a large portion of the city's population leaving. Croatian sources estimated that 6,000 artillery shells were fired against Osijek over the period.

After the JNA [[Battle of Vukovar|captured Vukovar]] on 18 November 1991, Osijek was the next target for its [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|campaign in Croatia]]. The JNA units subordinated to the 12th ([[Novi Sad]]) Corps, supported by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]], achieved modest advances in late November and early December, capturing several villages south of Osijek, but the [[Croatian Army]] maintained its defensive front and limited the JNA's advances.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Osijek, Croatian authorities charged thirteen JNA officers with [[war crime]]s against civilians, but no arrests have been made to date. Croatian authorities also charged the wartime commander of Osijek's defence, [[Branimir Glavaš]], and five others with war crimes committed in the city in 1991. The five were convicted and received sentences ranging between eight and ten years, and as of March 2015, judicial proceedings against Glavaš are in progress.

==Background==
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions worsened. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] (''Teritorijalna obrana'' – TO) to minimize potential resistance.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=117}} On 17 August 1990, the escalating tensions turned into [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] by the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]].{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=118}} The revolt took place in the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around [[Knin]]{{sfn|The New York Times|19 August 1990}} and in parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] regions and [[eastern Croatia]].{{sfn|Woodward|1995|p=170}} In January 1991, [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]], supported by [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Serbia's provinces of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]], made two unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval from the [[Yugoslav Presidency]] to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|pp=118–119}}

After [[Pakrac clash|a bloodless skirmish]] between Serb insurgents and [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991–95|Croatian special police]] in March,{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=384–385}} the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare a [[state of emergency]]. The request was denied on 15 March 1991,{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=119}} and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] in the summer of 1991 as the Yugoslav federation started to fall apart.{{sfn|Sell|2002|p=373}} By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated, resulting in the [[Plitvice Lakes incident|first fatalities]] of the war.{{sfn|The New York Times|3 March 1991}} The JNA then stepped in to support the insurgents and prevent [[Law enforcement in Croatia|Croatian police]] from intervening.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=119}} In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia announced their intention to integrate the areas under their control with Serbia. The [[Government of Croatia]] considered this an act of [[secession]].{{sfn|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}

==Timeline==
[[File:Map 3 - Croatia - Eastern Slavonia - September 1991 - January 1992.jpg|thumb|300px|Map showing the fighting in eastern Slavonia, September 1991 – January 1992; Osijek is located in the bulge (salient) near the top of the map]]
The JNA intervened directly against Croatia for the first time on 3 July 1991, driving Croatian forces out of [[Baranja]], north of the city of [[Osijek]],{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=397}} and out of [[Erdut]], [[Aljmaš, Croatia|Aljmaš]] and [[Dalj]] east of Osijek.{{sfn|Marijan|2012a|p=111}} The advance was followed by intermittent fighting around Osijek, [[Vukovar]] and [[Vinkovci]].{{sfn|CIA|2002|p=93}} At several points, JNA positions approached to within several hundred yards of Osijek city limits.{{sfn|The Washington Post|6 September 1991}}

The JNA units near Osijek were subordinated to the 12th ([[Novi Sad]]) Corps,{{sfn|Marijan|2012b|p=261}} commanded by [[Major General]] [[Andrija Biorčević]].{{sfn|Vreme|7 September 2006}} In the city itself, the JNA had several barracks which housed the 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade and the 12th Mixed Artillery Regiment.{{sfn|CIA|2002b|p=103}} The 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade contained one of a handful battalions maintained by the JNA at full [[combat readiness]].{{sfn|Marijan|2003|loc=note 20}} Osijek was established as their starting point in a [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|planned westward offensive]] toward [[Našice]] and [[Bjelovar]].{{sfn|Marijan|2012b|p=261}}

Croatian forces in the area were formally subordinated to the Operational Zone Command in Osijek headed by Colonel [[Karl Gorinšek]].{{sfn|Slobodna Dalmacija|8 November 2003}} In practice, the city's defense was overseen by [[Branimir Glavaš]], then head of the National Defence Office in Osijek, according to information presented at Glavaš trial in the 2000s. Glavaš formally became commander of city defenses on 7 December 1991.{{sfn|Slobodna Dalmacija|26 October 2006}}

===Bombardment of the city===
[[File:Osijek-2.JPG|thumb|left|Partially repaired bombardment damage in Osijek]]
The JNA first attacked Osijek by mortar fire on 31 July 1991,{{sfn|Libal|1997|p=30}} and heavily bombarded the city's center on 19 August 1991.{{sfn|Libal|1997|p=38}} The attacks came from positions north, east and south of Osijek,{{sfn|Ramsbotham|Miall|Woodhouse|2011|pp=308, 310}} and were supported by JNA garrisons stationed in Osijek itself.{{sfn|Mesić|2004|p=233}} On 7–9 September, an inconclusive battle was fought in [[Tenja]], within {{convert|3|km|abbr=off|spell=in}} of the city.{{sfn|CIA|2002b|p=86}} The [[Battle of the Barracks|JNA garrisons were besieged]] by Croatian forces in mid-September. After a barracks in the city centre was captured on 15 September 1991,{{sfn|Nacional|24 October 2006}} the remaining JNA garrison tried to break through the Croatian troops besieging the barracks and, after heavy fighting, reached JNA positions south of Osijek on 17 September 1991.{{sfn|CIA|2002b|p=103}} The intensity of the shelling increased thereafter, peaking through November and December. After a ceasefire was arranged in January 1992, following the acceptance of the [[Vance plan]], the artillery attacks dropped off and became intermittent,{{sfn|Jegen|1996|p=14}} and ceased by June.{{sfn|Ramsbotham|Miall|Woodhouse|2011|pp=308, 310}}

During its height, the intensity of the bombardment was reported to reach as high as one shell per minute,{{sfn|Bailey|2004|p=435}} and the artillery attacks were compounded by [[Yugoslav Air Force]] strikes against the city.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=409}} According to Croatian sources, a total of 6,000 artillery shells were fired against Osijek in the period.{{sfn|Nacional|27 April 2012}} Prior to the start of the bombardment, the civilian population of Osijek totaled 104,761 city residents and 129,792 municipal residents.{{sfn|Andraković|Jukić|2009|p=31}} These numbers were significantly reduced as civilians fled the fighting. It is estimated that only about a third of the population remained in the city by the end of November,{{sfn|Los Angeles Times|26 November 1991}} with some sources placing the estimate even lower, suggesting that the population of the city was reduced to just 10,000 civilians during the most intense periods of the bombardment.{{sfn|Ramsbotham|Miall|Woodhouse|2011|p=308}} Those who remained in Osijek through the fighting generally slept in [[bomb shelter]]s.{{sfn|The Washington Post|6 September 1991}}

}}
After JNA [[Battle of Vukovar|captured Vukovar]] on 18 November, the JNA 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, supported by the Serbian Ministry of Interior-trained [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] paramilitaries,{{sfn|CIA|2002|pp=101–102}}{{sfn|Macdonald|2002|p=104}} started to advance west between Vinkovci and Osijek on 20 November.{{sfn|CIA|2002|pp=101–102}} The city of Osijek appeared to be the next target of the JNA,{{sfn|Ahrens|2007|p=117}} which was later confirmed by General [[Života Panić]], commander of the JNA 1st Military District.{{sfn|CIA|2002b|p=208}}

On 21 November 1991, the JNA captured the villages of Stari Seleš, Novi Seleš and [[Ernestinovo]] situated approximately {{convert|10|km|abbr=off|spell=in}} south of Osijek. [[Laslovo]], {{convert|5|km|abbr=off|spell=in}} south of Ernestinovo, was captured three days later. Those developments threatened [[Đakovo]] and pointed to the potential encirclement of Osijek.{{sfn|Marijan|2012a|p=111}} On 4 December 1991, the [[Special Envoy]] of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Cyrus Vance]] visited Osijek to inspect the damage.{{sfn|The Washington Post|4 December 1991}}

In early December, the JNA made modest advances, capturing [[Antunovac]] located {{convert|6|km|abbr=off|spell=in}} south of Osijek on 5 December 1991.{{sfn|Marijan|2012a|p=111}} On the same day, an armoured JNA force unsuccessfully attacked positions held by the Croatian 106th Brigade in Rosinjača Forest near [[Nemetin]], approximately {{convert|2|km|abbr=off|spell=in}} east of Osijek.{{sfn|Glas Slavonije|6 December 2012}} On 6 December, the JNA pushed Croatian troops out from Tenja,{{sfn|Marijan|2012a|p=111}} followed by a heavy attack against Osijek repulsed by the [[Croatian Army]] (''Hrvatska vojska'' {{ndash}} HV) on 7 December.{{sfn|Los Angeles Times|9 December 1991}} On 11 December, HV personnel entered the frontline village of [[Paulin Dvor]], less than {{convert|3|km|abbr=off|spell=in}} kilometers west of Ernestinovo,{{sfn|Marijan|2012a|p=111}} and summarily executed 19 civilians (18 Serbs and one Hungarian).{{sfn|BBC|4 November 2010}}{{sfn|B92|11 December 2011}} The JNA captured Paulin Dvor five days later, on 16 December,{{sfn|Marijan|2012a|p=111}} and attacked Osijek once again.{{sfn|Fraser|17 December 1991}} The HV managed to contain the attack, though fighting continued south of Osijek until January 1992.{{sfn|CIA|2002|pp=101–102}}

===Operation Devil's Beam===
Advances of the JNA north of Osijek threatened HV control of a narrow [[bridgehead]] held across the [[Drava]] River skirting the city's northern edge. By mid-December the bridgehead was reduced to a strip of land opposite Osijek, encompassing suburban settlements of Podravlje and Tvrđavica. In order to remove the threat, the HV launched an offensive [[codename]]d Operation Devil's Beam ({{lang-hr|Operacija Đavolja greda|links=no}}) on 17–18 December. The offensive, involving the 1st Battalion of the 135th Brigade, elements of the [[special forces]] Frankopan Battalion and the Osijek-based [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991–95|Orao special police unit]], Drava River flotilla, artillery of the 106th Brigade,{{sfn|SIB.hr|23 December 2013}} and personnel of the 4th [[Beli Manastir]] Police Station,{{sfn|Bajto|18 December 2011}} successfully pushed the JNA north, across Stara Drava [[oxbow lake]] located approximately {{convert|4|km|abbr=off|spell=in}} north of Osijek.{{sfn|Pejić|19 December 2014}} The JNA also withdrew from the village of [[Kopačevo]] towards [[Darda, Croatia|Darda]] and [[Vardarac]], but the HV did not have sufficient resources to exploit the development.{{sfn|Alilović|18 December 2014}} The HV lost eight killed in the offensive,{{sfn|Zelenić|18 December 2014}} but the JNA's advance towards Osijek from the north was halted.{{sfn|Bajto|18 December 2011}}

==Aftermath==
By June 1992, approximately 800 people had been killed by the bombardment.{{sfn|Jegen|1996|p=14}} By the end of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] in 1995, a total of 1,724 people from Osijek had been killed, including 1,327 soldiers and 397 civilians.{{sfn|HRT|28 June 2012}} The city itself suffered great damage during the war, with the bulk of direct damage occurring as a consequence of the 1991–92 bombardment.{{sfn|Pavičić|2009|p=150}} Direct war damage sustained by the city was estimated at a total of US$1.3&amp;nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Pavičić|2009|p=154}} The damage was regularly recorded by 400 volunteers during the bombardment.{{sfn|Pavičić|2009|p=153}}

Although media reported on the bombardment of Osijek, journalists in the city itself felt that it was receiving an unduly low level of media coverage compared to wartime events elsewhere in Croatia.{{sfn|Mercier|1995|p=135}} The attacks on Osijek were welcomed by the ''Pravoslavlje'' newspaper published by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which appeared to give a blessing to the attack as a part of a &quot;[[holy war]]&quot;, setting it in the context of [[List of massacres in the Independent State of Croatia|World War II massacres]] and [[concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=400}}

The JNA withdrew from Croatia in 1992, but continued to contribute personnel and equipment to the [[Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (ARSK) which controlled the areas previously held by the JNA.{{sfn|Armatta|2010|p=216}} Although the [[United Nations Protection Force]] peacekeepers deployed to the area on the basis of the Vance plan and placed most of the ARSK heavy weapons in storage,{{sfn|CIA|2002|p=107}} Osijek was intermittently bombarded throughout the war—the last artillery strike occurred in September 1995.{{sfn|Večernji list|16 November 2011}} The hostilities ceased in November 1995 through the [[Erdut Agreement]] securing restoration of Croatian rule in the region.{{sfn|Ramet|Matić|2007|p=46}}

In November 2010, then-Croatian President [[Ivo Josipović]] officially apologized for the [[Paulin Dvor massacre]], shortly after his Serbian counterpart [[Boris Tadić]] issued a formal apology for the [[Vukovar massacre|massacre at Vukovar]].{{sfn|BBC|4 November 2010}}

===War crime trials===
In 2008, Croatian authorities formally charged Colonel Boro Ivanović, commanding officer of the JNA 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade, and twelve other JNA officers with [[war crime]]s against the civilian population. The charges include causing the deaths of 307 civilians in Osijek and surrounding areas, injuries to another 171 civilians, and the destruction of at least 1,188 different structures. {{As of|2013}}, all of the indicted officers remain at large in [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Blic|17 November 2008}}

In 2005, the Osijek District Court convicted former Croatian soldier Nikola Ivanković for his involvement in the killings at Paulin Dvor, and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. In 2012, Enes Vitesković was also convicted for his involvement in the atrocity, and given an eleven-year sentence.{{sfn|B92|11 December 2011}}

After the war, five Croatian fighters were charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of attempted murder, and one of torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence.{{sfn|Nacional|24 October 2006}}{{sfn|Nacional|8 May 2009}} Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid [[extradition]], Glavaš fled to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, when he was arrested and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Nacional|28 September 2010}} In January 2015, the conviction was set aside by the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]], pending a new trial before the [[Supreme Court of Croatia]].{{sfn|Jurasić|12 January 2015}}
