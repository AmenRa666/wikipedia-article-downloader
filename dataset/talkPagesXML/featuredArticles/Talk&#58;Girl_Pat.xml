== Overstatement? ==
The emphatic &quot;there is no public record of her subsequent history&quot; in the Aftermath section doesn't to my ear gel with [http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/History-fishing-town/story-11542814-detail/story.html the source's] (6-year old) less dogmatic &quot;Nothing seems to be known of her after that&quot;.

The result of the move request was: '''Move.''' Given that there's no other subject called &quot;Girl Pat&quot; on Wikipedia, the parentheses serves no disambiguation purpose.

[[:Girl Pat (1935 trawler)]] → {{no redirect|Girl Pat}} – In a quick search I couldn't find another trawler or topic sharing the name. Also, [[Girl Pat]] already redirects here.

* '''Support''' Per above. [[User:Wctaiwan|wctaiwan]] ([[User talk:Wctaiwan|talk]]) 07:58, 1 March 2016 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''': The longer title was chosen for two reasons: first, to clarify for the casual reader that this article was about a boat, not a girl, a film, book or video etc.; secondly, because there have been other vessels with the same name, and although none have yet acquired a WP article,  confusion or uncertainty could arise from the shorter title. Is there any real disadvantage in letting the existing title stand? [[User:Brianboulton|Brianboulton]] ([[User talk:Brianboulton|talk]]) 14:28, 3 March 2016 (UTC)
**I imagined that, but [[WP:Disambiguation]] must be justified with tangible evidence its ambiguity will be troublesome in general (not only for casual readers). If the first reason is &quot;they may think it is about something else&quot;, [[Paris]] would be at [[Paris, France]], [[America]] at [[America (disambiguation)]] or [[Titanic]] at [[Titanic (disambiguation)]], as they all are ambiguous titles that ''anyone'' &quot;may think it is about something else&quot;. For the second reason, if there are other topics, including trawlers, you have to create [[Girl Pat]] as a disambiguation page. But if this is the only blue link with that name, [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]] would still apply. [[WP:CC-BY-SA|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;©&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User:Tbhotch|&lt;font color=&quot;#4B0082&quot;&gt;Tb&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6082B6&quot;&gt;hotch&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tbhotch|&lt;font color=&quot;#555555&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;™&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; ([[User:Tbhotch/EN|en-2.5]]). 17:07, 4 March 2016 (UTC)
***The &quot;ambiguous&quot; examples that you cite are all extremely well known names which don't warrant further description; it is extremely unlikely that people will be confused by them. ''Girl Pat'' is not well known generally, and I believe the extended title may be helpful. I repeat:  is there any real disadvantage in letting the existing title stand? [[User:Brianboulton|Brianboulton]] ([[User talk:Brianboulton|talk]]) 10:04, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
****Considering [[America]] was originally a disambiguation page until 2015, and it took at least [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=move&amp;prefix=Talk%3AAmerica+%28disambiguation%29%2F&amp;fulltext=Search+archives&amp;fulltext=Search 3 RMs], it is not an extremely well-known name. Also, disambiguation is not added because the subject is obscure in general, refer to [[Toil]].

* '''Oppose''' per Brianboulton. Just yesterday I wanted to read the article about a woman named Viola (looking for women nominated for DYK in women's history month), only to find out it was about a band of male performers. When we can be clear about what something is, why not have it? How is - for a compromise - [[Girl Pat (trawler)]]? In case another trawler makes it to article, that one could get the year to distinguish. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 10:50, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
**Then go to [[Talk:Viola]] and request a move. BTW, [[Viola]] is an instrument, not a band of male performers (I guess you are talking about [[Viola Beach]]). Also, the instrument ''is'' the [[WP:PTOPIC]] for that name, not the given name. [[Girl Pat]], on the other hand, has no other use aside from the trawler. Brian mentioned there are other uses, but never cited which are them.

**''Girl Pat'' is a very odd construction as you might see only in ship names, so I highly doubt any other subject by this title exists, and none are on Wikipedia. &amp;mdash;[[User talk:Innotata|''innotata'']] 19:13, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' IMHO the title is fine as it stands, when using web based searches the short description is clearly not enough to distinguish the subject. The addition of date and a descriptor in the title of the article does it for me! [[User:HJKeats|HJKeats]] ([[User talk:HJKeats|talk]]) 21:45, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
:*Refer to [[WP:Disambiguation]] to fully understand why disambiguation is used. A hint, it is not used solely for descriptive purposes as you mention.

*'''Support''' – the oppose votes seem to be ignorant of what disambiguation is for. It is not for telling readers what the topic is about; that is the purpose of the article. Since there is no other topic named &quot;Girl Pat&quot; on Wikipedia, disambiguation is unnecessary. [[User talk:SSTflyer|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;sst✈&lt;/span&gt;]] 11:14, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
:*You should be a little careful of accusing other editors of ignorance. The issue here is not  about disambiguation – there is nothing to disambiguate. It is about having an article title that is sufficiently descriptive of the subject to inform readers what the article is about. That seems to be more important than this obsession with applying an interpretation of the rules that would, in the end, bring no advantage whatever. [[User:Brianboulton|Brianboulton]] ([[User talk:Brianboulton|talk]]) 15:41, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
::*&quot;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ignorance ignorance]: The condition of being uninformed or uneducated. Lack of knowledge or information.&quot; Although the word &quot;ignorant&quot; is commonly used as an attack, in this case it seems to be correctly used. Disambiguation is not used for ''descriptive'' purposes, it is used, and I cite, because it &quot;[[WP:DAB|is the process of resolving the conflicts that arise when a single term is ambiguous.]]&quot; Yourself are acknowledge there is nothing to disambiguate, therefore, there is no valid usage of disambiguation. If you still considering disambiguation must be used for descriptive purposes, create a consensus at [[WT:DAB]].

:::: If I understand Brian correctly, he means that the title is not an example of disambiguation. Instead it is just a clarification of the topic. That means that this discussion is not about disambiguation but about correct article naming.  I think the parentheses in the title are confusing the discussion.  It might still be the case that the article should be moved to [[Girl Pat]], but the relevant policy or guideline isn't [[WP:DAB]].

:::: An example might make it clearer what I'm trying to say.  The liner [[RMS Queen Mary]] is at that article title, presumably because that's in some sense the &quot;official&quot; name of the ship.  However, nobody ever called it that; it was always referred to as &quot;The Queen Mary&quot;.  The choice between &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;RMS Queen Mary&quot; isn't a disambiguation choice, it's a naming choice; but it has the happy side-effect of making it clear that this is an article about a ship.  Something similar, if such a title exists, would be ideal for this article.  I'm not sure if such a title exists, and personally I don't think it would be that harmful to move it to [[Girl Pat]], but I can see why other commenters would like to find a title like that.

== Great article ==

This is the most interesting featured article I've seen in a long time, great work by the creator(s) and reviewer(s). Blowing my own horn a bit, but anyone with an interest in maritime adventures should check out the article on [[Ben Carlin]] – currently only a good article (not quite as polished as this one), but a similar amount of detail. (Any copy-editing would be appreciated). &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:IgnorantArmies|&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;IgnorantArmies&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:IgnorantArmies|&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 04:47, 1 March 2016 (UTC)
:Thanks for the kind words. The Carlin story looks fascinating – completely new to me – and I'll make sure I read it and perhaps add comments. I'm very pressed for time at present, but I'll put it on my &quot;to do&quot; list, for when things ease up a bit.

== Pat or Patrick? ==

The infobox gives the name of the boat in the 1930s as ''Girl Patrick'', but this is completely unsourced as far I can see, and wouldn't make much sense as the name of a ship. Is it a wiki prank or from some kind of fringe source? [[Special:Contributions/83.251.170.27|83.251.170.27]] ([[User talk:83.251.170.27|talk]]) 17:49, 1 March 2016 (UTC)

== No map? ==

Seems like a map would be a nice addition to the article. I'm surprised it doesn't have one. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] ([[User talk:Kaldari|talk]]) 23:03, 1 March 2016 (UTC)
