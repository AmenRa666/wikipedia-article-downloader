Wow! Talk about an entry that needs work! No mention at all that Compton practically ran the [[Manhattan Project]] in its early days, or his work during WWII at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]]! I will be back when I have a botty face --[[User:Fastfission|Fastfission]] 00:17, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Agree that article probably needs to be completely rewritten.  I've done piecemeal editing, but the product doesn't yet do justice to Compton's importance.  --[[User:Cuppysfriend]], 13 Jun 2005.


This article seems to get vandalized a lot. I tried to fix some that was never properly reverted. --[[User:Jacqui M Schedler|Jacquelyn Marie]] 21:57, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm changing the part that says Arthur's brother Wilson M. Compton was president of Washington University in St. Louis. Actually, Wilson was president of the State College of Washington, later Washington State University. Arthur himself was Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis, beginning in 1945. [[User:Ropcat|Ropcat]] 19:18, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

I removed the comment that Compton Hall at The College of Wooster was named after him. It is actually named Otelia Compton Hall after his mother and was an all-women's dorm when I was a student there. They were an incredible family and I think would warrant their own page. For anyone with more time to edit the page, check out ''The House on College Avenue'' by James R. Blackwood, which is a biography of the family's life at Wooster. Best wishes.   &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.71.65.175|75.71.65.175]] ([[User talk:75.71.65.175|talk]]) 16:55, 16 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Add his children? ==

Arthur Compton's son John Compton, was a, get this a Philosophy professor of mine, specializing in Kant and some existensialism at Vanderbilt University.  Believe he is retired now, but he was a fairly notable guy.  Perhaps some mention should be made of his children?  I don't know if he had any other besides Dr. Compton  [[User:Domhail|Domhail]] 22:55, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

== speed bumps ==

How about them speed bumps? Or is that [[WP:N|not notable]]?&amp;mdash;[[User:msh210|msh210]]&lt;span class=&quot;Unicode&quot;&gt;℠&lt;/span&gt; 15:59, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

== Presbyterian/Baptist/Other? ==
I didn't mean to bring confusion. The article I found on him said his Dad was Presbyterian and that he was a deacon at a Baptist church. That was in [[1936]] though. Anyone know which denominational category he fits?--[[User:T. Anthony|T. Anthony]] ([[User talk:T. Anthony|talk]]) 03:34, 5 May 2008 (UTC)


== add a book ==
Albert Einstein didn’t prove that the photon exists. He did theorize the quantum effect and received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for the photoelectric effect. Arthur Compton did the experiment to prove that the photon exists in 1923. In 1927 is when he received the Nobel Prize for proving the existence of the photon. Read the Nobel Prize paper in which Arthur Compton mentions for the first time the photon as a particle and the experiment that proves it.

The book
X-rays and electrons
An outline of recent X-ray theory
By
Arthur H. Compton Ph. D.
Copyright 1926
By D. Van Nostrand Company
This book includes papers from 1923 on and uses the word photoelectrons for the one particle and electrons for the other. All he did was invent a new word by combining two words then later he shortened  the new word so as not to confuse it with the electron by eliminating electro. The new particles thus became the photons from a shortening of photoelectrons. Read the book.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.171.143.254|68.171.143.254]] ([[User talk:68.171.143.254|talk]]) 17:27, 29 August 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
