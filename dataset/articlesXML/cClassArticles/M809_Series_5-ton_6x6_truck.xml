The '''M809 series truck''' [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation|(G908)]] was a family of 5-ton [[Six-wheel drive|6x6]] tactical trucks built for the [[United States Armed Forces]]. The basic cargo version was designed to transport a 5-ton (4,500kg), {{convert|14|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long load over all terrain in all weather. In on-road service the load weight was doubled. Built by [[AM General]], they evolved into the [[M939 Truck|M939 Series]].

== History ==
In the late 1960s the US Army needed more 5-ton (4,536kg) trucks. [[AM General]] developed an updated version of the [[M54 (truck)|M39 series]], in service since 1951. The primary difference was the engine and transmission. The hood and grille were lengthened to make room for the larger engine and the lighting system was updated to meet new US safety regulations. All had an air cleaner on the left fender, a way to tell them from the earlier M39 series.

AM General built all M809s between 1970 and 1982. The M809 Series was then improved into the [[M939 Truck|M939 series]] in 1982. The first 11,000 M939s were rebuilds of M809s.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|pp=360-366}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=192-200}}

==Specifications==
===Engine and driveline===
[[File:Cummins NH250 engine.jpg|thumb|right|Cummins NH250 engine]]
The M809 series used a [[Cummins]] NH250 engine, a [[Engine displacement|{{convert|855|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] [[Straight six engine|inline 6 cylinder]] [[diesel engine]] developing [[Horsepower|{{convert|240|hp|kW|abbr=on}}]] at 2100[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|685|lbfft|0|abbr=on}}  of [[torque]] at 1500rpm. All models of the M809 series used this engine throughout their service life. The N series was a successful commercial design, with a conservative rating the engine was more powerful and less stressed than the Continental LDS-465 [[multifuel]] engine used in the M39 series.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|pp=360-366}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=192-200}}{{sfnp|Motor's|1973|p=1107-1108}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-34-1|1995}}

A [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana-Spicer]] 5-speed  model 6453 [[Transmission (mechanics)|synchromesh manual transmission]] had a very low 1st, direct 4th, and overdrive 5th. A Rockwell-Standard 2-speed transfer case also engaged the front axle automatically if the rear wheels turned faster than the front, as when the rear wheels spun.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-20|1995|p=1-35}}

===Chassis===
[[File:M809 chassis fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[File:M809 winch fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|Front mounted winch]]
The M809 series had a [[Vehicle frame#Ladder Frame|ladder frame]] with three live axles, the front on [[leaf spring]]s and the rear tandem on leaf springs with locating arms.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-20|1995|pp=1-10 to 1-11}}

There were three [[wheelbase]]s (measurements are from the centerline of the front axle to the centerline of rear tandem). The short, used for tractors and dumps, was {{convert|167|in|m|2}}, the long, used for cargo, wreckers, and bolsters, was {{convert|179|in|m|2}}, and the extra long, used for long cargo, tractor wreckers, and expansible vans, was {{convert|215|in|m|2}}.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=192-200}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988}}

Most models had 11.00x20 size tires with dual rear tires. Some M813s had 14.00x20 with single rear tires, the M821 bridge trucks had 14.00x20 with dual rear tires. The M819 wrecker tractor had 12.00x20 with dual rear tires. All tires were bi-directional military pattern.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988}}

Brakes were air over hydraulic with [[drum brake]]s on all wheels. Air brake connections at the rear were used for trailer brakes. The M815, M818, and M819 had separate controls to apply the trailer brakes separately from the service brakes.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988}}

All M809 models had a rear [[Pintle|pintle hitch]] and could tow {{convert|15,000|lb|abbr=on}} trailers except the M816, which could tow {{convert|20,000|lb|abbr=on}} The M818 and M819 could tow {{convert|37,500|lb|abbr=on}} semi trailers on their [[Fifth wheel coupling|fifth wheel]].

Many M809 series were equipped with a front mounted {{convert|20000|lb|abbr=on}} capacity winch, intended for self-recovery. A winch weighed {{convert|665|lb|abbr=on}} and added {{convert|15+1/2|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} inches to the length of the truck. The M815 had a mid mounted winch and the M816 had a rear mounted {{convert|45,000|lb|abbr=on}} capacity winch.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|pp=2.96-2.106}}

A standard military cab, designed by [[REO Motor Car Company|REO]] for their  {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton M35, was used. It had hinged doors with roll-up windows, a folding windshield, and a removable canvas roof. A hard roof could be fitted.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=192-200}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|pp=2.94-2.95}}

== Models ==
=== M813 &amp; M814 Cargo Truck ===
[[File:M813 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M813 Cargo Truck]]
[[File:M814 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M814 Cargo Truck]]
The M813 was the standard cargo version of the series. It had a {{convert|14|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long low sided box with a bottom hinged tailgate. Side racks, troop seats, and overhead bows with a tarpaulin were standard. A front mounted winch was optional.

The standard body sides could secure a load but could not be loaded from the side by forklifts, so a body with drop sides was standardized as the M813A1.

The M814, with an extra long wheelbase, had a {{convert|20|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long box. There was no drop side version of the M814, and none had troop seats.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=192-200}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|pp=1.12-1.13, 2.102-2.105, 2.216-2.221}}

=== M815 [[Logging truck|Bolster Logging Truck]] ===
[[File:M815 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M815 Bolster Logging Truck]]
The M815, with the M796 bolster trailer, was used to carry long loads like logs, poles, pipes, and bridge sections. The front of the load was secured to a rotating bolster on the truck and the rear of the load was secured to the trailer. The truck and trailer had a tubular boom (&quot;reach&quot;) that connected them under the load. When the truck was unloaded the trailer could be loaded onto the truck. The truck had a large cab protection rack and both front and mid mounted winches.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|p=1.14, 2.106-2.116}}

=== M816 [[Tow truck|Medium Wrecker Truck]] ===
[[File:M816 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M816 Medium Wrecker Truck]]
The M816 was used to [[Vehicle recovery|recover disabled or stuck trucks]] and lift large components. A rotating, telescoping, and elevating hydraulic boom could lift a maximum of {{convert|20,000|lb|abbr=on}}. Although the truck was not meant to carry a load, the boom could support {{convert|7,000|lb|abbr=on}} when towing. They had {{convert|20,000|lb|abbr=on}} front and {{convert|45,000|lb|abbr=on}} rear winches, outriggers, boom braces, chocks, block and tackle, oxygen-acetylene torches, and other automotive tools.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|p=1.15, 2.117-2.129, 2.150-2.160}}

=== M817 [[Dump Truck]] ===
[[File:M817 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M817 Dump Truck]]
The M817 was used to haul sand, gravel, dirt, rubble, scrap, and other bulk materials. It had a {{convert|5|cuyd|m3}} dump body with cab protector and a tailgate that could hinge at either the top or bottom. Normal loads are heavy by volume, the dump body was smaller and more heavily built than a cargo body. They could be equipped with overhead bows, tarpaulin, and troop seats, but the relatively small size of the body limited their passenger or cargo load.
{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=360-366}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|p=1.16, 2.130-2.143}}

=== M818 [[Tractor unit|Tractor Trucks]] ===
[[File:M818 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M818 Tractor Truck]]
Tractor trucks were used to tow [[semi-trailer]]s up to {{convert|37,500|lb|abbr=on}} with {{convert|15,000|lb|abbr=on}} on their fifth wheel. Semi-tractor/trailers have to stay on relatively flat ground, and are not rated for full off-road use. On improved roads they could tow up to {{convert|55,000|lb|abbr=on}} with {{convert|25,000|lb|abbr=on}} on their fifth wheel.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|p=1.17, 2.144-2.149}}

The M818 normally towed a 12-ton 2 axle trailer. There were stake and platform, van, low-bed, and tanker bodies. 6-ton 2 axle expansible vans and 6-ton single axle vans were also used.{{sfnp|TM 9-2330-27-14|1988|pp=1-9, 1-11}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2330-238-14|1988|p=1-32}}

=== M819 Medium Wrecker Tractor Truck ===
[[File:M819 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M819 Wrecker Tractor Truck]]
The M819, with an extra long wheelbase, was a wrecker with a fifth wheel mounted behind the boom. This let the truck load and tow semi trailers. Meant for aircraft recovery, they had a smaller body and less equipment than the M816.

All had a front winch, the fifth wheel replaced the rear winch. As a wrecker the boom could lift up to {{convert|20,000|lb|abbr=on}}, and had a longer reach than the M816. As a tractor the fifth wheel load rating was {{convert|15,000|lb|abbr=on}}. Because of the high empty weight as a semi tractor, oversize 12.00x20 tires were used, this was the only model to have this size.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=192-200}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|p=1.18, 2.144-2.149, 2.163-2.173}}

=== M820 Expansible Van Truck ===
[[File:M820 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M820 Expansible Van Truck]]
The M820 had a {{convert|17|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long van body with a slide out section on each side. When the sections are extended the working floor was almost {{convert|14|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wide. The body could support {{convert|5,000|lb|abbr=on}} of communications equipment. Heaters and air-conditioners (except the M820A1) were housed above the cab. The M820A1 had no windows or air-conditioning, the M820A3 and M820A4 had a hydraulic rear lift gate. None had a front mounted winch.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|pp=1.19-1.20, 2.173-2.188}}

=== M821 Bridge Transporting Stake Truck ===
[[File:M821 fr 260-10.jpg|thumb|right|M821 Bridge Transporting Stake Truck]]
The M821 had a {{convert|20|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long body for carrying bridging equipment and components. They had a roller on the rear to help unloading and small winches on the side to secure cargo. The stake sides could be removed to carry oversize loads. The largest tires in the series, 14.00x20, were used with dual rear tires.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-260-10|1988|p=1.21, 2.189-2.198}}
