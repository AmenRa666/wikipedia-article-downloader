'''Garnet Francis Malley''', [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (2 November 1892&amp;nbsp;– 20 May 1961) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&amp;nbsp;I, credited with six aerial victories. He was an aviation adviser to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government in China during the 1930s, and an intelligence officer in World War&amp;nbsp;II.

Born in [[Sydney]], Malley first saw service in World War&amp;nbsp;I as an artilleryman with the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. He transferred to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in 1917, and the following year flew [[Sopwith Camel]]s with [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Malley was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his achievements in combat, and his subsequent work as a flying instructor in England earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]].

After a spell in civilian life following the war, Malley joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1925, serving with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]]. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and worked closely with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, [[Soong Mei-ling]], from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.

==Early life==
Garnet Francis Malley, the second youngest of six children of Clara Ellen Merritt and Francis Malley, was born in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], on 2&amp;nbsp;November 1892. His father, an ironworker originally from [[Gosford]], founded the [[Major appliance|whitegoods]] firm Malley's.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Chris|title=Malley, Garnet Francis (1892–1961)|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150344b.htm |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher = Australian National University|location = Canberra|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16921965 |title=Mr. Francis Malley |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| date=29 June 1932 |accessdate=22 July 2014 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later served two terms as [[alderman]] of [[Municipality of Mosman|Mosman Council]].&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/file_download/2641/1-MOSMAN+COUNCIL+ALDERMEN.doc.pdf|title=Mosman Council Aldermen|publisher=Mosman Council|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garnet Malley attended the Church of England Preparatory School in Mosman, [[The School, Mount Victoria|The School]] in [[Mount Victoria, New South Wales|Mount Victoria]], and [[Hawkesbury Agricultural College]] in [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]].

{{quote|Lt. (T./Capt.) Garnet Francis Malley, Aust. F.C., attd. R.F.C.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When on offensive and low-flying patrol he attacked one of two hostile scouts, which eventually turned over and fell out of control, being seen to crash by another pilot. Later, a general engagement ensued with four enemy scouts, one of which he attacked, with the result that it fell completely out of control and crashed. Prior to this occasion he had also shot down out of control another hostile machine. His courage and able leadership have resulted in his patrol carrying out excellent work under the most adverse conditions.}}

Malley took temporary command of No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron at the end of June 1918, overseeing its move from [[Clairmarais|Clairmarais North]] to a new airfield at [[Reclinghem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2007/12/05/captain-e-j-mccloughry-dso-dfc-mid-no-4-squadron-afc/|title=Captain E.

He was by now serving as adviser to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, [[Soong Mei-ling]], in her capacity as secretary-general of the aeronautical commission that directed [[Republic of China Air Force|China's air force]]; May-Ling extended to Malley her &quot;warmest congratulations&quot; for his &quot;well deserved&quot; promotion.&lt;ref name=APSC13&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection&quot;, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tasks she assigned him was investigating corrupt procurement practices in the government.

| quote=...&amp;nbsp;in attempting to evaluate his role and importance&amp;nbsp;– both within the Australian aviation scene but more particularly the decade he spent in China&amp;nbsp;... it is plainly inappropriate to dismiss or discount his contribution; yet equally it is not possible to verify all that he claimed, and therefore to attach the same weight or significance as he did in assessing his impact and influence.

Malley's stay increasingly involved him in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|fighting in China]]; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH-19400917&quot; /&gt; In May 1938, he advised the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice-Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]]: &quot;there is a first-class war on here, which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes&quot;.&lt;ref name=APSC14&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection&quot;, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and other members of the RAAF may, however, have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects.&lt;ref name=Third448&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 448–450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APSC15&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection&quot;, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; In one letter, he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country, declaring: &quot;I&amp;nbsp;... can just imagine how much you would have enjoyed it&amp;nbsp;– landing on aerodromes that were all polished up for inspection. Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained. I had to drink every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made, and to eat foods unheard of in Australia!&quot;&lt;ref name=APSC15/&gt; At any rate, Malley's reports of Japanese air tactics, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.&lt;ref name=Third448/&gt;&lt;ref name=APSC15/&gt;

==World War II and later life==
Malley was recalled to Australia in July 1940, departing China with a note of thanks from May-Ling for his &quot;loyal service&quot; before rejoining the RAAF on active service as a squadron leader in October.&lt;ref name=APSC17&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection&quot;, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Air Force representative at the Combined Operational Intelligence Centre (COIC), Melbourne, a [[Australian Defence Force|tri-service]] organisation responsible for intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination.&lt;ref name=RAN&gt;Gill, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070347--1-.PDF ''Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 420–421]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s, Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures; it became evident in the wake of the [[Bombing of Darwin|attack on Darwin]] in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/admin/productfiles/publication/materials/476/pathfinder_171_feb12small.pdf|title=The bombing of Darwin 19 February 1942&amp;nbsp;– the RAAF experience|work=Pathfinder|date=February 2012|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|location=Canberra|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APSC18&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection&quot;, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; COIC primarily handled naval intelligence, so Army and Air Force participation was part-time initially. By April 1941, Malley had been assigned a full-time role, and the RAAF was maintaining a round-the-clock presence.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941, and two months later succeeded Commander [[Rupert Long]] as Director of COIC.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Malley was raised to acting [[group captain]] on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1942, but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=APSC17/&gt; He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9&amp;nbsp;June 1943.&lt;ref name=APSC17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&amp;VeteranId=1056413|title=Malley, Garnet Francis|work=World War Two Nominal Roll|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Douglas MacArthur]] praised Malley for his &quot;foresight, planning, and organizational ability&quot;.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; The former aviator went on to work as officer-in-charge of the Chinese section at the [[Commonwealth Police|Commonwealth Security Service]] in [[Canberra]] from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=APSC19/&gt;

In 1948, Malley's war service was recognised by the United States with the award of the [[Legion of Merit]]. By 1949, he had procured a yacht, the ''Royal Flight'', which was used as a setting in the film ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1949 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]''.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; The following year, the family bought a coconut plantation on [[Vanua Balavu]], Fiji.&lt;ref name=APSC19&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection&quot;, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1951, Malley and his wife toured the world, visiting [[Algiers]], [[Guadaloupe]], [[Curaçao]], [[Martinique]], and [[Tahiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 30 September 1951|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/28670979 |title=Social news and gossip |accessdate=20 February 2014|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently returned to live on their Fijian plantation, and rode out the [[1953 Suva earthquake|1953 Suva earthquake and tidal wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 17 December 1953|url= http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/18401581|title=Sydney's talking about— |accessdate=20 February 2014|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garnet Malley died of a heart attack on 20&amp;nbsp;May 1961. Survived by his wife and son, he was buried at sea in an Anglican ceremony.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; The commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Air Force|Taiwanese air force]] sent condolences, paying tribute to the &quot;invaluable&quot; contribution Malley had made during his decade in China, which would &quot;be long remembered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, &quot;Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection&quot;, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
