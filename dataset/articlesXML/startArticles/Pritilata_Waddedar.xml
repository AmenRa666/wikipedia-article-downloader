== Early life ==
[[File:MatriculationPritilata.jpg|thumb|left|Matriculation examination certificate of Pritilata]]

Pritilata was born in a middle-class Vaidya-Brahmin family on 5 May 1911&lt;ref name=&quot;A fearless female freedom-fighter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=A fearless female freedom-fighter |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2004/09/05/switch.htm |work=Rising Stars |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Dhalghat village in Patiya ''upazila'' of [[Chittagong]] (now in Bangladesh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pritilata's birth anniversary observed at CU |url=http://archive.is/PkCfK |newspaper=New Age |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father Jagabandhu Waddedar was a clerk in the Chittagong Municipality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritilata Waddedar (1911-1932)&quot; /&gt; Her mother Pratibhamayi Devi was a housewife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agnijuger Agnikanya Pritilata&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=5 May 2011 |title=Agnijuger Agnikanya Pritilata |url=http://blog.bdnews24.com/ruman11/15681 |newspaper=BDNews |language=bn |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had six children– Madhusduan, Pritilata, Kanaklata, Shantilata, Ashalata and Santosh. Pritilata was nicknamed Rani.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agnijuger Agnikanya Pritilata&quot; /&gt; ''Waddedar'' was a title conferred to an ancestor of the family who originally had the surname Dasgupta.

Jagabandhu tried to arrange best possible education for their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fire-Brand Woman Of Indian Freedom Struggle.&quot; /&gt; He got Pritilata admitted in [[Dr. Khastagir Government Girls' School]] of Chittagong. Pritilata was a meritorious student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pritilata|year=2008|publisher=Prometheus er pothe|page=15|language=Bengali}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher in the school, whom students affectionately used called ''Usha Di'', used stories of [[Rani Lakshmibai]] to inspire nationalism in her students. [[Kalpana Datta]], a classmate of Pritilata, writes in the biography ''Chittagong Armoury Raiders''– &quot;We had no clear idea in our school days about our future. Then the Rani of Jhansi fired our imagination with her example.

In the Intermediate examinations, she stood first among all students who appeared in that year's examination from the Dhaka Board.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fire-Brand Woman Of Indian Freedom Struggle.&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.towardsfreedom.in/site/Pritilata_Waddedar |title=The Fire-Brand Woman Of Indian Freedom Struggle. |publisher=Towards Freedom |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student in Eden College, she participated in various social activities. She joined the group ''Sree Sangha'', headed by [[Leela Nag]], under the banner ''Dipali Sangha''.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Amin |first=Sonia |year=2012 |chapter=Waddedar, Pritilata |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Waddedar,_Pritilata |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Calcutta ===
To pursue higher education, Pritilata went to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and got admitted to the [[Bethune College]]. Two years later, she graduated in Philosophy from the college with a distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. S. Shashi |year=1996 |title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv0vAQAAIAAJ |publisher=Anmol Publications |page=135 |isbn=978-81-7041-859-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her degree was withheld by British authorities at [[Calcutta University]]. In 2012, she (and [[Bina Das]]) were conferred their certificates of merit posthumously.&lt;ref name=&quot;After 80 yrs, posthumous degrees for revolutionaries&quot; /&gt;

=== As a school teacher ===
After completing her education in Calcutta, Pritilata returned to Chittagong. In Chittagong, she took up the job of headmistress at a local English medium secondary school called Nandankanan Aparnacharan School.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fire-Brand Woman Of Indian Freedom Struggle.&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 January 2009 |title=CCC plans to house 2 girls' schools in commercial complex |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=73697 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary activities ==

=== Joining Surya Sen's revolutionary group ===
{{quote box |quote = &quot;Pritilata was young and courageous. She would work with a lot of zeal and was determined to drive the British away.&quot;
 |source =Binod Bihari Chowdhury, a contemporary revolutionary&lt;ref name=&quot;A Long Walk to Freedom&quot; /&gt; |align = right |width = 35% |border =
 |fontsize =  |bgcolor = #c6dbf7}}
Pritilata decided to join the Indian independence movement. Surya Sen had heard about her and wanted her to join their revolutionary group.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Long Walk to Freedom&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=A Long Walk to Freedom |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2010/02/03/cover.htm |work=Star Weekend Magazine |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 1932, Pritilata met Surya Sen and Nirmal Sen in their Dhalghat camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agnijuger Agnikanya Pritilata&quot; /&gt; A contemporary revolutionary, Binod Bihari Chowdhury, objected that they did not allow women to join their group. However, Pritalata was allowed to join the group because the revolutionaries reasoned that women transporting weapons would not attract as much suspicion as men.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Long Walk to Freedom&quot; /&gt;

=== Inspiration from Ramkrishna Biswas ===
Surya Sen and his revolutionary group decided to kill Mr. Craig, Inspector General of Chittagong. Ramakrishna Biswas and Kalipada Chakravarty were assigned for this task. But they mistakenly killed SP of Chandpur and Traini Mukherjee instead of Craig. Ramakrishna Biswas and Kalipada Chakravarty were arrested on 2 December 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reva Chatterjee |year=2000 |title=Netaji Subhas Bose |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Dw3W9ubLkC&amp;pg=RA2-PT151 |publisher=Ocean Books |pages=2– |isbn=978-81-87100-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the trial Biswas was ordered to be hanged till death and Chakravarty to be [[exile]]d to [[Cellular Jail]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sonali Swapno&quot; /&gt;

The family and friends lacked the amount of money required to travel to Chittagong to Alipore Jail of Calcutta. Since at that time Pritilata was staying in Kolkata, she was asked to go to [[Alipore Jail]] and meet Ramkrishna Biswas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sonali Swapno&quot; /&gt;

=== Activities in Surya Sen's group ===
Along with the revolutionary group of Surya Sen, Pritilata took part in many raids like attacks on the Telephone &amp; Telegraph offices&lt;ref name=&quot;A fearless female freedom-fighter&quot; /&gt; and the capture of the reserve police line. In the Jalalabad battle, she took the responsibility to supply explosives to the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritilata Waddedar (1911-1932)&quot; /&gt;

== Pahartali European Club attack (1932) ==
[[File:Euclub.jpg|thumb|The Pahartali European Club (shown here in 2010) was torched by the group of revolutionaries]]
In 1932, Surya Sen planned to attack the Pahartali European Club which had a signboard that read &quot;Dogs and Indians not allowed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=80th death anniversary of Pritilata observed |url=http://archive.is/Q2Mka |newspaper=News Age |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surya Sen decided to appoint a woman leader for this mission. Kalpana Datta was arrested seven days before the event. Because of this, Pritilata was assigned the leadership of the attack. Pritilata went to Kotowali Sea Side for arms training and made the plan of their attack there.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fire-Brand Woman Of Indian Freedom Struggle.&quot; /&gt;

They decided to attack the club on 23 September 1932. The members of the group were given [[potassium cyanide]] and were told to swallow it if they were caught.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt;

On the day of the attack, Pritilata dressed herself as a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] male. Her associates Kalishankar Dey, Bireshwar Roy, Prafulla Das, Shanti Chakraborty wore ''[[dhoti]]'' and shirt. Mahendra Chowdhury, Sushil Dey and Panna Sen wore ''[[lungi]]'' and shirt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sonali Swapno&quot; /&gt;

They reached the club at around 10:45 PM and launched their attack. There were around 40 people inside the club then. The revolutionaries divided themselves into three separate groups for the attack. In the club, a few police officers who had revolvers started shooting. Pritilata incurred a single bullet wound. According to the police report, in this attack, one woman with a surname of Sullivan died and four men and seven women were injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sonali Swapno&quot; /&gt;

== Death ==
[[File:EuclubattackFolok.jpg|thumb|In this place Pritilata committed suicide. Now there is a plaque in her memory]]
An injured Pritilata was trapped by the British police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritilata Waddedar (1911-1932)&quot; /&gt; She swallowed cyanide to avoid getting arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Long Walk to Freedom&quot; /&gt; The next day, the police found her body and identified her. On searching her dead body, the police found a few leaflets, photograph of Ramkrishna Biswas, bullets, whistle and the draft of their plan of attack. During the [[post-mortem]] it was found that the bullet injury was not very serious and that cyanide poisoning was the cause of her death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sonali Swapno&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pal|first=Rupamay|title=Surjo Sener Sonali Swapno|year=1986|publisher=Deepayan|location=Kolkata|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief secretary of Bengal sent a report to British authorities in London. In the report it was written–&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fortnightly Reports on Bengal, for the second half of September 1932, GOI Home Poll No. 18/1932 |year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;!-- may be from Do and Die: the Chittagong uprising, 1930-34 --&gt;
{{quote|Pritilata had been closely associated with, if not actually the mistress of, the terrorist Biswas who was hanged for the murder of Inspector Tarini Mukherjee, and some reports indicate that she was the wife of Nirmal Sen who was killed while attempting to evade arrest of Dhalghat, where Captain Cameron fell.}}
