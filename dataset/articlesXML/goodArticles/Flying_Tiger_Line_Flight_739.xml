'''Flying Tiger Line Flight 739''' was a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Lockheed Constellation|L-1049 Super Constellation]] [[propliner]] chartered by the [[United States]] military that disappeared on March 16, 1962, over the Western [[Pacific Ocean]]. The aircraft was transporting 93 [[United States Army|US soldiers]] and 3 [[South Vietnam]]ese from [[Travis Air Force Base]], California to [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], Vietnam. After refueling at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]], the Super Constellation was en route to [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Philippines]] when it disappeared. All 107 aboard were declared missing and presumed dead.

The airliner's disappearance prompted one of the largest air and sea searches in the history of the Pacific. Aircraft and surface ships from four branches of the US military searched more than {{convert|200000|sqmi}} during the course of eight days. A civilian tanker observed what appeared to be an in-flight explosion believed to be the missing Super Constellation, though no trace of wreckage or debris was ever recovered. The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] determined that, based on the tanker's observations, Flight 739 probably exploded in-flight, though an exact cause could not be determined without examining the remnants of the aircraft.

To date, this remains the worst aviation accident involving the Lockheed Constellation series.

== Flight ==
The aircraft was a 5-year-old [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation]] with a total of 17,224 airframe hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;asn&quot;&gt;{{ASN accident|id=19620315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It carried 11 American civilian crew members and 96 military passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentinel-1962-3-16&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The flight originated from Travis Air Force Base, California, and was destined for Saigon. There were four planned refueling stops: [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]; [[Wake Island]]; Guam; and Clark Air Base, Philippines. The flight arrived at Guam at 11:14 GMT after being delayed for minor maintenance on engines numbers 1 and 3 at Honolulu, and later at Wake Island. The aircraft departed from Guam at 12:57 GMT with an estimated time of arrival at the Philippines at 19:16 GMT.&lt;ref name=&quot;asn&quot; /&gt; The Super Constellation carried nine hours of fuel for the {{convert|1600|mi|km}}, 8-hour flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;star-1962-3-16&quot; &gt;{{cite news

Eighty minutes after departure, at 14:22 GMT, the pilot radioed a routine message and gave his position as being 280 miles west of Guam at coordinates ({{coord|13|40|N|140|0|E|display=inline}}). The aircraft was expected to reach {{coord|14|00|N|135|0|E|display=inline}} at 15:30. At that time, the Guam IFSS experienced temporary communication difficulties with heavy radio static. At 15:39 the Guam radio operator attempted to contact the flight for a position report but was unable to establish contact. The aircraft was not seen or heard from again.&lt;ref name=&quot;asn&quot; /&gt;

== Investigation ==
The Clark Field Rescue Coordinating Center declared the aircraft missing the morning of 16 March 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;star-1962-3-16&quot; /&gt; Navy officials reported that they believed that the aircraft had crashed closer to Guam than the Philippines. At the time of the disappearance, the weather was clear and the sea calm.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentinel-1962-3-16&quot; /&gt; The Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marines ordered aircraft and ships to the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;star-1962-3-16&quot; /&gt;

The first day of searching continued overnight. During the first two days of the search, vessels crisscrossed {{convert|75000|sqmi|km2}} of ocean. Secretary of the Army [[Elvis Jacob Stahr, Jr.|Elvis Stahr]] told newspapers that &quot;[w]e have not given up hope that it will be found and that those aboard are safe,&quot; and that a &quot;maximum effort&quot; was being made.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentinel-1962-3-17&quot; /&gt; After four days of searching, [[Major General]] [[Theodore R. Milton]] of the [[Thirteenth Air Force|13th Air Force]] told newspapers that although the chance of finding survivors was doubtful, every effort would be made &quot;as long as there is any hope at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle-1962-3-19&quot; &gt;{{cite news

Search efforts included aircraft from Guam, Clark Field, the US 7th Fleet, and the Air Force at [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. Additionally surface ships and aircraft from numerous U.S. bases in the western Pacific contributed to the search efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;star-1962-3-16&quot; /&gt;

After eight days, the search was called off. The search, which was at the time one of the largest to ever take place in the Pacific, had covered more than {{convert|200000|sqmi}} of ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;guard-1962-3-23&quot;&gt;{{cite news

=== Conspiracy theories ===
Flight 739 was one of two Flying Tiger Line flights with military connections that were destroyed under similar circumstances on the same day. This led to suggestions of sabotage and conspiracy by both airline officials and the media.

Both Flight 739 and the other aircraft, a L-1049 Super Constellation, departed from Travis Air Force Base at around 09:45 PST on Wednesday 14 March 1962 and both encountered difficulties several hours later.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-1962-3-16&quot; /&gt; The other aircraft was carrying &quot;secret military cargo&quot; when it crashed in the [[Aleutian Islands]] and caught fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentinel-1962-3-17&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-1962-3-16&quot;/&gt;

Flying Tiger Lines released a statement outlining some possible reasons for the two occurrences, including sabotage of either or both aircraft, and kidnapping of Flight 739 and its passengers. The airline also said that these were merely &quot;wild guesses&quot; and that there was no evidence to support either theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentinel-1962-3-17&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-1962-3-16&quot;&gt;{{cite news

=== Possibility of sabotage ===
A [[Liberia]]n tanker, the SS ''T L  Linzen'', reported seeing a bright light in the sky near the aircraft's expected position about 90 minutes after the last radio contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;banner-1962-3-19&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}} ([http://theflightpath.wordpress.com/2009/11/15/sabotage-seen-as-possibility-in-lost-plane/ plaintext])&lt;/ref&gt; US military officials described it as being a “bright light strong enough to light a ship’s decks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;register-1962-3-19&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;banner-1962-3-19&quot; /&gt; The ''[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]'' reported that the tanker observed a flash of light approximately {{convert|500|mi}} west of Guam, followed immediately by two red lights falling to the ocean at different speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle-1962-3-19&quot; /&gt;

A [[United States government role in civil aviation#Civil Aeronautics Authority|Civil Aeronautics Board]] investigation determined that witnesses aboard the tanker also observed what appeared to be vapor trails, and numerous crew members observed the two fireballs fall into the ocean. The tanker proceeded to the location where the fireballs had been observed to impact the ocean but was unable to find any trace of the falling objects during their six-hour search.&lt;ref name=&quot;cab&quot; /&gt; A spokesman at the rescue effort headquarters in Guam said that as time passed with no sign of the aircraft, &quot;more credence is given to the possibility that the tanker may have seen the missing aircraft explode in flight.”&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle-1962-3-19&quot; /&gt;

Officials with the Flying Tiger Line said that if the investigation revealed that an explosion had occurred on board the aircraft, it would support their earlier theories of sabotage. The executive vice president of operation told the Associated Press that experts considered it impossible for explosions to occur on the Super-Constellation in the course of normal operation. Additionally he claimed that there was nothing powerful enough aboard the aircraft to completely blow it apart, and that &quot;something violent must have happened.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle-1962-3-19&quot; /&gt;

The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that, given the observations of the tanker crew, the flight most likely exploded in midair. As no part of the wreckage was ever found, the CAB was unable to establish a determination of cause. The accident report concluded:

{{quote|A summation of all relevant factors tends to indicate that the aircraft was destroyed in flight. However, due to the lack of any substantiating evidence the Board is unable to state with any degree of certainty the exact fate of N 6921C.&lt;ref name=&quot;cab&quot; /&gt;}}
