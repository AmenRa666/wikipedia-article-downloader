'''Aviation in Indonesia''' serves as a critical means of [[Transportation in Indonesia|connecting]] the [[List of islands of Indonesia|thousands of islands]] throughout the [[Indonesian archipelago|archipelago]]. [[Indonesia]] is the largest archipelagic country in the world, extending {{convert|5120|km|0}} from east to west and {{convert|1760|km|0}} from north to south,&lt;ref&gt;Kuoni - Far East, A world of difference.

Between 2009 and 2014, the number of Indonesian air passengers increased from 27,421,235&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air transport, passengers carried, Indonesia 2009| work=The World Bank |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR?page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 94,504,086,&lt;ref name=&quot;TWB-ATPC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Data: Air transport, passengers carried | work=The World Bank | url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of over threefold.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWB-ATPC&quot;/&gt;

However, safety issues continue to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system the reputation of the least safe in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/safety-woeful-admits-air-chief/2007/11/02/1193619119848.html | title = Safety woeful, admits air chief | newspaper =''Sydney Morning Herald'' online | date = 2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, [[Southeast Asian haze|haze problems]] caused by plantation fires, and [[volcanic ash]] spewed by numerous area [[List of volcanoes in Indonesia|volcanoes]] that disrupts air transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tempo-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Tempo|author=Maria Yuniar| title= Deregulasi Penerbangan Picu Kepadatan Bandara |date=18 September 2013|url=http://bisnis.tempo.co/read/news/2013/09/18/090514430/deregulasi-penerbangan-picu-kepadatan-bandara|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Indonesia's costly haze problem | first=Karishma |last=Vaswani |date = 12 October 2015 | work = BBC News | url =http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34507457 |accessdate = 6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Indonesia volcanic ash causes new Bali airport closure | date = 12 July 2015 | work = BBC News | url =http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33473679 |accessdate = 26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, there are 22 commercial scheduled airlines that carry more than 30 passengers, and 32 commercial scheduled airlines that transport 30 or less passengers, as well as chartered airlines. [[Garuda Indonesia]] is the [[flag carrier]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;List AOC 121 &amp; 135 2&quot;/&gt;

The [[Indonesian Air Force]] has 34,930 personnel equipped with 224 aircraft, among them 110 combat aircraft. The Indonesian Air Force possesses and operates numerous military air bases and military airstrips across the archipelago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flightglobal&quot;/&gt;

The [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) has predicted that Indonesia will become the world's sixth largest air travel market by 2034.&lt;ref name=&quot;IATA&quot;/&gt; Around 270 million passengers are predicted to fly from and within Indonesia by 2034.&lt;ref name=&quot;IATA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing the Potential of Indonesia’s Aviation Sector |  issue=Press Release No.: 11 |date=12 March 2015 | first= Tony |last=Tyler |work= [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA)| url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2015-03-12-01.aspx|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air transit policy==
{{further|ASEAN Single Aviation Market}}
[[File:Filza IMG 3490-20140414-aviation-DPS-bombardier-garuda-1024px-03 (16826632726).jpg|thumb|right|[[Garuda Indonesia|Garuda Indonesia Explore]] and [[Indonesia AirAsia]] airplanes.]]
As a large country spanning over three timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia is not a participant of the [[International Air Services Transit Agreement]] (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' [[freedoms of the air]], unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, and the right to make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia relating to Air Services | date=7 February 2013 |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/ATNIF/2013/4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Indonesia is the largest aviation market in the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). However, Indonesia is not yet a full member of the [[ASEAN open sky agreement]], which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPSkies&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Asean on track for Open Skies policy |author1=Winnie Yeoh |author2=David Tan |author3=Oh Chin Eng |author4=Chong Kah Yuan |author5=The Star/ANN | newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date =19 March 2015 |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/03/19/asean-track-open-skies-policy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are [[Soekarno-Hatta International Airport|Jakarta]], [[Kuala Namu International Airport|Medan]], [[Ngurah Rai International Airport|Bali]], [[Juanda International Airport|Surabaya]] and [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport|Makassar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia| work= CAPA Centre for Aviation |url=http://centreforaviation.com/profiles/countries/indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  Protectionism Still Winning as Liberalization Stalls | first = Jennifer | last = Meszaros | date = 15 February 2016 | work = AIN online | url = http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-02-15/protectionism-still-winning-liberalization-stalls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to foreign carriers on domestic routes is disallowed, while international flights will be subject to bilateral agreements. To get around this policy, in order to operate within Indonesia, foreign airlines first have to own and operate an Indonesian-based airline. An example of this practice is [[Indonesia AirAsia]], a branch of Malaysian [[AirAsia]]; it previously operated as local airline Awair in 2004, before changed to Indonesia AirAsia in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AWAIR changes name to Indonesia AirAsia |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=1 December 2005 |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/12/01/awair-changes-name-indonesia-airasia.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107065234/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/12/01/awair-changes-name-indonesia-airasia.html |archivedate=2016-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Colonial era ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het eerste vliegtuig is geland op Oelin (27 km van Bandjermasin) Borneo TMnr 10014089.jpg|right|thumb|DC-2 at [[Syamsudin Noor Airport|Oelin]] airport near Banjarmasin in 1935]]
Aviation service was pioneered in the early 20th century in colonial [[Dutch East Indies]]. On 1 October 1924, [[KLM]] started its first intercontinental flight, connecting Amsterdam to Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]) in a [[Fokker F-VII]] airplane.&lt;ref name=&quot;KLM History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Milestones in KLM's History | website = KLM.com | url =http://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/history/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1929 KLM had started regularly scheduled service between Amsterdam and Batavia. The route connected Amsterdam to Marseille, Rome, Brindisi, Athens, Merza Matruh, Cairo, Gaza, Baghdad, Bushire, Lingeh, Ojask, Gwadar, Karachi, Jodhpur, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon, Bangkok, Alor Star, Medan, Palembang, and Batavia, and extended to Bandung. Until the outbreak of the Second World War, this was the world's longest-distance scheduled service.&lt;ref name=&quot;KLM History&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[KNILM|Koninklijke Nederlandsch-Indische Luchtvaart Maatschappij]]'' (KNILM) — the airline of the former Dutch East Indies — was established on 16 July 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALH-DEI&quot;&gt;{{cite web| work=Airline History |title=The Dutch East Indies |url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/RestofWorld/Dutch%20East%20Indies/Airlines.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first regular operations were between [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] – [[Bandung]], and Batavia – [[Semarang]], starting on 1 November 1928. The inaugural ceremony was held at Cililitan airport in Batavia (now [[Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport]]). The Batavia-Semarang flight was later extended to [[Surabaya]]. Gradually, the services were expanded to include other islands in the archipelago, namely [[Palembang]] and [[Medan]] in [[Sumatra]], [[Balikpapan]] and [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] in [[Kalimantan]], and [[Denpasar]] in [[Bali]]. Immediately before the [[Pacific War]], KNILM also created a network in the east of the East Indies archipelago, serving towns such as [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]]. For this purpose, amphibious aircraft such as the [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] [[Sikorsky S-42|S-42]] and [[Sikorsky S-43|S-43]] and the [[Grumman G-21 Goose|Grumman G-21]] seaplanes were used, due to the lack of airstrip facilities in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Womack&quot;&gt;{{cite book| page=71| title= The Allied Defense of the Malay Barrier, 1941–1942|first=Tom |last=Womack |publisher= McFarland |year=2015|isbn= 9781476622675 | url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=2J4hCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1930, KNILM began its first international flight to [[Singapore]]. In June 1937, several cities in the Dutch East Indies were visited by [[Amelia Earhart]] during her attempted [[circumnavigation]]. From Singapore, Earhart flew to Bandung, Surabaya, and Kupang before continuing her journey to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Amelia Earhart Museum| title=Bulletins: June 24, 1937, Amelia Proceeds|url=http://www.ameliaearhartmuseum.org/AmeliaEarhart/NewsClips/clip370615.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1938, KNILM began operations to [[Sydney]], stopping at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Cloncurry, Queensland|Cloncurry]], and [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]. KNILM did not fly to the [[Netherlands]], as the Amsterdam-Batavia weekly service was operated by KLM.

During the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Japanese attack of the Dutch East Indies]], KNILM was utilized for evacuation flights and transport of troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Womack&quot;/&gt; KNILM could not operate in East Indies because of World War II and the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian war for independence]], and disbanded completely on 1 August 1947. Its remaining assets were transferred to KLM, which created the ''[[KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf]]'' (Interinsular Service).&lt;ref name=&quot;ALH-DEI&quot;/&gt;

===Republic era===
[[File:Bouraq Indonesia Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (DC-9-82) MRD.jpg|thumb|A [[Bouraq Indonesia Airlines]] McDonnell Douglas MD-82]]
The Republic of Indonesia [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared its independence]] on 17 August 1945 and the [[Indonesian National Revolution|war of independence]] ensued. After enduring five years of war and securing [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference|recognition of Indonesian Independence]] in late 1949, the aviation service reopened for business. The ''KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf'' was nationalized by the Indonesian government in December 1949 as [[Garuda Indonesia]], the national airline of the republic, and began to operate air services in the Indonesian archipelago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casius&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casius|first1=Gerard| last2=Postma|first2=Thijs|title=40 jaar luchtvaart in Indië|language=Dutch|year=1986|publisher=Alkmaar|isbn=9060139445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Indonesian Republic, Garuda Indonesia dominated the air transport service in the country, connecting major cities in the archipelago. In 1956, the Garuda Indonesia operated its first [[hajj]] flight to [[Mecca]] with Convair aircraft, carrying 40 Indonesian pilgrims.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutGaruda&quot;/&gt; In 1963, the airline launched flights to [[Hong Kong]]. By the mid 1960s, the airline took delivery of its first [[DC-8|Douglas DC-8]] and grew beyond the Asian market, beginning scheduled flights to Amsterdam and [[Frankfurt]] via [[Colombo]], [[Bombay]], and [[Prague]]. [[Rome]] and [[Paris]] became the airline's third and fourth European destinations, with flights stopping in Bombay and [[Cairo]] to refuel. Flights to the [[People's Republic of China]] began that same year, with service to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] via [[Phnom Penh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutGaruda&quot;/&gt;

In 1962, the government-owned [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]] was established to serve ''penerbangan perintis'' (pioneer flights) with small aircraft to connect remote locations in the archipelago. The airline however, ceased its operations in February 2014 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Merpati Flights Grounded as Airline Struggles to Take Off Under Weight of Debt| newspaper=Jakarta Globe| url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/business/merpati-flights-grounded-as-airline-struggles-to-take-off-under-weight-of-debt/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Indonesia's private aviation service began to grow with the establishment of [[Tigerair Mandala|Mandala Airlines]], followed by [[Bouraq Indonesia Airlines|Bouraq]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kompas-Mandala&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Kompas|title=Jatuh, Bangun, dan Jatuh lagi Bisnis Mandala Air| author=Yoga Sukmana|date=20 June 2014| url=http://bisniskeuangan.kompas.com/read/2014/06/20/1350189/Jatuh.Bangun.dan.Jatuh.Lagi.Bisnis.Mandala.Air|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two airlines directly competed against the government-owned Garuda Indonesia and Merpati Nusantara airlines, and survived until the 2000s. The Bouraq ceased its operations in 2005. Mandala was bought by Singapore-based [[Tigerair|Tigerair Group]] in 2012, but Tigerair Mandala ceased its operation in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kompas-Mandala&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigerair Mandala|work=CAPA, Centre for Aviation|url=http://centreforaviation.com/profiles/airlines/tigerair-mandala-ri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garuda Indonesia Flight Attendants in Kebaya.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Garuda Indonesia flight attendants in traditional ''[[kebaya]]'' and ''kain [[batik]]''. The aviation industry serves a vital role in Indonesian hospitality and tourism service.]]
In 2000, the Indonesian government announced the aviation deregulation policy, which makes it easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company.&lt;ref name=&quot;RA-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Deregulasi Penerbangan Indonesia dan Akibatnya |date=31 January 2015 |work=Runway Aviation News |url=http://www.runway-aviation.com/deregulasi-penerbangan-indonesia-dan-akibatnya/ |language=Indonesian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111416/http://www.runway-aviation.com/deregulasi-penerbangan-indonesia-dan-akibatnya/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the country, as well as to serve and stimulate tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them [[Lion Air]] (est. 1999), [[Sriwijaya Air]] (est. 2003), [[Adam Air]] (operating from 2002 to 2008), and [[Batavia Air]] (operating from 2002 to 2013). The deregulation also spurred the [[low-cost carrier]] service in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tempo-1&quot;/&gt; Previously, air travel service was dominated by well-established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati.&lt;ref name=&quot;RA-1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Adam air break.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Adam Air Flight 172]].]]
Due to poor government control and supervision, however, aviation service deregulation provoked [[price war]]s among low-cost carriers, resulting in fierce commercial competition at the expense of poor maintenance and service breakdown.&lt;ref name=&quot;RA-1&quot;/&gt; Consequently, throughout the 2000s, the number of Indonesian aviation accidents and incidents spiked tremendously. The most notable aviation accidents that occurred during this period were [[Lion Air Flight 538]] in Surakarta (30 November 2004, killing 25) and the [[Adam Air Flight 574]] crash into the Makassar Strait (1 January 2007, killing 107). The aviation safety records in Indonesia continued to plummet in a series of flight accidents, including  [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 421]] emergency landing on the [[Bengawan Solo River]] (16 January 2002, killing 1 stewardess), and [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 200]] in Yogyakarta (7 March 2007, killing 21).&lt;ref name=&quot;RA-1&quot;/&gt;

In June 2007, the [[European Union]] banned Garuda Indonesia, along with all other Indonesian airlines, from flying into any European country due to poor safety records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Clark|first=Nicola|title=EU set to ban flights of Indonesia carriers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 June 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/28/world/europe/28iht-airlines.5.6398202.html|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Indonesian carriers banned from EU |agency=United Press International|date=28 June 2007|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2007/06/28/Indonesian-carriers-banned-from-EU/UPI-60861183048659/|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on Garuda Indonesia was lifted in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sukarsono, Achmad.

Retrieved 25 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2010s, the condition of Indonesian aviation began to improve compared to the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Kabar Bisnis|title=2010, bisnis penerbangan diperkirakan tumbuh 10% |date=12 December 2009| url=http://www.kabarbisnis.com/read/287953/2010--bisnis-penerbangan-diperkirakan-tumbuh-10--- |language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air travel incident rate in 2010 also dropped by 40% compared to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=Pikiran Rakyat | title=Tingkat Kecelekaan Pesawat Turun 40% |date= 31 October 2010 | url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/ekonomi/2010/10/31/125952/tingkat-kecelekaan-pesawat-turun-40 |language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, several accidents occurred in the ensuing period.

The most significant current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development and maintenance of air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas. Other significant problems include overcapacity; the massive surge of air travelers in recent years, prompted by the growth of low-cost carrier passengers, has put intense stress on the aging airport infrastructure in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tempo-1&quot;/&gt;

Indonesia possesses 673 airports in 2013, ranging from grand international airports to modest unpaved airstrips on remote islands or inland interior areas located throughout the archipelago.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-Airport&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IM-Air&quot;/&gt; In November 2011, Indonesia had more than 230 conventional airports, most of them operated by Transportation Ministry technical operation units and state-owned PT Angkasa Pura I &amp; II. Major airports are managed by [[Angkasa Pura]]; Angkasa Pura I operates 13 airports in Eastern Indonesia, while Angkasa Pura II operates 13 airports in Western Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angkasapura1.co.id/sejarah|title=Sejarah – Angkasa Pura – Airports|author=PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero)|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2000 aviation deregulation, Indonesian airports endured a surge of passengers, especially catalyzed by the advent of low-cost carriers. According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry, 9 of the 13 airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura I have exceeded their passenger capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tempo-1&quot;/&gt;

Jakarta's [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport]] serves as the country's main air transportation hub as well as the nation's busiest. Since 2010, it has become the [[List of the busiest airports in Asia|busiest airport in Southeast Asia]], surpassing [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport|Suvarnabhumi]] and [[Changi International Airport|Changi]] airports. In May 2014, it became the eighth busiest airport in the world with 62.1 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/05/22/056579611/More-Flights-for-Soekarno-Hatta-Airport |title=More Flights for Soekarno–Hatta Airport |date=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the busiest airport in the Southern Hemisphere. In October 2015, the airport is named as Asia's largest megahub, and ranked the 17th most-connected airport in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Soekarno-Hatta airport named Asia's largest megahub |newspaper=The Jakarta Post|location=Jakarta | date= 6 October 2015 |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/10/06/soekarno-hatta-airport-named-asias-largest-megahub.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surge of air travellers, catalyzed by low-cost carriers and the rise of air-transport demands among Indonesia's rising middle class, has put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities, such as the construction of Medan's brand-new [[Kuala Namu International Airport|Kuala Namu Airport]] to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and accident-prone [[Polonia Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SBY launches the country’s most modern airport|author1=Nadya Natahadibrata  |author2=Apriadi Gunawan  |lastauthoramp=yes |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=March 28, 2014 |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/03/28/sby-launches-country-s-most-modern-airport.html |accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other newly built airports include [[Lombok International Airport|Lombok Airport]], replacing the old [[Selaparang Airport]] in [[Lombok]]; and [[Minangkabau International Airport|Minangkabau Airport]], replacing the old [[Tabing Airport]] in [[Padang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Minangkabau International Airport| work=Minangkabau International Airport | url=http://minangkabau-airport.co.id/en/general/about-us  |accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include [[Ngurah Rai International Airport|Ngurah Rai Airport]] in Bali,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is the new Ngurah Rai airport in Bali as stylish as was expected? |author=Raditya Margi |newspaper=The Jakarta Post Travel |date=December 10, 2013 |url=http://www.jakpost.travel/news/is-the-new-ngurah-rai-airport-in-bali-as-stylish-as-was-expected-6EtdXnoC1RbTUFif.html |accessdate=14 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222161522/http://www.jakpost.travel/news/is-the-new-ngurah-rai-airport-in-bali-as-stylish-as-was-expected-6EtdXnoC1RbTUFif.html |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juanda International Airport|Juanda Airport]] in Surabaya, and [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport|Sultan Hasanuddin Airport]] in [[Makassar]].

[[File:Merpati Nusantara Airtech CN-235-10 Wallner.jpg|thumb|right|[[Merpati Nusantara]]'s [[CN-235]].]]
PT. Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio was officially established in Bandung in 1976 as a state-owned aircraft manufacturer company. It was expanded from a research and industrial facility under the auspices of the Indonesian Air Force, namely ''Lembaga Industri Penerbangan Nurtanio'' (LIPNUR). [[Jusuf Habibie|Dr. BJ. Habibie]] was appointed as the President Director, and he has developed the company capability as an aircraft manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us: Our History | work= PT Dirgantara Indonesia (Persero)| url=http://www.indonesian-aerospace.com/aboutus.php?m=aboutus&amp;t=aboutus8 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 the company's name changed to ''Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara'' (IPTN). In 2000 the company assumed its new name as Indonesian Aerospace (IAe) ({{lang-id|PT. Dirgantara Indonesia}} (DI)). Its notable product is [[CASA/IPTN CN-235|CN-235]] civil, military, and maritime version (joint development with [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA|CASA]] Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garudamiliter.blogspot.com/2013/03/cn-235-tni-versi-winglet.html |title=CN-235 TNI versi Winglet |date=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garudamiliter.blogspot.com/2013/04/cn-235-persuader-maritime-patrol.html |title=CN-235 Persuader Maritime Patrol Aircraft |date=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian aircraft manufacture industry took the hardest hit during [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. Many of its projects, such as [[Indonesian Aerospace N-250|N-250]] were discontinued for a certain period due to financial constraints. Nevertheless, other projects such as [[Indonesian Aerospace N-219|N-219]] are being restarted and continued to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Development Project N219 Aircraft | work= PT Dirgantara Indonesia (Persero)| url=http://www.indonesian-aerospace.com/aboutus.php?m=aboutus&amp;t=company |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
