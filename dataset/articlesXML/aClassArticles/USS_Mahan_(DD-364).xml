'''USS ''Mahan'' (DD-364)''' was the [[lead ship]] of the [[United States Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer}}s. The ship was named for Rear Admiral [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], a 19th-century naval historian and strategic theorist. Her design ushered in major advances over traditional destroyers. Among them were a third set of quadruple [[torpedo tubes]], protective gun shelters, and [[Emergency power system|emergency diesel generators]].  Along with a steam [[propulsion]] system that was simpler and more efficient to operate.

''Mahan'' began her service in 1936. She was first assigned to the [[US Atlantic Fleet]] and then transferred to [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1937. When the Japanese [[attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Mahan'' was at sea with Task Force 12.  The task force's mission to [[Midway Island]] was aborted to participate in the post-attack search for the enemy strike force. Unable to locate it, the task force returned to Pearl Harbor.

Early in World War II, ''Mahan'' took part in raids on the [[Marshall Islands|Marshall]] and [[Gilbert Islands]]. In the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], Admirals [[Chester Nimitz]] and [[William Halsey]] commended the destroyer group (of which ''Mahan'' was a member) for a stellar effort in screening the [[aircraft carrier]]s {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}} against heavy odds.  During the [[New Guinea campaign]] to take the northeast coast from the Japanese, ''Mahan''  was engaged in the  [[amphibious landings]] at [[Salamaua]], [[Lae]], and [[Finschhafen]].  She participated in landings at [[Arawe]] and Borgen Bay (near [[Cape Gloucester]]), [[New Britain]], and provided support for the troop landing at [[Los Negros Island]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]].

Late in the [[Pacific War]], the Japanese [[kamikaze]] relentlessly plagued US Naval operations. On 7 December 1944, a group of suicide aircraft overwhelmed and disabled ''Mahan'' at [[Ormoc Bay]], [[Leyte]], in the [[Philippine Islands]].  On fire and exploding, the ship was abandoned, and a US destroyer sank her with torpedoes and gunfire.

==Characteristics==
''Mahan'' displaced {{convert|1500|LT|t|0}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship's [[length overall|overall length]] was {{convert|341|ft|3|in|m|1}}, the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}} and her [[draft (hull)|draft]] was {{convert|10|ft|7|in|m|1}}. She was powered by two [[General Electric]] [[gear]]ed [[steam turbine]]s that developed a total of  {{convert|46000|shp|lk=in}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}}.  Four [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] or four [[Foster Wheeler]] [[water-tube boiler]]s generated the [[superheated steam]] needed for the turbines. ''Mahan'' carried a maximum of {{convert|523|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], with a range of {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. Her peacetime complement was 158 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 465&quot;&gt;Friedman p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; The wartime complement increased to approximately 250 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mahan'' had a tripod [[foremast]] and a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft [[Field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], the tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;&gt;Friedman p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In silhouette, the ship was similar to the larger {{sclass|Porter|destroyer|4}} that immediately preceded her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reilly p. 28&quot;&gt;Reilly p.28&lt;/ref&gt;  She was fitted with the first emergency diesel generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier destroyers. Gun crew shelters were built fore and aft for the superimposed weapons.
A third quadruple set of torpedo tubes was added, with one mount on the centerline and two in the side positions. This required relocating one [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|5 inch/38 caliber gun]] to the aft deckhouse.  ''Mahan'' incorporated a new generation of land-based steam propulsion machinery. With boiler pressures increasing to 600 PSI (pounds per square inch), and high-pressure [[turbines]] that had double reduction gears, which ran faster and more efficient than that of her predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;/&gt;

==Armament==
[[File:USS Mahan 24 June 1944.jpg|thumb|''Mahan'' undergoing overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 24 June 1944, with her forward 5 inch/38 caliber guns in full view.|alt=Overhead closeup of the ship's forward superstructure, which bristles with guns, radar arrays, and other equipment]]
The main battery of ''Mahan'' consisted of five 5 inch/38 caliber guns, equipped with the Mark 33  [[ship gun fire-control system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 465&quot;/&gt; Each gun was [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]], configured for surface and aerial targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;/&gt; Her [[anti-aircraft]] battery originally had four water-cooled [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges and Friedman p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was fitted with three quadruple torpedo-tube mounts for twelve 21-inch torpedoes, guided by the Mark 27 torpedo fire-control system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 465&quot;/&gt; [[Depth charge]] roll-off racks were rigged on the stern of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942, the ''Mahan''-class destroyers began a wartime armament refitting process, but most of the class was not fully refitted until 1944. ''Mahan'' was refitted in June 1944 at the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodges and Friedman p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The notable refits to the ''Mahan''-class included the removal of one 5 inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin [[Bofors 40 mm guns]] and five [[20 mm Oerlikon]] guns.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
''Mahan'' was built by United Dry Docks (successor to the [[Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company]]) in Staten Island, New York. Her keel was laid down on 12 June 1934 and she was launched on 15 October 1935, sponsored by Kathleen H. Mahan (the admiral's great-granddaughter). The ship was commissioned on 18 September 1936, with Commander J. B. Waller in command. The ship departed for Caribbean and South American ports within two months of her commission, combining her initial training and [[shakedown cruise]] with a goodwill tour. She remained in the Atlantic until July 1937, then headed to the Southern California coast for fleet training before steaming to her new station at Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahan| url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/m/mahan-ii.html|publisher=[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]]|accessdate=23 January 2015 |work=[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising tension between Japan and the United States stretched back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of [[Manchuria]] in the [[Mukden Incident]]. Japan's continued aggression, instigating the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 and [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|invading French Indochina]] in 1940&amp;mdash;to which the United States and European powers responded with embargoes on iron and oil imports&amp;mdash;further heightened the tension. The Japanese thereafter decided to attack the Western powers in Asia, beginning with a surprise attack on the American naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner and Chesneau p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Peattie p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; When the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|struck Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Mahan'' was at sea with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, three [[cruiser]]s and four destroyers as part of Task Force 12.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt; ''Lexington''{{'}}s mission was to ferry Marine aircraft to reinforce [[Midway Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer and Hummelchen p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; After news of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the task-force commander received orders to terminate the ferry mission and to search for the Japanese strike force. Unable to locate them, the task force returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 December.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

She put to sea in late December with 103 Marines to reinforce their detachment at [[Johnston Island]] (about 750 nautical miles—860 miles, or 1,390&amp;nbsp;km—west of [[Hawaii]]), and evacuated 47 civilians to Hawaii the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Fleshman, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; A convoy assignment took ''Mahan'' to [[Samoa]], where she joined [[Task Force 17]] (including the carrier {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}}, two cruisers and five destroyers). The task force carried out raids on [[Jaluit Atoll]], [[Mili Atoll]] and Makin Atoll ([[Butaritari]]) in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer and Hummelchen p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mahan'' moved on to [[Canton Island]] in late February 1942, temporarily assigned to offshore patrol duty.&lt;ref&gt;Fleshman pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; By early April, she was at sea with a convoy bound for San Pedro, California. The ship then steamed north to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul, docking on 18 April 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Fleshman p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mahan'' was back operating in the waters off Pearl Harbor in August 1942.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt; By mid-October, she had steamed out of Pearl Harbor as part of [[Task Force 16]] with the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, the battleship {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}}, two cruisers and seven destroyers. On 24 October they joined Task Force 17, which included the carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, four cruisers and six destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer and Hummelchen p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The two carrier groups formed [[Task Force 61]] under the command of Rear Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]], and was ordered to the Santa Cruz Islands to strike the Japanese if they moved on [[Guadalcanal]].&lt;ref name=R185-188/&gt;

After the task force anchored off the islands on the morning of 26 October, ''Enterprise''{{'}}s search planes spotted the enemy carrier force and dropped two 500-pound bombs on the {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuiho}}, setting the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] in motion. When  it subsided, the Navy had lost 74 aircraft, the carrier ''Hornet'' and one destroyer; ''Enterprise'', ''South Dakota'', one cruiser and one destroyer were damaged. The Japanese lost about 100 aircraft, but their ship casualties were much lower. Nimitz and Halsey expressed their satisfaction with Kinkaid's force and their battle against heavy odds, and the destroyers in the ''Hornet'' and ''Enterprise'' screens were commended for a stellar effort.&lt;ref name=R185-188/&gt;

[[File:BB South Dakota.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerial view of large ship and three smaller ones, side by side|''South Dakota'', ''Prometheus'', ''Mahan,'' and ''Lamson'' after ''South Dakota''-''Mahan'' collision following the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands|left|alt=Overhead view of a large warship with three smaller warships tied alongside]]

En route to [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]], on  27 October,  a Japanese submarine contact caused the  American ships to take evasive action. In the confusion, ''Mahan''  and battleship ''South Dakota''  collided:  both ships were seriously damaged. Commander  R. W. Simpson was ''Mahan'''s captain at the time, having taken command in early 1941.&lt;ref name=R185-188&gt;Roscoe pp. 185–188&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary repairs were made to ''Mahan'' at Noumea, and she headed back to Pearl Harbor for a new bow.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

Fully repaired, ''Mahan'' left Pearl Harbor on 9 January 1943 for the South Pacific. In subsequent months she escorted convoys between the [[New Hebrides]] and the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], performed patrol assignments off New Caledonia, and engaged in operations in Australian waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; By August her base of operations was [[Milne Bay]], New Guinea, which along with [[Buna, Papua New Guinea]], was used as a staging area for an advance to gain possession of the Japanese-held northeast coast of New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The operation began in August 1943, with plans to strike Lae, New Guinea. Two weeks earlier, ''Mahan'', under Lieutenant Commander James T. Smith, and three other US destroyers had cleared the Lae approaches and the waters between Salamaua and Finschhafen, bombarding Japanese installations at Finschhafen.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; In early September the Lae Task Force, under Rear Admiral [[Daniel E. Barbey]], left Milne Bay for Lae with 8,000 Australian troops. By the evening of 4&amp;nbsp;September, the troop landing was completed. On 11 September Salamaua was under Allied control, and Lae was taken by 16 September. ''Mahan'' and other US destroyers had provided cover for the amphibious landings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 257-258&quot;&gt;Roscoe pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

Defeated at Lae, the Japanese pulled back to Finschhafen, which the Americans and Australians chose as the site of their next offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p.258&quot;&gt;Roscoe p.258&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September an assault force under Barbey left Buna, escorted by US destroyers including ''Mahan'', and stopped at Lae to pick up an Australian infantry brigade. Additional US destroyers were attached to the force, preceding the convoy to the rendezvous point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p. 258&quot;&gt;Roscoe p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, before daylight, the amphibious force stormed the beach at Finschhafen; by noon, all troops were ashore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p.258&quot; /&gt; As the destroyers began to withdraw from the area, ten Japanese torpedo planes winged across the water, targeting ''Mahan'' and five other US destroyers. The ships returned fire, shooting down eight of the ten planes; the remaining two escaped. This scrimmage ended without any hits by enemy planes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p. 258&quot; /&gt; By 2 October, Finschhafen was in the hands of the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer and Hummelchen p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 1943, the amphibious force led by Barbey mustered at Buna, New Guinea, in preparation for the landing at Arawe, New Britain. With it was a bombardment group, composed of ''Mahan'' and four other US destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;  Setting sail on the 14th, the force dropped anchor off Arawe early the next morning, and ''Mahan'' and her sister ships bombarded the Japanese shore defenses at the main landing point. The shelling from the 5&quot;/38 guns and the [[bazooka]]-fired rockets sent the Japanese into retreat, and by mid-morning the beachhead was secured.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p.267&lt;/ref&gt;
Christmas 1943 found ''Mahan'' steaming with Barbey's amphibious force to Borgen Bay, near Cape Gloucester, New Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to Borgen Bay was risky, with uncharted waters; ''Mahan'' and {{USS|Flusser|DD-368|2}} were picked to sound out the channel and mark the way. They moved through the channel, with two [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] laying [[buoys]] in their wake. The force shadowed the buoys, and made its way through the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p.269&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of the 26th, the Marines landed on the beach unopposed. The Japanese struck forcefully later that afternoon, but the Americans would not be dislodged.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 1944, ''Mahan'' was in action with the [[Seventh Fleet]] supporting the troop landing at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands. Although the supporting ships came under heavy fire, the troops made it ashore. Three weeks later, the Japanese force at Los Negros was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1944, after extended wartime duty in the Pacific, the veteran destroyer was ordered to California for overhaul and moored again at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. ''Mahan'' left the yard in early July for Pearl Harbor, participating in exercises there until 15 August. She returned to New Guinea on 20 October via [[Eniwetok]], Jaluit, [[Guam]], [[Saipan]] and [[Ulithi]], escorting convoys between Hollandia ([[Jayapura]]) and Leyte. By the end of November 1944, ''Mahan'' was performing anti-submarine patrol off Leyte in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

==Sinking==
In November 1944,  bad weather and hostile terrain bogged down the ground campaign to seize Leyte from the Japanese. The chief impediment to retaking Leyte was the Japanese ability to reinforce and resupply its headquarters at [[Ormoc City]], on the west side of Leyte, and the Americans' inability to counter this advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the unavoidable decision was made for an amphibious attack on Ormoc.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DD 364 USS Mahan (Bow Head On) - NARA - 19-N-67750.tif|jpg|thumb|''Mahan'' at Mare Island Naval shipyard in 1944, before returning to the South Pacific]]
On the morning of 7 December 1944, three years to the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, troops of the [[US 77th Infantry Division]] landed south of Ormoc City.  At the same time, ''Mahan'' was patrolling the channel between Leyte and [[Ponson Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamont-Brown pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; The amphibious strike by the infantry met with little opposition, but nine Japanese bombers and four escort fighters converged on ''Mahan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p. 445&quot;&gt;Roscoe p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Kamikaze'' (1997), Raymond Lamont-Brown wrote: &quot;Observers were to record of this, one of the most unusual and devastating of kamikaze assaults of 1944, that the Japanese aircraft used torpedo-launching tactics, but when they had been hit&amp;nbsp;... they switched to kamikaze attacks, diving on ''Mahan''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont-Brown p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; During the assault, US Army fighters downed three Japanese aircraft and damaged two more. ''Mahan'' shot down four but took three direct kamikaze hits,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p. 445&quot;/&gt; as David Sears observed in ''At War With the Wind'' (2008), &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the most calamitous [being] a direct hit to the superstructure near the No. 2 gun.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploding and awash in flames, ''Mahan'' was turned by Commander E. G. Campbell toward the picket line in a last hope to save her before issuing the order to abandon ship. The destroyers {{USS|Lamson|DD-367|2}} and {{USS|Walke|DD-723|2}} rescued the survivors; one officer and five men were missing, and thirteen seriously wounded (including burns). A US destroyer sank ''Mahan'' with torpedoes and gunfire because she was not salvageable.&lt;ref&gt;Sears p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mahan''’s captain praised the performance of his crew during the ordeal. He described their response as disciplined and courageous.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
''Mahan'' received five [[battle star]]s for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;
