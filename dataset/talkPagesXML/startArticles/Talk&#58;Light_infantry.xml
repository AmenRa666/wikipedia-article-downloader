Perhaps a merger into the infantry page, where light infantry is described in adition to other types?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/115.189.50.25|115.189.50.25]] ([[User talk:115.189.50.25|talk]]) 03:29, 14 October 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Perhaps a more modern and revelant introduction to this article? Instead of immediately talking about line strategies, we should talk about the relevance and position of light infantry today. Basically dismounted forces around the globe, whether they are in an open war, a peacekeeping, or a special operations role.

OK, tried to tidy the article up but it'S still American and British centric. [[User:217.7.209.108|217.7.209.108]] 15:19, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

&quot;Not all light infantry fight for a state military. According to a former FBI agent who was a senior member of the Bureau's counter-terrorism unit, the light infantry of the Shi'a Islamist organization Hezbollah are the finest in the world.[1]&quot;
It doesn't say that anywhere on the link.


----
Huh? &lt;blockquote&gt;
They are disciplined, highly trained, with incredibly lethal equipment with a frighteningly good counterintelligence network. A former head of the FBI's Hezbollah branch told me that &quot;they are the best light infantry in the world and can strike the United States any time any where.&quot; [That general sentiment] was echoed by last week's testimony of both the CIA and FBI directors before the Senate in open hearings.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, I spotted the reference in the link. I don't think an anonymous FBI agent is really qualified to judge the quality of anybody's light infantry. This appears to be pure hyperbole. News reports indicate the Israelis were surprised by how well Hebollah fought but were certainly not overwhelmed. I'd delete this reference.

==Rifle Regiment should be a separate article==
Not all Rifle Regiments were Light Infantry and vice versa.  Could someone please modify the system so 'Rifle Regiment' goes straight to 'Rifleman' rather than Light Infantry?[[User:Foofbun|Foofbun]] ([[User talk:Foofbun|talk]]) 06:21, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

== Chart ==

First the chart is wrong. Light Infantry soldiers are routinely packing 70-90 pounds in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Mortarmen have weighed in at 170 pounds of gear. As well 10 liters is way too much water to be drinking unless it's 105+ degrees out. Finally the point that says it's disputed in the chart, 25 miles a day is correct. The 101st actually does a 101 mile road march in 4 days every so often. Sorry if the formatting is bad, this is my first post on Wikipedia, and I don't really have time now to corroborate this with news articles or anything. I promise not to change anything until I figure some things out around here, and find some sources to cite.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.121.32.4|24.121.32.4]] ([[User talk:24.121.32.4|talk]]) 03:47, 9 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The whole chart is bogus. It's from some commercial &quot;military bikes&quot; website, not a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]. It's snazzy but that's no reason to keep it. I'll remove it. [[User:TomPointTwo|TomPointTwo]] ([[User talk:TomPointTwo|talk]]) 04:38, 9 March 2011 (UTC)

Can someone please redirect &quot;Rifle Regiment&quot; from the incorrect &quot;Light Infantry&quot; to &quot;Riflemen&quot; where it belongs? Light Infantry  Regiments and Rifle Regiments were two different units with different functions.[[User:Foofbun|Foofbun]] ([[User talk:Foofbun|talk]]) 23:36, 24 January 2013 (UTC)
