== ?moderate Iranians ==
the term &quot;moderate iranians&quot; is used throughout the article, starting at the beginning, but there is no citation which gives any real insight as to who these people were. without context &quot;moderate&quot; is a meaningless statement.[[Special:Contributions/192.12.69.203|192.12.69.203]] ([[User talk:192.12.69.203|talk]]) 01:02, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:Well in this instance, &quot;moderate&quot; is attributed to those opposed to the Ayatollah Khomeni, who was more of the extremist when it came to advocating Islamic values. [[User:Happyme22|Happyme22]] ([[User_talk:Happyme22|talk]]) 05:01, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

What other &quot;moderate&quot; political groups build up a private cache of weapons?

:Note that the characterization of the arms sales being to &quot;moderate&quot; Iranians is solely sourced to Reagan's own account; it needs to be described as such, rather than presented as unvarnished fact.  The Walsh report characterizes the sales as being &quot;to Iran&quot; (which after all is a totalitarian state under the control of the Ayatollah).  [[User:Stevenj|— Steven G. Johnson]] ([[User talk:Stevenj|talk]]) 15:24, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
::The arms sales were to the Islamic Republic of Iran, not &quot;moderate&quot; Iranians. The man whom the Americans were hoping to deal with was [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], who was and still is a major player in Iranian politics. I corrected that, and replaced the anonymous &quot;moderate&quot; faction with the Rafsanjani faction, which might help to clarify things. On a slightly different note, this article uses Reagan's memoirs as its main source. This is highly problematic given that Reagan was president at the time, and so whatever Reagan or more accurately Reagan's ghost-writer wrote is clearly going to be partial to the Gipper. Would Reagan's ghostwriter admit that Reagan broke the law and traded arms for hostages? Merely to ask the question is to answer it. I have no trouble with using Reagan's memoirs as a source, to get Reagan's take on things. But surely the article would be better if it used third party sources rather than Reagan's memoirs? It is rather like if one were to use Nixon's memoirs as the main source for the Watergate article or Clinton's memoirs as the main source for the Lewinsky affair. If one were to use Eden's memoirs as the main source for article on the Suez Crisis of 1956, then the article would say that there was no &quot;collusion&quot; between Israel, France and Britain to attack Egypt. What Eden wrote in his memoirs denying the &quot;collusion&quot; to attack Egypt was a complete and total lie. The Eden memoirs are worthless as history as Eden lies shamelessly about his plans to attack Egypt in 1956 and a great many other things, like being opposed to the appeasement of Germany during his first stint as Foreign Secretary  in 1935-38, which he in fact supported. This is especially the case as others like Colonel North have insisted that Reagan did know everything about they were doing. The article notes North's claim, but takes Reagan's side on the basis of his memoirs, which is somewhat problematic. Furthermore at present this article demands of the reader a stunning suspension of belief. The article, using only Reagan's memoirs as a source claims Reagan was dealing with a nameless &quot;moderate&quot; Iranians faction (which is falsely implied not to be the government of Iran)  and did not trade arms for hostages. If the aim of sending arms to Iran, first via Israel and then directly was to free hostages held by Hezbollah as Reagan contends in his memoirs, then that '''is''' trading arms for hostages, regardless of how Reagan's ghost-writer might try to spin it as not trading arms for hostages. If these Iranian officials had nothing to do with terrorism, how was it that they had enough influence to order Hezbollah to free American hostages? Any Iranian official with the power to order Hezbollah to free hostages is definitely right up to their necks in terrorism. And if the faction led by Rafsanjani were powerful enough to order Hezbollah to free hostages and if they were &quot;moderates&quot; vehemently opposed to terrorism, then why was the Islamic Republic of Iran engaging in terrorism in the first place and letting Hezbollah kidnap Americans? That makes no sense. Indeed, if the Rafsanjani faction were really opposed to terrorism as morally wrong, then why was it necessary for the United States to ship arms to Iran to effect the release of the hostages? Surely, these people would do the morally right thing and have Hezbollah free the hostages without conditions such as arms shipments if they really felt that way? Any Iranian official who had nothing to do with terrorism would not had the power to free the hostages. Either Reagan was really stupid not to understand these very simple points or he was lying. Take your pick. --[[User:A.S. Brown|A.S. Brown]] ([[User talk:A.S. Brown|talk]]) 01:34, 15 September 2016 (UTC)

== Neutrality Dispute ==

Anyone else see this as a problem?  This line in particular:
'Reagan was deeply committed to securing the release of the hostages; it was this compassion that motivated his support for the arms initiatives&quot; - maybe this is what he said, or what people said, but no one can pretend to know his thoughts.

That, coupled with the frequent mention of &quot;moderate&quot; Iranians seems to create a clear slant.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.55.13.25|68.55.13.25]] ([[User talk:68.55.13.25|talk]]) 18:20, 24 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The piece about Reagan being committed to releasing the hostages is directly from his autobiography, so they are his words. The 'moderate' Iranians mention is necessary, as it distinguishes those opposed to the Ayatollah from those supporting him. It was the moderates that Reagan's administration supported, but it deteriorated into an arms-for-hostages scheme. [[User:Happyme22|Happyme22]] ([[User_talk:Happyme22|talk]]) 21:17, 24 May 2008 (UTC)

::The words should be quoted and cited then. This is not neutral text. Also, iirc, &quot;moderate&quot; Iranians popped up later as an excuse/apology post factum and in fact the US negotiated with the staunchest Iranian Islamic revolutionaries, who had the power to deliver. When Tower went on national television he surprised the public by claiming to have achieved &quot;damage control&quot; (his words) in the Iran-Contra crisis, and to have protected the president from the fallout. Also, if someone is working on making this into a readable article, the Contra side of the equation is in dire need of treatment. The one sentence that touches upon their role is entirely unclear, as if they were raising money by selling arms to Iran. They were the cocaine terminus, the CIA was running guns and cocaine. This is generally very well known, documented, verifiable etc. Leaving it out is anti NPOV. Good luck with your quest for admin Happyme22, don't ban me for being right :) [[User:Hypatea|Hypatea]] ([[User talk:Hypatea|talk]]) 23:16, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

:::The article states Reagan's lack of involvement as a fact in one paragraph. Then another paragraph simply states that Reagan appointed a commission to investigate the matter, and they (surprise, surprise) didn't find proof of his involvement. It seems extremely slanted to declare he didn't approve or even have knowledge of what was going on while 11 members of his administration were convicted and then pardoned by his former Vice-President. There may not be proof of his involvement, but there certainly is no proof that he was totally clueless either.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.107.30.155|76.107.30.155]] ([[User talk:76.107.30.155|talk]]) 03:12, 6 June 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::::That is a good argument IP 76.107.30.155, and as a result, I have removed the phrase &quot;nor was he aware that funds were being sent to the Contras&quot;. Reagan was never found to have possessed any knowlege of the divert-to-Contras part of the scheme, but you are correct in saying that there isn't any proof that he was completely out of the loop. I hope that helped, and thank you for your comment. [[User:Happyme22|Happyme22]] ([[User_talk:Happyme22|talk]]) 03:24, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

I think this article tends to take a more critical stance toward the shredding of documents, or withholding of documents, than is fair. Covert operations are covert for a reason, and the idea of protecting sources of sensitive information is not just a cover-up: at least one Iranian contact disappeared in Iran shortly after many of the documents were made public. According to the New York Times, August 9, 1987, &quot;the disclosures have prompted the intelligence services of some friendly nations to share less information with the United States.&quot; The article is implying from the fact that the NSC and CIA did not empty their file cabinets before Congress and the press that they were trying to hide incriminating evidence. On the contrary, the executive branch did hand over any, many documents, declassifying perhaps more than they should have, given the sensitive nature of much of the information, and the effects such revelations often have on the sources.
Also, on the question of &quot;moderate Iranians&quot;, this is confusing because while in fact those conducting the sales wanted to strengthen pro-Western Iranians, and billed their actions as such, it was not possible to support a faction, only the actual government, the whole regime. So it is understandable that this is a grey area to readers.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.63.233.184|71.63.233.184]] ([[User talk:71.63.233.184|talk]]) 22:10, 13 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== GA revert ==

This article's GA nomination was passed without a review, so I have reverted it. I would also like to point out that the last line of the &quot;Tower Commission&quot; section and the first two paragraphs of &quot;Convictions, pardons, and reinstatements&quot; need to be sourced, as they are potentially controversial and contain quotations. [[User:GaryColemanFan|GaryColemanFan]] ([[User talk:GaryColemanFan|talk]]) 22:59, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, and thank you for doing that. I did not know that it had been passed without a review, which is not good. And the fact tags only help us in getting this article up to GA! Best, [[User:Happyme22|Happyme22]] ([[User_talk:Happyme22|talk]]) 04:19, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

== Weapon Condition ==
Weren't the missiles we sent them defective?  I don't remember where I heard that.  Anyone know what the condition of the SAM's and what was wrong with them? [[User:Smaug99|Smaug99]] ([[User talk:Smaug99|talk]]) 17:40, 7 June 2008 (UTC)
:Well if you provide a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], we can certainly take that into consideration. Thanks, [[User:Happyme22|Happyme22]] ([[User_talk:Happyme22|talk]]) 18:59, 7 June 2008 (UTC)

Kind of late, but my take on it is not to bother considering that more than 2500 TOW missiles were sent to the Iranians over a certain period of time, and they would certainly have noted if they were defect since they used them in the war against Iraq and thus ceased any further purchases of the expensive weapons. [[User:Pavuvu|Pavuvu]] ([[User talk:Pavuvu|talk]]) 12:26, 18 November 2011 (UTC)
{{Talk:Iran-Contra affair/GA1}}

I read the same somewhere, and it's worth adding when sourced.  The missiles were ostensibly being returned to the U.S. from West Germany for refitting as TOW II missiles but were diverted to Iran instead. The missiles Iran received were unreliable. I don't recall the source where I read these particular details, but they jive with what I knew at the time.  [[User:Rklawton|Rklawton]] ([[User talk:Rklawton|talk]]) 03:02, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

The U.S. shipped TOW missiles, not SAMs. All American TOW missiles were being refitted at the time to become the TOW II missile. This made the transfers easier - the missiles were routinely being removed from bunkers for shipment stateside, so the operation didn't provoke any questions on the ground. As far as &quot;defective&quot; goes, it's probably more accurate to say they weren't &quot;reliable&quot; and that the U.S. knew they weren't reliable (hence the refit), and that Iran got ripped off in the exchange (committing an act of war by taking diplomats hostage notwithstanding). No doubt all of this is sourced somewhere by now. This was all Army lore back in the '80s when I served. [[User:Rklawton|Rklawton]] ([[User talk:Rklawton|talk]]) 13:52, 18 November 2011 (UTC)

==Link to More American imperialism/intervention?==

== US Troops in Honduras ==

Can anyone find any reliable sources for the presense of US troops in Honduras, training the Contras?

The wikpedia guidlines for an article lead [[WP:LEAD]]

*First off, IMHO the article ought to start out if at all possible with a summary of what the issue is about, in this case how Iran and how the contras are involved. So I replaced &lt;br&gt;
&quot;which was revealed in November 1986 as a result of earlier events &quot; with &lt;br&gt;
&quot;an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran and funding for the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] group.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
I put it to you that the reader looking for a quick summary is going to be more interested in this, than when the scandal was revealed.  
(to be continued)

:I'm not &quot;defending&quot; the page; I have it on my watchlist because I've done extensive work on it and got it up to GA status. As for what you wrote above: that was okay and a discription of the affair earlier up may be good. I think that a timeline should be established, however, and we should retain the &quot;which was revealed in November 1986 as a result of earlier events during the Reagan administration&quot; rather than simply &quot;during the Reagan administration&quot;. It is neutral and just to point out that the affair was revealed in 1986, half-way into Reagan's second term, instead of the broad &quot;during the Reagan administration&quot;, which leaves it to the reader to find out when it was and results in additional questions.

:I know you said above that you have more coming (good), but since I'm here I'm going to go ahead and list some of my thoughts:

:*The addition of 'relatively' to 'moderate' needs a citation. There are citations for moderate, but not for relatively moderate.
:*Noting that this group of moderates was opposed to the Ayatollah is extremely important, for Reagan says in his autobiography that he would not have authorized the Israeli plan had they been hardliners or supporters of Khomeini. Whether he was bluffing or not, we don't know, but that is his account.
:*There was no such thing as &quot;Iranian&quot; payment; the U.S. was to be reimbursed by Israel, not Iran.
:*The deterioration from the initial plan into one of arms-for-hostages was crucial and needs to be retained. After all, that was how the problem started. Reagan authorized the initial Israeli plan, though there has not been any evidence uncovered that he supervised or new about the failure of the original plan and its deterioration, which should be noted.
:*Reagan being unaware of the diversion to the Contras is one of the most talked about aspects of the entire affair. No one will ever know if he really did authorize the Conta diversion, but, as with the deterioration of the first part of the plan, there has not been any evidence uncovered showing that Reagan authorized the Contra diversion. That ''has'' to be noted for to achieve accuracy and a NPOV, for it paints an incomplete picture of the scandal without mentioning it.

:Those are my grievances; the rest was great and you definitely helped to improve the article's flow and structure. Hope to hear back soon. Thanks, [[User:Happyme22|Happyme22]] ([[User_talk:Happyme22|talk]]) 01:34, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

== Long term consequences ? ==
I am working on a Dutch translation of this article, which was first limited to three paragraphs without any references. I am not a specialist in this field, but I wondered if there hasn't been any speculation on the relation between the Iran-Contra affair and the 9/11 attacks?

==Robert Gates and the Iran-Contra affair==
After reading ''Gates &amp; the Iran-Contra Legacy'' by Ivan Eland at Consortiumnews.com, I conclude that the article on the Iran-Contra affair needs information on the role of Robert Gates.

On the Dutch page I have added a slightly summarized version of the following paragraph on Robert Gates. 

&quot;One of the persons mentioned by Walsh was [[Robert Gates]], Secretary of Defense under [[George W. Bush]] from December 18, 2006 and from January 20, 2009 under [[Barack Obama]]. Walsh concluded in the Tower Report that &quot;(...) contrary to Gates' sworn testimoy before a grand jury and at a confirmation hearing, “evidence proves” that then-Deputy Director of Central Intelligence Gates knew about the unconstitutional diversion of profits from Iran-bound arms sales to the Contras sooner than he let on.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Eland, Ivan, {{cite web|title=Gates &amp; the Iran-Contra legacy|date=November 15, 2006| url= http://www.consortiumnews.com/2006/111406a.html|accessdate= February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we agree on this addition, please feel free to add it. [[User:AdeleivdVelden|AdeleivdVelden]] ([[User talk:AdeleivdVelden|talk]]) 13:49, 1 February 2009 (UTC)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

:I'm not &quot;defending&quot; the page; I have it on my watchlist because I've done extensive work on it and got it up to GA status. As for what you wrote above: that was okay and a discription of the affair earlier up may be good. I think that a timeline should be established, however, and we should retain the &quot;which was revealed in November 1986 as a result of earlier events during the Reagan administration&quot; rather than simply &quot;during the Reagan administration&quot;. It is neutral and just to point out that the affair was revealed in 1986, half-way into Reagan's second term, instead of the broad &quot;during the Reagan administration&quot;, which leaves it to the reader to find out when it was and results in additional questions.

:I know you said above that you have more coming (good), but since I'm here I'm going to go ahead and list some of my thoughts:

:The addition of 'relatively' to 'moderate' needs a citation. There are citations for moderate, but not for relatively moderate.
::Agreed. (I have to say here that my expertise (such as it is) is in Iranian history and Islam, ''not'' the Iran-Contra affair itself.) --[[User:BoogaLouie|BoogaLouie]] ([[User talk:BoogaLouie|talk]]) 20:00, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
 
:*Noting that this group of moderates was opposed to the Ayatollah is extremely important, for Reagan says in his autobiography that he would not have authorized the Israeli plan had they been hardliners or supporters of Khomeini. Whether he was bluffing or not, we don't know, but that is his account.
::Here's the problem: we have copious verbage about how the Iranians dealt with were &quot;moderates&quot; (the word moderate, as in &quot;moderate Iran group&quot; or &quot;moderate Iranians,&quot; occurs 13 times in the article), and of Reagan's self-described intensions: 
::''Reagan initially rejected the plan, until Israel sent information to the U.S. showing that the moderate Iranians were opposed to terrorism and had fought against it.[19] Now having a reason to trust the moderates, Reagan approved the transaction, which was meant to be between Israel and the moderates in Iran, with the U.S. reimbursing Israel.[17] In his 1990 autobiography An American Life, Reagan states that he was deeply committed to securing the release of the hostages; it was this compassion that motivated his support for the arms initiatives.[1] The president requested that the moderate Iranians do everything in their capability to free the hostages held by Hezbollah'' 
::but who are these moderates? Did anyone find out?? What were their names? Was there a group of them they all belonged to?  Did they oppose Khomeini? Surely by now we know more about them then Reagan did back then.  
::There is only one Iranian (in Iran) mentioned that I could find: ''In July 1985, Israel sent American-made BGM-71 TOW antitank missiles to Iran through an arms dealer named Manucher Ghorbanifar, a friend of Iran's Prime Minister.''
::The link for Iranian prime minister goes to short article on prime ministers in Iran, at the end of which is a link to list of prime ministers, from which you can scroll down about 10 feet and find out that between 1981 – 1989  [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] was prime minister of Iran. 

::So the problem is two fold: 
# In Iran at the time, anti-Khomeini groups and activists had all been crushed. Any Iranian group or person in a position to negotiate for arms to go to the Iranian military, could not breath a word in opposition to Khomeini.  It would be like an American official in the 1950s coming out in support of the Soviet Union. 
# Mousavi was one of Khomeini's core supporters. Althought the article on Mousavi does not say so, Mousavi was one of the &quot;radicals&quot; of Iranian politics. He was a member of the Islamic Republic Party. Later on the radicals such as him feuded with &quot;pragmatic conservatives&quot; like Rafanjani who wanted to open Iran to more foreign investment.  To give an example of who was who in Iranian politics back then, another base of support for the radicals of Iran was [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], the hostage takers of the American embassy. 

So we need more information and rewriting for this article. --[[User:BoogaLouie|BoogaLouie]] ([[User talk:BoogaLouie|talk]]) 22:35, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:*There was no such thing as &quot;Iranian&quot; payment; the U.S. was to be reimbursed by Israel, not Iran.
:*The deterioration from the initial plan into one of arms-for-hostages was crucial and needs to be retained. After all, that was how the problem started. Reagan authorized the initial Israeli plan, though there has not been any evidence uncovered that he supervised or new about the failure of the original plan and its deterioration, which should be noted.
:*Reagan being unaware of the diversion to the Contras is one of the most talked about aspects of the entire affair. No one will ever know if he really did authorize the Conta diversion, but, as with the deterioration of the first part of the plan, there has not been any evidence uncovered showing that Reagan authorized the Contra diversion. That ''has'' to be noted for to achieve accuracy and a NPOV, for it paints an incomplete picture of the scandal without mentioning it.

== Boland Amendment ==

The Boland Amendment is cited as &quot;banning direct aid&quot; to the Contras.  However, the language of the Boland Amendment referred only to &quot;appropriated funds&quot; which means funds that Congress has appropriated for a specific use, Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524 (1838).  Nonappropriated funds, such as from the sale of government property, simply were not banned by the Boland Amendment.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boland_Amendment The goal here seems to be to misstate what the Boland Amendment actually said, and then accuse Reagan and his administration of not following the misinterpretation.  The question is fairly raised whether the Boland Amendment was actually intended to limit military aid to the contras (however military aid is actually defined) or whether it was part of a smoke screen intended to give Reagan cover?  This is the danger of interpreting legal documents as though they were written by actual human beings instead of lawyers.[[User:JPStrikes|JPStrikes]] ([[User talk:JPStrikes|talk]]) 01:21, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

== Some additions and changes that I would like to make ==

1. There is no discussion of Oliver North's testimony before Congress in 1987.  It was a huge media sensation at the time, over a period of months.  So far as I can determine, Col. North was as truthful and forthcoming in that testimony as he was able.  His testimony made him a national figure and a hero to many, and in fact his truthfulness was probably a major factor in his exoneration on appeal.

2. There is no mention of the timing of the Weinburger indictment by Walsh, nor of GHWB’s pardon of him.  Walsh announced his indictment of Weinburger mere days before the 1992 presidential election, which clearly indicates a political agenda.  Further, sworn testimony before the commission indicated that of all of the knowledgeable players in the incident, only Weinburger objected to the plan.  In other words, Weinburger could not have been more innocent, and it is easy to infer that GHWB had no choice but to pardon him.

3. I think that the use of Oliver North’s mugshot to illustrate this article violates NPOV, especially in light of his successful appeal.  I am working on getting better images.

4. There is no mention of GHWB's role in dealing with the Contras.  North's biography mentions several vivid incidents, and while peripheral, these might be pertinent to the story.

I am willing to work on the above, but I would like some discussion first.  I don’t want to edit war with anyone.  Have a great day.

BTW, great work and effort on the article.  I am impressed.[[User:Jarhed|Jarhed]] ([[User talk:Jarhed|talk]]) 05:47, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

==eRumor 9/11==
I concur with [[User:Jarhed|Jarhed]]. I just received an eRumor from my aunt that forms a connection between the Iran-Contra affair, and the Sept 11 destruction of the World Trade Towers. Attached was a reply-forward debasing the connection. I personally am not up on this topic, and feel that the inclusion of the 1987 Congress testimony is important. We all agree that the Sept 11, 2001 attack could have been avoided, however, using it to validate an invalid argument is not only bad historical accuracy, but does injustice to the victims. I propose that someone up to the task, obtains factual references to either argument, and provides a comparison between the two claims, as to how the rumor/contradiction may have originated.

Please open a new section that either validates the eRumor, or else proves the eRumor as nothing more than rumor. The rumor/contradiction can be found at http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/o/ollienorth-osama.htm but I am not familiar with TruthOrFiction.com's credentials.

== Historical Revisionism? ==

This article seems to suggest that the Iran-Contra affair was about exchanging weapons for hostages. As little as five years ago, the Iran-Contra affair was about covertly selling arms to Iran to covertly fund various projects in Central America and had absolutely nothing to do with the hostage situation, which was generally considered to be a Republican ploy to tear down Jimmy Carter, whatsoever. When did this revision of history become mainstream? Should a section explaining the revision, why it happened and what lead to it's ascendancy be included?&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:99.254.121.196|99.254.121.196]] ([[User talk:99.254.121.196|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/99.254.121.196|contribs]]) 18:27, 13 April 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:The hostage question was a part of the discussions at the inception of the program. There was debate within the executive branch as to whether the hostages or diplomatic relations with Iran ought to be the focus of talks, with some arguing that the release of hostages must precede any diplomatic discussions, and others advocating the forging of diplomatic relations first, with the release of Hezbollah-held hostages coming as a natural result of such a renewed relationship. So, the hostages were in fact part of discussions from the beginning, but had nothing to do with Carter, except in the superficial similarity that there were also Iran-held hostages during Carter's administration. I would recommend the book &quot;Perilous Statecraft: An insider's account of the Iran-Contra Affair&quot; by Michael Ledeen, which has the advantage of having been written very close to the event by a person who participated in them enough to have a good view without being too close to have a decently objective perspective.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.63.233.184|71.63.233.184]] ([[User talk:71.63.233.184|talk]]) 22:16, 13 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:: this as well as the many contra war controversies preceding the scandal should be mentioned as background (human rights abuses on the part of the contras were extensive and horrific, as confirmed by human rights watch and several church groups who conducted reports; the boland amendment should be mentioned; general issues with the background of the contras and origins of the FDN leadership as ex-Somoza-guardsmen should be mentioned).

When the background refers to the human rights abuses by the United States against Nicaragua, it would be worth referring to the case before the International Court of Justice (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), ICJ, Judgement of 27 June 1986, Merits[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/70/6503.pdf]). The Court, for instance, decides:

::Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State;

The report is cited as evidence of or support for this when in fact it concludes that claims of drug money funding the Contras were exaggerated and that reports of drug importation, influence peddling, etc were unsubstantiated.

Whether or not the US govt or any of its agencies were involved in the drug trade or in protecting the druggies is neither here nor there.

== Skipping the beginning? ==

When reading this article, the first thing that perturbed me was the fact that after the overview, the article jumps straight to the scandal, without any pretext whatsoever! I would really appreciate it if this article include some of the following points:
-US ties or relationship with the Contras before the scandal
-Us ties or relationship with the Iranians before the scandal
-The events that unfolded that allowed the US workers to be taken hostage
-The actual hostage-taking event itself
-What the Reagan Administration was doing in present-tense, as in while the public was unaware.

I feel as if the article jumps to the exposure in the beginning, without setting any pretext.

The source essentially states that Reagan knew of the contra support and than he knew of the weapons for hostages deal, but he ''may'' not have known about how they got linked by his staff and which illegal activities were involved in the details.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 15:27, 5 September 2011 (UTC)

:North and Poindexter said that Reagan did not know about the Contra funding program. However, everyone in the administration knew that Reagan wanted the Contras supported.[[User:Jarhed|Jarhed]] ([[User talk:Jarhed|talk]]) 15:50, 5 September 2011 (UTC)

==Reagan Testified==
I don't see in this article any mention of Ronald Reagan testifying during a trial on Iran-Contra. On Youtube, a simple search of &quot;Ronald Reagan Testimony&quot; shows about 22 videos of him testifying. I don't know much about the Iran-Contra affair, and the reason I'm even typing this is because I came on here to find out why exactly he was testifying and received NO information. Could someone add it?--[[User:Xxhopingtearsxx|Xxhopingtearsxx]] ([[User talk:Xxhopingtearsxx|talk]]) 20:52, 10 February 2012 (UTC)

== Arrow Air 1285 crash ==

Why is this in the Iran-contra article?

I see no evidence to tie the crash to Iran Contra.  Does someone suspect that this crash was caused by iran, as a result of the &quot;botched&quot; missile sales?  If so, then that should be clarified.

[[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking]] predated Sheehan, and Sheehan had made some new claims before the Iran–Contra story broke. Once the Iran–Contra story broke, he tacked on some of the publicized names to the lawsuit and made it one gigantic conspiracy theory.

== Syria's role in scandal leaking to the press. ==

Today an article of a CIA journal was declassified relating this scandal. It says Syria played a role in leaking the scandal to the press, it also explains its motivations to do so. It may be useful to this article. As far as I understand this information is new, but I'm not that informed about the topic to make the assertion in an edit, so I'll leave it to you. I may come later to contribute. See ya.

== A Reagan Press Conference From May 1987 That Must Be Included In 'Aftermath' ==

http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-16/news/mn-9385_1_iran-contra

Although the article as it is may be correct in its assertion that the specific level of Reagan's involvement is 'unknown,' the tone of this piece is overall obfuscatory given the press conference of May 1987 in which Reagan vociferously took credit for the general idea of the Affair, while insisting that all actions were legal under the Boland Amendment, etc.  At the risk of violating NPOV principles, I think the article might mention that the President went on to cite positive poll numbers as justification for his personal involvement. [[User:Maurizio689|Maurizio689]] ([[User talk:Maurizio689|talk]]) 18:16, 4 November 2015 (UTC)

:[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/051587a.htm Here] is a transcript of that press conference. One reporter asked if Reagan had been &quot;mortally wounded&quot; by the Iran–Contra affair; he replied that he had not seen any evidence that he had been. A second report asked how Reagan would respond to public opinion polls that had shown a drop in support for him and his policies over the preceding six months; he replied that he still had high favorability ratings and that poll results are dependent upon how questions were asked. In other words, Reagan was not justifying anything; he was refuting the premise of the questions.
:Regardless, the Iran–Contra affair encompasses a many different aspects, so what specifically would he be presumed to be justifying via those quotes? Negotiating with Iran? Selling arms to Iran? Supporting the Contras? The diversion of funds? - [[User:Location|Location]] ([[User talk:Location|talk]]) 22:14, 4 November 2015 (UTC)

== Some fundamental issues in the problematic representation of this article ==
While it is well-presented in its details, this article suffers from a noticeable equivocation between what are statements of fact concerning a definitive set of apparently illegal exchanges, and what are political talking points by those who would be (or were in fact) the defendants.  Historically, the public position of those individuals implicated in this ordeal was overwhelmingly reliant on the claim of a &quot;noble cause&quot;: that these transactions were primarily an agreement that was contemplated for the reason of obtaining the return of hostages.  The actual transactions recorded, however, are that arms had been, in fact, sold and transferred to Iran, and that proceeds had been directed toward the arming of the Contras.  No hostages were involved in any of the actual transactions.  Again, the undisputed events to which this article refers are transactions concerning Contras and transactions concerning Iran: in both cases, exchanges (money for weapons) were successfully executed, none (repeat, NONE) of which involved any hostages.   

If you were sitting in a court of law, concerning illegal, completed (key word: &quot;completed&quot;) transactions, and you started off your brief by quoting the talking points of the defendants (as is done in this present article), and stating, as an assumed fact, that they did this because &quot;they hoped thereby to secure the release of several US hostages,&quot; you would (a) clearly be the defense lawyer, and, (b) your defense would be standing on very tenuous ground.  This is not even considering the settled fact that high-level, implicated persons illegally destroyed government documents of the transactions (should we also assume that these would have somehow exonerated them?).  

In short, documented facts of the case should be the prominent features of the article; not the positions of personal memoirs and editorial articles, which should be secondary and qualified.   [[User:Wikibearwithme|Wikibearwithme]] ([[User talk:Wikibearwithme|talk]]) 08:41, 7 November 2015 (UTC)

:I think you will need to be a tad more specific in what you think should be added, removed, or changed. While I haven't fact-checked every citation, it appears most of the material cited to Reagan's autobiography can be supported by other reliable secondary sources. No doubt that secondary sourcing would almost always be better given that Reagan was a major player in the scandal. 
:I am also not clear what your point is about the &quot;noble cause&quot; claim, particularly since you seem to lump the many participants together as entering the fray all at the same time, having the same knowledge of events, and having the same agenda or intentions. That's just not the case. Strangely, ''you'' seem to suggest that the ends justified the means... if all the hostages in Lebanon had been released, then all or some of the participants - hard to know which ones you are charging with what - may have been exonerated in this hypothetical court of law. Also, &quot;NONE&quot; is not accurate given the circumstances of the release of [[Lawrence Jenco|Father Jenco]]. - [[User:Location|Location]] ([[User talk:Location|talk]]) 04:08, 18 November 2015 (UTC)



(a) I believe, for obvious reasons, secondary sources are clearly called for under Wikipedia guidelines, particularly under these circumstances.  If Reagan's autobiography is so reliably backed up by secondary sources, then it would seem incumbent upon the author of this piece to cite those secondary sources.  At this juncture, the claim of needed secondary sources being out there somewhere is merely an unsupported claim.  However, as a highly politicized episode, with many so-called secondary sources being essentially cheerleaders, none of this appears adequate, relative to the simple fact that only the Reagan-preferred side of the story is itierated throughout this article.

(b) I fail to see how the chronology of interactions that you refer to, or their individual motives, is of relevance to my citing what was uniformly the official and unofficial (in autobiography) &quot;reason&quot; for the business transactions in question.  This &quot;reason&quot; (hostage release) is reiterated with great repetition, unquestioned in its credibility, throughout this article.   As an alleged reason for the executed business transactions in question, I don't think that it is in dispute that the motive of obtaining hostage release was widely considered a &quot;noble cause&quot; and obviously a patriotic cause.  

It is not clear how you arrived at your comments on what I &quot;seem&quot; to imply, in your second paragraph, without making a great deal of inferences for which I did not provide any support.  I made no suggestion that any &quot;exoneration&quot; should have been forthcoming, in any event.  And clearly, I did not suggest or intimate that this &quot;noble cause&quot; was in any way ample justification for the means in question.  I think it is pretty clear that I utilized the term &quot;noble cause&quot; to explain the alibi of those implicated in these transactions and, so, attempting to defend their own actions - never suggested it was adequate - quite the contrary, in fact.

(c) Please explain and support (by secondary sources) how Lawrence Jenco could be considered one of the Iran-held hostages in question, who was released as a consideration in the business transactions in question.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wikibearwithme|Wikibearwithme]] ([[User talk:Wikibearwithme|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wikibearwithme|contribs]]) 23:47, 19 November 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:(a) Keep in mind that this is Wikipedia, so the &quot;author of this piece&quot; is currently 1,562 different users&lt;ref&gt;https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/wikihistory/wh.php?page_title=Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair&lt;/ref&gt; Feel free to look up in the article's edit history who placed the links to Reagan's book and tell them you think it is incumbent upon them to cite secondary sources. Alternatively, I have no objections to you adding secondary source material that conforms to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.
:(b) What I think you are saying is the same as what I though you were saying before, so there is no need for me to proffer a response and keep us going round in circles. Your best bet is to suggest a specific passage and a specific fix.
:(c) The report of the [[congressional committees investigating the Iran–Contra affair]] states that [[Benjamin Weir]] and [[Lawrence Jenco|Father Jenco]] were both released due to the involvement of Ghorbanifar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran/Contra Affair&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=U.S. Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition, U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran |author-link=Congressional committees investigating the Iran–Contra Affair |title=Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran/Contra Affair With Supplemental, Minority, and Additional Views |url=http://www.archive.org/details/reportofcongress87unit |date=1987 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=520 |id=S.
