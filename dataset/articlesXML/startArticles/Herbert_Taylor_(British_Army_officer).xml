He was first and principal aide de camp to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in 1827, and also deputy [[Secretary at War]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; From 1828 to 1830 he was [[Adjutant-General to the Forces]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He became private secretary to the new king, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], in 1830.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; On the death of the king in 1837 he retired, although he was first and principal aide de camp to [[Queen Victoria]] 1837–39.

Taylor became a [[Major-General]] in 1813, and a [[Lieutenant-General]] in 1825. He was [[St Katharine's by the Tower|Master of St Katherine's Hospital]], [[Regent's Park]], and [[Master Surveyor]] and [[Surveyor-General of the Ordnance]]  from 1828.
