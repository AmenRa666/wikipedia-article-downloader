The '''[[Koninklijk]]e Marechaussee''', the ''Royal Netherlands Marechaussee'', abbreviated to KMar (English is [[Marshal|Royal Marshal]]s, but commonly seen as [[Constabulary|Royal Military Constabulary]]), is one of the four Services of the armed forces of the [[Netherlands]]. It is a [[gendarmerie]] force performing military police and civil [[police]] duties.

==History==
The ''Corps de Maréchaussée'' was created by King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] to replace the [[French Gendarmerie]] on October 26, 1814. The word ''[[gendarmerie]]'' had gained a negative connotation, so William called the new force ''&quot;marechaussée&quot;'' (he forgot the first acute accent in the document). Maréchaussée is an alternate French word for ''gendarmerie''. At that time, the Marechaussee was a part of the army (''landmacht''). The Marechaussee was tasked with maintaining public order, law enforcement, and safeguarding the main roads. Although not specifically mentioned, this included police duties for the army. As such, the Marechaussee was part of the national police (''rijkspolitie'').

[[Image:Koninklijke Marechaussee busje.JPG|thumb|A Marechaussee van]]

The Marechaussee was the only police force in many small municipalities, such as [[Venlo]], especially in the southern provinces of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant]] (former [[Generality Lands]]).

In 1908, Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]] assigned the Marechaussee the task of guarding the royal palaces, which had previously been done by [[gardener]]s. To this day, guarding a palace is called &quot;''klompendienst''{{-&quot;}} ([[Clog (shoe)|clog]] service).

On July 5, 1940, the [[Germany|German]] occupation government merged the Marechaussee with the ''rijksveldwacht'' and the ''gemeenteveldwacht''. This meant that the Marechaussee lost its military status and the [[wikt:predicate|predicate]] Royal. These changes did not apply to the Marechaussee outside occupied Dutch territory. About 200 ''marechaussees'' guarded the Royal Family and the Dutch government-in-exile, and provided military police services to the [[Princess Irene Brigade]], a brigade formed in the [[United Kingdom]], consisting of Dutchmen.

After [[World War II]], the Marechaussee was split into a ''[[Korps Rijkspolitie]]'' (National Police Corps) (as a replacement of the ''rijksveldwacht'' and the ''gemeenteveldwacht'') and the ''Royal Marechaussee'', which regained its military status. The main tasks for the Marechaussee since then have been border protection, military police and guard duties.

On July 3, 1956, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] became patroness of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee.

In 1994, the national and municipal police forces were merged into the present 25 regional police forces and the ''[[Korps landelijke politiediensten]]'' (National Police Services Agency). The National Police transferred its airport police and security tasks (primarily [[Schiphol]]) to the Marechaussee.

In 1998, the Marechaussee became a separate Service within the armed forces.

In 2014, a team of 40 Dutch Military Police went to eastern [[Ukraine]] to assist the investigation into the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|shooting down of Malaysian airliner MH17]]. They provided security for the international team and assistance in collecting evidence from the crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28506109|title=Dutch military police in Ukraine to investigate flight MH17|publisher=[[BBC NEWS]]|date=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
[[Image:Springende granaat.jpg|100px|thumb| The Grenade]]
The emblem of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee is, as with many other gendarmerie forces, a flaming [[grenade]]. In the 17th century, a new weapon was introduced in [[Europe]]: the [[hand grenade]]. The soldiers who handled grenades were called grenadiers. They became an [[elite]] type of soldier in all European armies. In France, the grenade symbol was adopted by the gendarmerie, and this was imitated by similar forces throughout Europe.

The flaming grenade (but in this case within an eight-pointed star) was also the emblem of the ''Rijkspolitie''.

The present marechaussee is a police organisation with a military status, under the [[jurisdiction]] of the Ministry of Defense, but mostly working for the Ministry of Security and Justice and the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. The RNLM performs the following duties:

* assistance to and replacement by the Police
* fighting [[illegal immigration]]
* fighting [[Transnational crime|international crime]]
* guarding the [[national border]]s
* guarding the royal [[palace]]s and the house of the [[Dutch Prime Minister|Prime Minister]]
* [[military police]] functions for the [[Military of the Netherlands|Dutch Armed Forces]]
* [[riot control]] and protection
* security and police work at all civilian airports, notably [[Schiphol Airport]]
* VIP close protection including the [[Royal Family]] and high-ranking government officials
* Special Protection Assignments Brigade ([[Brigade Speciale Beveiligingsopdrachten|BSB]]), [[special forces]] for arrests, surveillance and protection
* KMOO, the [[Military Police]] Service

The first four units are territorial, other two have national rather than regional responsibilities.

==Ranks==
See [[Military ranks of the Dutch armed forces]]

==Equipment==
* [[Colt Canada C7 rifle#The Netherlands|Colt Canada C8NLD]]
* [[Glock 17]]
* [[Glock 26]]
* [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK416]]
* [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]]
* [[FN 303]]
* [[FN MAG]] (only on [[AIFV]] armoured vehicles)

==Spelling==
In the course of time the two acute accents of the French spelling (Maréchaussée) were dropped. The lowest ranking personnel are referred to as marechaussees (without the capital M), a rank comparable to [[lance corporal]] and [[corporal]].
