'''Nelson Appleton Miles''' (August 8, 1839 – May 15, 1925) was a United States soldier who served in the [[American Civil War]], [[Indian Wars]], and the [[Spanish–American War]].

==Early life==
Miles was born in [[Westminster, Massachusetts]], on his family's farm. He worked in [[Boston]], read military history, and mastered military principles and techniques, including battle drills.

==Civil War==
Miles was working as a crockery store clerk in Boston when the Civil War began. He entered the [[Union Army]] on September 9, 1861, as a volunteer and fought in many crucial battles. [[File:Nelson Appleton Miles.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Miles during Civil War]]He became a Lieutenant in the [[22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]], and was commissioned [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] of the [[61st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] on May 31, 1862. He was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] after the [[Battle of Antietam]]. Other battles he participated in include [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], and the [[Appomattox Campaign]]. Wounded four times in battle (he was shot in the neck and abdomen at Chancellorsville), on March 2, 1867 he was [[Brevet (military)|brevetted]] a [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] in recognition of his actions at Chancellorsville.  He was again brevetted, this time to the rank of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] for his actions at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]]. He received the [[Medal of Honor]] (on July 23, 1892) for gallantry at Chancellorsville. He was appointed Brigadier General of volunteers as of May 12, 1864, for the Battles of [[Battle of the Wilderness|the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]]. On October 21, 1865, he was appointed Major General of volunteers at age 26.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he was commandant of [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]], where former Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] was held prisoner. During his tenure at Fort Monroe, Miles was forced to defend himself against charges that Davis was being mistreated.

==Indian Wars==
[[File:General Nelson Miles and other soldiers on horseback Puerto Rico..JPG|thumb|right|250px|General Nelson Miles and other soldiers on horseback in Puerto Rico.]]
In July 1866, Miles was appointed a colonel in the Regular Army. In March 1869 he became commander of the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S. Infantry Regiment]]. On June 30, 1868, he married Mary Hoyt Sherman (daughter of [[Charles Taylor Sherman]], niece of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] and [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]], and granddaughter of [[Charles Robert Sherman|Charles R. Sherman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wooster, Robert|title=Nelson A. Miles and the Twilight of the Frontier Army|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nlFAa-kiHsC&amp;pg=PA50|year=1996|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles played a leading role in nearly all of the U.S. Army's campaigns against the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes of the Great Plains. In 1874–1875, he was a field commander in the force that defeated the [[Kiowa]], [[Comanche]], and the Southern Cheyenne along the Red River. Between 1876 and 1877, he participated in the campaign that scoured the Northern Plains after Lt. Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]], and forced the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and their allies onto [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. In the winter of 1877, he drove his troops on a forced march across [[Montana]] and intercepted the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Percé]] band led by [[Chief Joseph]]. For the rest of Miles' career, he would quarrel with General [[Oliver O. Howard]] over credit for Joseph's capture. While on the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]], he developed expertise with the [[heliograph]] for sending communications signals, establishing a {{convert|140|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} line of heliographs connecting Fort Keogh and Fort Custer, Montana in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Signal Service Station on Mount Hood|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cdnc/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DAC18840920.2.58&amp;%20srpos=1&amp;e=------188-en--20--1--txt-IN-heliograph----1884#|accessdate=April 21, 2013|newspaper=Daily Alta California|date=September 20, 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=188001UnS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reade|first=Lt. Philip|title=About Heliographs|journal=The United Service|date=January 1880|volume=2|pages=91–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLCgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heliographs were supplied by Brig. Gen. [[Albert J. Myer]] of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coe&quot;&gt;Coe, Lewis (1993) ''The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and its Predecessors in the United States'' McFarland, Jefferson, N.C., p. 10, ISBN 0-89950-736-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1880, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Regular Army.  He was then assigned to command the [[Department of the Columbia]] (1881–85) and the [[Department of Missouri]] (1885–86)

In 1886, Miles replaced General [[George Crook]] as commander of forces fighting against [[Geronimo]] in the [[Department of Arizona]]. Crook had relied heavily on Apache scouts in his efforts to capture the [[Chiricahua]] leader. Instead, Miles relied on white troops, who eventually traveled {{convert|3000|mi|km}} without success as they tracked Geronimo through the tortuous Sierra Madre Mountains.  Finally, First Lieutenant [[Charles B. Gatewood]], who had studied Apache ways, succeeded in negotiating a surrender, under the terms of which Geronimo and his followers, agreed to spend two years in a [[Florida]] reservation. Geronimo agreed on these terms, being unaware of the real plot behind the negotiations (that there was no intent to let them go back in their native lands.) The exile included even the Chiricahuas who had worked for the army, in violation of Miles' agreement with them. Miles denied Gatewood any credit for the negotiations and had him transferred to the Dakota Territory. During this campaign, Miles's special signals unit used the [[heliograph]] extensively, proving its worth in the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coe&quot;/&gt; The special signals unit was under the command of Captain W. A. Glassford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coe&quot;/&gt; In 1888, Miles became the commander of the [[Military Division of the Pacific]] and the [[Department of California]]

In April 1890, Miles was promoted to major general in the Regular Army and became the commander of the [[Military Division of the Missouri]]. That same year, the last major resistance of the [[Sioux]] on the Lakota reservations, known as the [[Ghost Dance]], brought Miles back into the field. His efforts to subdue the Sioux led to [[Sitting Bull]]'s death and the massacre of about 300 Sioux.  This included women and children at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] on December 29, 1890. Miles was not directly involved at Wounded Knee and was critical of the commanding officer. Just two days after the event, Miles wrote to his wife, describing Wounded Knee as  &quot;The most abominable criminal military blunder and a horrible massacre of women and children&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=DeMontravel, Peter R.|title=A Hero to His Fighting Men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXmeG_jTQygC&amp;pg=PA206|year=1998|publisher=Kent State University Press|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his retirement from the Army, he fought for compensation payments to the survivors of the massacre. Overall, he believed that the United States should have authority over the Indians, with the Lakota under military control.

==Spanish–American War and later life==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:NelsonMiles.jpg|thumb|250px|Miles' portrait at [[United States Army Center of Military History]]]]
In his capacity of commander of the [[Department of the East]] from 1894 to 1895, Miles commanded the troops mobilized to put down the [[Pullman strike]] riots. He was named [[Commanding General of the United States Army]] in 1895, a post he held during the Spanish–American War. Miles commanded forces at Cuban sites such as [[Siboney, Cuba|Siboney]].

After the surrender of [[Santiago de Cuba]] by the Spanish, he personally led the invasion of [[Puerto Rico]], landing in [[Guánica, Puerto Rico|Guánica]] in what is known as the [[Puerto Rican Campaign]]. He served as the first head of the military government established on the island, acting as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs.

Upon returning to the United States, Miles was a vocal critic of the Army's quartermaster general, Brigadier General [[Charles P. Eagan]], for providing rancid canned meat to the troops in the field during what was known as the [[Army beef scandal]].

He was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] in 1900 based on his performance in the war.

[[File:Satterfield cartoon about forced retirement of Nelson Miles.jpg|thumb|Cartoon by [[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] about Miles' retirement in August 1903.]]
To show that he was still physically able to command, on July 14, 1903 - a month away from his 64th birthday - General Miles rode the 90 miles from [[Fort Sill]] to [[Fort Reno (Oklahoma)|Fort Reno]], Oklahoma, in 8 hour's riding time (10 hrs 20 mins total), in temperatures between {{convert|90|and|100|F|C}}. The distance was covered on a relay of horses stationed at 10-mile intervals; the first 30 miles were covered in 2 hours, 25 minutes. This was the longest horseback ride ever made by a commanding general of the army.&lt;ref&gt;See newspaper reports from Washington, D.C. (''Showing off his Stamina. General Miles making 90-mile horseback ride'') and Kansas City, MO (''General Miles made it in Triumph''), July 14, 1903. [http://www.lrgaf.org/news%20stories/historical-news.htm ''Hot off the Press''] Long Riders Guild Academic Foundation. Retrieved October 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Called a &quot;brave peacock&quot; by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]],{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Miles nevertheless retired from the Army in 1903 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64. Upon his retirement, the office of [[Commanding General of the United States Army]] was abolished by an Act of Congress and the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] system was introduced. A year later, standing as presidential candidate at the [[1904 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], he received a handful of votes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

When the U.S. entered [[World War I]] in 1917, the 77-year-old general offered to serve, but President Wilson turned him down.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Miles died in 1925 at the age of 85 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while attending a circus in Washington, D.C., with his grandchildren. He was one of the last surviving of those who served as a general officer on either side during the Civil War&lt;ref&gt;Warner, pp. 323-24, states that Miles was the &quot;last survivor of the full rank major generals of Civil War vintage&quot; and of all general officers, was outlasted only by [[John R. Brooke]] (died 1926) and [[Adelbert Ames]] (died 1933).&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in the [[Miles Mausoleum]]. It is one of only two [[mausoleum]]s within the confines of the cemetery.

[[George Burroughs Torrey]] painted his portrait.
