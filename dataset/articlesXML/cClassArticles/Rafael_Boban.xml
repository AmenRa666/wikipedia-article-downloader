'''Rafael ''Ranko'' Boban''' (born 22 December 1907) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] military commander who served in the [[Ustaše Militia]] and [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Armed Forces]] during [[World War II]]. Having participated in the [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932, he joined the [[Royal Italian Army]] and returned to Croatia following the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. He fought with the Ustaše until the end of the war, when he is reported to have evaded the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and reached the Austrian town of [[Bleiburg]]. Nothing is known of what happened to him afterwards, and it was rumoured that he was either killed in Podravina in 1945, died fighting with the [[Crusaders (guerrilla)|Crusaders]] in [[Herzegovina]] in 1947, or, more unlikely, emigrated to the [[United States]] via [[Argentina]], joined the [[United States Army]] and fought [[Communist]] forces in the [[Korean War]]. In 1951, he was named the Croatian Minister of Defence in-exile by Ustaše leader [[Ante Pavelić]].

==Early life==
Rafael Boban was born on 22 December 1907 in the village of [[Sovići]], near the town of [[Grude]], [[Austria-Hungary]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=42}} He was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Bosnian Croat]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=378–379}}{{sfn|Pinson|1996|p=142}} He served as an officer in the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] prior to joining [[Ustaše]] units based in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in the summer of 1932. In September 1932, he returned to Croatia and participated in the Ustaše-led [[Velebit uprising]] against Yugoslav rule. Afterwards, he traveled to Italian-controlled [[Zadar]] to request Italian citizenship and protection. In May 1934, Ustaše leader [[Ante Pavelić]] promoted Boban to the rank of sergeant in the Ustaše and he became a member of Pavelić's inner circle. The following year, Boban became a deputy commander of a [[Royal Italian Army]] company based in [[Lipari]] before being transferred to [[Calabria]]. At the beginning of December 1937, Italian authorities arrested him and other members of the Ustaše on suspicion that they were planning to assassinate Yugoslav [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] [[Milan Stojadinović]]. They were all quickly released.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=42}}

==World War II==
With the creation of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna Država Hrvatska}}, NDH) in April 1941, Boban returned to Croatia and joined the [[Ustaše Militia]]. He was promoted to the rank of captain in November{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=42}} and later became commander of the [[Black Legion (Ustaše militia)|Black Legion]] alongside [[Jure Francetić]]. Boban assumed full command of the legion following Francetić's capture and execution by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in December 1942.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=422}} Ustaše propaganda declared him Francetić's natural successor.{{sfn|Yeomans|2011|p=202}} The legion operated in various parts of the NDH under his command.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=422}}

Boban was promoted to the rank of general in December 1944 and became the head of the [[Podravina]]-based Fifth Ustaše Active Brigade of the [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Armed Forces]] that month.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=42}}; 
* {{harvnb|Tomasevich|2001|p=422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That autumn, he was responsible for guarding the imprisoned politicians [[Mladen Lorković]] and [[Ante Vokić]] in the town of [[Koprivnica]]. He held the rank of colonel within the Ustaše Militia by April 1945. In May, he withdrew with the Ustaše towards [[Austria]] and is reported to have successfully reached the town of [[Bleiburg]],{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=42}} alongside Pavelić and [[Vjekoslav Luburić]].{{sfn|Dorril|2002|p=336}}

Many theories exist about what actually happened to him. One theory states that he was killed in Podravina in 1945, while another states that he either died fighting with the [[Crusaders (guerrilla)|Crusaders]] in [[Herzegovina]] in 1947 or that he emigrated to the [[United States]] via [[Argentina]], joined the [[United States Army]] and fought [[Communist]] forces in the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=42}}

==Legacy==
In 1951, Boban was named the Croatian Minister of Defence in-exile by Pavelić.{{sfn|Dizdar|Grčić|Ravlić|Stuparić|1997|p=42}} During the [[Bosnian War]], a brigade of the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) was named after him.{{sfn|Žanić|2007|p=489}} The Roman Catholic church in the Herzegovinian village of [[Šćenica Bobani]] is decorated with his pictures.{{sfn|Sells|1998|p=106}}
