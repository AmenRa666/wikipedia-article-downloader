'''Reginald Roy Rattey''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (28 March 1918&amp;nbsp;– 10 January 1986) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. He was one of 20 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the [[Second World War]], doing so while serving with the [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Battalion]] during the [[Bougainville Campaign]] in 1945. After the war, Rattey ran a farm near [[West Wyalong]], New South Wales. He died in 1986 at the age of 67.

==Early life==
Born on 28 March 1918,{{#tag:ref|Rattey's entry in the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' states that he was born in 1917,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; while Belham &amp; Denham, and Rattey's entry in the World War II Nominal Roll state that he was born in 1918.&lt;ref name=Belham/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nominal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=A&amp;VeteranId=846296 |title=Rattey, Reginald Roy |work=World War II Nominal Roll |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; |group=Note}} at [[Barmedman, New South Wales|Barmedman]], in [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/rattey-reginald-roy-14289 |title=Rattey, Reginald Roy (1917–1986) |author=Staunton, Anthony |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=Volume 18 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reg Rattey was one of seven children born to a Lutheran family living in rural New South Wales. His father, Johannes Albert Rattey, who was originally from [[Springton, South Australia]] had married his mother, Anna Elisabeth (née Damschke),{{#tag:ref|Rattey's entry in the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' records his mother's name as &quot;Elizabeth Annie&quot;,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; while Harry Willey records it as &quot;Anna Elisabeth&quot;.&lt;ref name=Willey/&gt;|group=Note}} at [[Pleasant Hills, New South Wales|Pleasant Hills]] on 26 February 1914. Reginald was the couple's third child and when he was born, his father was working a  share farm. Three years later he purchased his own property near Wargin, and after he bought another property called &quot;Bon Accord&quot;, he expanded the family's holdings to {{convert|1672|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name=Willey&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719161559/http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-vc/rattey-vc.htm  |url= http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-vc/rattey-vc.htm |title=Rattey VC: First VC to a Militia Battalion Member |author=Willey, Harry |year=2001 |publisher=Digger History |archivedate=19 July 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his formative years, Reg was schooled at Bellarwi, travelling by horse {{convert|6.5|km|mi}} each way, and was a keen sportsman playing cricket, football and tennis.&lt;ref name=Belham/&gt; After leaving school, he helped out on the family farm, and found work as a miner; he also joined the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]], serving as a part-time soldier in the 21st Light Horse Regiment.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; When the war broke out, he was working at the Gibsonvale Open Cut Tin Mine at [[Kikoira]] and was parading with the 21st Light Horse Regiment at [[Wagga Wagga]].&lt;ref name=Willey/&gt;

==Second World War==
In late September 1941, as the prospect of war in the Pacific against the Japanese grew, Rattey’s regiment was mobilised for full-time service. The 21st Light Horse was subsequently redesignated as the 21st Reconnaissance Battalion,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; and Rattey served as a [[Universal carrier|Bren carrier]] driver and then a driver-mechanic.&lt;ref name=Willey/&gt; As a member of the Militia, under the provisions of the ''Defence Act'', Rattey was not allowed to serve outside of Australian territory, but in July 1942 he volunteered for overseas service as part of the Australian Imperial Force. He was transferred to [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]]’s carrier company and then the [[11th Division (Australia)|11th Division]], and in September 1943 deployed to [[New Guinea]], remaining there until April 1944 when he returned to Australia as a [[corporal]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/reg-ratteys-a-hero-a-town-will-not-forget/story-e6frev4r-1111116137553 |title=Reg Rattey's a hero West Wyalong will not forget |author=Williams, Samantha |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he was transferred to an infantry battalion, the [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Battalion]], a Militia unit that had been raised in Queensland that was part of the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]].&lt;ref name=Belham&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belham |first1=David |last2=Denham |first2=Peter |title=The Blue Diamonds: The History of the 7th Brigade, 1915–2008 |year=2009 |publisher=Department of Defence |location=Puckapunyal, Victoria |oclc=525034269 |pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11901.asp |title=25th Battalion (Darling Downs Regiment) |work=Second World War, 1939–1945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1944, the 25th Battalion deployed to New Guinea where they were based around [[Madang]] until November when the battalion was transferred to [[Bougainville Island]], landing at Torokina,&lt;ref name=Belham/&gt; where the Australians had taken over from the American force that had previously been fighting a [[Bougainville campaign|campaign]] against the Japanese on the island. The Australians then began a three-pronged offensive in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island to clear the Japanese from the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keogh |first=Eustace |title=The South West Pacific 1941–45 |publisher=Grayflower Productions |location=Melbourne, Victoria |pages=413–418 |oclc=7185705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this offensive, the 25th Battalion initially took part in the fighting in the central sector, and in late December fought in the [[Battle of Pearl Ridge]] before joining the southern drive on the Japanese stronghold of [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]] in early 1945. By March they had crossed the Puriata River and begun moving inland towards a position that became known as &quot;Slater's Knoll&quot;.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

===Victoria Cross===
[[File:KIng George IV &amp; Austn VC winners.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rattey (3rd from left) meets King George VI at the Victory Parade in London, in June1946.]]

On 26 July 1945, Rattey was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Buin Road in South Bougainville on 22 March. The 25th Battalion were ordered to capture a Japanese stronghold following an allied air and artillery attack. After determining that an attack by his section would likely incur many casualties, he single-handedly attacked three Japanese weapons bunkers with his Bren gun. After eliminating one of the bunkers with a grenade, he returned to his section through enemy fire to obtain two more grenades and returned to destroy two more enemy bunkers.&lt;ref name=LG&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37194|supp=yes|startpage=3857|date=26 July 1945|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this, his section advanced and encountered further Japanese machine gun fire. Rattey again launched a solo attack on an enemy gun position, killing one, injuring another and causing the remaining gun crew to retreat. The section captured the Japanese machine gun with 2,000 ammunition rounds before advancing further.&lt;ref name=LG/&gt; Two days after this action, Rattey was promoted to [[sergeant]],&lt;ref name=Belham/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; and the following month his battalion was relieved shortly after holding off a large-scale Japanese attack during the [[Battle of Slater's Knoll]].&lt;ref name=Willey/&gt;

==Post war==
After returning to Australia, Rattey was briefly hospitalised with a bout of [[malaria]] and then briefly toured the country helping to raise money for the Australian Comfort Fund. He was discharged from the Army on 31 October 1945,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nominal/&gt; and began farming a {{convert|2,400|acre|ha|adj=on}} property around [[Lake Cowal]], near West Wyalong, which he was granted under a special lease. In March 1946, he returned to the Army, being granted the rank of sergeant to attend the Victory Parade in London, where he was presented his Victoria Cross by [[King George VI]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. He was discharged from the Army again in September 1946 and returning to Lake Cowal. In 1948, Rattey married Emily Café, with whom he had one daughter. Emily died in 1954 and the following year he remarried, exchanging nuptials with Aileen Delaney at St Mary’s Catholic Church, in West Wyalong; the couple would later have four children.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Willey/&gt;

Rattey expanded his property at Lake Cowal by an extra {{convert|783|acre|ha}}, and eventually worked the land with sheep, cattle, pigs and wheat. Later, he also farmed tiger snakes for their serum.&lt;ref name=Willey/&gt; In his later life, Rattey’s health deteriorated and he had to give up the land. He died on 10 January 1986 as a result of [[emphysema]] and was given a full military funeral at St Mary’s Catholic Church, before being interred at the West Wyalong Lawn Cemetery. He was survived by his second wife and his five children.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Willey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Driveway&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remembrancedriveway.org.au/vc-citations/default.asp?ID=Rattey |title=Reginald Rattey VC |work=Remembrance Driveway |publisher=Remembrance Driveway Committee |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
