[[File:Kuma ONI.jpg|right|thumb|ONI drawing of the ''Kuma'' class|300px]]
The five {{nihongo|'''''Kuma''-class cruisers'''|球磨型軽巡洋艦|Kuma-gata keijun'yōkan}} were [[light cruiser]]s operated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN). The ''Kuma''-class cruisers proved useful in combat operations ranging from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the [[Indian Ocean]] throughout [[World War II]].

The ''Kuma''-class was followed by the very similar {{sclass-|Nagara|cruiser|4}}.

==Background==
Despite the success of the {{sclass-|Tenryū|cruiser|0}} high speed light cruiser design, the Imperial Japanese Navy realized that they would be outgunned by the larger [[US Navy]] {{sclass-|Omaha|cruiser|4}} of light cruisers then under development. In addition, the ''Tenryū''-class vessels, with a maximum speed of {{convert|33|kn|lk=in}}, were unable to keep up with the newer Japanese [[destroyer]]s, such as the {{sclass-|Minekaze|destroyer|4}}, which had a design speed of {{convert|39|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Stille&gt;Stille, '' Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 '', pages 14-18;&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1917, plans for an additional six ''Tenryū''-class vessels, plus three new-design 7200 ton-class [[scout cruiser]]s were shelved, in place of an intermediate 5,500 ton-class vessel which could be used as both a long-range, high speed reconnaissance ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer or [[submarine]] flotillas.&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;Gardner, ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921''; page 238&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the long range oxygen-propelled [[Type 93 torpedo|Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes]] in the 1930s, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]] drafted plans to create a special &quot;Night Battle Force&quot; of [[torpedo cruiser]]s. The idea was based on Japan's success in the naval [[Battle of Port Arthur]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. As the new Type 93 torpedoes had a range longer than that of contemporary [[battleship]]s' [[main battery]],{{dubious|date=January 2015}} the concept was to have a high speed strike force attack an enemy fleet at night with a massive and overwhelming barrage of torpedoes. Major surface combatants would follow up at dawn to finish off the wounded enemy.

''Ōi'' and ''Kitakami'' were subsequently modified with ten quadruple mount torpedo launchers (a total of 40 tubes), arranged in two broadside rows of five, i.e. 20 per side. The ships were assigned to the CruDiv 9 of the [[1st Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|IJN 1st Fleet]]. However, the rapid development of [[naval aviation]] and [[submarine warfare]] in the 1930s quickly made this plan obsolete. In January 1942, Chief of Staff Rear Admiral [[Matome Ugaki]] expressed strong disapproval of the newly remodeled torpedo cruisers and urged a revision to the Navy's tactics.&lt;ref name=Ugaki&gt;Ugaki, Fading Victory ''; page 74&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]] debated the issue, ''Ōi'' and ''Kitakami'' were converted to high speed transports, with {{sclass2-|Daihatsu|landing craft}}, and ''Kitakami'' was subsequently converted into a carrier for ''[[kaiten]]'' suicide torpedoes.

==Design==
The ''Kuma''-class hull design was based on a 5,500 ton nominal [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], with a high freeboard and light bridge structure, behind which was a tripod mast with the fire control platform and two searchlights. The design proved so versatile that it became the standard upon which all future light cruisers in the Japanese navy would be based.&lt;ref name= Stille/&gt;

The propulsion system for the ''Kuma'' class was based on four axial deceleration turbines with 12 boilers, providing {{convert|90000|hp|lk=in|abbr=on}}. Ten boilers were designed to burn [[Fuel oil|heavy oil]], and the remaining two burned a mixture of [[coal]] and oil. With improvements in geared-turbine engine technology, the ''Kuma''-class vessels were capable of the high speed of {{convert|36|kn|km/h}}, and a range of {{convert|9000|nmi|km|abbr=on}} at {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; The silhouette of the ''Kuma'' class was discernible by its three smoke stacks, with the stacks flaring out in a trumpet shape.

The number of [[14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun]]s was increased from four on the ''Tenryū'' class to seven on the ''Kuma'' class, centerline mounted in individual [[gun turret]]s, (two fore, three after and one on either side of the bridge). The positioning meant that only six of the guns could be brought to bear in a broadside.&lt;ref name= Gardner/&gt; As with the ''Tenryū'' class, the ''Kuma'' class remained highly deficient in anti-aircraft protection, with only two [[8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun]]s and two 6.5&amp;nbsp;mm machine guns. Provision was made for 48 [[naval mine]]s. The two triple torpedo launchers on the ''Tenryū'' class was changed to four double launchers, placed in pairs so that four torpedoes could be fired on each side. Eight reloads were also provided.&lt;ref name= Stille/&gt;

''Kiso'' was unique in that it had both a forward and aft flat surfaced superstructure, with a rotating floatplane take-off platform located aft. The platform appears to have never been used, and was removed in 1922, but her superstructure retained the shape of the hangar.

=== In service modifications===
From 1931-1932, provision was made for a catapult to launch one [[floatplane]] (typically a [[Kawanishi Aircraft Company|Kawanishi]] [[Kawanishi E7K|E7K1 &quot;Alf&quot;]] floatplane ) for scouting purposes on ''Kuma'' and ''Tama''. The catapult was situated aft, in between the No.5 and No.6 turrets.&lt;ref name= Stille/&gt;

From 1933-1934, the ships were renovated with a modified superstructure, replacing the canvas sides of the bridge with steel plate, and building a rangefinder tower behind the bridge was with either an {{convert|11.5|ft|m|sing=on}} or {{convert|13|ft|m|sing=on}} rangefinder. ''Kiso'' was also given anti-rain caps on her two forward stacks, which gave her a unique appearance.&lt;ref name= Stille/&gt;

By 1941, the 8-cm Type 3 guns were replaced by a twin-mount [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96 25 mm AA guns]], and the 6.5&amp;nbsp;mm machine guns were upgraded to 7.7&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name= Gardner/&gt; All of the ships in the ''Kuma'' class were progressively upgraded during the [[Pacific War]]. The modifications varied from vessel to vessel, but consisted of removing the aircraft catapult and at least one of the main 140-mm turrets, and replacing with twin or triple-mount Type 96 25-mm anti-aircraft guns. From 1943-1944, ''Kiso'' and ''Tama'' were given a twin turret with [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun]]s. ''Kiso'', ''Tama'' and ''Kitakami'' were the only in the class to receive [[radar]].&lt;ref name= Stille/&gt;

In August 1941 ''Ōi'',  ''Kitakami'' and ''Kiso'' were to undergo a conversion to ''torpedo cruisers'' to form a special torpedo attack squadron, but not enough Type 92 quadruple torpedo mounts were available so only the first two were converted,&lt;ref&gt;Stille, '' Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 '', page 16;&lt;/ref&gt; both ships three aft turrets were replaced by ten quadruple torpedo mounts, five per side, with a total of 40 torpedoes. In August 1942, they were modified into fast transports, with all of the torpedo tubes removed and replaced by [[Daihatsu class landing craft]], with depth charge racks and two Type 96 triple-mount anti-aircraft guns.&lt;ref name= Stille/&gt;

After ''Kitakami'' was damaged in 1944, she was converted into a ''[[kaiten]]'' carrier, with all of her armament removed, and replaced by two Type 89 single gun turrets (fore and aft), a total of 67 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns(12 triple, 31 single), two depth charge racks and eight Model 1 Kaiten. Removal of the aft turbine engines reduced her speed to 23 knots.&lt;ref name= Stille/&gt;

==Ships in class==
Five vessels were built in the ''Kuma'' class. Only one (''Kitakami'') survived the Pacific War.

;{{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kuma||2}} (球磨)

Ordered in 1917 to the [[Sasebo Navy Yard]], launched 14 July 1919, and completed 31 August 1920, ''Kuma'' was active in screening the landings of Japanese troops in the [[Philippines]] in the early months of [[World War II]], and remained stationed there for local defense. Later assigned to the [[Southwest Area Fleet]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]], she was refit at [[Singapore]] from October–November 1943. She was torpedoed by the submarine {{HMS|Tally-Ho|P317|6}} off the west coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] on 10 March 1944.&lt;ref name=Combined-Kuma&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/kuma_t.htm]  CombinedFleet.com: ''Kuma'' Tabular Record of Movement;&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tama||2}} (多摩)

Ordered in 1917 to [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], launched 10 February 1920, and completed 29 January 1921, Camouflaged in Arctic colors, ''Tama'' participated in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] and the [[Battle of the Komandorski Islands]] and spent most of the early part of [[World War II]] in northern waters. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to [[Rabaul]] and other locations in the [[Solomon Islands]]. After refit in Japan in late 1943, she remained in Japanese home waters until reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy’s all-out final defense of the Philippines in October 1944. She was at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], where she was damaged by USN aircraft and was torpedoed by USN submarines northeast of the Philippines on 25 October 1944 while attempting to return to [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref name=Combined-Tama&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/tama_t.htm]  CombinedFleet.com: ''Tama'' Tabular Record of Movement;&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kitakami||2}} (北上)

Ordered in 1917 to the [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]], launched 3 July 1920, and completed 15 April 1921, ''Kitakami'' was converted into a torpedo cruiser under a short-lived Imperial Japanese Navy program, which was abandoned at the eve of World War II. She subsequently participated in [[Battle of Midway]] as part of the Aleutian screening force. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to Rabaul and other locations in the Solomon Islands and [[New Guinea]]. From March 1943, she was assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet for escort and transport duties. After taking severe damage in a torpedo attack by the submarine {{HMS|Templar|P316|6}} on 27 January 1944, she returned to Japan for conversion to carrier for ''[[Kaiten]]'' human torpedoes, but never served in this capacity due to lack of fuel. She survived the end of the war, and was used as a tender for repatriation vessels after the war. She was scrapped from 10 August 1946 – 31 March 1947.&lt;ref name=Combined-Kitakami&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/kitakami_t.htm]  CombinedFleet.com: ''Kitakami'' Tabular Record of Movement;&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{ship|Japanese cruiser|Ōi||2}} (大井)

Ordered in 1917 to the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] in [[Kobe]], launched 15 July 1920, and completed 3 November 1921, ''Ōi'' was converted into a torpedo cruiser under a short-lived Imperial Japanese Navy programme, which was abandoned at the eve of World War II. She subsequently participated in the [[Battle of Midway]] as part of the Aleutian screening force. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to Rabaul and other locations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. From March 1943, she was assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet for escort and transport duties. She was torpedoed west of [[Manila]] on 10 September 1944.&lt;ref name=Combined-Oi&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/oi_t.htm]  CombinedFleet.com: ''Oi'' Tabular Record of Movement;&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kiso||2}} (木曾)

Ordered in 1917 to the [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], launched 14 December 1920, and completed 4 May 1921, ''Kiso'' participated in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands and spent most of the early part of World War II in northern waters. She was later used as a fast transport. After refit in Japan in late 1943, she remained in Japanese home waters until reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy’s all-out final defense of the Philippines in October 1944. She survived the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], and was assigned guard duties in the Philippines. She was sunk by USN carrier-based aircraft west of Manila on 13 November 1944.&lt;ref name=Combined-Kiso&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/kiso_t.htm]  CombinedFleet.com: ''Kiso'' Tabular Record of Movement;&lt;/ref&gt;
