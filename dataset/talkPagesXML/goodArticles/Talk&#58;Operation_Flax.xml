This page is in grevious error. Operation FLAX was carried out by Ninth Air Force, which was commanded by Maj. Gen. Lewish H. Brereton. Doolittle played no role in it. [[Special:Contributions/206.54.222.20|206.54.222.20]] ([[User talk:206.54.222.20|talk]]) 17:54, 19 February 2011 (UTC)

::No, you are in grievous error. Dootle was commander of NASAF ([[Northwest African Strategic Air Force]]) and he was ordered to plan and execute the operation for the USAAF. The Ninth Air Force is not important. It was merely a sub-command of the Theatre Commands. Even then, its groups were spread around all over the place in different Strategic commands (including in the Middle East). It was only part of the US force that took part. For example the 1st Fighter Group took part which belonged to the 12th Air Force. [[User:Dapi89|Dapi89]] ([[User talk:Dapi89|talk]]) 22:30, 19 February 2011 (UTC)
:::This is pertinent to an edit I just made. The article asserted that Ninth Air force was &quot;under Carl Spaatz&quot;, which I deleted. While technically true, inasmuch as all air operations in Northwest Africa were &quot;under&quot; Spaatz, it was misleading to the average reader not familiar with the Allied air command structure. I took it that Spaatz needed to be inserted into the narrative but this was not the way to do it. The paragraph wound up implying that Tedder and the commander of this sub-command (as characterized above) were making the final decision. In fact Spaatz ran the whole air shebang in Northwest Africa--Doo&lt;u&gt;lit&lt;/u&gt;tle included--and Tedder as commander of all air in the Med was his immediate commander. This is supposed to be a GA.--[[User:Reedmalloy|Reedmalloy]] ([[User talk:Reedmalloy|talk]]) 17:06, 18 October 2013 (UTC)
::::If something is correct then there is no real reason to delete it. I haven't a problem with countering an overly simplified word or two (which was intended to keep the blurb down). Tedder and Spaatz made the decision on whether or not the operation took place. That is a strategic-level decision. So the article is right to imply they were making the final decision: they were.
::::I think you also underestimate the influence Doolittle had. Spaatz did not step outside his area of responsibility nor did he set operational parameters. Doolittle ran this operation. Once the green light was given, he 'ran' things with support or advice from Spaatz and Tedder.
::::After the deletion I am going to have insert them earlier since no explanation of who they are appears until the Orbat section.
::::There is nothing there that is inappropriate for a good article. [[User:Dapi89|Dapi89]] ([[User talk:Dapi89|talk]]) 12:50, 19 October 2013 (UTC)

Operation Torch was NOT a purely American operation. There was a substantial British element. [[User:Darkmind1970|Darkmind1970]] ([[User talk:Darkmind1970|talk]]) 21:40, 2 July 2014 (UTC)</text>
