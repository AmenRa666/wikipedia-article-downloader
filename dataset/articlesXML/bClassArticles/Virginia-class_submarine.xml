The '''''Virginia'' class''', also known as the '''SSN-774 class''', is a class of [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] fast [[attack submarine|attack]] [[submarine]]s ([[SSK (US Navy)|hull classification symbol]] SSN) in service with the [[United States Navy]]. The submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of [[Blue-water navy|open-ocean]] and [[littoral]] (shallow coastal water) missions. They were conceived as a less expensive alternative to the [[Seawolf-class submarine|''Seawolf''-class attack submarines]], designed during the [[Cold War]] era. They are replacing older {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|1}}s, many of which have already been decommissioned. ''Virginia''-class submarines will be acquired through 2043, and are expected to remain in service past 2060.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defensetech.org/2014/02/12/navy-considers-future-after-virginia-class-subs/ |title=Navy Considers Future After Virginia-Class Subs |publisher=Defensetech.org |last=Osborn |first=Kris |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on recent updates to the designs, some of the ''Virginia''-class submarines are expected to still be in service in 2070.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2014/05/06/five-reasons-virginia-class-subs-are-the-face-of-future-warfare/ |title=Five Reasons Virginia-Class Subs Are The Face Of Future Warfare |last=Thompson |first=Loren |website=Forbes |date=6 May 2014  |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Virginia class submarine.jpg|thumb|left|Computer-based rendering of Virginia class attack submarine]]
The class was developed under the codename Centurion, renamed to New Attack Submarine (NAS) later on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gdeb.com/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SSN-774 Virginia class&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpoondatabases.com/encyclopedia/Entry1383.aspx |title=SSN-774 Virginia class |accessdate=23 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910002816/http://www.harpoondatabases.com/encyclopedia/entry1383.aspx |archivedate=10 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Centurion Study&quot; was initiated in February 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man//dod-101/sys/ship/docs/920721-cr.htm |title=Navy Report on New Attack Submarine (Senate - July 21, 1992) |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Virginia''-class submarines were the first US Navy warships designed with the help of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and visualization technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;USW W99&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;submarinesuppliers1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.submarinesuppliers.org/programs/index.php |title=Submarine Industrial Base Council |publisher=Submarinesuppliers.org |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119163338/http://www.submarinesuppliers.org/programs/index.php |archive-date=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2007 approximately 35 million labor hours were spent on designing the ''Virginia'' class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a478587.pdf |title=Sustaining U.S. Nuclear Submarine Design Capabilities |first=John F. |last=Schank |first2=Mark V. |last2=Arena |first3=Paul |last3=DeLuca |first4=Jessie |last4=Riposo |first5=Kimberly |last5=Curry |first6=Todd |last6=Weeks |first7=James |last7=Chiesa |publisher=National Defense Research Institute |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-8330-4160-9 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 9 million labor hours are required for the construction and completion of a single ''Virginia''-class submarine.&lt;ref name=&quot;submarinesuppliers1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/default.aspx |title=Naval Submarine League |publisher=Navalsubleague.com |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;navalsubleague1&quot;&gt;[http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/documents/Submarine%20Road%20Show%20NSL%2017%20Aug%202011%20NSL.ppsx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113065646/http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/documents/Submarine%20Road%20Show%20NSL%2017%20Aug%202011%20NSL.ppsx |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 4,000 suppliers are involved in the construction of the ''Virginia'' class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Jim |date=Winter 2011 |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/double_vision.html |title=Double Vision: Planning to Increase Virginia-Class Production |journal=Undersea Warfare |issue=43 |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each submarine is projected to make 14–15 deployments during its 33-year service life.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=John D., RAdm (ret) |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-06/sweet-smell-acquisition-success |title=The Sweet Smell of Acquisition Success |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |journal=Proceedings |volume=137 |issue=6/1,300 |date=June 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Virginia'' class was intended in part as a less expensive alternative to the ''Seawolf''-class submarines ($1.8 billion vs $2.8 billion), whose production run was stopped after just three boats had been completed. To reduce costs, the ''Virginia''-class submarines use many &quot;[[commercial off-the-shelf]]&quot; (COTS) components, especially in their computers and data networks. In practice, they actually cost less than $1.8 billion (in fiscal year 2009 dollars) each, due to improvements in shipbuilding technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;baker1005&quot; /&gt;

In hearings before both [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] committees, the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) and expert witnesses testified that the procurement plans of the ''Virginia'' class – one per year, accelerating to two per year beginning in 2012 – would result in high unit costs and an insufficient number of attack submarines,  according to some of the witnesses and the committee chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/congress/2000/00-06-27hunter.htm |title=Statement of The Honorable Duncan Hunter, Chairman, Subcommittee on Military Procurement, Submarine Force Structure and Modernization |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] Military Analysis Network |date=27 June 2000 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 10 March 2005 statement to the House Armed Services Committee, Ronald O'Rourke of the CRS testified that, assuming that the production rate remains as planned, &quot;production economies of scale for submarines would continue to remain limited or poor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;orourke1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/hasc/testimony/109thcongress/Projection%20Forces/3-10-05O'RourkeCRS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Ronald O'Rourke Specialist in National Defense Congressional Research Service before the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Projection Forces Hearing on Navy Force Architecture and Ship Construction |date=10 March 2005 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060604000350/http%3A//www%2Ehouse%2Egov/hasc/testimony/109thcongress/Projection%2520Forces/3%2D10%2D05O%27RourkeCRS%2Epdf |archivedate= 4 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat Company built a quarter-scale version of a ''Virginia''-class submarine dubbed Large Scale Vehicle II (LSV II) ''Cutthroat''. The vehicle was designed as an affordable test platform for new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auvac.org/configurations/view/197 |title=AUV System Spec Sheet Cutthroat LSV-2 configuration |publisher=Antonymous Undersea Vehicle Applications Center |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_11/submarine_stealth.html |title=Small Subs Provide Big Payoffs for Submarine Stealth |work=Undersea Warfare |last=Fox |first=David M., CDR |format=PDF |date=Spring 2001 |volume=3 |number=3 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Virginia'' class is built through an industrial arrangement designed to keep both [[Electric Boat Corporation|GD Electric Boat]] and [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] (the only two U.S. shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered vessels) in the submarine-building business.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/navy/submarines/ssn774_virginia.html |title=SSN-774 Virginia-class NSSN New Attack Submarine |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707133458/http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/navy/submarines/ssn774_virginia.html |archivedate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the present arrangement, the Newport News facility builds the stern, habitability, and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room and control room. The facilities alternate work on the reactor plant as well as the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery.

O'Rourke wrote in 2004 that, &quot;Compared to a one-yard strategy, approaches involving two yards may be more expensive but offer potential offsetting benefits.&quot;&lt;ref name=RL32418 /&gt; Among the claims of &quot;offsetting benefits&quot; that O'Rourke attributes to supporters of a two-facility construction arrangement is that it &quot;would permit the United States to continue building submarines at one yard even if the other yard is rendered incapable of building submarines permanently or for a sustained period of time by a catastrophic event of some kind&quot;, including an enemy attack.

In order to get the submarine's price down to $2 billion per submarine in FY-05 dollars, the Navy instituted a cost-reduction program to shave off approximately $400 million of each submarine's price tag. The project was dubbed &quot;2 for 4 in 12,&quot; referring to the Navy's desire to buy two boats for $4&amp;nbsp;billion in FY-12. Under pressure from Congress, the Navy opted to start buying two boats per year in FY-11, meaning that officials would not be able to get the $2&amp;nbsp;billion price tag before the service started buying two submarines per year. However, program manager Dave Johnson said at a conference on 19 March 2008 that the program was only $30&amp;nbsp;million away from achieving the $2&amp;nbsp;billion price goal, and would reach that target on schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidedefense.com/secure/defense_docnum.asp?f=defense_2002.ask&amp;docnum=NAVY-21-12-4 |accessdate=25 March 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia Class Program Office received the David Packard Excellence in Acquisition Award in 1996, 1998, 2008, &quot;for excelling in four specific award criteria: reducing life-cycle costs; making the acquisition system more efficient, responsive, and timely; integrating defense with the commercial base and practices; and promoting continuous improvement of the acquisition process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=40781 |title=Navy's Virginia Class Program Recognized for Acquisition Excellence |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Team Submarines Public Affairs |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the Navy signed a $14 billion contract with General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman to supply eight submarines. The contractors will deliver one submarine in each of fiscal 2009 and 2010, and two submarines on each of fiscal 2011, 2012, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2008/12/22/business/business-us-navy-submarines.html|title=General Dynamics And Northrop Awarded Submarine Deal|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 December 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contract will bring the Navy's ''Virginia''-class fleet to 18 submarines. And in December 2010, the [[United States Congress]] passed a defense authorization bill that expanded production to two subs per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDermott|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20101223/NWS09/312239514/-1/nws|title=House, Senate ok defense bill for 2011; sub plan stays on track|work=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]] |location=New London, Connecticut|date=23 December 2010|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two submarine-per-year production resumed on 2 September 2011 with commencement of {{USS|Washington|SSN-787|3}} construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ssn787&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Newswire2011/08SEP11-01.aspx |location=Washington, DC |publisher=NAVSEA – Naval Sea Systems Command|title=Construction Begins on SSN 787; Navy Transitions to Building Two Virginia Class Submarines Per Year|date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2008, the Navy christened {{USS|New Hampshire|SSN-778|3}}, the first Block II submarine. This boat was delivered eight months ahead of schedule and $54&amp;nbsp;million under budget. Block&amp;nbsp;II boats are built in four sections, compared to the ten sections of the Block I boats. This enables a cost saving of about $300 million per boat, reducing the overall cost to $2 billion per boat and the construction of two new boats per year. Beginning in 2010, new submarines of this class will include a software system that can monitor and reduce their [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] signatures when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/ssn-774-spiral-1.htm |title=SSN-774 Virginia-class NSSN New Attack Submarine |website=Global Security |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first full-duration six-month deployment was successfully carried out from 15 October 2009 to 13 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Communication |first=Mass |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/csg2/Pages/VARFD.aspx |title=VARFD.aspx |publisher=Public.navy.mil |date= |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222101140/http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/csg2/Pages/VARFD.aspx |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorization of full-rate production and the declaration of full operational capability was achieved five months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!-- This story was written by Naval Sea Systems Command Team Submarine Public Affairs  --&gt; |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=55866 |title=Virginia Class Program Reaches Major Milestone |publisher=United States Navy |location=Washington, DC |date=10 October 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, it was found that urethane tiles, applied to the hull to damp internal sound and absorb rather than reflect sonar pulses, were falling off while the subs were at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig |last=Hooper |url=http://nextnavy.com/virginia-class-when-does-hull-coating-separation-endanger-the-boat/ |title=Virginia Class: When does hull coating separation endanger the boat? |website=Next Navy|date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Kevin McCoy announced that the problems with the Mold-in-Place Special Hull Treatment for the early subs had been fixed in 2011, then ''Minnesota'' was built and found to have the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nextnavy.com/the-virginia-peel-why-are-2-billion-dollar-subs-losing-their-skin/ |title=The Virginia Peel: Why are $2 Billion Dollar Subs Losing Their Skin? |last1=Hooper |first1=Craig |date=7 November 2013 |website=Next Navy |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor Ross Babbage]] of the [[Australian National University]] has called on Australia to buy or lease a dozen ''Virginia''-class submarines from the United States, rather than locally build [[Collins-class submarine replacement project|12 replacements]] for its {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|1}}s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahnken|first=Tom|url=http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/02/09/growing_concern_down_under|title=Growing concern down under|journal=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=9 February 2011|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, just as two-per-year sub construction was supposed to commence, Congress failed to resolve the [[United States fiscal cliff]], forcing the Navy to attempt to &quot;de-obligate&quot; construction funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Cavas|url=http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20130303/DEFREG02/303030004/U-S-Navy-Sets-Budget-Cutting-Plans-Motion |title=U.S. Navy Sets Budget-cutting Plans in Motion |publisher=Blogs.defensenews.com |date=2 March 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovations ==
The ''Virginia'' class incorporates several innovations not found in previous US submarine classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;baker1005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Combat Fleets of the World, 1998–1999 |last= Baker|first=A. D. III |year=1998 |location= USA|isbn= 1-55750-111-4|page=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology barriers ===
Because of the low rate of ''Virginia'' production, the Navy entered into a program with [[DARPA]] to overcome technology barriers to lower the cost of attack submarines so that more could be built, to maintain the size of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=O'Rourke |first=Ronald|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL32914.pdf|title=Navy Ship Acquisition: Options for Lower-Cost Ship Designs — Issues for Congress|series=RL32914|format=PDF|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=23 June 2005|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photonics masts===
The ''Virginia'' class is the first to utilize photonic sensors instead of a traditional [[periscope]]: the class is equipped with high-[[image resolution|resolution]] cameras, along with light-intensification and [[thermographic camera|infrared sensors]], an infrared [[laser rangefinder]], and an integrated [[Electronic Support Measures]] (ESM) array. Two redundant sets of these sensors are mounted on two [[AN/BVS-1]] [[photonics mast]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;baker1005&quot; /&gt; located outside the [[pressure hull]]. Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through [[optical fiber]] data lines through [[signal processor]]s to the control center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claudio |last=Paschoa |url=http://www.marinetechnologynews.com/blogs/umm-photonics-mast-for-virginia-class-attack-submarines-700510 |title=UMM Photonics Mast for Virginia-class Attack |publisher=Marinetechnologynews.com |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual feeds from the masts are displayed on [[liquid-crystal display]] interfaces in the command center.&lt;ref name=&quot;USW W99&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graves |first=Barbara |first2=Edward |last2=Whitman |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_02/virginia_class.htm |title=Virginia Class: America's Next Submarine |journal=Undersea Warfare |publisher=US Navy |date=Winter 1999 |volume=1 |number=2 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of earlier optical periscopes required them to penetrate the pressure hull, reducing the structural integrity of the pressure hull as well as increasing the risk of flooding, and also required the submarine's control room to be located directly below the sail/fin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holian |first=Thomas |date=Fall 2004 |title=Eyes from the Deep: A History of U.S. Navy Submarine Periscopes |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_24/eyes.htm |work=Undersea Warfare |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of photonics masts (which do not penetrate the pressure hull) enabled the submarine control room to be relocated to a position inside the pressure hull which is not necessarily directly below the sail.&lt;ref name=&quot;seapower-digital1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.seapower-digital.com/seapower/february_march_2015#pg1 |title=Sea Power |issue=February/March 2015 |publisher=Navy League of the United States |pages=22–25 |date=19 February 2015 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current photonics masts have a visual appearance so different from the ordinary periscopes that when the submarine is detected, it can be distinctly identified as a ''Virginia''-class vessel. As a result, current photonic masts will be replaced with Low-Profile Photonics Masts (LPPM) which resemble traditional submarine periscopes more closely.&lt;ref name=&quot;seapower-digital1&quot;/&gt;

In the future, a non-rotational Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast may be fitted, enabling the submarine to obtain a simultaneous 360° view of the sea surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/~/media/Files/Fact-Sheets/31/Affordable-Modular-Panoramic-Photonics.ashx |title=Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast |publisher=Office of Naval Research |date=October 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Media-Center/Fact-Sheets/Affordable-Modular-Panoramic-Photonics-Mast.aspx |title=Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics |publisher=Office of Naval Research |date= |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propulsor ===
In contrast to a traditional bladed propeller, the ''Virginia'' class uses [[pump-jet]] propulsors (built by [[BAE Systems]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_049643/bae-systems-delivers-first-us-navy-submarine-propulsor-from-louisville-facility-receives-additional-243-million-contract |title=BAE Systems Delivers First U.S. Navy Submarine Propulsor from Louisville Facility, Receives Additional $24.3 Million Contract |publisher=BAE Systems |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally developed for the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Swiftsure|submarine|1}}s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propulsor significantly reduces the risks of [[cavitation]], and allows quieter operation.

=== Improved sonar systems ===
[[Sonar]] arrays aboard ''Virginia''-class submarines have an &quot;[[Open system (computing)|Open System Architecture]]&quot; (OSA) which enables rapid insertion of new hardware and software as they become available. [[Hardware upgrade]]s (dubbed Technology Insertions) are usually carried out every four years, while [[software update]]s (dubbed Advanced Processor Builds) are carried out every two years. ''Virginia''-class submarines feature several types of sonar arrays.&lt;ref name=&quot;npg13&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/policy/seapower/npg13/top-npg13.pdf |title=US Navy Program Guide 2013 |publisher=US Navy |date=2013 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Two high frequency active sonars mounted in the sail and bow. The chin-mounted (below the bow) and sail-mounted high frequency sonars supplement the (spherical/LAB) main sonar array, enabling safer operations in coastal waters, enhancing under-ice navigation, and improving [[anti-submarine warfare]] performance.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Virginia Payload Module ===
[[File:150801-N-EO381-162.JPG|thumb|right|{{USS|John Warner|SSN-785|6}} alongside, with forward Virginia Payload Tube hatch open]]
The Block III submarines have two multipurpose Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) replacing the dozen single purpose cruise missile launch tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/04/navy-sub-program-stumbles-ssn-north-dakota-delayed-by-launch-tube-troubles/ |title=Navy Sub Program Stumbles: SSN North Dakota Delayed By Launch Tube Troubles |last1=Freedberg Jr. |first1=Sydney J. |date=16 April 2014 |work=Breaking Defense |publisher=Breaking Media, Inc. |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Block V submarines built from 2019 onward will have an additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM) mid-body section, increasing their overall length. The VPM will add four more VPTs of the same diameter and greater height, located on the centerline, carrying up to seven Tomahawk missiles apiece, that would replace some of the capabilities lost when the SSGN conversion {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|1}}s are retired from the fleet.&lt;ref name=RL32418 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VPM&quot; &gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/issues/archives/issue_47/virginia.html |title=The Virginia Payload Module: A Revolutionary Concept for Attack Submarines |last1=Hasslinger |first1=Karl, CAPT, USN (ret) |last2=Pavlos |first2=John |journal=Undersea Warfare |date=Winter 2012 |issue=47 |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially eight payload tubes/silos were planned&lt;ref name=&quot;VPM&quot; /&gt; but this was later rejected in favour of 4 tubes installed in a 70-foot long module between the operations compartment and the propulsion spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;VPM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.usni.org/2013/11/04/navy-selects-virginia-payload-module-design-concept |title=Navy Selects Virginia Payload Module Design Concept |work=USNI News |publisher=U.

The VPM could potentially carry (non-nuclear) medium-range ballistic missiles. Adding the VPM would increase the cost of each submarine by $500 million (2012 prices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grossman |first=Elaine M. |url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/us-senate-panel-limits-navy-effort-add-missiles-attack-submarines/ |title=U.S. Senate Panel Curbs Navy Effort to Add Missiles to Attack Submarines |agency=Global Security Newswire |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This additional cost would be offset by reducing the total submarine force by four ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cavas |first=Christopher P. |url=http://archive.navytimes.com/article/20130204/NEWS/302040306/Navy-cuts-fleet-goal-to-306-ships |title=Navy cuts fleet goal to 306 ships |work=Navy Times |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent reports state that as a cost reduction measure the VPM would carry only Tomahawk SLCM and possibly unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) with the new price tag now estimated at $360–380 million per boat (in 2010 prices). The VPM launch tubes/silos will reportedly be similar in design to the ones planned for the ''Ohio'' class replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Robert T. |url=http://www.ct.gov/oma/cwp/view.asp?a=3422&amp;q=525006 |title=Lower Ohio-Class Replacement Cost Tied To VA-Class Multiyear Deal: Could Achieve 8 To 15 Percent Savings |website=State of Connecticut, Office of Military Affairs |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kris |last=Osborn |url=http://defensetech.org/2014/01/28/navy-electric-boat-test-tube-launched-underwater-vehicle/ |title=Navy, Electric Boat Test Tube-Launched Underwater Vehicle |publisher=Defense Tech |location=Groton, Connecticut |date=28 January 2014 |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|September 2013}} the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO) was still hoping to field the VPM from 2027,&lt;ref name=Greenert20130918&gt;{{cite report |url=http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20130918/101291/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-GreenertUSNJ-20130918.pdf |format=PDF |first=Jonathan, Admiral |last=Greenert |authorlink=Jonathan Greenert |title=Statement Before The House Armed Services Committee On Planning For Sequestration In FY 2014 And Perspectives Of The Military Services On The Strategic Choices And Management Review |date=18 September 2013 |publisher=US House of Representatives |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but deployment now seems unlikely since the [[Joint Requirements Oversight Council]] (JROC) moved the program in February 2013 from the 'Prompt Strike' budget to the main Navy shipbuilding account, which is already under financial pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/global-security-newswire/pentagon-lawmakers-deal-blows-to-navy-fast-strike-missile-effort-20130731 |title=Pentagon, Lawmakers Deal Blows to Navy Fast-Strike Missile Effort |first=Elaine M. |last=Grossman |agency=Global Security Newswire |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Journal |date=31 July 2013 |access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Block I ===
Modular construction techniques were incorporated during construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Patani |first=Arif |url=http://navylive.dodlive.mil/2012/09/24/next-generation-ohio-class/ |title=Next Generation Ohio-Class |website=Navy Live |publisher=US Navy |date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier submarines (e.g., ''Los Angeles''-class SSNs) were built by assembling the pressure hull and then installing the equipment via cavities in the pressure hull. This required extensive construction activities within the narrow confines of the pressure hull which was time-consuming and dangerous. Modular construction was implemented in an effort to overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a ''Virginia''-class submarine.&lt;ref name=Holmander&gt;{{cite news |first1=John D. |last1=Holmander |first2=Thomas |last2=Plante |title=The Four-Module Build Plan: The Second Decade of Virginia-class Construction Gets Better |journal=Undersea Warfare |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/build_plan.html |publisher=US Navy |date=Winter 2011 |issue=43 |access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Johnson |first1=David C., RDML (sel.) |first2=George M. |last2=Drakeley |first3=George M. |last3=Smith |title=Engineering the Solution: Virginia-Class Submarine Cost Reduction |conference=Engineering the Total Ship (ETS) 2008 |url=https://www.navalengineers.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/2008%20Proceedings%20Documents/ETS%202008/VA%20Class%20ASNE%20Paper%20FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |location=Falls Church, Virginia |publisher=American Society of Naval Engineers |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Block II ===
Block II boats were built in four sections rather than ten sections, saving about $300 million per boat. Block II boats (excluding SSN-778) were also built under a multi-year procurement agreement as opposed to a block-buy contract in Block I, enabling savings in the range of $400 million ($80 million per boat).&lt;ref name=RL32418/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt; As a result of improvements in the construction process, ''New Hampshire'' was 500 million USD cheaper, required 3.7 million fewer labor hours to build (25% less) thus shortening the construction period by 15 months (20% less) compared to ''Virginia''.&lt;ref name=Holmander/&gt;

===Block V===
Block V subs may incorporate the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which would give guided-missile capability when the [[SSGN]]s are retired from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Virginia Payload Module (VPM) |website=General Dynamics - Electric Boat |url=http://www.gdeb.com/news/advertising/ |accessdate=4 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Block V subs are expected to triple the capacity of shore targets for each boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes1&quot;/&gt;

=== Future acquisitions ===
The Navy plans to acquire at least 30 ''Virginia''-class submarines,&lt;ref name=&quot;jeffhead1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffhead.com/usn21/nssn.htm |title=US Navy 21st Century - SSN Virginia Class |publisher=Jeffhead.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;submarinesuppliers2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.submarinesuppliers.org/programs/index.php |title=Submarine Industrial Base Council |publisher=Submarinesuppliers.org |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, more recent data provided by the Naval Submarine League (in 2011) and the Congressional Budget Office (in 2012) seems to imply that more than 30 may eventually be built. The Naval Submarine League believes that up to 10&amp;nbsp;Block&amp;nbsp;V boats will be built.&lt;ref name=&quot;navalsubleague1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/default.aspx |title=Naval Submarine League |publisher=Navalsubleague.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same source also states that 10 additional submarines could be built after Block&amp;nbsp;V submarines, with 5 in the so-called Block&amp;nbsp;VI and 5 in Block&amp;nbsp;VII, largely due to the delays experienced with the &quot;Improved ''Virginia''&quot;. These 20&amp;nbsp;submarines (10&amp;nbsp;Block&amp;nbsp;V, 5&amp;nbsp;Block&amp;nbsp;VI, 5&amp;nbsp;Block&amp;nbsp;VII) would carry VPM bringing the total number of ''Virginia''-class submarines to 48 (including the 28&amp;nbsp;submarines in Blocks I, II, III and IV). The CBO in its 2012 report states that 33&amp;nbsp;''Virginia''-class submarines will be procured in the 2013–2032 timeframe,&lt;ref name=&quot;cbo&quot;/&gt; resulting in 49&amp;nbsp;submarines in total since 16 were already procured by the end of 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS Weapons&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_04_10_2013_p0-567382.xml |title=Funding For U.S. Navy Subs Runs Deep |work=Aviation Week |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a long production run seems unlikely but it should be noted that another naval program, the {{sclass|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}, is still ongoing even though the first vessel was procured in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL32109.pdf |title= Navy DDG-51 and DDG-1000 Destroyer Programs: Background and Issues for Congress|first=Ronald|last=O'Rourke |date=22 October 2013 |work=[[Congressional Research Service]] |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCullough III |first=Bernard, VAdm (ret) |url=http://www.usni.org/print/25780 |title=Now Hear This - The Right Destroyer at the Right Time |journal=Proceedings |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |date=January 2013 |volume=139 |issue=1/1,319 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources believe that production will end with Block&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/ssn-774.htm |title=SSN-774 Virginia-class NSSN New Attack Submarine |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, data provided in CBO reports tends to vary considerably compared to earlier editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbo&quot;/&gt;

==SSN(X)/Improved ''Virginia''==
Initially dubbed Future Attack Submarine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/fas.htm|title=Future Attack Submarine|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Improved ''Virginia'' class in Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports,&lt;ref name=&quot;cbo&quot;/&gt; the SSN(X) or Improved ''Virginia''-class submarines will be an evolved version of the ''Virginia'' class.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbo&quot;/&gt;

In late 2014, the Navy began early preparation work on the SSN(X). It was planned that the first submarine would be procured in 2025. However, their introduction (i.e., procurement of the first submarine) has been pushed back to 2033/2034.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=An Analysis of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2011 Shipbuilding Plan |url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/05-25-navyshipbuilding.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |number=Pub. No. 4116 |date=May 2010 |access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The long-range shipbuilding plan is for the new SSN to be authorized in 2034, and become operational by 2044 after the last Block VII ''Virginia'' is built. Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified is the need to integrate with off-board systems so future ''Virginia'' boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the [[Pennsylvania State University]] could allow a torpedo to hit a target {{convert|200|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase. Targeting information might also come from another platform like a patrol aircraft or an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) launched from the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Navy Starting Work on New SSN(X) Nuclear Attack Submarine |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/10/23/navy-starting-work-new-ssnx-nuclear-attack-submarine |work=USNI News |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |date=23 October 2014 |access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified a quieter advanced propulsion system and the ability to control multiple [[unmanned underwater vehicle]]s (UUVs) at once as key SSN(X) components.  The future submarines will operate through the end of the 21st century, and potentially into the 22nd century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.usni.org/2016/03/09/peo-subs-navys-future-attack-sub-will-need-stealthy-electric-drive-controls-for-multiple-uuvs PEO Subs: Navy's Future Attack Sub Will Need Stealthy Advanced Propulsion, Controls for Multiple UUVs] - News.USNI.org, 9 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; New propulsion technology, moving beyond the use of a rotating mechanical device to push the ship through the water, could come in the form a [[biomimetics|biomimetic]] propulsion system that would eliminate noise-generating moving parts like the drive shaft and the spinning blades of the propulsor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/us-navys-next-submarine-super-stealthy-now-underwater-16978 US Navy's Next Submarine: Super Stealthy and Now Underwater Aircraft Carrier?] - Nationalinterest.org, 14 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Humor ==
Beginning in 2015, [[Dan's Papers]], a weekly lifestyle publication in the Hamptons area of Long Island, New York, initiated satirical news spoofs featuring the &quot;Hamptons Police Submarine Unit&quot; that caricaturized the affluent area's police department acquisition of a &quot;military surplus&quot; Virginia class submarine for routine ocean patrols and law enforcement, with similar tongue-in-cheek overtones of excessive [[militarization of police]].  While perhaps clearly a spoof to an informed reader, the news reports were otherwise realistic and of consequent readership response that the paper later featured a spoof local investigation titled &quot;Area Man Reveals Hamptons Police Submarine Story as Hoax.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danspapers.com/2015/06/hamptons-police-submarine-unit-makes-first-arrest/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danspapers.com/2015/06/area-man-reveals-hamptons-police-submarine-story-as-hoax/&lt;/ref&gt;  The satire was also of sufficient quality to eventually lead to the creation of a [[Snopes.com]] refutation of the existence of such an expensive ($2.688 Billion) military surplus acquisition for local police department usage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/fake-news-hampton-sub/&lt;/ref&gt;
