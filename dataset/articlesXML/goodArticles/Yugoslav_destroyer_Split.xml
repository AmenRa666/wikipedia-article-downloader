The '''Yugoslav destroyer ''Split''''' was a large [[destroyer]] designed for the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the late 1930s. Construction began in 1939, but she was captured incomplete by the Italians during the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. They continued to build the ship, barring a brief hiatus, but she was not completed before she was [[scuttled]] after the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender in September 1943]]. The Germans occupied [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Marine salvage|refloated]] the destroyer later that year, but made no efforts to continue work. The ship was scuttled again before the city was taken over by the [[Yugoslav Partisan]]s in late 1944. ''Split'' was refloated once more, but the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was able to do little with her before the [[Tito–Stalin Split]] in 1948 halted most work. Aid and equipment from the United States and Great Britain finally allowed her to be completed 20 years after construction began. She was commissioned in July 1958 and served as the navy's [[flagship]] for most of her career. ''Split'' became a ''training ship'' in the late 1970s after a [[boiler]] explosion; she was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1980, and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] six years later.

==Design==
The Yugoslav Navy decided to order a single large destroyer rather than a repeat pair of smaller {{sclass-|Beograd|destroyer|2}}s in the late 1930s because the Navy's planners didn't believe that the smaller ships could adequately support the raiding strategy that it intended to conduct in the event of a war with Italy. The staff decided on a much larger equivalent of the [[flotilla leader]] {{ship|Yugoslav destroyer|Dubrovnik||2}} that could out-gun any Italian destroyer and cover the escape and return to base of the raiding forces. The French company [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] was selected and based the new ship on their design for the {{convert|2610|t|LT|adj=on|sp=us}} {{sclass-|Le Fantasque|destroyer|2}}. She was built by [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]] at their shipyard in Split and was named after her place of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yugoslavs chose to buy the components from a variety of different nations. The pairs of geared [[steam turbine]]s and [[Yarrow boiler]]s were intended to give the ship a speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|55000|shp|lk=in}} and were purchased from Great Britain. The [[Ship gun fire-control system|fire-control system]], with two [[Director (military)|directors]], and radios were French while the armament was supplied by the [[Škoda Works]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Bofors]] of [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=ch0&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's designed armament was five 56-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[Skoda 14 cm/56 naval gun|Škoda {{convert|12.7|cm|adj=on|1|sp=us}} guns]] in single mounts, five single 43-caliber [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|1|adj=on|sp=us}}]]{{refn|These were early versions of the famous Bofors gun with shortened barrels.&lt;ref name=ch0/&gt;|group=Note}} [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]], four single [[ZB vz.60|{{convert|15|mm|adj=on|1|sp=us}} ZB vz.60]] [[anti-aircraft machinegun]]s,{{refn|Whitley&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; and Gardiner, et al.&lt;ref name=g6&gt;Gardiner, et al, p. 643&lt;/ref&gt; report larger numbers of 40 and 15&amp;nbsp;mm guns, but these appear to be confused with the total numbers ordered by the Yugoslavs, which included spares. In addition Bofors never made a twin-gun mount for their 40&amp;nbsp;mm gun until after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} and two triple mounts for {{convert|53.3|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yugoslav emphasis on anti-aircraft defense meant that ''Split'' could only have a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the [[Fire room|boiler rooms]] were adjacent to the [[engine room]]. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
The ship was [[laid down]] in July 1939 with her [[Ship naming and launching|launching]] scheduled for the following year and completion by the end of 1942. By the time the Italians joined the Germans in [[Battle of France|invading France]] in May 1940, only {{convert|600|t|LT|sp=us}} of the {{convert|1100|t|LT|sp=us|0}} of material necessary to launch her had been delivered. The British government embargoed her machinery in 1940, despite French protests, when it discovered surreptitious contacts between the Yugoslav and Soviet governments. The Swedish government embargoed the Bofors guns due to the war and the German control of the Škoda Works meant that the Yugoslavs had to suspend construction of ''Split''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 101–02&lt;/ref&gt;

When the city of Split was captured by the Italians on 14 April 1941, the hull remained undamaged and the ''Regia Marina'' decided to complete the ship after a delay of several months. They renamed the ship ''Spalato'', the Italian name for the city of Split. New machinery was ordered from [[Franco Tosi Meccanica (FTM)|Franco Tosi]], and five 45-caliber [[135 mm /45 Italian naval gun|{{convert|13.5|cm|abbr=on|1}} guns]], as many [[Cannone-Mitragliera da 37/54 (Breda)|Breda {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on|1}} AA guns]] as could be fitted, and four twin mounts for [[Breda Model 35|Breda {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on|1}} light AA guns]] replaced the Czech and Swedish weapons. One torpedo tube mount was removed and the Italians planned to add [[depth charge]] throwers and racks, the capacity for 40 [[naval mine|mines]] and an [[Gufo radar|EC-3 ter Gufo radar]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 102–03&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was lightly damaged by saboteurs in December which disrupted progress and the ''Regia Marina'' decided to suspend construction in April 1942 as she remained nearly two years from completion. By late 1942, the ''Regia Marina''{{'}}s shortage of destroyers had reached a point that every possible hull was needed and construction restarted at a high priority. This allowed her to be launched on 18 July 1943, but shortly afterwards a change in the Italian leadership caused any further work to be suspended in August and the resources used in her construction to be diverted to finish a large group of small wooden [[minesweeper]]s. During the fighting between the Germans and the Italians after the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]] on 9 September, ''Spalato'' was scuttled in Split harbor on 24 September. The Germans occupied Split three days later, refloated the ship several weeks later and stripped her of any valuable material. As part of their [[Scorched earth|scorched-earth strategy]] as they abandoned Split, the Germans scuttled ''Spalato'' and wrecked the shipyard before the Yugoslav Partisans occupied the port on 27 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 103–06&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postwar completion ===
The new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist government of Yugoslavia]] lacked any sizable warships after the end of the war and decided to resurrect ''Split'' as the centerpiece of their new navy. The [[Yugoslav Navy]] ordered replacement parts for the machinery from Franco Tosi and contacted Škoda in 1948 to get delivery of her original main armament, which had sat out the war in a [[warehouse]]. The damage to the shipyard meant that the navy had to tow the ship to the [[Ganz &amp; Co. Danubius|Kvarner Shipyard]] (formerly the ''Cantieri navali del Quarnaro'') in [[Rijeka]]. Shortly afterwards, however, the Tito-Stalin split deprived the ship of her main armament and the technical assistance needed to complete her.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 106–07&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Yugoslavs re-launched ''Split'' in March 1950 to free up the [[slipway]], but no other work was done. In 1953 there was a rapprochement with the [[NATO]] powers and the American and the British agreed to help complete the ship. The Tosi machinery ordered earlier had been used for other ships so the British agreed to furnish her propulsion machinery while the Americans provided the ship's armament, fire-control equipment and electronics.&lt;ref name=c7&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Split'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|120|m|ftin|sp=us}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|3.7|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The ships displaced {{convert|2400|t|LT|sp=us|0}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard]] and {{convert|3000|t|LT|sp=us|0}} at [[deep load]]. She was powered by two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared steam turbines, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], using steam provided by two [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s. The turbines were designed to produce {{convert|50000|shp|sp=us}}, which would propel the ship at {{convert|31.5|kn}}. ''Split'' carried {{convert|590|t|LT|0|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]], although her range is unknown, and had a crew of 240.&lt;ref name=g6/&gt;

The main armament of ''Split'' consisted of four 38-caliber [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}}]] guns in single mounts, one [[superfiring]] pair each fore and aft of the superstructure. Her [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of four twin-gun and four single mounts for [[Licensed production|license-built]] Bofors 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns. The ship carried one quintuple set of 21-inch torpedo tubes and retained her capacity for 40 mines. For anti-submarine combat, ''Split'' was equipped with two [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] [[spigot mortar]]s, six depth-charge throwers and two depth-charge racks. The ship was fitted with a Mk 37 fire-control director for the 5-inch guns and a Mk 51 director for the AA guns. The Mk 37 director was equipped with a Mk 12 [[fire-control radar]] and a Mk 22 [[Height finder|height-finding radar]]. SC and SG-1 [[search radar]]s completed her radar suite.&lt;ref name=c7/&gt;

==Service==
Construction proceeded at a snail's pace and the ship was finally [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 4 July 1958, although she did not enter service until 1959. She immediately became the navy's flagship and retained that position for most of her career. ''Split'' proved to be [[Ship stability|top-heavy]], short ranged, slow and very cramped for in service. She accidentally collided with the ex-Italian [[torpedo boat]] ''Biokovo'' in 1963, damaging the latter so badly that she was immediately struck from the [[Navy List]]. In the late 1970s, an explosion of one of ''Split''{{'}}s main boiler steam lines killed all of the men standing watch in the boiler room. The boiler was not repaired and she was limited to a speed of {{convert|24|kn}}. The ship became a stationary training ship afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; She was decommissioned in 1980, struck on 2 February 1984 and scrapped in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freivogel|first=Zvonimir|title=Scrapping of Various Warships|journal=Warship International|publisher=International Naval Research Organization|location=Toledo, OH|volume=XXXI|issue=4|pages=428–29|issn=0043-0374|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
