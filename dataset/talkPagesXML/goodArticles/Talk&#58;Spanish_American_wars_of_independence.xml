== Main image ==

All the important articles about wars in Wikipedia use a collage of important battles or images as the main image. For this I made [[:File:Independencia sudamericana.jpg]], but it was recently removed as having perhaps some Argentine bias in the chosing of the images. I'm open to suggestions of possible ideas to replace images, but always having in mind that the battles should be key to the development of the war itself, not mere skirmishs, and that the heroes in them should not be repeated if possible.  

The one of the crossing of the Andes have a higher size because it's a square image instead of a rectangular one. Yes, this arrangement gives it more predominance, but I don't think that's much of a problem: it is clearly the most important military action of the whole war, and the image in it have prominent images of San Martín and O'Higgins, heroes of Argentina and Chile, which is better than having 2 different images for both. 

The battle of Salta may be a potencial candidate for replacement, if a better option is suggested. It was a key battle in Argentine independence but not a decisive one, and I'm not sure about its effects outside of Argentina.

*This picture is not [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]]
[[File:Independencia sudamericana.jpg|300px]]
*Description:
**'''Cap: San Martin (argentinian)'''
**4 minor pictures:
***Pisba pass (Colombia) 
***'''Battle of Salta (argentinian)'''
***'''Gauchos (argentinian)'''
***Battle of Ayacucho (Perou)


Main objections:
* no NPOV [[San Martin]] is in the big cap of whole independence.
* There are no picture representative of [[Royalists]]
* There are no picture representative of independence of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]
* There are no picture representative of independence of [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]]
* etc etc etc

MBelgrano your image look argentinians pictures: then put your national picture in the article of [[Argentine War of Independence]]

'''Sugestions for New Image:'''
*Cap: continental map with actual boundaries (as now) or of '''independente nations at end of war''': Mexican Empire, Great Columbia,Peru,Chile,Bolivia,Paraguay, and Rio de la Plata, and remaining colonies of Spain in Americas.
*The rest of four minor pictures:
**one for main battle of Bolivar (Or equivalent)
**one for main battle San Martin (Or equivalent)
**one for military campaign in New Spain (Or equivalent)
**one for Spain military effort (Or equivalent)

::I have done most the work on writing or translating articles on these war on the Norwegian Wikipedia, and I support the idea of a collage picture in the infobox. I made a navigation box: [[no:Mal:Kampanjeboks latinamerikansk uavhengighet]] to reflect upon the different aspects of the war, which you might consider as an idea, though I am not really confident in it (and one of the pictures (Bolívar crossing the Andes) had to be relaced). But otherwise I support Santos30's suggestion. Anyway, I hope you can use images that could be transferd to Commons and as such used on other projects.  [[User:Yonaka|Yonaka]] ([[User talk:Yonaka|talk]]) 13:22, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

With respect to [[User:Hpav7|Hpav7]], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spanish_American_wars_of_independence&amp;oldid=359272607 previous image] put by [[User:Santos30|Santos30]] with the smaller globe at the bottom was more esthetically pleasing. In the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spanish_American_wars_of_independence&amp;oldid=360638737 current version] the globe is overpowering and diminishes the impact that these paintings have on the reader's imagination. A map, or maps, would go perfectly well in the body of the text.[[User:TriniMuñoz|TriniMuñoz]] ([[User talk:TriniMuñoz|talk]]) 09:51, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

:I think the same. It may be up to discussion which should be the images to include, but if we check around wikipedia, the idea itself, using a collage of related images as the lead and most prominent image, is a common standard in articles about wars. See for example [[World War II]], [[Hundred Years' War]], [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Vietnam War]], among other great wars. The map was a good alternative until such a collage was made, but now that it is, and there are not very strong concerns about the images used by it, there's little reason not to use it in the same style other articles do. [[User:MBelgrano|MBelgrano]] ([[User talk:MBelgrano|talk]]) 11:31, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

::Agree with TriniMuñoz and MBelgrano. Salut, --&lt;small&gt;[[User:IANVS|IANVS]] ([[User talk:IANVS|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/IANVS|cont]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:54, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

:::As we are 3 supporting here the use of the collage as lead image (plus Santos 30 at my talk page, and the creator of the current one), I have proceed to restore it as the only image. The map has been moved to a section below that details the consequences of the war. [[User:MBelgrano|MBelgrano]] ([[User talk:MBelgrano|talk]]) 00:17, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

==Animated Map not working===
File:Hisparevol.gif does not work unless click on twice to see in full resolution. Even then it changes far to quickly and needs to be slowed down.[[User:Gaius Octavius Princeps|Gaius Octavius Princeps]] ([[User talk:Gaius Octavius Princeps|talk]]) 12:15, 21 March 2011 (UTC)

:That was my file. I created the GIF with [[GraphicConverter]]® 6.7 back in Dec. 2009. It worked when I first uploaded it, but it stopped soon after. It must have been something with Graphic Converter's animation. I now have access to [[Adobe Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop CS3]]® 10.0.1 for the Mac, and I recreated it.  I'm not the handiest when it comes to GIF creation, but following Octavii suggestion, I set the frame time at five seconds each. With the new file, the GIF seems to be functioning as viewed in the article. Best, [[User:TriniMuñoz|TriniMuñoz]] ([[User talk:TriniMuñoz|talk]]) 03:50, 12 September 2011 (UTC)

== Ready for GA? ==

Should we nominate this article for Good Article status, or do you think it needs more work? [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 23:06, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

:{{OK}} ready for Good Article --[[User:Santos30|Santos30]] ([[User talk:Santos30|talk]]) 01:11, 20 November 2011 (UTC)

== A-Class review ==

Are any of you interested in bringing this forward to a WikiProject for A-class review?  [[User:DCI2026|''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0f0&quot;&gt;DCI&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0000f1&quot;&gt;]]''[[User talk:DCI2026|talk]]''&lt;/span&gt; 02:08, 21 November 2011 (UTC)

:Thanks for the review. However, I must clarify that I'm the nominator but not the main contributor of this article, so I'm not taking credit for it. I just thought that it was a very good article, which fits all the requirements, and I have some books around if there were requests of further clarification; but that's it. It's Trinimuñoz who made most of the work. 
:As for A-Class review, I think that should be left for later. In my experience, writing everything about a topic, provide a good style and follow a &quot;one reference per paragraph and red flag sentence&quot; policy is good enough for GA review, but A and Featured take a little more. Referencing should be expanded to &quot;One reference per sentence&quot;, the manual of style should be verfied point by point (some things like paragraph size or space between images are self-evident when someone writes, but there are plenty of small details as well, as types of dashes, easy to forget and hard to notice unless seeking specifically for it), and even then, one or two peer reviews just to be sure there's nothing missing [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 03:07, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
::That's fine; we can leave it at GA for a while.  [[User:DCI2026|''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0f0&quot;&gt;DCI&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0000f1&quot;&gt;]]''[[User talk:DCI2026|talk]]''&lt;/span&gt; 13:02, 21 November 2011 (UTC)

== Portugal-Spain alliance 1811? ==
Please [[User:Cambalachero]] give us the references, I never read something like that. As far I know Portugal never support the spaniards in their war against patriots.--[[User:Santos30|Santos30]] ([[User talk:Santos30|talk]]) 15:44, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

:This took place in 1811, at the Banda Oriental. Buenos Aires had made the May Revolution in 1810, but Montevideo stayed loyal to the authorities in Spain. Then, in 1811, the oriental countryside rebelled against Montevideo, and led by Artigas, joined forces with Buenos Aires. With the victory at the battle of Las Piedras, they began a siege to Montevideo. Incapable to resist with his own forces, Javier de Elío requested help from Portugal (Brazil was not independent yet). The &quot;Ejército Pacificador de la Banda Oriental&quot; joined the conflict on July 1811, nearly 4.000 men led by Diego de Souza. This led to a conflict between Buenos Aires and Artigas: with the recent defeats at the Upper Peru and Paraguay, Buenos Aires gave up the siege against Montevideo and signed an armistice, leaving Artigas alone against both the royalists and the Portuguese. The whole story, in Spanish, can be check at [[:es:Sitio de Montevideo (1811)]] (not translated yet). In short, Portugal aided with troops a royalist leader. And, as pointed, it is correct that the [[Luso-Brazilian invasion]] was not in support of Spain, but that's another conflict. [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 16:38, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

::OK I see the local support (annexation) to [[Banda Oriental]] on 1811, but is the first invasion of [[Cisplatina]] by Portugal (We need a traslation of Cisplatina wars).--[[User:Santos30|Santos30]] ([[User talk:Santos30|talk]]) 18:34, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

==Dominican Republic==
There is no mention of the country, its independence from Spain, its re-annexation or its second independence from Spain.--[[User:El Mayimbe|El Mayimbe]] ([[User talk:El Mayimbe|talk]]) 05:39, 11 May 2012 (UTC)

== 1810-1818 in the Southern Cone ==

While I welcome the countinuing expansion of this article, I noted that there is no mention of the key military feats of the [[Argentine war of independence]] before the [[Crossing of the Andes]]. These developments are important as they included action in the territories of four current nations and secured a stronghold that was never reconquered by the royalists, and from where San Martín could launch its campaigns.
