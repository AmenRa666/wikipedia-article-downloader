'''No. 1 Flying Training School''' ('''No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS''') was a school of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).  It was one of the Air Force's original units, dating back to the service's formation in 1921, when it was established at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria. By the early 1930s, the school comprised training, [[Fighter Squadron RAAF|fighter]], and [[Seaplane Squadron RAAF|seaplane]] components. It was re-formed several times in the ensuing years, initially as '''No.&amp;nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School''' (No.&amp;nbsp;1 SFTS) in 1940, under the wartime [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. After graduating nearly 3,000 pilots, No.&amp;nbsp;1 SFTS was disbanded in late 1944, when there was no further requirement to train Australian aircrew for service in Europe.

The school was re-established in 1946 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS at [[RAAF Base Uranquinty|RAAF Station Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and transferred to Point Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training to cope with the demands of the [[Korean War]] and [[Malayan Emergency]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as '''No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School''' (No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS); it moved to [[RAAF Base Pearce]], Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's [[air traffic controller]]s. Its pilot trainees included [[Australian Army|Army]], [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]], and foreign students as well as Air Force personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of [[No. 1 Basic Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS was re-formed as [[No. 2 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Training School]] and No.&amp;nbsp;1 BFTS was re-formed as No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS in 1993.

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:P00448.005Avro504K1926.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Avro 504K of No. 1 FTS, July 1926|alt=Manned single-engined military biplane parked on airfield]]
No. 1 Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS) was the first unit to be formally established as part of the new [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian Air Force]] on 31&amp;nbsp;March 1921 (the term &quot;Royal&quot; was added in August that year). No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS was formed from the remnants of Australia's original military flying unit, [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]], at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother41&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Squadron Leader [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|William Anderson]], who was also in charge of the Point Cook base, was No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS's first commanding officer.&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130063b.htm? |title=Anderson, William Hopton|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school's initial complement of staff was twelve officers and 67 airmen.&lt;ref name=ThirdBrother41/&gt;

In December 1921, the Australian Air Board prepared to form its first five [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] and allocate aircraft to each, as well as to the nascent flying school. The plan was for No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS to receive twelve [[Avro 504]]Ks and four [[Sopwith Pup]]s, and the squadrons a total of eight [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, eight [[Airco DH.9]]s, and three [[Fairey III]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Funding problems forced the Air Force to disband the newly raised squadrons on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1922 and re-form them as [[Flight (military unit)|flights]] in a composite squadron under No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Flight Lieutenant [[Frank McNamara (VC)|Frank McNamara, VC]], took command of the school.&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100340b.htm?|title= McNamara, Frank Hubert (Francis)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural flying course commenced in January 1923. Basic instruction took place on the Avro 504Ks, and more advanced or specialised training on the school's other aircraft. Fourteen students commenced the year-long course, and twelve graduated.&lt;ref name=Stephens34&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; As well as flying, they studied aeronautics, communications, navigation, armament and general military subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Squadron Leader Anderson resumed command of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS in 1925; the following year he handed over to Wing Commander [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], who led the unit until 1929.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130504b.htm? |title=Cole, Adrian Lindley Trevor|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Citizen Air Force (active reserve) pilots' course ran from December 1925 to March 1926, 26 of 30 students completing the training. Although 24 accidents occurred, there were no fatalities, leading Cole to remark at the graduation ceremony that the students were either made of [[Natural rubber|India rubber]] or had learned how to crash &quot;moderately safely&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 234–238&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1926 Permanent Air Force (PAF) cadet course was marred by three fatal accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, 29 students graduated—thirteen PAF, nine reserve, and seven destined for exchange with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070474--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1928, the school's Avro 504Ks were replaced by [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de&amp;nbsp;Havilland DH.60 Cirrus Moths]]; these were augmented by [[Gipsy Moth]]s commencing in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series1/A7.htm|title=DH 60 Cirrus Moth|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Squadron Leader McNamara resumed command of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS in October 1930.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt; By then, two sub-units had been raised at Point Cook under the school's auspices: &quot;[[Fighter Squadron RAAF|Fighter Squadron]]&quot;, operating [[Bristol Bulldog]]s; and &quot;[[Seaplane Squadron RAAF|Seaplane Squadron]]&quot;, operating [[Supermarine Southampton]]s, among other types.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 1934, No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS was organised into Training Squadron, operating Moths and [[Westland Wapiti]]s, Fighter Squadron and Seaplane Squadron.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt; Fighter and Seaplane Squadrons were formally established as units that month,&lt;ref name=Fighter&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Fighter Units'', pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seaplane&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 187–190&lt;/ref&gt; but remained under the control of the flying school and were &quot;really little more than flights&quot;, according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark127&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; As well as participating in training exercises, Fighter Squadron was often employed for aerobatic displays and flag-waving duties.&lt;ref name=Fighter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 104, 405&lt;/ref&gt; One of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS's leading instructors during the early 1930s, Flight Lieutenant [[Frederick Scherger]], was also a flight commander in Fighter Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 188–189, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; Seaplane Squadron undertook naval co-operation and survey tasks, as well as seaplane training.&lt;ref name=Seaplane/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 186–187, 380–381&lt;/ref&gt; Fighter Squadron was dissolved in December 1935 when its Bulldogs were transferred to [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Laverton]], while Seaplane Squadron continued to function until June 1939, when it was separated to form the nucleus of [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark127/&gt;

In 1932, No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS started running two courses each year, the first commencing in January and the second in July; it also ceased graduating [[non-commissioned officer]]s as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the [[Royal Australian Naval College]] and the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt; The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Wing Commander [[Hippolyte De&amp;nbsp;La Rue]] became commanding officer in early 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130682b.htm |title=De La Rue, Hippolyte Ferdinand|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first [[Avro Cadet]]s, procured as an intermediate trainer to bridge the gap between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Military Aircraft of Australia'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander [[Frank Lukis]] in January 1938.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt; By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070475--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 44]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Link Trainer]] simulators were introduced in March 1939.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;

===World War II===

RAAF flying training was heavily reorganised soon after the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, in response to Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). Several elementary flying training schools were formed, to provide basic flight instruction to cadets, while more advanced pilot instruction was to take place at service flying training schools.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 72–73]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillison97&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;May 1940, No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS was re-formed at Point Cook as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;1 SFTS). Its inaugural commanding officer was [[Group Captain]] John Summers, who led Fighter Squadron in the early 1930s and had taken over No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS in December 1939.&lt;ref name=1SFTS&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  The school's Instructors' Training Squadron was detached to become the nucleus of a re-formed Central Flying School, which relocated to [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, in June.&lt;ref name=Gillison97/&gt; Courses at the service flying training schools consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced; the total duration varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for sixteen weeks, the course was cut to ten weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to twelve weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to sixteen weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of formation, No.&amp;nbsp;1 SFTS came under the control of [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area Command]], headquartered in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The school's complement of 52 aircraft included Wapitis, Cadets, [[Avro Anson]]s, [[Hawker Demon]]s, and a [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Tiger Moth]]. Group Captain [[John McCauley]] served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander [[Elwyn Roy King|Roy King]], who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October.&lt;ref name=1SFTS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150028b.htm|title= King, Elwyn Roy|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July, No.&amp;nbsp;1 SFTS was operating more than 100 aircraft, including Gipsy Moths, [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|de&amp;nbsp;Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapides]], [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]], [[CAC Wirraway]]s and [[Airspeed Oxford]]s, the last two being the mainstays.&lt;ref name=1SFTS/&gt; In August 1941, control of all training units in Victoria passed from Southern Area Command to the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Training Group.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; By September, the school had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, including 300 cadets.&lt;ref name=1SFTS/&gt; It was organised into Intermediate Training Squadron, Advanced Training Squadron, Maintenance Wing, Armament School, and Signal School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1360153|title=Operations Record Book&amp;nbsp;– Nos.&amp;nbsp;1–3 Service Flying Training Schools|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|page=72|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] held command of No.&amp;nbsp;1 SFTS from October 1943 until its disbandment on 15&amp;nbsp;September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated.&lt;ref name=1SFTS/&gt; Among these were [[Nicky Barr]], who became one of Australia's leading [[Flying ace|fighter aces]] in [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]], and [[Bill Newton]], awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for bombing raids in [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077820.asp |title=Wing Commander Andrew William Barr|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', pp. 19–22&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British [[Air Ministry]] that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=166516|title=Formation, organisation and movement&amp;nbsp;– No. 1 Flying Training School|pages=64–65|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the [[invasion of Normandy]], but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30&amp;nbsp;June numbered 3,000 Australians.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070711--1-.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 283–285]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the [[Korean War]] and [[Malayan Emergency]], flying training underwent major changes in 1951–52, the syllabus at No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS being split among three separately located units.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 1 Initial Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 IFTS) was raised at [[RAAF Station Archerfield]], Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.&amp;nbsp;1 IFTS went on to the newly formed [[No. 1 Basic Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS, which was renamed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School (No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as [[Sergeant|sergeant pilot]]s.&lt;ref name=Stephens199&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; [[RAAF College]], formed at Point Cook in 1947, was to be the Air Force's primary source of commissioned officers.&lt;ref name=Solo151&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No.&amp;nbsp;1 BFTS were subsequently replaced by the [[CAC Winjeel]], first delivered in 1955.&lt;ref name=Winjeel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A85.htm|title= Winjeel|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time it was re-formed as No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Area Command was re-formed as [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Training Command]] in September 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.raaf.gov.au/organisation/groups/aftg.htm |title = Training Command History|publisher= Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=28 December 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20000917062205/http://www.raaf.gov.au/raaftc/history/index.htm| archivedate= 17 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt; On 28&amp;nbsp;May 1958, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS relocated to [[RAAF Base Pearce]], Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook.&lt;ref name=2FTS&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.&amp;nbsp;1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens199/&gt; By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school.&lt;ref name=Stephens199/&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.&amp;nbsp;1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.&lt;ref name=Solo151/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frost, ''RAAF College &amp; Academy'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for trained aircrew, which had lessened in the mid-1950s, rose again the following decade as a result of the RAAF embarking on a major re-equipment program, and Australia's increasing involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. The RAAF also had an ongoing commitment to providing flying training to students from the [[Australian Army]] and [[Royal Australian Navy]]. By adding instructors and increasing the ratio of pupils to instructors, the number of Air Force graduates was progressively raised from 38 in 1963, to 100 in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 151, 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1968, [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326H]] jet trainers began replacing the Vampires of No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A79.htm |title=DHA Vampire|publisher= RAAF Museum|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the Macchi led to a brief flirtation with &quot;all-through&quot; jet training in the Air Force, consisting of 210 hours on this one type of aircraft. The experiment was dropped after two courses as being, in the words of the official historian of the post-war RAAF, &quot;an expensive way of finding out that some pupils lacked the aptitude to become military pilots&quot;; by 1971 students were receiving 60 hours of basic training on Winjeels at Point Cook, and the Maachi course at Pearce was reduced to 150 hours.&lt;ref name=Stephens199/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;December 1968, No.&amp;nbsp;1 AFTS was disbanded at Pearce, re-forming on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1969 as [[No. 2 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Training School]] . At the same time, No.&amp;nbsp;1 BFTS was disbanded at Point Cook and re-formed as No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;

The Winjeels of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS were replaced by [[PAC CT/4 Airtrainer|CT-4A Airtrainers]] in late 1975.&lt;ref name=Winjeel/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A19.htm |title=CT-4A Airtrainer|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first CT-4 pilots' course of 34 students included six from the Royal Australian Navy and three from Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Airtrainers on line|magazine=RAAF News|date= May 1976|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977, the school was organised into Air Training, Ground Training and Maintenance Squadrons. As well as maintaining its own aircraft, it was responsible for technical support of other units at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=reports/1977/1977_pp87.pdf|author=[[Parliament of Australia]]|title=Report relating to the proposed development of RAAF Base Point Cook, Victoria|year=1977|publisher=[[Australian Government Publishing Service]]|location=Canberra|pages=2–4|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Queen's Colour]] was presented to No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS by the Governor-General, [[Zelman Cowen|Sir Zelman Cowen]], in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Queen's Colour for 1FTS|magazine=RAAF News |date=June 1981|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1989, one of the school's CT-4s re-created the first trans-Australia flight that had taken place 70 years before, when Captain [[Henry Wrigley]] and Sergeant [[Arthur William Murphy|Arthur &quot;Spud&quot; Murphy]] flew a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]] biplane from Point Cook to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, between 16&amp;nbsp;November and 12&amp;nbsp;December 1919.&lt;ref name=CT4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of undergraduate flying training, commissioned by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), Air Marshal [[Ray Funnell]], and aimed at reducing failure rates and improving cost-effectiveness, saw the retirement of the CT-4s in December 1992, followed by the closure of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS.&lt;ref name=CT4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=CT4s on their way to Wagga |magazine=RAAF News |date=December 1992|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last RAAF flying course completed on 12&amp;nbsp;June 1992, and the last Army pilots' course in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Johnson|first=Peter|magazine=RAAF News |date=July 1992|title=It's goodbye after 78 years|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was disbanded on 31&amp;nbsp;January 1993, bringing to an end almost 80 years of flying at Point Cook, Australia's oldest military air base.&lt;ref name=1FTS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens309&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; The occasion was marked by a parading of the Queen's Colour and a flypast by six CT-4s in front of the new CAS, Air Marshal [[Barry Gration]]. This was followed by a service at the RAAF Chapel of the Holy Trinity overflown by four Winjeels and a Tiger Moth, and later an all-ranks dining-in night.&lt;ref name=RAAFNews&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Johnson|first= Peter|magazine= RAAF News |title=1FTS&amp;nbsp;– the final curtain|date= February 1993|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent with the phase-out of training at No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS, [[BAE Systems|British Aerospace]] was contracted to conduct flight grading at its base in [[Tamworth Airport|Tamworth]], New South Wales. Subsequent all-through flight training on the [[Pilatus PC-9]] took place at No.&amp;nbsp;2 FTS, Pearce.&lt;ref name=2FTS/&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAFNews/&gt; In 1998, British Aerospace was granted a contract to supply tri-service basic flying instruction at the newly formed [[Australian Defence Force Basic Flying Training School]] (ADFBFTS) in Tamworth, the first course commencing in January 1999 on CT-4B Airtrainers, and No.&amp;nbsp;2 FTS again became responsible for advanced flying training only. ADFBFTS thus became, according to the school's head of training, &quot;the No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School you have when you don't have a No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=New era dawns in ADF basic flying training|magazine=Air Force News|date= December 1998|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
