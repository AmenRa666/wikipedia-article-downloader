'''Hermann Graf''' (24 October 1912 – 4 November 1988) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[World War II]] [[fighter ace]]. A flying ace or fighter ace is a [[military aviation|military aviator]] credited with shooting down five or more enemy [[aircraft]] during aerial combat.&lt;ref&gt;Spick 1996, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He served on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Fronts]]. He became the first pilot in aviation history to claim 200 aerial victories—that is, 200 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier p21&quot;&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed 212 aerial victories in over 830 combat missions, 202 of which were on the Eastern Front.{{refn|His 209th aerial victory west of [[Berlin]] on 6 March 1944 over a [[B-24 Liberator]] of the [[453d Bombardment Group]] of the [[8th Air Force]] was actually an ''Herausschuss'' (separation shot)—a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from his [[combat box]] which counted as an aerial victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov 2003, p. 295&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}

Graf, a pre-war [[Association football|football player]] and [[gliding|glider pilot]], joined the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1935. He was initially selected for transport aviation and was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]] (JG&amp;nbsp;51—51st Fighter Wing) in May 1939. At the outbreak of war he was stationed on the German–Franco border flying uneventful patrols. Serving as a flight instructor, he was stationed in [[Romania]] as part of a German military mission training Romanian pilots. Graf flew a few ground support missions in the closing days of the German [[Battle of Crete|invasion of Crete]].

Following the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], Graf claimed his first aerial victory on 4 August 1941. He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) after 45 Eastern Front victories on 24 January 1942. By 16 September 1942 his number of victories had increased to 172 for which he was honored with the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten''}}). At the time of its presentation to Graf it was Germany's highest military decoration.{{refn|In 1942, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds was second only to the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|''Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes''}}), which was awarded only to senior commanders for winning a major battle or campaign, in the military order of the Third Reich. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds as the highest military order was surpassed on 29 December 1944 by the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten''}}).&lt;ref&gt;Williamson &amp; Bujeiro 2004, pp. 3, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} On 26 September 1942 he became the first fighter pilot in aviation history to claim 200 enemy aircraft shot down.

By then a national hero, Graf was taken off combat operations and posted to a fighter pilot training school in France before being tasked with leadership of a high flying [[de Havilland Mosquito]] intercept unit called [[Jagdgeschwader 50|''Jagdgeschwader'' 50]] (JG&amp;nbsp;50—Fighter Wing 50). In November 1943 Graf returned to combat operations. He was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (Wing Commander) of [[Jagdgeschwader 11|''Jagdgeschwader'' 11]] (JG&amp;nbsp;11—11th Fighter Wing) and claimed his last aerial victory on 29 March 1944. He was severely injured during this encounter and, after a period of convalescence, became ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG&amp;nbsp;52—52nd Fighter Wing). He and the remainder of JG&amp;nbsp;52 surrendered to units of the [[United States Army]] on 8 May 1945, and were turned over to the [[Red Army]]. Graf was held in Soviet captivity until 1949. After the war he worked as an electronic sales manager and died of [[Parkinson's disease]] in his home town of [[Engen, Germany|Engen]] on 4 November 1988.

== Early life ==
Hermann Anton Graf was born on 24 October 1912 in Engen in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] not far from the [[Swiss]] border, the son of Wilhelm Graf (1878–1937), a farmer, and his wife Maria, née Sailer (1877–1953). He was the third of three children, with two older brothers, Wilhelm Wilhelm (1904–1981) and Josef Wilhelm (1909–1981).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p11&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leobw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=leobw |title=Graf, Hermann |url=http://www.leo-bw.de/web/guest/detail/-/Detail/details/PERSON/kgl_biographien/101239333X/Graf+Hermann |language=German |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had fought in [[World War I]] as an [[artillery]] soldier and was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] (''Eisernes Kreuz''). He did not return home until Hermann was six years old. The young Hermann's main reference point in his life was his mother, and the bond he formed with her lasted the remainder of her life. [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic]] in 1923 wiped out all the family savings, as a result, from a very early age, Hermann learned to work hard to make a living.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p11&quot; /&gt;

=== Childhood ===
As a young boy, Graf was fascinated by [[Association football|football]]. He started with the football club ''DJK Engen'' (''Deutsche Jugendkraft''—Literally &quot;German Youthful Strength&quot;, a [[Catholic]] sports organization dating back to 1920) and later became a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] in ''FC Höhen''. In his teens, he had been selected to join a group of talented young football players who were trained by [[Sepp Herberger]], a former [[Forward (association football)|forward]] (1921–1925) of the [[Germany national football team|German national football team]] and later head coach of the German team winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]]. A broken thumb ended all of Graf's early hopes for a career on the national football team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin pp11–12&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graf graduated from the ''[[Volksschule]]'' (primary school) in 1926 at the age of thirteen. Since the savings for Graf's higher education had been lost in the 1923 inflation crisis, he had no option but to apply for a [[vocational education]]. For the next three years, Graf worked as a [[locksmith]] [[apprentice]] at a local factory. A locksmith had a low income and when he received an offer to work as an apprentice [[Clerk (position)|clerk]], he gladly accepted a change in careers. In this position, Graf helped Jewish families escape to [[Switzerland]] at a time when the &quot;J&quot; stamp in German [[Jews]]' passport had been demanded by Germany's neighboring countries. He took a great personal risk and came close to getting caught. Graf was assisted by ''[[Gruppenführer]]'' (Group Leader) Albert Keller of the Nazi [[sailplane|Glider]] Club NSFK in Engen, who later erased all the bureaucratic traces that Graf had left.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amateur pilot and joining the ''Luftwaffe'' ===
Graf saw his first aircraft when he was twelve years old and this sight caused an emotional conflict between his old passion for football and a new obsession with aviation. He worked at the Engen town hall in 1930, saving all his money to buy a glider. Before his 20th birthday he contributed a homemade glider to the newly founded Engen Glider Club. Every Sunday he would go out to the nearby Ballenberg mountain until an almost fatal crash destroyed his glider in the fall of 1932. In 1935 when [[Adolf Hitler]] nullified the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Hermann Graf applied for flight training in the newly created ''Luftwaffe''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin pp11–12&quot; /&gt;

Graf was accepted for the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s A-level pilot training school in [[Karlsruhe]] on 2 June 1936. Following [[basic training]], flight training progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. Graf's A training included theoretical and practical training in [[aerobatics]], navigation, long-distance flights and [[deadstick landing]]s, graduating from A2 on 25 September 1936. Graf joined the B1 school in [[Ulm]]-[[Dornstadt]] on 4 October 1937. The B courses included high-altitude flights, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle the aircraft in difficult situations. He completed his B1 training on 23 December 1937 and progressed to B2 training in Karlsruhe on 19 January 1938, completing on 31 May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the B2 course the pilots were either selected for fighter pilot training and transferred to a ''[[Jagdfliegerschule]]'' (fighter pilot school) or chosen for bomber or transport pilot training at a C flight school. Graf, at the age of 26, was initially thought to be too old for fighter pilot training and selected for the transport pilot C school. Largely due to the fact that the fighter force was in dire need for new officers, ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' (non-commissioned officer) Graf, without training on modern fighter aircraft, was transferred to 2. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (2nd squadron) of I./[[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]] (I./JG&amp;nbsp;51—1st group of the 51st fighter wing) at [[Bad Aibling]] on 31 May 1939 after he had completed his officers candidate training at [[Neubiberg]].&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations, see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)|Organisation of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; I./JG&amp;nbsp;51 was equipped with the most modern German fighter aircraft at the time, the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#E-1|Messerschmitt Bf 109 E1]]. Graf, who had never flown a modern fighter aircraft before, ended his first flight on the Bf 109 with a crash. In July 1939, I./JG&amp;nbsp;51 was briefly reequipped with the Czechoslovakian built [[Avia B-534]] biplane, giving Graf an opportunity to show his flying skills as well as to reestablish his self-confidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p18&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==
World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939 when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. On this day, I./JG&amp;nbsp;51 was stationed at the [[France|French]] border at [[Speyer]] and Graf was promoted to ''[[Feldwebel]]'' (staff sergeant). I./JG&amp;nbsp;51 exchanged the Avia B-534 biplanes  for the Bf 109 and was charged with protection of Germany's Western border during the [[Phoney War]]—the phase in the months following Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939 and preceding the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p18&quot; /&gt; During the Phoney War, Graf flew 21 combat sorties without firing his guns and was still considered an unreliable pilot. On 20 January 1940, his ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (Group Commander) Hans-Heinrich Brustellin had Graf transferred to ''[[Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Merseburg]]'' (a supplementary training unit stationed at [[Merseburg]]) where newly trained fighter pilots received instruction from pilots with combat experience. Graf's completion of the program resulted in his promotion to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) on 1 May 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; At Merseburg Graf met and befriended two other fighter pilot trainees, [[Alfred Grislawski]] and [[Heinrich Füllgrabe]]. ''Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Merseburg'' at the time was under the command of ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (Major) [[Gotthard Handrick]], the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic]] gold medalist and former commander of ''[[Jagdgruppe 88]]'' of the &quot;[[Condor Legion]]&quot; during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström 2003, p. 21&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 1940, ''Major'' Handrick was appointed ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (III./JG&amp;nbsp;52—3rd group of the 52nd fighter wing). Handrick had some influence on the personnel rotation within the ''Luftwaffe'' and had Graf, Füllgrabe and Grislawski transferred to 9./JG&amp;nbsp;52 (9th Squadron of the 52nd Fighter Wing) on 6 October 1940 as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström 2003, p. 21&quot; /&gt;

=== Service in Romania and invasion of Greece ===
[[Romania]], isolated and threatened following the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] signed by Germany and the [[Soviet Union]], sought to uphold its neutrality. The [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] of Romania's regions, [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]], consented to by the King [[Carol II of Romania]], caused Carol's popularity to fall. This gave [[Ion Antonescu]] an opportunity to rise to power and he soon established a dictatorship in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Antonescu, Romania's armed forces were reorganized, supported by a military mission from Germany called ''Luftwaffenmission Rumänien'' (''Luftwaffe'' Mission Romania) under the command of ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Wilhelm Speidel]]. Stationed in [[Bucharest]], III./JG&amp;nbsp;52 was temporarily renamed I./''Jagdgeschwader'' 28 (I./JG&amp;nbsp;28—1st group of the 28th fighter wing) until 27 December 1940. Its primary task was to train [[Romanian Air Force]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the trio of Füllgrabe, Graf and Grislawski was joined by [[Ernst Süß]], and later by [[Leopold Steinbatz]] and [[Edmund Roßmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German airmen of 9./JG&amp;nbsp;52 spent a number of very relaxing days in Bucharest. Graf even managed to play football when a team of the ''Deutsche Luftwaffe'' played against Cyclope Bucharest at the Bucharest Sport's Arena before thirty thousand spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxed life continued until late 1940 when the Romanian internal political situation deteriorated. Ion Antonescu, mainly a nationalist and the [[Iron Guard]], led by [[Horia Sima]], formed a tense alliance climaxing in the brief but bloody civil war from 21–24 January 1941. The three-day civil war was eventually won by Antonescu with support from the [[German Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1941 III./JG&amp;nbsp;52 was transferred to [[Greece]] to support [[Operation Merkur]], the invasion of [[Crete]]. The unit flew mostly ground attack missions during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann 2005, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War against the Soviet Union ===
In early June the unit transferred back to Romania, and from 22 June the unit supported [[Army Group South]] in [[Operation Barbarossa]] from bases in the country. On 1 August JG&amp;nbsp;52 transferred to [[forward airfield]]s in [[Ukraine]], and on 4 August Graf claimed his first aerial victory against a [[Polikarpov I-16]] while escorting a [[Junkers Ju 87]] strike. Graf recorded the victory at 06:20.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998 pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; His second victory fell the next day. Graf became an official ace upon achieving his fifth victory on 6 September 1941. The victory was achieved at night, 18:23 local time, in the vicinity of [[Krementschug]].&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:9-JG52-ins.svg|thumb|right|9. ''Staffel'' also known as the ''Karaya-Staffel'']]
JG&amp;nbsp;52 moved forward into the Soviet Union as the German advance quickened in the late summer and autumn. Flying air superiority missions during the [[First Battle of Kharkov]] in September and October 1941 he accounted for 12 victories (nos. 8–20) which included five [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, pp. 58–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Graf was finding his stride and accounted for 10 enemy aircraft in November and 12 in December 1941, increasing his personal success to 42 aerial victories by the end of 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, pp. 84–91, 97–100, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

This period had witnessed some bitter aerial combat as Graf experienced the [[Battle of Rostov (1941)|Battle of Rostov]] and opening phases of the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942)|Siege of Sevastopol]]. Graf remained with his unit as operations ground to a halt, and stalemate. On 24 January, with his tally now 45 victories, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}). On 3 February 1942 he accounted for his 47th victim, a [[Sukhoi Su-2]] ground attack aircraft. It was to be his last victory for several weeks. After seven months of ceaseless combat operations he was withdrawn from the frontline and sent on leave to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March Graf was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of 9./JG&amp;nbsp;52. That same day, Graf accounted for four enemy aircraft and by the end of March 1942 had reached 58 aerial victories. 9./JG&amp;nbsp;52 moved to the [[Crimea]] in April to support [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11th Army]]. The [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula]] ({{lang|de|''Unternehmen Trappenjagd''}}) was designed to eject [[Red Army]] forces that had conducted an amphibious landing in the region on 26 December 1941. Tasked with clearing the skies above Manstein's limited forces, Graf achieved substantial success. On 30 April 1942 he became an &quot;[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]&quot; after shooting down six enemy aircraft in the region followed by seven on 2 May and again seven on 8 May.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, pp. 111–115.&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 May the Kerch campaign was reaching its climax; it ended in complete victory for the Germans and their allies eight days later. On this day Hermann Graf reached a tally of 89 aerial victories.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, pp. 115–148.&lt;/ref&gt; Graf was ordered north immediately to assist German air forces near Kharkov. The Soviets had launched a surprise offensive beginning the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]]. Graf recorded 19 air victories in the heavy air fighting. On 14 May 1942, Graf was credited with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 7th ''Luftwaffe'' pilot to achieve the century mark.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub''}}) on 17 May 1942 for 100 air victories.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, pp. 115–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Only two days later, his score had increased to 105, he also received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''}}) on 19 May 1942. The 39 claims submitted in May 1942 brought his personal tally to 108 by the time the battle was over.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim 1998, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 1942, Graf, together with ''Leutnant'' [[Adolf Dickfeld]], flew to the [[Wolf's Lair]], Hitler's headquarters in [[Rastenburg]], present-day Kętrzyn in Poland, for the official Oak Leaves and Swords presentation the next day. Following the presentation, he was sent on home leave, where he made a number of public appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann p6&quot;&gt;Schumann 2005, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Towards Stalingrad ===

Upon return to his post, Graf claimed his next victory on 30 June 1942. From August onwards, JG&amp;nbsp;52 supported Army Group South advances towards [[Stalingrad]]. Graf had volunteered for service in the ''Gefechtsverband Stalingrad'' (Combat Detachment Stalingrad), which was under the leadership of ''Hauptmann'' [[Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke]]; Graf increased his number of aerial victories to 140 by the end of August.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann 2005, pp. 6, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In September alone he shot down 62 enemy aircraft, including 5 on 2 September and 10 on 23 September. The aerial fighting was fierce. On 4 September 1942, he claimed his 150th victory, a [[Yakovlev Yak-1]]; he was the second pilot, after [[Gordon Gollob]], to achieve this mark. Graf's aircraft suffered over 100 hits during the engagement with the Yak-1. He barely escaped being killed on several occasions. On 15 September his aircraft cabin was hit by a cannon shell. On 16 September his plane was again hit, this time suffering 30 bullet holes and on 19 September the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery]] shot away half the rudder. His ''Gruppe'' was then relocated to the [[Pitomnik Airfield]] in Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann p6&quot; /&gt;

Flying from Pitomnik Airfield, Graf achieved his 172nd aerial victory on 9 September 1942 for which he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten''}}) on 16 September, the fifth member of the [[Wehrmacht]] to receive this distinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann p6&quot; /&gt; Within a time-frame of 235 days he had received every grade of the Knight's Cross available at the time. The next day, on 17 September, he claimed three more victories and on 23 September, victories 188 to 197. On 26 September, he became the first pilot in aviation history to claim 200 enemy aircraft shot down. He claimed three victories that day taking his total to an unprecedented 202. Following this he received a promotion to ''Major'' on 1 October 1942. Some time after this Graf was ordered not to fly operationally anymore, as the High Command was concerned about the potential morale loss if he was to be shot down.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann 2005, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fighter pilot instructor—''Jagdgruppe Ost'' ===
On 28 January 1943 Graf, now a ''Major'', was sent to southern France to command ''[[Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Ost]]'' (Supplemntary Fighter Group East), a fighter pilot school. Here newly trained fighter pilots destined for the Eastern Front received their final training from experienced Eastern Front pilots. The main base was at [[St. Jean d'Angély]] {{Convert|70|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of [[Bordeaux]] on the Atlantic coast. However, he spent most of his time at the [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], where he nursed his passion for football. [[Peter Düttmann]], whom Graf would later send to JG&amp;nbsp;52, was one of the pilots at the time at ''Jagdgruppe Ost''. Graf selected a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] A-5 aircraft for his personal use.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann Göring]] was summoned to the Wolf's Lair by Hitler. Following the Allied aerial bombings of [[Nuremberg]] and [[Paderborn]], Hitler blamed Göring for the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s inability to protect the German cities against the intensified Allied bomber offensive. In particular, German cities were vulnerable to the speedy, multi-use [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighter-bombers, which had all returned home without having been intercepted by German defenses. Two days after the attack on Paderborn, Göring met with Germany's leading aircraft manufacturers, [[Willy Messerschmitt]], [[Ernst Heinkel]] and [[Claude Dornier]] on 18 March 1943. Göring berated them for their inability to produce a German aircraft capable of competing with the Mosquito. He then withdrew to [[Berchtesgarden]], where he came up with the idea to create a Mosquito-intercept task force led by Graf and [[Herbert Ihlefeld]]. Graf was ordered to Berchtesgarden, where he received his instructions from Göring personally. In the project, Graf was directly subordinated to Göring and, when asked what he required, responded that he wanted to appoint his own team. Göring approved this request and subsequently Graf was able to call upon his old friends Grislawski, Süß and Füllgrabe, as well as a number of good football players, who had served as administrators, drivers and mechanics in southern France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p168&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the meeting with Göring at Bertechsgaden, Graf traveled to Berlin to organize the necessary personnel authorizations at the ''Luftwaffenpersonalamt'' (''Luftwaffe'' personnel office). In Berlin, he took the opportunity to watch a football match at the [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p168&quot; /&gt; Here Graf was introduced to the young film actress [[Jola Jobst]]. Graf flew back to Toulouse from Berlin, where he learned that his Mosquito assignment had been delayed. Hitler, who had assisted [[Francisco Franco]] during the Spanish Civil War, made repeated efforts to convince Franco to join the war on Germany's side. Since 1941 Spanish fighter squadrons had operated together with the ''Luftwaffe'' in the East and German propaganda had employed images of Graf   interacting with the Spaniards. In this role, under Graf's supervision, the 4ta ''Escudrilla Azul'' (4th [[Blue Squadron]]), one of five Spanish voluntary fighter squadrons, received three weeks of specialized fighter pilot training for the Eastern Front from 18 May to 6 June 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p169&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defense of the Reich ===
On 11 June 1943, Graf arrived at the [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden airfield]], where he began the creation of the high-altitude fighter unit. Organizationally, it was based on ''[[Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Süd|Jagdgruppe Süd]]''. The unit was to be equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-5, a high-altitude variant of the Bf 109 equipped with a [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized cockpit]], but arrival of the aircraft was delayed and, in the meantime, Graf's focus was on football. He invited Sepp Herberger to Wiesbaden to train Graf's team for one day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p169&quot; /&gt; During this visit, Herberger encouraged Graf to use his influence to save Germany's best football players from frontline duty. Subsequently, Graf brought to his unit players like [[Hermann Eppenhoff]], Hermann Koch, [[Alfons Moog]], [[Franz Hanreiter]] and Walter Bammes.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Graf also requested [[Fritz Walter]], who later captained the West German World Cup team of 1954, to be transferred to his unit. Walter's transfer was more difficult to achieve. Graf had to submit his request directly to ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (Colonel General) [[Friedrich Fromm]], the commander of the ''[[Ersatzheer]]'' (Reserve Army).&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with playing football, recruiting his pilots and staff, Graf again encountered the actress Jobst.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

His unit received the first 12 Bf 109 G-5 in July 1943. With one of these aircraft he managed to reach an altitude of {{Convert|14300|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.{{refn|Bergström, Antipov and Sundin state that this flight, which reached an altitude of {{Convert|14300|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}, was a World [[flight altitude record]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p172&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to what category this &quot;World Record&quot; pertains to. [[Mario Pezzi]], flying a [[Caproni Ca.161]], had reached an altitude of {{Convert|17083|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, {{Convert|2783|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} higher, almost five years earlier on 22 October 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=FAI—The International Air Sports Federation|title=FAI Record ID #11713|url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=11713|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Military success came quickly when the unit achieved its first aerial victory over an intruding Mosquito. However, aircraft shortage still prevented him to declare full operational status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p172&quot; /&gt; In parallel to these events the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) based in England escalated its [[Combined Bomber Offensive|daylight offensive over Europe]]. The heavy four-engined [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers they had first appeared over northern Germany on 27 January 1943 in daytime attacks against the port of [[Wilhelmshaven]]. The number of [[heavy bomber]]s of the USAAF [[Eighth Air Force]] surpassed the 800 mark and tight flying [[combat box]] formations struck deeply into German airspace by July 1943. Graf ordered all his available Bf 109s to intercept the American bombers targeted for [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|Kassel]] on 28 and 30 July 1943. He was credited with the destruction of his first B-17 Flying Fortress during one of these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit, consisting of 19 aircraft, was declared combat ready on 31 July 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Graf's football team, the ''[[Rote Jäger]]'' (Red Hunters), was also ready and played its first game on 4 August 1943, with Graf as goalkeeper. This football team followed Graf in his assignments for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 1943 Graf's unit was renamed to [[Jagdgeschwader 50|''Jagdgeschwader'' 50]] (JG&amp;nbsp;50—50th Fighter Wing). It was expected that JG&amp;nbsp;50 would be equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] rocket fighter. The Me 163 was being tested by ''Major'' [[Wolfgang Späte]]'s test unit ''[[Erprobungskommando]]'' 16 (16th Test Commando) at [[Peenemünde]] and [[Rechlin]] in the summer of 1943. Following a visit of this test unit, Graf also learned about the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet fighter, and he returned to JG&amp;nbsp;50 full of optimism.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; During this assignment Graf shot down three enemy aircraft, including two [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers and a Mosquito in June 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov 2003, p. 295&quot;/&gt;

=== Wing commander of JG&amp;nbsp;1 and JG&amp;nbsp;11 ===
''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel) [[Hans Philipp]], ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (Wing Commander) of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (JG&amp;nbsp;1—1st Fighter Wing), was [[killed in action]] on 8 October 1943. The next day, Graf, officially remaining in command of JG&amp;nbsp;50, was appointed acting ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of JG&amp;nbsp;1 and transferred to [[Jever]]. Graf subsequently appointed Grislawski as acting-commander of JG&amp;nbsp;50. The Eighth Air Force flew their [[Second Raid on Schweinfurt]] on 14 October 1943. Although costly to the attackers—77 heavy bombers were destroyed by either German fighters or by the anti-aircraft fire at the price of 46 German fighters lost—Göring was not satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October, Graf and Major [[Anton Mader]], ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 11|''Jagdgeschwader'' 11]] (JG&amp;nbsp;11—11th Fighter Wing) were summoned to a meeting with Göring at [[Deelen Air Base]] near [[Arnhem]]. Graf, Mader and ''Unteroffizier'' Karl Blaha as a rear observer, made the journey from Jever in a [[Messerschmitt Bf 108]] Taifun. During this flight they were nearly shot down by a flight of two Mosquitos over the [[North Sea Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their successes, after the October meeting, Göring disbanded the unit, and it  was absorbed into I./[[Jagdgeschwader 301|''Jagdgeschwader'' 301]]; Graf was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) and appointed ''Geschwaderkommodore'' (Wing Commander) of JG&amp;nbsp;11 on 11 November. JG&amp;nbsp;11 was tasked with ''Reichsverteidigung'' ([[Defense of the Reich]]), and despite officially being banned from flying operational missions Graf managed to down six more aircraft over the next four months. On 29 March 1944 Graf shot down one [[P-51 Mustang]] and in the confusion of the dog fight collided with another. He managed to bail out, but was injured and had to spend some time in a hospital. While on convalescence leave Graf married the German actress Jobst on 24 June 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p239&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wing commander of JG&amp;nbsp;52 ===
Following his convalescence, Graf was appointed ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of his old unit JG&amp;nbsp;52 by the ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' (General of Fighters), ''Generalleutnant'' [[Adolf Galland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p239&quot; /&gt; The ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Geschwaderstab]]'' and I./JG&amp;nbsp;52 were based at [[Kraków]] in southern Poland at the time and the men of JG&amp;nbsp;52 gave Graf a welcome celebration on 20 September 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p240&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; With German forces in retreat by this time, Graf did not have any opportunity for further air combat. Graf disobeyed an order from General [[Hans Seidemann]], who had ordered him and [[Erich Hartmann]] to fly to the British sector to avoid capture by the Russians when the rest of the wing surrendered to the Soviets. Together with his fellow pilots and ground personnel he marched through [[Bohemia]] toward [[Bavaria]], where he surrendered his unit to the [[U.S. 90th Infantry Division|90th US Infantry Division]] near [[Písek]] on 8 May 1945 and became a [[prisoner of war]] (POW).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann p46&quot;&gt;Schumann 2005, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prisoner of war ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S78949, Frankfurt - Oder, entlassene Kriegsgefangene.jpg|thumb|right|German POWs released at Frankfurt (Oder).|alt=A black and white photo of numerous men, some carrying backpacks, heading for a train.]]
Along with most of the JG&amp;nbsp;52 personnel, Graf was handed over by the Americans to the Soviets shortly after his surrender on 15 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Having become famous via the Nazi propaganda machine and as the Commander of JG&amp;nbsp;52, Graf was singled out for attention by the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December 1945 he was moved from the prisoner of war camp Nr. 150 in [[Gryazovets]] to the prisoner of war camp Nr. 27 in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann p46&quot; /&gt; He was then moved to the war camp Nr. 69 ([[:de:Heimkehrerlager Gronenfelde|''Heimkehrerlager Gronenfelde'']]) near [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] in [[East Germany]]. There he was released from captivity on 25 December 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann 2005, p. 47&quot;&gt;Schumann 2005, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

This relatively early release was perceived by many to be caused by co-operation with his Soviet captors, something for which his fellow pilots criticized him, especially following a 1950s book by fellow fighter ace and Soviet POW [[Hans &quot;Assi&quot; Hahn]] entitled &quot;I Speak the Truth&quot; ({{lang|de|''Ich spreche die Wahrheit''}}).&lt;ref&gt;Hahn 1951, pp. 221–223.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Graf's exclusion from post-war ''Luftwaffe'' comrade associations.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, pp. 264–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graf sighned papers stating that Soviet pilots were equal, or superior to German pilots while at Krasnogorsk &lt;Ref&gt; Soldat, Knappe pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Initially, Graf had a hard time obtaining work, but his relationships in the football community helped him. Sepp Herberger introduced Graf to Roland Endler, an electronics manufacturer (&quot;Elektro-Schweiss-Industrie [[GmbH]]&quot;) from [[Neuss]], who also was president of the [[FC Bayern Munich]] football club between 1958 and 1962. Endler employed Graf as a salesman in his company, and Graf eventually advanced to branch leader in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and Chief of Sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p269&quot; /&gt;

Graf's marriage with Jobst collapsed and they divorced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p269&quot;&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Jobst married [[Wolfgang Kieling]] in 1950 and committed suicide in October 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p269&quot;/&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} He remarried twice thereafter. His third marriage in May 1959 with Helga Schröck resulted in the birth of his son, Hermann-Ulrich, in 1959, and his daughter Birgit, in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;leobw&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin p269&quot; /&gt; In 1965, Graf was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], a condition that affected many of the high-altitude flyers, which had a slow deteriorating effect on his health. Graf died in his hometown Engen on 4 November 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, Antipov &amp; Sundin 2003, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aerial victory credits ==
Graf was credited with 212 aerial victories, claimed in over 830 combat missions, 10 on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] which included six four-engined-bombers and one Mosquito, and 212 on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier p21&quot; /&gt;
