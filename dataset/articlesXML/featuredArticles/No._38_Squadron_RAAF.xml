'''No. 38 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) transport unit. It was formed in 1943 and saw service during [[World War II]] transporting supplies and personnel between Australia and the combat zones in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo]], using [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] aircraft. Following the war, the [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] conducted regular courier flights between Australia and Japan in 1947 and 1948. No. 38 Squadron was deployed to Singapore from 1950 to 1952, supplying Commonwealth forces engaged in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and undertaking courier flights across Asia. In 1954 it became responsible for training RAAF personnel to operate Dakotas.

After being re-equipped with [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou]] in 1964, No. 38 Squadron served as the RAAF's [[operational conversion unit]] for the type and also conducted transport tasks within Australia and its territories. Throughout [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War]], it prepared aircrew for operational service with [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|No. 35 Squadron]], and maintained a detachment in [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea|Papua and New Guinea]] to provide pilots with experience flying in tropical conditions. A Caribou was deployed to Pakistan from 1975 to 1978 to support United Nations peacekeepers, and detachments were established within Australia during the 1980s to provide search and rescue capabilities and work with [[Australian Army]] units. From 1999 until 2001, a detachment was deployed to East Timor as part of the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|Australian-led peacekeeping force]] in the newly independent nation. No. 38 Squadron continued to operate Caribou after No. 35 Squadron was disbanded in 2000, though the age of the aircraft increasingly affected its operations.

Following the retirement of the Caribou from service in 2009, No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with eight [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft King Air 350]] aircraft. The squadron is currently stationed at [[RAAF Base Townsville]], Queensland, and is responsible for training RAAF pilots to operate King Airs, and performing light transport tasks. It is also believed to have a ground surveillance capability.

==History==

===World War II===
No. 38 Squadron was formed as a transport unit at [[RAAF Base Richmond]] near [[Sydney]] on 15 September 1943. Equipped with [[Lockheed Hudson]]s, the squadron conducted its first operation on 17 December, when one of its aircraft flew from Richmond to [[RAAF Base Darwin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_67&quot;/&gt; During the period No. 38 Squadron was equipped with Hudsons, it operated only within Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather_76&quot;&gt;Eather (1995), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron's activities expanded in early 1944, when its obsolescent Hudsons were replaced with more capable [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] transports.&lt;ref name=Eather_76 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamonds in the rough&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Diamonds in the rough|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4521/history/story01.htm|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=Air Force|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031214124321/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4521/history/story01.htm|archivedate=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received its first Dakota on 3 March 1944, and was completely equipped with the type by the end of May.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_67 /&gt; While the squadron continued to fly to locations within Australia after receiving Dakotas, it also began transporting supplies to Allied forces fighting the Japanese in western New Guinea. During return flights from New Guinea, the Dakotas typically carried wounded personnel to Australia for treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_68&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1944, No. 38 Squadron was given the additional task of supporting the RAAF's [[Paratroop Training Unit RAAF|Paratroop Training Unit]] at Richmond. The squadron moved to [[RAAF Station Archerfield]] near [[Brisbane]] in early December 1944, but continued to maintain a detachment at Richmond. By this time No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with transporting supplies to the battle zone in New Guinea, which included making supply drops to [[Australian Army]] units in the field and evacuating casualties to the mainland. From 17 July 1945, the squadron maintained a detachment at [[Morotai|Morotai Island]], which dropped supplies to Army units [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|fighting in Borneo]]. No. 38 Squadron's only loss during World War II was a Dakota that crashed on a mountain in western New Guinea while flying between [[Biak]] and Morotai; the wreckage of this aircraft was not located until 1970.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_68 /&gt;

Following the end of the war, No. 38 Squadron flew into [[Singapore]], [[Bangkok]] and locations in Borneo to evacuate released Australian prisoners of war. In addition, the squadron transported other service personnel back to Australia until 1946 as part of the [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation of the Australian military]].&lt;ref name=Eather_76 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_68 /&gt; During May 1946, three of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were assigned the unusual task of flying 25 tonnes of pig bristles from [[Chongqing]] in China to [[Hong Kong]], from where the bristles were shipped to Australia. This mission, which was designated &quot;[[Operation Pig Bristle]]&quot;, took two weeks to complete and sought to rectify a shortage of paint brushes, which was hindering the Australian construction industry.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_68 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (1995), pp. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian deployments===
No. 38 Squadron relocated to [[RAAF Station Schofields]] near Sydney on 15 August 1946. It became part of [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No. 86 Wing]], along with [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|Nos. 36]] and [[No. 37 Squadron RAAF|37 Squadrons]], which also operated Dakotas, and [[No. 486 Squadron RAAF|No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron]], which serviced the wing's flying units.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roylance&gt;Roylance (1991), pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Commencing on 22 January 1947, one of No. 38 Squadron's main responsibilities was to conduct thrice-weekly courier flights to Japan to support the Australian element of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. These flights were the longest regular air route serviced by twin-engined aircraft at the time, and took several days to complete. The courier flights continued until 13 January 1948, after which chartered [[Qantas]] aircraft were used to support the force in Japan.&lt;ref name=Eather_76 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_68/&gt; In August 1948, five of No. 38 Squadron's air crews were dispatched to Europe where, as members of the [[RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift]], they participated in the international efforts to fly supplies into [[Berlin]] during the [[Berlin Blockade|Soviet blockade of the city]]. These personnel remained in Europe for 12 months, and their absence greatly disrupted No. 38 Squadron's operations.&lt;ref name=Eather_76/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_69&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, twenty members of No. 86 Wing were sent to Europe; the resulting shortage of personnel forced Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons to operate for a period as a single unit, all flying hours being attributed to No. 38 Squadron in official records.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; No. 86 Wing moved to Richmond between 22 June and 1 July 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance (1991), pp. 114–118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:38 Squadron RAAF Dakotas in Singapore during 1950.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of five silver aircraft parked in a line|No. 38 Squadron Dakotas at RAF Changi in 1950]]

In 1950, No. 38 Squadron was selected to form part of the Australian force assigned to the Commonwealth [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|Far East Air Force]]. As an element of this force, the Australian Government agreed for the unit to be tasked with courier flights across Asia and providing support for the British-led [[Malayan Emergency|counterinsurgency operations]] in Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron's advance party arrived at [[Changi Air Base|RAF Changi]] in Singapore on 19 June 1950, and all of its personnel and eight Dakotas were operational there by 6 July. While in Malaya the squadron came under the command of [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No. 90 (Composite) Wing]], along with the [[Avro Lincoln]]-equipped [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;38 Squadron RAAF AWM Malaya&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=38 Squadron RAAF|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11081malayan_emergency.asp|work=Units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=1 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520052050/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11081malayan_emergency.asp|archivedate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half the squadron's aircrew were veterans of the Berlin Airlift, but none had any direct experience of tropical environments. No. 38 Squadron began flying transport missions in Malaya in early July, with British and New Zealand pilots accompanying its aircrews during the first two weeks of operations to help them become familiar with local conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis_25&quot;&gt;Dennis and Grey (1996), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; From July 1950 until February 1951, No. 38 Squadron's main task was to conduct courier flights to Borneo, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines, and these remained an important responsibility throughout the period it was based at Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the squadron flew British troops and supplies from Singapore to Japan and Korea, and four of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were transferred to [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No. 30 Communication Unit]] in Japan during November 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;38 Squadron RAAF AWM Malaya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis_26&quot;&gt;Dennis and Grey (1996), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing half its strength, No. 38 Squadron remained at Changi and conducted supply and aeromedical evacuation flights throughout Malaya to support the British-led forces there. The squadron's aircraft were also occasionally used to mark targets ahead of bombing raids and to drop propaganda leaflets. From April to July 1951, No. 38 Squadron and an attached [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] from [[No. 41 Squadron RNZAF]] was stationed at [[RAF Kuala Lumpur]], and was the main unit tasked with dropping supplies to Commonwealth forces in the field. The squadron made another deployment to Kuala Lumpur between November 1951 and February 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;38 Squadron RAAF AWM Malaya&quot; /&gt; In February 1952, No. 38 Squadron successfully parachuted 54 personnel from the British [[Special Air Service|22nd Special Air Service Regiment]] into a remote area near the Malaya-Thailand border.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting the Australian units in Korea placed heavy demands on the RAAF's transport force, which was too small to fully meet its domestic and international responsibilities, and it became increasingly difficult to sustain the four Dakotas in Malaya during 1952. As a result, the Australian Government decided in September that year to return the squadron to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;38 Squadron RAAF AWM Malaya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; No. 38 Squadron left Changi for Richmond on 8 December.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_69 /&gt; The squadron's only fatality during the deployment was an airman who was killed when the [[No. 110 Squadron RAF]] Dakota he was co-piloting crashed during a flight between Changi and [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] on 31 August 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;38 Squadron RAAF AWM Malaya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis_27&quot;&gt;Dennis and Grey (1996), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational conversion unit===

After returning to Richmond, No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with routine transport duties.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_69 /&gt; The squadron also occasionally provided aircraft for [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] [[rainmaking]] experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather_77&quot;&gt;Eather (1995), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and early 1960s, No. 38 Squadron developed a reputation as a &quot;cowboy&quot; unit with lax flying standards. The squadron did not conduct proper conversion courses, and new Dakota pilots received only ad-hoc instruction on the type while serving as the co-pilot during operational tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (1995), p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 1953, No. 38 Squadron absorbed No. 36 Squadron's Dakotas, after which [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF|No. 30 Transport Unit]] (previously No. 30 Communication Unit) in Japan was renamed No. 36 Squadron. From late March until September 1954, No. 38 Squadron conducted VIP flights out of [[Fairbairn, Canberra|RAAF Station Canberra]]. In November that year, it was renamed the Transport Training Squadron and became responsible for instructing new Dakota crews and RAAF air movements personnel. It resumed its previous name on 13 June 1963.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_69 /&gt;

No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with new [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou]] tactical transport aircraft during 1964. In January 1964 the unit's commanding officer, five other pilots and three navigators undertook conversion training on the type in Canada. At the completion of this course the personnel flew the RAAF's first three Caribous from [[Toronto]] to RAAF Base Richmond between 17 March and 22 April.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1990), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The process of fully converting No. 38 Squadron to Caribous was delayed by the government's decision to deploy several of the aircraft to Vietnam; at the time this decision was made, in June 1964, the squadron had received six of its planned allocation of nine aircraft, and the next batch of three aircraft was sent directly to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark (1995), pp. 35, 38&lt;/ref&gt; No. 38 Squadron was the last operational RAAF squadron to fly Dakotas, though several other units did so until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1990), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A65 Douglas Dakota|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A65.htm|publisher=RAAF Museum|accessdate=9 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603123148/http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A65.htm|archivedate=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving its Caribous, No. 38 Squadron's main role was to train aircrews for operational service with the [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam]] (later redesignated No. 35 Squadron).&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_69 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather_77 /&gt; On 1 July 1964, one of the squadron's Caribous suffered severe damage when it made a crash landing at [[HMAS Albatross (air station)|HMAS ''Albatross'']]; this aircraft was subsequently written off and its fuselage used for training purposes by the Army's [[1st Commando Regiment (Australia)|1st Commando Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1990), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron became an independent unit under Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond in August that year, following the disbandment of No. 86 Wing.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_69 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo424&quot;&gt;Stephens (1995), pp. 424–425&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October 1965, Detachment A of No. 38 Squadron began operations from [[Port Moresby]] in the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]], equipped with two Caribous.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_70&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1990), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; One of the detachment's tasks was to give Caribou pilots experience in tropical and mountainous conditions, and all aircraft captains were required to complete at least one two-month deployment to Port Moresby before serving with No. 35 Squadron in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its training role, No. 38 Squadron undertook transport flights in and around Australia, taking part when required in relief efforts following natural disasters.&lt;ref name=Eather_77 /&gt;

===Peacekeeping deployments===
