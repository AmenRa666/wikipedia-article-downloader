Think we'd be better using more-or-less the original crop at http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a07409/ just losing a bit of the headroom, and maybe editing out any writing if needed to give appropriate headroom. A decent crop doesn't appear to exist yet; the supposed &quot;full&quot; version crops very, very tight to his head - I think it's from an alternate copy. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 07:03, 27 May 2015 (UTC)

== Microfiche showing much later father naturalization recently discovered ==

Chester A. Arthur gave a number of false and misleading statements about his family history. 
A recently discovered microfiche shows his father was a Commonwealth citizen who did not become naturalized until Chester was a young teenager. Although Chester was likely born on American soil this would have cast doubt on his &quot;natural born citizen&quot; status depending on which theory prevailed.

:Where is this information reliably documented? â€”[[User:Adavidb|ADavidB]] 11:41, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

::The only sources I found when I looked today were politically conservative opinion web sites such as Free Republic, The Battle for Truth, and Natural Born Citizen.  They're all in the context of anti-Barack Obama attacks from 2008.  The basic claim is that if William Arthur didn't become a naturalized citizen until the 1840s, then Chester Arthur wasn't a natural born citizen, or maybe was a dual citizen of Britain and the US, and was therefore ineligible to be president.  And if Chester Arthur was ineligible to be president, then so is Barack Obama.

::Of course, this line of attack says nothing about Arthur's mother being a US citizen by birth, or Arthur being a US citizen by birth -- both were born in Vermont.  By extension, the attack on Arthur also doesn't account for Barack Obama's mother having been born in Kansas and Obama having been born in Hawaii.

::By almost all interpretations of the term &quot;natural born citizen&quot;, if one of your parents is a US citizen, then you are a natural born citizen, regardless of your birthplace.  The question was explored in 2008, and the US Senate passed non-binding resolutions indicating its view that John McCain (born in the Panama Canal Zone) and Barack Obama (whose father was from Kenya) were both natural born citizens.

::To use an earlier example, ''Time'' and ''Life'' magazine publisher Henry Luce had reason to believe that if a Republican won the 1948 presidential election, Luce might be appointed Secretary of State.  At the time, before the passage of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the Secretary of State was next after the Vice President in the order of succession.  Luce had been born in China to US parents who were on a church mission, so he researched the natural born citizen clause.  Luce's attorneys were of the view that because at least one of his parents was a US citizen, the fact that he was born in China was irrelevant -- Luce was a natural born citizen and could serve as Secretary of State without disrupting the line of succession.  (Of course, the question was rendered moot by the passage of the 1947 act, which placed the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate ahead of the cabinet in the line of succession, as well as Republican nominee Dewey's loss to President Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.)

::All things considered, the story about William Arthur's naturalization seems to me to really be an inaccurate, ham-handed attack on Barack Obama.  Respectfully, I don't think it merits mention in the article on Chester A. Arthur.

::[[User:Billmckern|Billmckern]] ([[User talk:Billmckern|talk]]) 12:46, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

:::I agree. That he was born here was enough for 19th-century people. These more convoluted arguments are more about our own times and opposition to Barack Obama or Ted Cruz. Barring the publication of a reliably sourced article by a historian, let's leave it out. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 13:41, 14 January 2016 (UTC)</text>
