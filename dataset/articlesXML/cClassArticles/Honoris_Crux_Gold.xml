The '''Honoris Crux Gold''' (Gold Cross of Honour), post-nominal letters '''HCG''', is a South African military decoration for bravery which was instituted in 1975. It was awarded to members of the [[South African Defence Force]] for outstanding acts of bravery while in extreme danger. It was the second most senior in a set of four classes of Honoris Crux decorations which replaced the discontinued [[Honoris Crux (1952)|Honoris Crux of 1952]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PostNominals&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/militaf/sapnls.htm#GHI South African Medal Website - Post-nominal Letters] (Accessed 28 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The South African military==
The Union Defence Forces (UDF) were established in 1912 and renamed the South African Defence Force (SADF) in 1958. On 27 April 1994 it was integrated with six other independent forces into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).&lt;ref name=&quot;SADF 1952-1975&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/militaf/mil52.htm South African Medal Website - SA Defence Force : 1952-1975] (Accessed 30 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institution==
The Honoris Crux Gold (Gold Cross of Honour), post-nominal letters HCG, was instituted by the State President on 1 July 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;SADF 1952-1975&quot;/&gt;

==Award criteria==
The decoration could be awarded to members of the [[South African Defence Force]] for outstanding acts of bravery while in extreme danger. A Bar could be awarded for a further similar deed of bravery. It was the second most senior of a set of four classes of Honoris Crux decorations, the [[Honoris Crux Diamond]], Honoris Crux Gold, [[Honoris Crux Silver]] and [[Honoris Crux (1975)|Honoris Crux]], which together replaced the discontinued [[Honoris Crux (1952)|Honoris Crux of 1952]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SADF 1975-2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/militaf/mil75.htm South African Medal Website - SA Defence Force : 1975-2003] (Accessed 30 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order of wear==
{{main|South African military decorations order of wear#Order of wear}}
The position of the Honoris Crux Gold in the official order of precedence was revised four times after 1975 to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first with the discontinuation of the [[Honoris Crux Diamond]] (HCD) on 3 September 1993, then upon the integration into the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994, again in April 1996 when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted for the two former non-statutory forces, the [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], and finally with the institution of a new set of awards on 27 April 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette 15093&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette 27376&quot;/&gt;

==Description==
;Obverse
The Honoris Crux Gold is a silver-gilt Maltese cross which fits in a circle 45 millimetres in diameter, with two swords in [[saltire]] surmounted by a circular protea wreath, the arms of the cross in green enamel, with a roundel in the centre tierced horizontally in the orange, white and blue bands of the national flag, framed in a double silver circle containing 24 stones.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAMA&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=South African Military Awards 1912-1987 | publisher=South African National Museum of Military History | author=Monick, S | year=1988 | pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from being silver-gilt instead of silver and having a more ornate ribbon suspender, it is identical to the [[Honoris Crux Silver]] in all respects.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAMA&quot;/&gt;

;Reverse
The reverse has the [[:File:Coat of Arms of South Africa (1932-2000).svg|pre-1994 South African Coat of Arms]], with the decoration number underneath.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAMA&quot;/&gt;

;Bar
The bar is of silver-gilt with a miniature replica of the Maltese cross embossed in the centre. Only one bar was ever made, after the Bar to the HCG was awarded to Captain Arthur Walker HCG. In lieu of the Bar, he was initially presented with a Clasp for 40 years of service to the [[Permanent Force Good Service Medal]], also in silver-gilt, until one was eventually manufactured especially for him in 1991.

;Ribbon
The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and orange, with a single 1 millimetre wide white band in the centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAMA&quot;/&gt;

==Discontinuation==
Conferment of the decoration was discontinued in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette 27376&quot;/&gt;{{rp|3}}

He only withdrew when ordered to do so. Later Lieutenant Walker returned to the contact area to provide top cover for a Puma assigned to casualty evacuation. Again he was subject to heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire. During the withdrawal the second helicopter developed difficulties and called for assistance. Yet again Lieutenant Walker returned to provide top cover drawing virtually all the anti-aircraft fire to his Alouette. His courageous act prevented the loss of an Alouette and crew. Lieutenant Walker's actions were not only an outstanding display of professionalism, devotion to duty and courage, but also constitutes exceptional deeds of bravery under enemy fire and make him a worthy recipient of the Honoris Crux Gold.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerHist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkervillesa.co.za/walker.html|title=Walkerville - The Walker Family|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On take-off with the evacuee his number two helicopter was hit and crash-landed. Without hesitation and with total disregard for his personal safety Captain Walker landed near the wrecked helicopter and immediately searched for the crew. Eventually the situation became suicidal compelling Captain Walker and his crew to withdraw. When he was airborne he spotted the missing crew and yet again, without hesitation and despite the fact that virtually all enemy fire was now directed in his direction, he landed and uplifted the crew to safety. Through this courageous deed he prevented the loss of two men. His distinguished actions, devotion to duty and courage make him a credit to the South African Defence Force in general, the South African Air Force in particular and makes him a worthy recipient of the Bar to the Honoris Crux Gold.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerHist&quot;/&gt;}}
