'''Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud''' (1925 &amp;ndash; 22 October 2011) ({{lang-ar|سلطان بن عبدالعزيز آل سعود}}), called ''Sultan al-Khair'' ({{lang-ar|سلطان الخير}}, ''Sultan of goodness'') in [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref name=wmer29oct&gt;{{cite news|title=The Dream of Gerontocracy|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Succession.-a0272258958|accessdate=28 March 2013|work=The Weekly Middle East Reporter|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia from 2005 to 2011.

==Early life and education==
Sultan was born in [[Riyadh|Riyadh, Najd Sultanate]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=ppp/&gt; He was the 12th son of [[King Abdulaziz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mouline|first=Nabil|title=Power and generational transition in Saudi Arabia|journal=Critique internationale|date=April–June 2012|volume=46|pages=1–22|url=http://www.ceri-sciencespo.com/publica/critique/46/ci46_nm.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother was [[Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi]].&lt;ref name=Chai2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Winberg Chai|title=Saudi Arabia: A Modern Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lh4bENPP_HEC&amp;pg=PA193|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=22 September 2005|publisher=University Press|isbn=978-0-88093-859-4|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second of the [[Sudairi Seven]].&lt;ref name=she1aug&gt;{{cite news|last=Shenk|first=Mark|title=Oil Surges to Record as King Fahd's Death Raises Supply Concern|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=apDJnl7svZqo|accessdate=4 March 2013|work=Bloomberg|date=1 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aps29nov&gt;{{cite news|title=The Political Leadership - King Fahd|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SAUDI+ARABIA+-+The+Political+Leadership+-+King+Fahd.-a057816188|accessdate=16 March 2013|work=APS Review Gas Market Trends|date=29 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Sultan, along with many of his brothers, received his early education in religion, modern culture, and diplomacy at the royal court.&lt;ref name=ppp&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sultan bin Salman Al Saud|title=Supporting Peace, Justice and Equality|journal=Presidents and Prime Ministers|date=March 2001|volume=10|issue=2|page=16|url=http://www.questia.com/read/1G1-75373145/supporting-peace-justice-equality|accessdate=31 August 2013}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aps29nov/&gt;

==Early experience==
His career in public service began in 1940 when he was made a deputy to then [[Riyadh]] governor or emir, [[Nasser bin Abdulaziz|Prince Nasser]].&lt;ref name=aps29nov/&gt; In 1947, Prince Sultan replaced Prince Nasser as governor of Riyadh.&lt;ref name=cbcap/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc185pro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Kheirallah|title=Arabia Reborn|date=1952|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|page=254|url=https://www.questia.com/read/682471/arabia-reborn|accessdate=14 March 2015}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Sultan also assisted King Abdulaziz's attempts to establish a national administrative system based on the Islamic Sharia law during this period.&lt;ref name=cbcap/&gt; In 1947, Prince Sultan oversaw [[Aramco|ARAMCO's]] construction of the Kingdom's rail link between [[Dammam]] and Riyadh. He was appointed as the kingdom’s first minister of agriculture in 1953&lt;ref name=cbcap/&gt; and minister of transport in 1955.&lt;ref name=bloomberg11&gt;{{cite news|title=Crown Prince Sultan’s Death Starts Plan for Saudi Succession|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-01/crown-prince-sultan-s-death-starts-plan-for-saudi-succession.html|accessdate=13 April 2012|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=1 November 2011|author1=Glen Carey|author2=Vivian Salama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his direct military experience was brief, heading the Royal Guard in Riyadh in the early 1950s, he felt a lifelong connection to the military and the cause of Saudi independence from an early age.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; Major General [[Carl von Horn (1903–1989)|Carl von Horn]], Swedish commander of the UN observer mission during the [[North Yemen Civil War|Yemeni civil war]], described the Prince Sultan as &quot;a volatile and emotional young man&quot; in the early days.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

==Minister of Defense and Aviation==
In 1963, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Crown Prince Faisal]] appointed Prince Sultan as minister of defense and aviation.&lt;ref name=bbc185pro/&gt;&lt;ref name=lwire05&gt;{{cite news|title=Veteran Saudi defence minister becomes heir to throne|url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0805/05080121AFP.asp|accessdate=1 February 2013|work=Lebanonwire|date=1 August 2005|location=Riyadh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presided over the development of the [[Military of Saudi Arabia|Saudi armed forces]]. During the reign of King Faisal, Prince Sultan was particularly interested in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleySnider1979&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=P. Edward Haley|author2=Lewis W. Snider|author3=M. Graeme Bannerman|title=Lebanon in Crisis: Participants and Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdrqhFpLkC8C&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=16 October 2012|year=1979|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2210-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His influence declined under the reign of [[King Khalid]].&lt;ref name=HaleySnider1979/&gt;

Sultan purchased U.S. tanks, fighter planes, missiles and [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] (airborne warning and control systems).  However, as a result of problems assimilating technology within its armed forces, a relatively high proportion of the military equipment is stored or under maintenance, despite a large portion of Saudi's $34&amp;nbsp;billion defense budget being spent on maintaining military equipment. Sultan allegedly became extraordinarily wealthy from kickbacks by Western businesses that handled multibillion-dollar defense contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-12-22-02-primer-who-s-who-in-the-house-of-saud.html?pagewanted=2|title=The way we live now|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 December 2002|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in many scandals, including [[Al-Yamamah arms deal|the Al Yamamah deal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;saudipolitics&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101121/wl_mideast_afp/saudipoliticsroyalshealth;_ylt=Ak7X8By.biX9Wemgf9e76MgLewgF;_ylu=X3oDMTMwNTk5N3VsBGFzc2V0A2FmcC8yMDEwMTEyMS9zYXVkaXBvbGl0aWNzcm95YWxzaGVhbHRoBHBvcwM2BHNlYwN5bl9wYWdpbmF0ZV9zdW1tYXJ5X2xpc3QEc2xrA3NhdWRpa2luZ3RvdQ--|title=Saudi king to US for treatment of back ailment|date=21 November 2010|work=Yahoo! News|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his influence remained unhindered until his health began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;saudipolitics&quot;/&gt; During his tenure, Saudi Arabia became the largest importer of U.S. arms. He was a strong proponent of U.S.-Saudi partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0812/p09s02-coop.html|title=Backlash in Saudi Arabia|author=Nawaf Obaid|date=12 August 2002|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, Sultan authorized a deal with the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) in 1965. His program, called ''Operation Magic Carpet'', traded [[£]]16 million for six second-hand [[English Electric Lightning|Lightnings]], six [[Hawker Hunter]]s, and a set of missile launchers going to [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]. Geoffrey Edwards served as the official intermediary. British pilots also came over, privately contracted.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; Prince Sultan was an expert on the Yemen civil war and Soviet involvement in the [[Horn of Africa]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_briefing_for_PM&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2006/10/27/PJ5_39BriefforThatcherSept85.pdf|format=PDF|title=Briefing for the Prime Minister's meeting with Prince Sultan|date=25 September 1985|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vf9BP28b|archivedate=11 January 2011|deadurl=no|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Prince Sultan opposed Pentagon plans to relocate U.S. troops to safer locations after the [[Dhahran]] complex bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2yBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KYEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6015,6300009&amp;dq=prince+sultan+minister+of+defense&amp;hl=en|title=Saudi Arabia – Defense Minister opposes U.S. plans to move soldiers|work=The Vindicator|date=15 July 1996|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited [[Iran]] in May 1999 that was the first official visit of a Saudi minister since 1979.&lt;ref name=Cordesman2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony H.

==Second Deputy Prime Minister==
On 13 June 1982, after the death of [[King Khalid]] and Crown Prince Fahd became the King, Prince Sultan was appointed second deputy prime minister.&lt;ref name=bbc185pro/&gt;&lt;ref name=hjournal&gt;{{cite news|title=Crown Prince Fahd takes control of largest oil-exporting nation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19820614&amp;id=E4osAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5M4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6176,3067260|accessdate=28 July 2012|newspaper=Herald Journal|date=14 June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to his appointment as second deputy prime minister came in particular from two  half brothers, Musaid and [[Bandar bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Bandar]], both of whom, like [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], were born in 1923 and therefore, were older than Prince Sultan, who was born in 1925. The objection of Prince Musaid was easily ignored since his son, [[Faisal bin Musaid]], had assassinated King Faisal. However, the interests of Bandar bin Abdulaziz were much harder to ignore. Thus, he was compensated and the dispute was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simon Henderson|title=After King Abdullah. Succession in Saudi Arabia|journal=Policy Focus|date=August 2009|volume=96|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/pubPDFs/PolicyFocus96.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Sultan, in December 1995, attempted to seize power through the support of the Ulema when Crown Prince Abdullah was in Oman for a summit of [[Gulf Cooperation Council|the Gulf Cooperation Council]].&lt;ref name=pm97&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul Michael Wihbey|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia: The not so Silent Struggle|journal=IASPS Research Papers in Strategy|date=July 1997|issue=4|url=http://www.iasps.org/strategic4/SA.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his attempted coup failed.&lt;ref name=pm97/&gt;

In April 2005, Sultan donated £2 million to the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. This is regarded as one of the most controversial donations [[Oxford University]] received. A year after his donations to establish an art museum, Oxford University agreed to 'expedite' the scholarship application process for Saudi students, and identify colleges for ten Saudi students from [[Prince Sultan University]] (PSU). When this arrangement became public, it led to criticism from both academics and students stating that it was no academic worth to the university, bypassing Oxford’s governing council, and breaching the admissions process for prospective students.&lt;ref name=simcox&gt;{{cite web|last=Simcox|first=Robin|title=A Degree of Influence|url=http://w.socialcohesion.co.uk/files/1301651125_1.pdf|publisher=The Centre for Social Cohesion|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A press release issued by Oxford University on 20 April 2005 said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt; HRH Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has given the Ashmolean Museum a substantial donation to provide a fitting home for the Museum's internationally renowned collection of Islamic art. The total value of the gift is £2 million, which will also provide for ten scholarships at the University of Oxford for Saudi Arabian students.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The press release added further that ‘the new gallery, part of the ambitious redevelopment of one of the world’s oldest museums, will be named the “Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al Saud Gallery”’. ''[[Arab News]]'' on 21 April 2005 reported that Sultan’s donation was a ‘move to promote understanding between Islam and the West’, adding that ‘Saudi and British officials’ had said that the new gallery ‘will help to portray Islamic culture and civilization in right perspectives.’&lt;ref name=simcox/&gt;

==Personal life==
Prince Sultan had thirty-two children by his multiple wives. His eldest son [[Khalid bin Sultan]], after Prince Sultan's death, was appointed deputy minister of defense and served in the post until 20 April 2013.&lt;ref name=reugulf&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi deputy defence minister Prince Khalid Bin Sultan replaced|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-deputy-defence-minister-prince-khalid-bin-sultan-replaced-1.1172889|accessdate=20 April 2013|newspaper=Gulf News|date=20 April 2013|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bandar bin Sultan]] was the secretary general of [[National Security Council (Saudi Arabia)|the national security council]] between 2005 and January 2015, and the former head of [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah|the general intelligency directorate]].

==Characteristics==
Prince Sultan was regarded{{By whom|date=August 2012}} as a workaholic .He doled out money at banquets in keeping with tribal custom. A conservative, it was expected that he would have put a brake on [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]]'s timid reforms, if he had become king, he was considered to be pro-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Penketh|first=Anne|title=Succession at House of Saud: The men who would be king|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/succession-at-house-of-saud-the-men-who-would-be-king-848505.html|accessdate=13 April 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Sultan took a lifetime [[anti-communist]] and [[anti-Soviet]] view, based on his dislike of Soviet [[state atheism]] as well as Soviet interest in Gulf oil and access to ports that he felt risked Saudi independence. He rebuked U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] for what he saw as &quot;pusillanimity&quot; in the face of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8844666/Crown-Prince-Sultan-Ibn-Abdul-Aziz-al-Saud.html|title=Crown Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz al Saud|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=23 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 23 October 2001 interview in Kuwaiti newspaper ''As Seyassa'', concerning [[9/11]] attacks, Sultan stated “Who stands behind this terrorism and who carried out this complicated and carefully planned terrorist operation? Osama bin Laden and those with him have said what indicates that they stand behind this carefully planned act. We, in turn, ask: Are bin Laden and his supporters the only ones behind what happened or is there another power with advanced technical expertise that acted with them?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dudney|first=Robert S.|title=Verbatim Special: War on Terror|journal=Air Force Magazine|date=December 2001|pages=40–48|url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2001/December%202001/1201verb.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morocco vacation===
In February 2009, Sultan spent several months in New York City at [[New York–Presbyterian Hospital]] and underwent surgery in New York. He then convalesced at [[Agadir]], Morocco. He went back to Saudi Arabia, but soon returned to Morocco in August 2009. During his vacation, the Saudi cabinet increased officer salaries, a traditional domain of Sultan.&lt;ref name=reukhaleej&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2010/October/middleeast_October446.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col|title=Saudi crown prince in good health, on holiday|date=27 October 2010|agency=Reuters|newspaper=Khaleej Times|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, King Abdullah took charge of all defense purchases and reduced the power of the Defense Ministry. In October 2010, Abdullah personally conducted much of the negotiations for the U.S. arms package worth over $60&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.officialwire.com/main.php?action=posted_news&amp;rid=245784&amp;catid=855|title=For Saudis, U.S. Arms Deal is a Challenge|date=26 October 2010|work=iWireNews ™ (iWireNews ™ and OfficialWire)|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
