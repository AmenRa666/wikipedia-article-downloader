{{Foreign relations of France by continent}}

'''France–Asia relations''' span a period of more than two millennia, starting in the 6th century [[BCE]] with the establishment of [[Marseille]] by Greeks from Asia Minor, and continuing in the 3rd century BCE with Gaulish invasions of [[Asia Minor]] to form the kingdom of [[Galatia]] and Frankish Crusaders forming the Crusader States. Since these early interactions, France has had a rich history of contacts with the Asian continent.

The [[Phoenicia]]ns had an early presence around [[Marseille]] in southern France. Phoenician inscriptions have been found there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lcj-_dqCraEC&amp;pg=PT238] ''History of Phoenicia'' by Canon George Rawlinson p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest city of France, Marseille, was formally founded in 600 BCE by Greeks from the [[Asia Minor]] city of [[Phocaea]] (as mentioned by [[Thucydides]] Book 1, 13, [[Strabo]], [[Athenaeus]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]) as a trading port under the name Μασσαλία (''Massalia'').&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge ancient history&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA754] ''The Cambridge ancient history'' p. 754&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orrieux&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&amp;pg=PA62] ''A history of ancient Greece'' Claude Orrieux p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; These eastern Greeks, established on the shores of southern France, were in close relations with the [[Celts|Celtic]] inhabitants of France, and Greek influence and artifacts penetrated northwards along the [[Rhône]] valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orrieux&quot;/&gt; The site of [[Vix, Côte-d'Or|Vix]] in northern [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] became an active trading center between Greeks and natives, attested by the discovery of Greek artifacts of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orrieux&quot;/&gt;

The mother city of Phocaea would ultimately be destroyed by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in 545 BCE, further reinforcing the exodus of the Phocaeans to their settlements of the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&amp;pg=PA61] ''A history of ancient Greece'' Claude Orrieux p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ls6MczXvBEC&amp;pg=PA74] ''The ancient mariners'' Lionel Casson p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Populations intermixed, becoming half-Greek and half-indigenous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orrieux&quot;/&gt; Trading links were extensive, in iron, spices, wheat and slaves, and with [[tin]] being imported to Marseille overland from [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&amp;pg=PA63] ''A history of ancient Greece'' Claude Orrieux p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek settlements permitted cultural interaction between the Greeks and the Celts, and in particular helped develop an urban way of life in Celtic lands, contacts with sophisticated Greek methods, as well as regular East-West trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&amp;pg=PA65] ''A history of ancient Greece'' Claude Orrieux p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Overland trade with Celtic countries declined around 500  however, with the troubles following the end of the [[Hallstatt culture|Halstatt civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orrieux&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|right|thumb| The ''[[Dying Gaul]]'', an ancient Roman marble copy of a lost ancient Greek statue, thought to have been executed in bronze, commissioned some time between 230 and 220 BCE by [[Attalus I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honour his victory over the Galatians, also called ''Gallo-Graeci''.]]
Because of demographic pressure, the [[Senones]] [[Gauls]] departed from Central France under [[Brennus (4th century)|Brennus]] to sack Rome in the [[Battle of the Allia (390 BC)|Battle of the Allia]] c. 390 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hF99FuqC6JwC&amp;pg=PA85] ''A History of Rome to the Death of Caesar'' W. W. How p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion continued eastward, into the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] world, with a huge migration of Eastern Gauls appearing in [[Thrace]], north of Greece, in 281 BCE in the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans]], favoured by the troubled rule of the [[Diadochi]] after [[Alexander the Great]].

A part of the invasion crossed over to [[Anatolia]] and eventually settled in the area that came to be named after them, Galatia. The invaders, led by [[Leonnorius]] and Lutarius, came at the invitation of [[Nicomedes I of Bithynia|Nicomedes I]] of [[Bithynia]], who required help in a dynastic struggle against his brother [[Zipoites II]]. Three tribes crossed over from Thrace to Asia Minor. They numbered about 10,000 fighting men and about the same number of women and children, divided into three tribes, [[Trocmi]], [[Tolistobogii]] and [[Tectosages]] (from the area of [[Toulouse]] in southern France). They were eventually defeated by the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I]], in a battle where the Seleucid war elephants shocked the Celts. While the momentum of the invasion was broken, the Galatians were by no means exterminated. Instead, the migration led to the establishment of a long-lived Celtic territory in central [[Anatolia]], which included the eastern part of ancient [[Phrygia]], a territory that became known as Galatia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History: The last age of the Roman Republic'' p. 131 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yUkzNLiY4oC&amp;pg=RA1-PA131]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of all nations, from the earliest periods to the present'' Samuel Griswold Goodrich p. 288 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YU3TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA288]&lt;/ref&gt; There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran [[Bithynia]] and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries.

In 189 BCE Rome sent [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] on an expedition against the Galatians. He defeated them. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BCE onward.&lt;ref&gt;''Rome's Mediterranean empire: books forty-one to forty-five and the Periochae'' by Livy, Jane D.

Christianity, following its emergence in the [[Near East|Near-Eastern]] part of Asia, was traditionally introduced by [[Mary, sister of Lazarus|Mary]], [[Martha (opera)|Martha]], [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and some companions, who were expelled by persecutions from the [[Holy Land]]. They traversed the Mediterranean in a frail boat with neither rudder nor mast and landed at ''[[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]]'' near [[Arles]] in 40 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8OZiItqneFsC&amp;pg=PA294] ''Otia imperialia: recreation for an emperor'' p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SAQhVyHelOoC&amp;pg=PT96] ''Adventure Guide to Provence &amp; the Cote D'azur'' by Ferne Arfin p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; [[Provence|Provençal]] tradition names Lazarus as the first [[bishop of Marseille]], while Martha purportedly went on to tame [[Tarasque|a terrible beast]] in nearby [[Tarascon]]. Pilgrims visited their tombs at the abbey of [[Vézelay]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. In the Abbey of the Trinity at [[Vendôme]], a [[Amulet|phylactery]] was said to contain a [[relic|tear shed by Jesus]] at the tomb of Lazarus. The cathedral of [[Autun]], not far away, is dedicated to Lazarus as ''Saint Lazaire''.

The first written records of Christians in France date from the 2nd century when [[Irenaeus]] detailed the deaths of ninety-year-old bishop [[Pothinus]] of [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]) and other martyrs of the 177 [[persecution in Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;''The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology'' by Berard L.

In 496 [[Saint Remigius|Remigius]] baptized [[Clovis I]], who was converted from [[paganism]] to [[Catholicism]]. Clovis I, considered the founder of France, made himself the ally and protector of the papacy and his predominantly Catholic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 500–c. 700'' by Paul Fouracre p. 206 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JcmwuoTsKO0C&amp;pg=PA206]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 5th century, various Asian nomadic tribes of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin, especially the [[Taifals]] and [[Sarmatian]]s, were settled in Gaul by the Romans as ''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]''. They settled in the regions of [[Aquitaine]] and [[Poitou]], which at one point was even called ''Thifalia'' or ''Theiphalia'' (Theofalgicus) in the 6th century, with remaining place names such as [[Tiffauges]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bachrach&quot;&gt;''Merovingian military organization, 481–751'' by Bernard S. Bachrach p. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WctqG2vpQrwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Warfare and society in the barbarian West, 450–900'' Guy Halsall p. 44 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_xjGjVcpMzEC&amp;pg=PA44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gregory of Tours: life of the fathers'' by Saint Gregory (Bishop of Tours), Edward James p. 95 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZtEwxKWTHMC&amp;pg=PA95]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Sarmatians had also been settled in the [[Rodez]]–[[Velay]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bachrach&quot;/&gt;

From 414, [[Alans]] who had allied and then split with the [[Visigoth]]s, entered into an agreement with the Romans which allowed them to settle in the area between [[Toulouse]] and the Mediterranean where they played a defensive role against the Visigoth in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SXER_fLym9kC&amp;pg=RA1-PA30] ''A history of the Alans in the West'' Bernard S. Bachrach p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman general [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] settled Alans in Gaul for military purposes, first in the region of [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] in 440 to control the lower [[Isère]] valley, and in 442 in the area around [[Orléans]], apparently to counter the [[Armorica]]n ''[[Bacaudae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Romans and Barbarians: The Decline of the Western Empire'' by E. A. Thompson p. 34 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BiXgsE7vsjcC&amp;pg=PA34]&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities have been named after them, such as [[Allaines]] or [[Allainville, Eure-et-Loir|Allainville]].
[[File:Attila in Gaul 451CE.svg|left|thumb|The general path of the Hun forces in the invasion of Gaul]]
In 450 [[Attila]] proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful [[Visigoth]] kingdom of [[Toulouse]], making an [[military alliance|alliance]] with Emperor [[Valentinian III]] in order to do so. Attila gathered his [[vassal]]s—[[Gepids]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Rugians]], [[Scirians]], [[Heruls]], [[Thuringians]], Alans, [[Burgundians]], among others and began his march west. In 451 he arrived in [[Belgica]] with an army exaggerated by Jordanes to half a million strong. [[J.B. Bury]] believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom – already the strongest on the continent – across [[Gaul]] to the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B. Bury]], ''The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians'', lecture IX [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/bury/017.php (e-text)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April, Attila captured [[Metz]]. Saint [[Genevieve]] is believed to have saved Paris.

The Romans under [[Flavius Aetius|Aëtius]] allied with troops from among the [[Franks]], the [[Burgundians]], the [[Celts]], the [[Goths]] and the Alans and finally stopped the advancing Huns in the [[Battle of Châlons]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SXER_fLym9kC&amp;pg=PA66] ''A history of the Alans in the West'' by Bernard S.

===Exchanges with the Arab world (8th–13th centuries)===
[[File:Steuben - Bataille de Poitiers.png|thumb|left|[[Charles Martel]] (mounted) facing [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|‘Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] (right) at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]]]]
Following the rise of [[Islam]] in the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the 7th century, the Arabs invaded northern Africa, then the [[Iberian peninsula]] and France. They were finally repelled at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, but thereafter remained a significant presence in southern France and Spain.

Various exchanges are known around that time, as when [[Arculf]], a Frankish Bishop, visited the [[Holy Land]] in the 670s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qtgotOF0MKQC&amp;pg=PA18] ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'' by André Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Michael Lapidge p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

These contacts followed an intense conflict between the Carolingians and the [[Umayyads]], marked by the landslide Battle of Tours in 732, and were aimed at establishing a counter–alliance with the distant Abbasid Empire. There were numerous embassies between [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] from 797,&lt;ref name=&quot;AyMXqaozwC p. 172&quot;/&gt; apparently in view of a Carolingian-Abbasid alliance against [[Byzantium]],&lt;ref&gt;''Charlemagne, Muhammad, and the Arab roots of capitalism'' by Gene W.

===Cultural and scientific exchanges===
{{main article|Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|Islamic influences on Christian art}}
From the 10th to the 13th century, [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe]], including France, were numerous, affecting such varied areas as [[Islamic art|art]], [[Islamic architecture|architecture]], [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[Islamic music|music]], [[Influence of Arabic on other languages|language]], [[Madrasah|education]], [[Sharia|law]], and [[Inventions in the Islamic world|technology]]. Over several centuries Europe absorbed knowledge from the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]], but also knowledge from India or lost knowledge from the ancient Greeks which was being retransmitted by the Arabs. The French scientist [[Gerbert of Aurillac]], future [[Pope Sylvester II]], who had spent some time in [[Catalonia]] in the 960s, was instrumental in the adoption of [[Arabic numerals]],&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine'', ed. [[Helaine Selin]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA1] p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[abacus]] in France and Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==France and the Near East (16th-19th centuries)==
Between the 16th and 19th century, France had at times a relatively dormant relation with the [[Near East]] (or [[Western Asia]]), while at other times was closely politically intertwined. Relations with the region were mostly dominated through the two empires that ruled the area, namely the rivaling [[Ottoman Empire]], and the various [[Iran|Persian]] dynasties between these centuries ([[Safavids]], [[Afsharids]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]]). The rivalry between the French, British, and Russians was a key factor in foreign policies for the French for the region, finding themselves at times allied with the Turks or Persians.

===Franco-Ottoman alliance (16th–18th centuries)===
{{main article|Franco-Ottoman alliance|Orientalism in early modern France}}
[[File:Francois I Suleiman.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (left) and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (right) initiated a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] from the 1530s.]]
Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and to set up instruction in the [[Arabic language]], through the instruction of [[Guillaume Postel]] at the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8fniRER4kC&amp;pg=PA26] ''Eastern {{Not a typo|Wisedome}} and Learning: the Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England'' by [[G. J. Toomer]] p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] was established in 1536 between the king of France [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and the Turkish ruler of the [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] following the critical setbacks which Francis had encountered in Europe against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The alliance has been called &quot;the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w5iJ1tfLnnoC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Franco-Turkish+alliance%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=cafPSe7_M46WMsLtnJsL&amp;hl=en#PPA62,M1] Kann, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; It caused a scandal in the Christian world,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, p.2&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and was designated as &quot;the impious alliance&quot;, or &quot;the sacrilegious union of the [[Fleur-de-Lis|Lily]] and the [[Crescent]]&quot;; nevertheless, it endured since it served the objective interests of both parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AkMHta3C7LUC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=%22Franco-Turkish+alliance%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=Ad3PSaXUHaTYMOvAmAw&amp;hl=en#PPA134,M1] Merriman, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

The French forces, led by [[François de Bourbon, Count of Enghien|François de Bourbon]] and the Ottoman forces, led by [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]], joined at [[Marseille]] in August 1543,&lt;ref&gt;''A New General Biographical Dictionary, Volume III'' by Hugh James Rose [https://books.google.com/books?id=lHYcKMBEb8sC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22Siege+of+Nice%22+1543&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborated to bombard the city of [[Nice]] in the [[Siege of Nice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, p.2&quot;/&gt; In this action 110 Ottoman galleys, amounting to 30,000 men,&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; combined with 50 French galleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam p.328&quot;&gt;''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The Franco-Ottomans laid waste to the city, but met a stiff resistance which gave rise to the story of [[Catherine Ségurane]]. Afterwards, Francis allowed the Ottomans to winter at [[Toulon]].

The strategic and sometimes tactical alliance lasted for about three centuries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriman, p.132&quot;&gt;Merriman, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; until the [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt]], an Ottoman territory, in 1798–1801.

===French diplomacy with Persia (16th-19 centuries)===
The advent of Shah [[Ismail I]] in 1501 coincided with crucial world events. Becoming the eventual archrival of the Ottomans, the shah sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a precarious alliance against the Ottomans together with the Portuguese, Emperor Charles V, and King Ludvig II of [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-ii|title=RELATIONS WITH PERSIA TO 1789|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas other European governments repeatedly insisted on their avowed desire to cooperate with Persia against the Turks, France remained aloof due to the treaty of 1536 between [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and Suleiman the Magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-ii|title=RELATIONS WITH PERSIA TO 1789|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Suleiman I invaded north-west Persia and took [[Tabriz]] during the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)]], he was accompanied by the French ambassador [[Gabriel de Luetz]], whose advice enabled the Ottomans to force the Persians to surrender the citadel of [[Van]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-ii|title=RELATIONS WITH PERSIA TO 1789|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the tide turned in 1604 as Persia gained the upper hand against Ottonan Turkey, the French ambassador to the Porte, [[Savary de Brèves]], wrote a memoir on how an alliance with Persian would be detrimental to Franco–Ottoman relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-ii|title=RELATIONS WITH PERSIA TO 1789|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Turkish alliance prevented Henri IV from responding to the overtures made to him by shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]], who was rapidly reconquering lost territories and conquering beyond that in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-ii|title=RELATIONS WITH PERSIA TO 1789|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French endeavors in the Near East remained cautious and limited even after the fall of the [[Safavids]]. However, France played an important part in post-Safavid external policies through [[Marquis de Bonnac]], ambassador to the Porte, and who was an active mediator between Russia, Iran, and Turkey, all regional rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-ii|title=RELATIONS WITH PERSIA TO 1789|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cultural links between France and Persia, although gradually developing through this period, suffered at times because of ruptures in diplomatic commercial relations. However, relations picked up intensely with the advent of Napoleon and the [[Qajar dynasty]] in [[Persia]].

====Franco-Persian alliance (19th century)====

Despite the hostility of Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]] towards both neighbouring rival [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] and the French Revolution, the ascendancy of the new monarchy in Persia represented by the Qajar dynasty did not at once lead to closer relations between the two,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-iii-relations-with-persia-1789-1918|title=FRANCE iii.

[[File:Gardane Jaubert Jouanin.jpg|thumb|General [[Claude Matthieu, Count Gardane|Gardane]], with colleagues Jaubert and Joanin, at the Persian court of [[Fath Ali Shah]] in 1808]]
Following his victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in 1805, Napoleon managed to establish the short-lived [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] and a [[Franco-Persian alliance]] formalized in the [[Treaty of Finckenstein]] in 1807, while Persia and Russia were already for three years in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]], in order to obtain strategic support in his fight against the [[Russian Empire]].

The treaty included French support for Persia to reclaim its lost territories comprising Georgia and other territories in the Caucasus that were occupied by Russia by that time, promising to act so that Russia would surrender the territory. In exchange, Persia was to fight Great Britain, and allow France to cross the Persian territory to eventually reach India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sicker p.97&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BzMJys65u9wC&amp;pg=PA97] &quot;The Islamic World in decline&quot; by Martin Sicker p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the political atmosphere that marked the peace between France and Russia at the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] made the alliance lose its motivation. The ongoing [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]] despite several successes partly influenced due to initial French assistance, resulted eventually in combination with the Treaty of Tilsit in a disaster for Persia, as not only was it forced to recognize Russian suzerainty over Georgia, its own land which it had been ruling for centuries, but it also facilitated the cession of [[Dagestan]] and most of what is today [[Azerbaijan]] to Russia amongst the other terms of the [[Treaty of Gulistan]].&lt;ref&gt;John F. Baddeley. &quot;The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus&quot;. Longman, Green and Co., London: 1908, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===French plans in Egypt===
Napoleon attempted to establish a decisive French presence in Asia, by first launching his [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|Egyptian Campaign]] in 1798. He wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, and was then planning to make a junction with [[Tippu Sahib]] in India, against the British.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o4vrUbMK5eEC&amp;pg=PA13] ''Tricolor and crescent'' William E. Watson pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon assured the [[Directoire]] that ''&quot;as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n5IOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA12] ''Napoleon and Persia'' by Iradj Amini, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 13 February 1798 report by [[Talleyrand]]: ''&quot;Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send a force of 15,000 men from [[Suez]] to India, to join the forces of Tipu-Sahib and drive away the English.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; The Directory, though troubled by the scope and cost of the enterprise, agreed so the popular general would be absent from the centre of power.&lt;ref&gt;Schom 1998, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial, religious and military expansion (16th-18th century)==

===Early-modern contacts with East-Asia (1527-)===

France began trading with Eastern Asia from the early 16th century. In 1526, a sailor from [[Honfleur]] named [[Pierre Caunay]] sailed to [[Sumatra]]. He lost his ship on the return leg between Africa and [[Madagascar]], where the crew was imprisoned by the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAbe78&quot;&gt;''Orientalism in early Modern France'' 2008 Ina Baghdiantz McAbe, p. 78, ISBN 978-1-84520-374-0&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1527, a French [[Normandy|Norman]] trading ship from [[Rouen]] is recorded by the Portuguese [[João de Barros]] to have arrived in the Indian city of [[Diu, India|Diu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Dodwell |editor-first=H.

In 1529, [[Jean Parmentier (explorer)|Jean Parmentier]], sailing with the ''Sacre'' and the ''Pensée'', reached Sumatra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HlibHoeruDUC&amp;pg=PA123] ''European travellers in India'' Edward Farley Oaten p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the [[Dieppe maps]], influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers, such as [[Jean Rotz]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P7OuMkzGKw0C&amp;pg=PA57] ''Explorers and colonies: America, 1500-1625'' David B. Quinn p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Portuguese and Spanish forays into Asia after 1500, a few Frenchmen participated in the activities of Catholic religious orders in these countries during the 16th century. The first instance of [[France-Thailand relations]] occurred according to the [[Jesuit]] [[Giovanni Pietro Maffei]] when about 1550 a French [[Franciscan]], Bonferre, hearing of the great kingdom of the Peguans and the [[Siam]]ese in the East, went on a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship from [[Goa]] to Cosme ([[Pegu]]), where for three years he preached the [[Gospel]], but without any result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=in8qAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Bonferre+Maffei&amp;dq=Bonferre+Maffei&amp;pgis=1] ''The Catholic encyclopedia'', p. 766&lt;/ref&gt;

====François Pyrard and François Martin (1601-1611)====
[[File:Itinéraire de Pyrard de Laval.JPG|thumb|left|Itinerary of [[François Pyrard de Laval]] (1601—1611)]]
In December 1600 a company was formed through the association of [[Saint-Malo]], [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] and [[Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine|Vitré]], to trade with the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] and Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;/&gt; Two ships, the ''Croissant'' and the ''Corbin'', were sent around the Cape in May 1601. One was wrecked in the [[Maldives]], leading to the adventure of [[François Pyrard de Laval]] who managed to return to France in 1611.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;/&gt; The second ship, carrying [[François Martin de Vitré]], reached [[Ceylon]] and traded with [[Acheh]] in Sumatra, but was captured by the Dutch on the return leg at [[Cape Finisterre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;/&gt; François Martin de Vitré was the first Frenchman to write an account of travels to the [[Far East]] in 1604, at the request of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and from that time numerous accounts on Asia were published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Making&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lach |first1=Donald F. |author-link=Donald F.

From 1604 to 1609, following the return of François Martin de Vitré, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] developed a strong enthusiasm for commerce with Asia, and attempted to set up a [[French East India Company]] on the model of England and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Making&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2002 |origyear=First published 1994 as ''Histoire de l'Inde Moderne'' |editor-last=Markovits |editor-first=Claude |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950 |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |page=144 |isbn=978-1-84331-004-4 |quote=The account ...

On 1609, another adventurer, [[Pierre-Olivier Malherbe]] returned from a circumnavigation, and informed Henry IV of his adventures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Making&quot;/&gt; He visited China, and in India had an encounter with [[Akbar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Making&quot;/&gt;

On the missionary front, [[Nicolas Trigault]] resumed [[People's Republic of China – France relations|France-China relations]] when he left Europe to do missionary work in Asia around 1610, eventually arriving at [[Nanjing]], China in 1611.

====Hasekura Tsunenaga (1615)====
[[File:Hasekura in Rome.JPG|thumb|[[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] initiated [[France-Japan relations]] when he landed in [[Saint-Tropez]] in 1615.]]
{{further information|France-Japan relations|Hasekura Tsunenaga}}
[[France-Japan relations]] started in 1615 when [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]], a Japanese samurai and ambassador, sent to Rome by [[Date Masamune]], landed at [[Saint-Tropez]] for a few days. In 1636, [[Guillaume Courtet]], a French [[Dominican order|Dominican]] priest, would reciprocate when he set foot in Japan. He penetrated into Japan clandestinely, against the 1613 interdiction of [[Christianity]]. He was caught, tortured, and died in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] on 29 September 1637.&lt;ref&gt;''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' by Alban Butler, Paul Burns, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

====Company of the Moluccas (1615)====
In 1615, the regent [[Marie de Médicis]] incorporated the merchants of Dieppe and other harbours to found the [[Company of the Moluccas]]. In 1616, two expeditions were Asia–bound from [[Honfleur]] in [[Normandy]]: three ships left for India, and two ships for [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]]. One ship returned from Bantam in 1617 with a small cargo, and letters from the Dutch expressing their hostility towards French ships in the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lach |first1=Donald F. |author-link=Donald F.

One was captured by the Dutch, but the other obtained an agreement from the ruler of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]] to build a fortress and a factory there, and returned with a rich cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Fleet of Montmorency led by Augustin de Beaulieu 1619 1622.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Fleet of Montmorency&quot;, led by [[Augustin de Beaulieu]], in the [[East Indies]] (1619—1622)]]
In 1619, an armed expedition composed of three ships (275 crew, 106 cannons) called the &quot;Fleet of Montmorency&quot; under General [[Augustin de Beaulieu]] was sent from Honfleur, to fight the Dutch in the Far East. They encountered the Dutch fleet off Sumatra. One ship was captured, another remained in Asia for inter-country trade, and the third returned to [[Le Havre]] in 1622. In 1624, with the [[Treaty of Compiègne]], [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] obtained that the Dutch would stop fighting the French in the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;/&gt; [[Isaac de Razilly]] commented however:
{{quote|As regards Asia and the East Indies there is no hope of planting colonies, for the way is too long, and the Spaniards and Dutch are too strong to suffer it.| [[Isaac de Razilly]], 1625.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt;}}
[[File:Jean de Thévenot (1664).jpg|thumb|[[Jean de Thévenot]], from &quot;Relation d'un voyage fait au Levant&quot; (1664)]]
However, trade further developed, with the activities of people such as [[Jean de Thévenot]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] in 17th century Asia. [[Gilles de Régimont]] travelled to Persia and India in 1630 and returned in 1632 with a rich cargo. He formed a trading company at Dieppe in 1633, and sent ships every year to the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I_S1D8cnTiEC&amp;pg=PT127] ''Shipwrecks of Madagascar'' Pierre Van Den Boogaerde p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1638, the Honfleur sailor [[Pierre Berthelot]], after becoming a [[Carmelite]] in [[Goa]] in the mission of [[Francis Xavier]], was martyred in [[Aceh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Divine aporia: postmodern conversations about the other'' by John Charles Hawley p. 205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=j1hCAyHW7L4C&amp;pg=PA205]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion under Louis XIV===
{{main article|French East India Company|Paris Foreign Missions Society}}
France adopted a more structured approach to its expansion in Asia during the 17th century during the rule of [[Louis XIV]], in an organized attempt to establish a [[mercantilism|mercantile empire]] by taking a share of the lucrative market of the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;''Colbert, Mercantilism, and the French Quest for Asian Trade'' by Ames, Glenn J.　Northern Illinois University Press [http://www.owlbooks.jp/y_detail.jsp?ID=8087580207]&lt;/ref&gt; On the religious plane, the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] was formed from 1658 in order to provide for missionary work in Asia mainly, under French control. Soon after, the [[French East India Company]] was established in 1664.

[[File:King Narai.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chevalier de Chaumont]] presents a letter from [[Louis XIV]] to [[King Narai]] in 1685.]]
In 1664 a mission was sent to [[Madagascar]] under [[François Caron]], formerly in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The Madagascar mission failed, but soon after, Caron succeeded in founding French outposts at [[Surat]] (1668) and at [[Masulipatam]] (1669) in India;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p266&quot;&gt;Pope, George Uglow. (1880). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xpABAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA266] ''A Text-book of Indian History,'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Caron became &quot;Commissaire&quot; at [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]] (1668—1672). The French East India Company set up a trading centre at Pondicherry in 1673. This outpost eventually became the chief French settlement in India.

In 1672, Caron helped lead French forces in [[Ceylon]], where the strategic bay at [[Trincomalee]] was captured and [[St. Thomé]] (also known as [[Meilâpûr]]) on the [[Coromandel coast]] was also taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;p266&quot;/&gt; However, his military success was short-lived. The French were driven out while Caron was en route to Europe in 1673.&lt;ref name=&quot;f42&quot;&gt;Frazer, Robert Watson. (1896).

During the reign of Louis XIV, France further developed [[France–Thailand relations]] and sent numerous embassies to [[Siam]], led by [[Alexandre, Chevalier de Chaumont|Chevalier de Chaumont]] in 1685 and later by [[Simon de la Loubère]] in 1687, until French troops were ousted from the country following the 1688 [[Siege of Bangkok]]. Around the same time France actively participated in the [[Jesuit China missions]], as Louis XIV sent in 1685 a mission of five Jesuits &quot;mathematicians&quot; to China in an attempt to break the Portuguese predominance: [[Jean de Fontaney]] (1643–1710), [[Joachim Bouvet]] (1656–1730), [[Jean-François Gerbillon]] (1654–1707), [[Louis Le Comte]] (1655–1728) and [[Claude de Visdelou]] (1656–1737).&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China'' - p. 182 by Catherine Pagani (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bXxHSZkWssC&amp;pg=PA182]&lt;/ref&gt; While French Jesuits were found at the court of the [[Qing Dynasty|Manchu]] [[Kangxi Emperor]] in China, Louis received the visit of a Chinese Jesuit, [[Michael Shen Fu-Tsung]], by 1684.&lt;ref&gt;''The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art'' p. 98 by Michael Sullivan (1989) ISBN 0-520-21236-3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8pLhEWdaMvEC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Louis+XIV+Couplet+Michel&amp;sig=x4USX2wQ6&amp;nbsp;lbhEx2pQMX8QCATkoU]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several years later, he had at his court a Chinese librarian and translator — [[Arcadio Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Linda L.

After these first experiences, France took a more active role in Asia from its base in India. France was able to establish the beginnings of a commercial and territorial empire in India, leading to the formation of [[French India]]. Active [[Franco-Indian alliances]] were established to reinforce French influence and counter British efforts on the country. [[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Suffren]] had a considerable role in upholding French naval power in the [[Indian Ocean]]. 
[[Burma–France relations]] started in 1727 with approaches by [[Joseph François Dupleix]], and were cemented in 1729 with the building of a shipyard in the city of [[Syriam]]. France allied with the [[Mon people]] and participated in the Burman-Mon conflict in 1751–1756 under [[Sieur de Bruno]] and [[Pierre de Milard]].&lt;ref&gt;''Europe and Burma: A Study of European Relations with Burma''- p. 62 by Daniel George Edward Hall - 1945: &quot;Dupleix promised them men and munitions, but before deciding how far to commit himself he sent over his agent, the Sieur de Bruno, to Pegu&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, Ronald and O'Rourke, Kevin H. (2007) ''Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=tcZoUGGw3ssC&amp;pg=PA277]&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographical exploration of Asia was expanded thanks to the efforts of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]] and [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|La Pérouse]].

Following the development of [[France-Vietnam relations]] through early trade and religious contacts, France intervened militarily in Vietnam at the end of the 18th century through the [[French assistance to Nguyễn Ánh]] under Mgr [[Pigneau de Behaine]].

France thus managed to gain strong positions in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeastern Asia]], but these efforts were essentially wrecked with the outcome of the [[French revolution]] and [[Napoleonic wars]].

Trade also developed, with the activities of people such as [[Pierre Poivre]] who dealt with Vietnam from the 1720s.

===Asia in 17th-18th-century French art===
{{main article|Chinoiserie|Turquerie}}
[[File:C. van Loo Sultane.jpg|thumb|[[Madame de Pompadour]] portrayed as a Turkish lady by [[Charles André van Loo]] (1747)]]
The discovery of Asia led to a strong cultural interest in Asian arts. France especially developed a taste for artistic forms derived from Chinese art and narratives, called [[Chinoiserie]], as well as for Turkish scenes, called [[Turquerie]]. French textile industry was also strongly influenced by Asian style, with the development of the silk and [[tapestry]] industries. A carpet industry ''façon de Turquie'' (&quot;in the manner of Turkey&quot;) was developed in France in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] by [[Pierre Dupont]], who was returning from the [[Levant]], and especially rose to prominence during the reign of [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paris as it was and as it is, or, A sketch of the French capital'' by [[Francis William Blagdon]] p. 512 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mWwDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA512]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Savonnerie manufactory|Tapis de Savonnerie]] especially exemplify this tradition (&quot;the superb carpets of the Savonnerie, which long rivalled the carpets of Turkey, and latterly have far surpassed them&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;''The Industry of Nations'' London Exhibition of 1851 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14],&lt;/ref&gt; which was further adapted to local taste and developed with the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]] carpets. This tradition also spread to Great Britain where it revived the British carpet industry in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Sloan's Architecture - The Late Georgian Period'' by Samuel Sloan p. 114 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HGAZVw0Ji88C&amp;pg=RA4-PA114]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-François Allard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-François Allard]] became a General in the army of [[Ranjit Singh]].]]
For a brief period (1806—1815), France had an intense role in [[Indonesia]], since the Netherlands became a province of France. The islands of [[Java]] and [[Bali]] were thus in contact with a Franco-Dutch administration.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon]] handpicked a new Governor-General, the &quot;Iron Marshall&quot; [[Willem Daendels]], sent ships and troops to reinforce the East Indies against British attacks, and had military fortifications built through the length of Java.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; A treaty of alliance was signed in 1808 between the new administration and the Balinese king of [[Badung]], to provide workers and soldiers for the Franco-Dutch defensive effort, but [[Java]] fell to the British in 1811, and the agreement was not implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, pp. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Napoleonic era, some former soldiers of Napoleon left France as mercenaries in Asian countries. One of them [[Jean-François Allard]], became the leader of the European officer corps in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], in the Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]]'s  service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fGVU3YNtmJsC&amp;pg=PA43] ''Sikh art and literature'' by Kerry Brown p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Another mercenary of Ranjit Singh, [[Claude Auguste Court]] was an early student of [[Kushan]] coinage, whose coin–rubbings books are on display at the [[British Museum]].

==Colonial era==
{{French colonial campaigns}}
Through its defeat in the Napoleonic wars, France lost most of its colonial possessions, but the 19th century brought an era of [[Industrial revolution]] combined with European expansionism that saw France expand anew to form a second colonial empire in Asia.

===French Indochina===
{{main article|French Indochina}}
[[File:French soldiers in the Tonkin circa 1890.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French soldiers in the [[Tonkin]] (c. 1890)]]
In the 1820s, France tried to reestablish contacts with [[Vietnam]]. On 12 January 1825, an embassy led by Captain [[Hyacinthe de Bougainville]] attempted to obtain a meeting with emperor [[Minh Mạng]] but failed. Instead, Christian missionaries were smuggled onshore in the person of Father Regéreau of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]]. These actions triggered edicts of persecution against Christianity by Minh Mạng.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hWjx-6WM6PMC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Bougainville+Danang&amp;sig=ACfU3U3Ta5vUQoDiNHUBwvFtl-5r-yM1Eg#PPA27,M1] ''The Vietnamese Response to French Intervention, 1862—1874'' p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Using these persecutions as a pretext, in 1843, the French Foreign Minister, [[François Guizot]], sent a fleet to the East under Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Cécille]] and Captain [[Charner]], together with the diplomat [[Lagrene]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis, ''The Last Emperors'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RorGHF0fGIC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Bougainville+Danang&amp;sig=ACfU3U0DB5y6exGyUoY2foqpOWxsHHy47A] p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The move responded to the successes of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in China in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext however was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; New religious persecutions again triggered the [[Cochinchina Campaign]] (1858–1862) which marked the real beginning of territorial expansion in Vietnam.
[[File:ThailandWithFlags.gif|thumb|Expansion of French Indochina over Siam]]
Northern Vietnam was then disputed with China, leading to the [[Tonkin campaign]] (1883–1886), and to French victory in the [[Sino-French War]] (1884–1885). France also expanded westward from its Vietnamese basis to dispute territory with [[Siam]], leading to the [[Franco-Siamese War]] in 1893. [[French Indochina]] was formed in October 1887 from [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]], [[Tonkin]], [[Cochinchina]] (which together form modern [[Vietnam]]) and the [[Colonial Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] was added after the [[Franco-Siamese War]].

===China campaigns===
{{main article|Second Opium War|Boxer Rebellion}}
France intervened several times in China, together with other Western powers, to expand Western influence there. France participated actively to the [[Second Opium War]] in 1860, also using religious persecutions as a pretext. In 1900, the [[Boxer Rebellion]] led to massive French and Western intervention.

===Korea===
France also had an interventionist role in northeastern Asia throughout the second half of the 19th century.

In Korea, religious persecutions again motivated the [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|French Campaign against Korea]] in 1866. Although there were no territorial gains, these events would progressively lead to the opening of the &quot;Hermit kingdom&quot; to the rest of the world.

===Japan===

{{main article|France-Japan relations (19th century)}}
In Japan, France had a key role in fighting anti-foreign forces and supporting the [[Bakumatsu|Late Tokugawa Shogunate]]. In 1863–64, France battled anti-forces at the [[Bombardment of Shimonoseki]]. In 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867–1868)|French military mission to Japan]] was sent by [[Napoleon III]] to support the Shogun.&lt;ref&gt;''French policy in Japan during the closing years of the Tokugawa regime'' by Meron Medzini p. 125 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nevHnD10DKEC&amp;pg=PA125]&lt;/ref&gt; French soldiers such as [[Jules Brunet]] even fought on the side of the [[Shogun]] against pro-Imperial forces during the [[Boshin war]].
[[File:Lautrec reine de joie (poster) 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] [[lithograph]] poster of 1892, an example of [[Japonism]]]]
Although the Shogun was defeated in the Boshin war, France continued to take an active role in supporting Japan military through the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872-1880)|1872–1880 mission]], the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1884-1889)|1884–89 mission]], the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)|1918–19 mission]], and had a key role in the development of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] with the mission of [[Emile Bertin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w5N-c7YMrJYC&amp;pg=PA150] ''Naval warfare, 1815–1914'' Lawrence Sondhaus p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia in 19th-century French art===
{{main article|Orientalism|Japonism}}
Asia influenced Western authors, and especially French ones, in an artistic school known as [[Orientalism]]. Asian scenes were typically depicted in an idealistic and voluptuous manner. [[Impressionism]] also was strongly influenced by the vividness of Japanese painting through [[Japonism]].
French literature was also strongly influenced by Asia, as in the works of [[Pierre Loti]].

==Decolonization and modern collaboration==
[[File:HD-SN-99-02041.JPEG|thumb|upright|A [[French Foreign Legion]] unit patrols in a Communist-controlled area during the [[Indochina War]].]]
The 20th century was marked by the French difficulties during [[World War II]], and the general [[decolonization]] that followed. In particular, the [[Indochina War]] (1946–1954) marked the end of French military presence in southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MdH-Vw31d9cC&amp;pg=PA6] ''The Vietnam War'' Mitchell K. Hall p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, contacts have resumed, and France has remained a strong economic partner to Asian countries. French exports include [[nuclear power]] technologies, advanced transportation technologies such as [[Airbus]] or [[TGV]], food products, and consumer industries. Asia in turn finds in France a receptive market for its manufactured goods.
