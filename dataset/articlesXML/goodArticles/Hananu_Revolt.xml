{{Campaignbox Franco-Syrian war}}
The '''Hananu Revolt''' (also known as the '''Aleppo Revolt'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Moubayed604&quot;&gt;Moubayed 2006, p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Northern revolts''') occurred in 1920–1921 in the western countryside of [[Aleppo]] and its purpose was to drive out French military forces from northern [[Syria]]. Support for the revolt was driven by opposition to the establishment of a [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandate]] in the country. The revolt was named after its leading commander, [[Ibrahim Hananu]], and mainly consisted of four allied revolts in the areas of [[Harim Mountains|Jabal Harim]], [[Altınözü|Jabal Qusayr]], [[Jabal Zawiya]] and [[al-Haffah|Jabal Sahyun]]. The rebels were led by rural leaders and mostly engaged in guerrilla attacks against French forces or the sabotage of key infrastructure.

The Hananu Revolt coincided with the [[Alawite Revolt]] in Syria's coastal mountains led by [[Saleh al-Ali]], and both al-Ali and Hananu jointly referred to their revolts as part of the &quot;general national movement of Western Aleppo&quot;. Despite early rebel victories, guerrilla operations ceased after the French occupation of Aleppo in July 1920 and the dissolution of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Arab government]], the revolt's key backer. However, Hananu's forces renewed their revolt in November 1920 after securing large amounts of military aid from the [[Franco-Turkish War|Turkish forces]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], who were fighting the French for control of southern [[Anatolia]]. At the revolt's peak in 1920, Hananu established a quasi-state in the region between Aleppo and the Mediterranean. The rebels were dealt major blows on the battlefield in December 1920 and after agreements between the French and the Turks, Turkish military support for the rebels largely dissipated by the spring of 1921. French forces overran Hananu's last stronghold in Jabal Zawiya in July. Hananu was tried by the French Mandatory authorities and ultimately acquitted. A low-level insurgency led by rebel leader [[Yusuf al-Sa'dun]] persisted, with the last major military engagement with French forces occurring on 8 August 1926. The latter occurred amid the countrywide [[Great Syrian Revolt]], which began in the summer of 1925.

The collapse of the Hananu Revolt marked a significant turning point in Aleppo's political configurations. Whereas prior to the revolt, many in Aleppo's political elite were aligned with Turkish national politics, the betrayal that Aleppo's leaders felt at the withdrawal of Turkish support prompted most of them to embrace and pursue a shared destiny with the rest of Syria. Many were also influenced by Hananu's support for Syrian unity and strengthening ties with [[Damascus]]. In the aftermath of the [[Treaty of Ankara|Franco-Turkish accords]], Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, the major market for its goods and the supplier of its food and raw materials, was ceded to Turkey. This effectively severed commercial relations between Aleppo and Anatolia, harming the former's economy.

==Background==
In October 1918, [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]] and the [[Sharifian army]] wrested control of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. With British military support, the [[Hashemite]] leader of the Sharifian army, Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]], formed a rudimentary government in [[Damascus]] which extended its control to the northern inland Syrian cities of [[Homs]], [[Hama]] and [[Aleppo]]. Meanwhile, France claimed special interests in Syria, per the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]] made with the British, and sought to establish a [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandate]] over the region. The prospect of French rule was opposed by Syria's inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep27&quot;&gt;Neep 2012, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; French forces landed in the northern coastal city of [[Latakia]] in November 1918 and began to push inland through the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|coastal mountains]], where they faced a [[Alawite Revolt of 1919|revolt]] led by [[Saleh al-Ali]], an [[Alawite]] feudal [[sheikh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fieldhouse283&quot;&gt;Fieldhouse 2006, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and cultural sentiments in Aleppo===
[[File:CUINET(1892) 2.126 Aleppo Vilayet.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Aleppo Vilayet]], an Ottoman province of which Aleppo was the administrative capital. The province's territory was later divided between [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]]]

At the time of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's [[political elite]] was divided between those who embraced the [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist movement]] led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's [[Anatolia]]n hinterland, which was predominantly populated by [[Turkish people|Turks]]; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury103&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the political elite of Aleppo, which was considerably more ethnically and religiously diverse than the almost entirely [[Arab]] Muslim-populated Damascus, was culturally closer to Turkish-Ottoman society, and numerous members of Aleppo's elite were of [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkic]], [[Kurds in Syria|Kurdish]] and [[Circassians in Syria|Circassian]] descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury103&quot;/&gt; Because of these factors, many in Aleppo's political class did not support the 1916 [[Arab Revolt]], and those who joined it felt that the revolt negatively exceeded their expectations because it ultimately ended Ottoman rule, and thus broke the bonds of Islamic unity and initiated the separation of Aleppo from its Anatolian hinterland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury104&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also resentment in Aleppo, which under Ottoman rule had been the administrative center of the [[Aleppo Vilayet]] (Province of Aleppo) and was equal to Damascus in political stature, at the political dominance of Damascus under Faisal. While there were several Aleppines who held influential positions in Faisal's Damascus-based government, Faisal's leading political authorities in Aleppo were from Damascus or [[Iraq]]. However, French officials incorrectly believed that the rivalry between Aleppo and Damascus would make Aleppo's elite embrace French rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury104&quot;/&gt; Instead, according to historian Phillip S. Khoury, Aleppo &quot;vigorously resisted [French] occupation in order that its voice be heard in the new political climate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury104&quot;/&gt;

Several Aleppan dignitaries supported Emir Faisal and in late October 1918, following the Sharifian army's entry into Aleppo, a branch of the Arab Club was founded in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin84&quot;&gt;Gelvin 1999, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab Club's ideology was a mix of Arab nationalism and Aleppine regionalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury106&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; It promoted the concept of Syrian national unity,&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury106&quot;/&gt; and served as a political support base for Emir Faisal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin84&quot;/&gt; Among the Arab Club's founders were [[Ibrahim Hananu]], the president of Aleppo Vilayet's presidential council, Rashid al-Tali'a, governor of Aleppo Vilayet, Najib Bani Zadih, a wealthy Aleppine merchant, Abd al-Rahman al-Kayyali, an Aleppine physician and Shaykh Mas'ud al-Kawakibi, one of the city's leading Muslim scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin84&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury106&quot;/&gt;

===Prelude and early rebel actions===
[[File:Hananu, 1932.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ibrahim Hananu]], a principal leader of the revolt, 1932]]

In November 1918, soldiers from Emir Faisal's army entered [[Antakya|Antioch]] and were welcomed by the city's Arab inhabitants. In late November, French troops landed on the coast of the [[Gulf of Alexandretta]] and entered the city of [[Alexandretta]], prompting anti-French uprisings in Antioch, al-Hamammat and [[Kırıkhan|Qirqkhan]] and the [[Amik Valley|al-Amuq]] area. In December, French troops occupied Antioch and replaced the [[Flag of the Arab Revolt|Arab flag]] on its governmental headquarters with the French flag. The revolts continued in the city's countryside, namely in the vicinity of [[Harbiye, Antakya|Harbiya]] and [[Altınözü|al-Qusayr]]. The local uprisings spread from the Antioch region to Aleppo's countryside as far as the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi586-87&quot;&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, pp. 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels consisted of small, disorganized ''′iṣābāt'' (bands) and launched guerrilla-style attacks against French targets, but they also engaged in banditry and highway robberies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep109-10&quot;&gt;Neep 2012, pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; An early attempt to coordinate the various rebel groups took place when one of the leaders of the Antiochian uprising and Alawite notable, Najib al-Arsuzi, developed contacts with rebel leaders from [[Jisr al-Shughur]] and other areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi586-87&quot;/&gt;

British forces withdrew from Syria to [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in December 1919 as part of agreements with France over dividing control of the Ottomans' predominantly Arab territories&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep27&quot;/&gt; (later, in April 1920, France was given a mandate over Syria at the [[San Remo conference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arsuzi, Ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt; This left Faisal's rudimentary state vulnerable to French occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep27&quot;/&gt; The French demanded that Faisal rein in the ''′iṣābāt'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi588&quot;&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; which were not under Faisal's control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi583&quot;&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber, p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Faisal opted to support and organize the northern rebels to prevent French advances from the coastal areas to the Syrian interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi588&quot;/&gt; The Arab government entrusted two natives of northern Syria, Hananu,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi588&quot;/&gt; a former Ottoman military instructor and a municipal official,&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh175&quot;&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Subhi Barakat]], a notable from Alexandretta, with expanding and organizing the local uprisings into a full-blown revolt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi588&quot;/&gt;

Initially, Hananu logistically supported the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided to organize a rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin 1999, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Hananu was motivated to act by what he saw as the ineffectiveness of the [[Syrian National Congress]], the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fieldhouse283&quot;/&gt; He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin134&quot;&gt;Gelvin 1999, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved to put an end to Faisal's state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep27&quot;/&gt; Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep109-10&quot;/&gt;

Hananu gained the backing of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, which consisted of numerous educated professionals, wealthy merchants and Muslim religious leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury105&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee provided him with arms and funds, and helped promote his armed campaign among the city's [[ulama|Muslim scholars]] as well as put Hananu in touch with Ibrahim al-Shaghuri, head of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Arab Army]]'s Second Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin133&quot;/&gt; On orders from the Arab government in Damascus, Hananu formed an ''′iṣābā'' in Aleppo consisting of seven men from his native [[Kafr Takharim]], who he armed with hand-held bombs and rifles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sluglett588&quot;&gt;Arsuzi-Elamir, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; With al-Shaghuri's assistance, Hananu later expanded his ''′iṣābā'' to forty fighters, known as ''mujahidin'' (fighters of a holy struggle), from Kafr Takharim and organized them into four equal-sized units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin133&quot;&gt;Gelvin 1999, pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Dalal Arsuzi-Elamir, the small size of each unit made them highly mobile and &quot;able to inflict chaos on French troops&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sluglett588&quot;/&gt; Hananu used his family's farm in the regional administrative center of [[Harim]] as the headquarters of his branch of the Committee of National Defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh175&quot;/&gt;

==Revolt==

===First phase===

====Battle of Harim====
Hananu's revolt coincided with [[Franco-Turkish War|Turkish revolts against the French military]] presence in the Anatolian cities of [[Şanlıurfa|Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]] and [[Kahramanmaraş|Mar'ash]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh176&quot;&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; It also was related to Barakat's revolt in Antioch, which was captured and held by Arab guerrillas for a week starting on 13 March 1920. The French Air Force bombarded Antioch for 17 days until the rebels withdrew to [[Narlıca|Narlija]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sluglett588&quot;/&gt; On 18 April, taking advantage of the diversion of French forces to Gaziantep where a major battle between French and Turkish forces was taking place, Hananu decided to attack the French garrison at Harim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh176&quot;/&gt; With fifty of his irregulars, Hananu stormed the town. As word of his attack spread to nearby villages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh176&quot;/&gt; his forces subsequently swelled to 400.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin134&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh176&quot;/&gt;

Hananu and Rashid al-Tali'a cooperated with Barakat in an attempt to unify northern Syria's rebel groups into a single resistance movement against the French, in allegiance with Faisal's government in Damascus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philipp279&quot;&gt;Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Hananu also formed an alliance with the semi-nomadic [[Mawali]] tribesmen of the Aleppo region.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the battle at Harim, Hananu, with the assistance of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, had collected up to 2,000 gold pounds in funds, and 1,700 rifles for the 680 men in his '''iṣābā'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury105&quot;/&gt; who he and his aides trained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury106&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

====French occupation of Aleppo====
[[File:Henri Gouraud passing through Aleppo.jpg|thumb|right|French general [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]] passing through the Old City of Aleppo nearly two months after its occupation by French forces in July 1920]]

In April 1920, Hananu coordinated the shipment of Turkish arms to Saleh al-Ali's forces in their revolt against the French in the coastal mountains south of Latakia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh178&quot;&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Faisal's government aided Hananu's movement financially and logistically via local Arab nationalist intermediaries. French General [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]] demanded that Faisal rein in the rebels of northern Syria and end their resistance to the French military advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;IslamicQuarterly&quot;/&gt; Faisal continued to oppose French rule and his government launched a campaign to conscript soldiers from throughout the country in May as part of a last-ditch effort to defend Damascus against a French invasion, but the recruitment campaign was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philipp279&quot;/&gt; On 14 July, Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal to demobilize his makeshift Arab Army and recognize France's mandate over Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep27&quot;/&gt; Later in mid-July, French forces broke Hananu's resistance lines in Jisr al-Shughur, capturing the town on their way to Aleppo.&lt;ref name=&quot;IslamicQuarterly&quot;/&gt;

In late July, the French escalated their push into Syria's major inland cities. On 23 July, French troops led by General Fernand Goubeau,&lt;ref name=&quot;Allawi291&quot;&gt;Allawi 2014, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; commander of the [[Army of the Levant]]'s Fourth Division,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeidner|first1=Robert Farrer|title=The Tricolor over the Taurus: The French in Cilicia and Vicinity, 1918–1922|date=2005|publisher=Atatürk Supreme Council for Culture, Language and History|page=218|isbn=9789751617675|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiotAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22commanded+by+General+Fernand%22&amp;dq=%22commanded+by+General+Fernand%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; captured Aleppo without resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allawi291&quot;/&gt; The lack of resistance was criticized by commander al-Sa'dun in his memoirs. In the aftermath of Aleppo's occupation, he organized 750 rebels to oust the French from the city, a plan that did not materialize.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi589&quot;&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent flight of Aleppo's Arab nationalist leaders to the countryside and the French forces' military superiority managed to stymie a potential revolt in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury106&quot;/&gt; On 25 July, French forces [[Capture of Damascus (1920)|captured Damascus]] a day after routing a small Arab Army contingent and armed volunteers led by [[Yusuf al-'Azma]] at the [[Battle of Maysalun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep27&quot;/&gt; Following the loss of Aleppo and Damascus, Barakat arranged a meeting of Antiochian rebel leaders in al-Qusayr, in which the attendants were divided between those who advocated either of the following: continuing the revolt, surrendering to the French or approaching the Turks for support. After the meeting, Barakat chose to defect to the French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi589&quot;/&gt; Afterward, al-Sa'dun and his fighters continued the revolt in Barakat's former area of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, pp. 589–590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hananu meanwhile left Aleppo, which had served as his urban base, and went to the village of Baruda to regroup and continue the revolt, rallying support around his leadership from the active ''′iṣābāt'' in the western Aleppo countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi590&quot;&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt subsequently expanded to include four other ''′iṣābāt'', namely al-Sa'dun's ''′iṣābā'' (over 400 rebels) in the [[Altınözü|Jabal Qusayr]] area near Antioch, [[Umar al-Bitar]]'s ''′iṣābā'' (150 rebels) in Jabal Sahyun in the mountains around [[al-Haffah]] northeast of [[Latakia]], the ''′iṣābā'' in [[Jabal Zawiya]] (200 rebels) under commander Mustafa al-Hajj Husayn and Najib Uwaid's ''′iṣābā'' (250 fighters) around Kafr Takharim in Harim District.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi590&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Choueiri19&quot;&gt;Choueiri 1993, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sa'dun's area of operations were centered in Jabal Qusayr, but extended as far north as al-Amuq, as far south as Jisr al-Shughur, as far east as [[Darkush]] and far west as the [[Kesab]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi590&quot;/&gt;
 
An ''′iṣābā'' from [[Jableh]] led by Sheikh [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] also formed part of the revolt. The French military authorities considered al-Qassam's group, which relocated its headquarters to the Jabal Sahyun village of [[Zanqufa]] from Jableh in early 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Schleifer, ed.

===Second phase===

====Alliance with Turkish forces====
[[File:Ataturk29.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] in 1921. Hananu established an alliance with Mustafa Kemal, who supplied Hananu's forces with arms, funds and military advisers]]

With the Arab government in Damascus destroyed and Faisal exiled, Hananu's rebels sought to compensate for the consequent loss of aid from the Arab government. In the period following the Arab defeat, the rebels began appointing administrators in their territory who oversaw the institution of taxes to support the revolt, monthly salaries for the fighters and supply services for the '''iṣābā''. They also sought military training by Turkish officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philipp279&quot;/&gt;

Hananu and some of his aides traveled to Mar'ash to request support from the Anatolian insurgents and on 7 September, he signed a deal with them in which they recognized him as the representative of the Arab government of Syria and promised military aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi590&quot;/&gt; In the course of that month, Hananu began receiving significant financial and military support, and military advisers, from the remnants of the Ottoman [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|Second Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the mutual suspicion between the nationalists in Aleppo and Turkey, who were leading their respective revolts, both sides agreed that they were confronting a common French enemy. In addition, the Turkish struggle to oust French forces from Anatolia was popularly supported by Syria's inhabitants, and in northern Syria in particular, there were widespread feelings of religious solidarity with the Turks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury107&quot;/&gt; In the second week of September, Saleh al-Ali announced that he was ready to coordinate with Hananu's rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi590&quot;/&gt;

The Turkish forces in Anatolia were led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], who Hananu established contact with via intermediaries, chief of whom was [[Jamil Ibrahim Pasha]]. The latter, who was an Arabized Kurd, Ottoman World War veteran and absentee landlord from Aleppo, met Mustafa Kemal in Gaziantep in the late summer of 1920. During their meeting, an agreement was concluded to launch a propaganda campaign funded by the Turks against the French occupation. The campaign began in Aleppo in December 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury107&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an urban revolt in Aleppo did not take place in the aftermath of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury106&quot;/&gt; In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian refugees]] who had fled their villages in Turkey during the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury107&quot;/&gt; The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.

As a result of deteriorating conditions in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, while many of the city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as [[Bab al-Nairab]], violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury108&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renewal of revolt====
After the relative lull in fighting that followed the French occupation of Aleppo and Damascus, Hananu's forces resumed their guerrilla campaign in November 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury108&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Hananu's forces grew to about 5,000 irregulars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moubayed376&quot;&gt;Moubayed 2006, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months prior to the November offensive, the rebellions in the Antioch area and the Syrian coastal mountains had also resumed after temporarily tapering off in May 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury107&quot;/&gt; Armed action by Hananu's allies included an assault against the police station of [[Hamam, Kumlu|Hammam]], a village north of Harim, by 600 rebels in September. Gouraud stated in a report on 21 September that the rebels were in full control of Antakya, the road between the latter city and Aleppo and the [[Nur Mountains|Amanus Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi589&quot;/&gt; Hananu's rebels sabotaged telegraph lines and railroads, captured and disarmed French troops, and disrupted French military movements into Aleppo city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moubayed376&quot;/&gt; The repeated destruction of railroad and telegraph lines between Aleppo, Alexandretta and [[Beirut]] by Hananu and Saleh al-Ali's rebels  placed the rebels in a position to take full control of northwestern Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;/&gt;

By the end of November, the rebels gained control of the towns of Harim and Jisr al-Shughur and the villages of their districts. They then prepared for offensives to capture the towns and districts of [[Idlib]] and [[Maarrat al-Nu'man]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major scenes of fighting occurred at [[Isqat]], [[Demirköprü, Antakya|Jisr al-Hadid]], Kafr Takharim, Darkush, [[Talkalakh]] and the areas of al-Qusayr and Antioch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi590&quot;/&gt; At around the same time, Kurdish tribal forces countered the French at [[Viranşehir]], east of Aleppo, and [[Bedouin]] forces commanded by ex-Ottoman officer [[Ramadan al-Shallash]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;/&gt; who declared his support for Hananu,&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury108&quot;/&gt; began guerrilla actions against French forces in the general vicinity of [[al-Raqqah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;/&gt;

In the late winter of 1920, Hananu's rebels assaulted French forces in Idlib and according to the British consul in Aleppo, looted the town and killed some of its Christian inhabitants. Hananu's victory at Idlib and the arrival of Turkish military assistance led to a French withdrawal from Idlib.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;/&gt; Hananu's principal lieutenant commander in the Idlib operations was Tahir al-Kayyali,&lt;ref name=&quot;Philipp261&quot;&gt;Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; who also served as president of the Arab Club of Aleppo and Aleppo's Committee of National Defense.&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin 1999, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In early December, the French general of the 2nd Division in Aleppo, {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri-Félix de Lamothe|fr|3=Henri-F%C3%A9lix_de_Lamothe}}, assembled a [[column (formation)|column]] at Hammam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;/&gt; In mid-December, the French launched a counterattack on Idlib and burned down the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;/&gt; Afterward, General de Lamothe assembled a second column at Idlib.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;/&gt;

The French column from Hammam managed to capture Harim and Jisr al-Shughur from the rebels after a series of attacks and counterattacks between the two sides in late December. Hananu's rebels and Turkish irregulars launched a broad offensive to regain their positions in Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib, and according to Khoury, &quot;a reversal seemed possible&quot;, as a result of the offensive. However, a French relief column arrived in the area and the French consolidated their hold over the three major towns. The French victories in December proved to be a decisive setback for Hananu's forces, who withdrew to Jabal Zawiya, a mountainous area south of Idlib. At Jabal Zawiya, Hananu and his commanders re-organized the rebels into more numerous, smaller units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;/&gt;

In early 1921, using al-Shallash as an intermediary,&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury108&quot;/&gt; Hananu began receiving support from Emir [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], the Hashemite emir of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and Faisal's brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bidwell174&quot;&gt;Bidwell 2012, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the support from Emir Abdullah was relatively small in quantity, the French authorities feared it was part of a plot by Abdullah and his British allies to oust the French from Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury108&quot;/&gt; Hananu, meanwhile, was launching frequent hit-and-run operations against the French left flank in the area between Urfa and Antioch in an effort to support the Turks at the main battlefront in Gaziantep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;/&gt;

====Dwindling Turkish support====
Hananu continued to receive arms and funds from Anatolia in early 1921, including a shipment in March consisting of 30 machine guns and 20 horse-loads of ammunition, which came after a larger weapons shipment via [[Jarabulus]] sometime in late February–early March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh177&quot;/&gt; The Turks and the French negotiated a [[Cilicia Peace Treaty|treaty]] to end fighting in [[Cilicia]], the southern Anatolian region north of Aleppo, in March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;&gt;Neep 2012, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Hananu and Saleh al-Ali issued a joint letter to the [[League of Nations]] via the US and Spanish consuls in Aleppo in which the rebel leaders referred to themselves as commanders of the &quot;general national movement in the region of Western Aleppo&quot; and asserted that Syria sought to remain independent of France, and that the country was part of a broader Islamic community associated with the Ottoman state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh178&quot;/&gt;

Despite the treaty with France, Turkish forces in southern Anatolia continued to support Hananu's rebels with arms for a while longer to pressure the French further and gain more leverage in negotiations over territorial concessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;/&gt; At this point in the revolt, the rebels were in control of the villages of the Harim, Antioch, Jisr al-Shughur, Idlib and Maarrat al-Nu'man districts, but not the towns themselves. The French and Hananu entered into negotiations in the village of [[Kurin, Syria|Kurin]] near Idlib in April, but they faltered. By order of the French Mandate's High Commissioner, Henri Gouraud, the French reinforced their military presence in the greater Aleppo region in April, and their [[column (formation)|column]]s defeated Hananu's rebels in a number of confrontations during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fieldhouse283&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;/&gt; By April, the French had over 20,000 troops in southern Anatolia and northern Syria, with over 5,000 troops in Aleppo, 4,500 in the Idlib district, 1,000 in [[Qatma]] and 5,000 in the [[Hatay Province|Antioch region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh178&quot;/&gt; In May, French troops commanded by General Goubeau pursued Mawali and Sbaa Bedouin rebels after they launched several attacks against the highway between Homs and Hama. The Mawali surrendered after French aerial bombardments against their encampments in Qatara on 21 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baxter80&quot;&gt;Baxter 2013, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to French intelligence reports, the Turks sent political agents to northern Syria to persuade the inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt; Sometime between April and May,&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh179&quot;&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of [[al-Suqaylabiyah]], in which many of its inhabitants were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi592&quot;&gt;Arsuzi-Elamir, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philipp261&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him to carry out the raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi592&quot;/&gt; Asim's execution may have contributed to the rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh179&quot;/&gt;

The arms flow from Anatolia ended in June, either due to a direct French diplomatic request or the diversion of arms and fighters to combat the Greek offensive against the Turks in western Anatolia. In any case, the stopping of weapons shipments had a significant impact on both the military aspect of the rebellion and morale, as Hananu and the revolt's backers in Aleppo felt abandoned by the Turks, who later concluded a final peace arrangement with France, known as the [[Treaty of Ankara]], in October.&lt;ref&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; In need of funds, Hananu hired local bandits to extort money and supplies from Jabal Zawiya's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury 1987, pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; His main sources of weapons became limited to the towns of Maarrat al-Nu'man and Hama.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; With the previous blows dealt to the rebels by French forces, the waning support for the revolt by the local inhabitants and the lack of weapons, Hananu's revolt largely dissipated during the spring of 1921,&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;/&gt; although rebel operations against the French still continued at a reduced pace during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt;

===Suppression and aftermath===
[[File:Fathallah Alsakkal.jpg|thumb|right|Attorney [[Fathallah Saqqal]] defended Hananu in court in March 1922 and succeeded in having Hananu acquitted of all charges]]

Between the spring and early summer of 1921, the rebels experienced a series of defeats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt; In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bidwell174&quot;/&gt; By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi592&quot;/&gt; On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria,&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt; to avoid arrest by the French authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi592&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh180-181&quot;&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting [[Jerusalem]] and extradited him to Syria in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt;

After six months of incarceration,&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt; Hananu was subsequently put on trial on 15 March 1922,&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh180-181&quot;/&gt; with the charges against him including murder, organizing rebel bands, engaging in brigandage and the destruction of public property and infrastructure. He was defended by the Aleppine Christian attorney, [[Fathallah Saqqal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt; In court, Hananu condemned the &quot;illegal occupation of Syria&quot; and argued that military operations were done under the aegis of Mustafa Kemal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt; The trial became a rallying point of popular support for Hananu and a led to a significant degree of solidarity among Aleppo's urban elite who collectively supported Hananu's freedom. The trial concluded on 18 March, and Hananu was acquitted after the court decided that he was not a rebel, but rather a soldier who was legally mandated by the Ottoman authorities to engage in warfare against French forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh180-181&quot;/&gt; According to Khoury, the &quot;verdict would have been different ... had Hananu not become a legend in his own time&quot; and if the Franco-Turkish War had not ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt;

Although Hananu's revolt was largely suppressed, a low-level insurgency involving small ''′iṣābāt'' persisted in Aleppo's countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;/&gt; Al-Sa'dun and Uwaid opted to continue the armed struggle, fleeing to the coastal mountains and from there to Turkey in December 1921. From the frontier area with Syria, they staged hit-and-run attacks against French forces. With 100 of his fighters, al-Sa'dun entered Jabal Zawiya in the summer of 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance. On 26 August, al-Sa'dun's ''′iṣābā'' assaulted a postal convoy in al-Darakiya, a village between Darkush and Antioch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi592&quot;/&gt; In 1923, rebel commander Aqil al-Saqati and ten of his fighters launched numerous attacks against the French, including an assault against a government building in [[al-Safira]], southeast of Aleppo, and Jisr al-Hadid near Antakya.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi593&quot;/&gt;

The insurgency in northwestern Syria continued and between December 1925 and August 1926, al-Sa'dun's fighters launched several attacks against French forces and military installments. These attacks coincided with the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] that started in the south of the country and spread to central and northern Syrian cities. Among the major engagements between al-Sa'dun's '''iṣābā'' and the French was at [[Talamar|Tell Amar]] at the end of April 1926. The last major confrontation was at Jabal Qusayr on 8 August 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi592&quot;/&gt;

==Rebel organization==
The rebel groups were collectively known as ''ḥarakat al-′iṣābāt'', and each individual ''′iṣābā'' was composed of anywhere between 30 and 100 rebels known as ''mujahidin'' and were led by a ''ra'īs'' (commander), who was often a local notable or the head of a major clan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy504&quot;&gt;Méouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual ''′iṣābāt'' began forming in the countryside between Aleppo and Anatolia in 1919 to counter French advances, but Hananu gradually consolidated them into his network.&lt;ref&gt;Neep 2012, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt was ultimately organized into four principal military zones, each headed by a ''ra'īs 'iṣābā'' native to the particular zone. The four zones were the following: Jabal Qusayr (Antioch area) headed by Sheikh Yusuf al-Sa'dun (headquarters in [[Babatorun]]), [[Harim Mountains|Jabal Harim]] headed by Najib Uwaid (headquarters in Kafr Takharim), Jabal Zawiya headed by Mustafa Haj Husayn and Jabal Sahyun (al-Haffah area) headed by Umar al-Bitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy510&quot;/&gt; Hananu, the overall leader of the revolt, and the regional commanders discussed major military decisions, typically involving a particular guerrilla campaign or arms procurement, together. At times they also consulted with Ozdemir Bey, commander of Turkish irregulars fighting the French in Anatolia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy510&quot;/&gt;

At the height of the revolt, Hananu effectively created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin134&quot;/&gt; Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in [[Armanaz]], where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and weapons from local sources, and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelvin134&quot;/&gt;

Volunteers from the rural villages formed the bulk of the rebels' fighting force and during the course of the revolt, each village typically contained a 30-man reserve unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi593&quot;/&gt; However, Hananu's forces also included volunteers from Aleppo city, former Ottoman conscripts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury108&quot;/&gt; Bedouin tribesmen (including some 1,500 Mawali fighters)&lt;ref name=&quot;Baxter80&quot;/&gt; and Turkish officers who served as advisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury108&quot;/&gt; The ''′iṣābāt'' were rooted in the rural countryside, but also drew financial support from people in the cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philipp278&quot;&gt;Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; While the rebels functioned as a traditional rural Syrian autonomous movement wary of centralized authority or foreign intervention into their affairs, they also sought to establish close ties with the Arab nationalist movement and, until the Arab Army's defeat at Maysalun, with representatives of the Arab government based in the cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy510&quot;&gt;Méouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides military expertise, formal military language and style was important to rebel commanders as they sought to instill in their soldiers the &quot;spirit, self-image and shape of an army&quot;, according to historian Nadine Méouchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy512&quot;&gt;Méouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; During meetings of the rebel leadership, the ''mujahidin'' of the host leader assumed military formation by lining up along the road of the host village and saluting the visiting commanders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy512&quot;/&gt; The rebels referred to themselves as ''junūd al-thawra'' (sing. ''jundi''), meaning &quot;soldiers of revolt&quot;, which represented a more noble image than the term ''iṣābā'', which was associated with banditry, and the term ''al-askar'', which referred to the military and had negative connotations due to its association with conscription and repression. Each ''mujahid'' received a salary depending on his rank, with cavalrymen (''fursan'') or officers receiving higher pay than foot soldiers (''mushāt'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy511-512&quot;&gt;Méouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, pp. 511–512.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels had multiple sources for arms, but did not possess heavy weaponry,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy511&quot;&gt;Méouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of two artillery pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;/&gt; Sources for weapons included the Turkish forces in southern Anatolia, Bedouin tribes who either sold or smuggled [[Mauser#Rifles|Mauser rifles]] to the rebels that the Germans had distributed to the tribes during World War I, weapon stockpiles left behind by Ottoman troops fleeing Syria during the British-Arab offensive in 1918, and raids against French arms warehouses. The rebels' arsenal largely consisted of German Mauser rifles, revolvers, shotguns, and Turkish five-shooters, as well as [[sabre]]s and [[dagger]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy511&quot;/&gt; According to Khoury, the rebels also possessed twelve light machine guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;/&gt; Following the destruction of the Arab government in July 1920, the Turks became the main arms suppliers of the rebels. The rebels distinguished the Turkish armed movement in Anatolia from the Ottomans, who the rebels viewed negatively, by stressing the role of Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, who was viewed as the quintessential guerrilla leader in the struggle against French occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy504&quot;/&gt;

==Tactics==

===Rebels===
The chief operational goals of the ''′iṣābāt'' were to inflict as much damage as they could on French forces and make clear their &quot;determination to resist&quot;, according to Arsuzi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi594&quot;/&gt; The rebels utilized the familiar, mountainous terrain where they operated against the French forces, and typically launched guerrilla operations at night to avoid detection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury109&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi594&quot;/&gt; However, at times when the rebels could not avoid direct confrontation with French forces, they maintained fighting order similar to a regular army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi594&quot;/&gt;

===French forces===
Militarily, the French utilized large column formations against the rebels, a tactic which the French chief-of-staff of the Army of the Levant, General [[André-Gaston Prételat]], found to be generally ineffective against small mobile rebel units. Instead, he believed the optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels: knowledge of the terrain and high mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;/&gt; However, the Syrian [[gendarmerie]] conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels because they were too small numerically, and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi589&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;/&gt;

The French were more successful in persuading large landowners to cease support for the rebels and recruit local militias to protect highways from rebel attacks. The French also ultimately understood that in order to quell the revolt in Syria they needed to offer concessions in Anatolia and establish cooperation with the Turks, whose financial, military and moral support was critical to the rebels. When truces were reached with the Turks, the French redeployed large numbers of troops from the Anatolian front to suppress the rebels in Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi589&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, pp. 591–592.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations for revolt==
[[File:Umar al-Bitar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Umar al-Bitar]] was the rebel commander of Jabal Sahyun, one of the four rebel military zones of the revolt]]

Hananu's subordinate officers and rank-and-file fighters were all [[Sunni Muslim]]s, but were ethnically heterogeneous. Hananu himself was a Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar, while Umar al-Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha'ban Agha was a Turk. The ''′isabat'' led by al-Bitar and al-Qassam were dominated by Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp and Schumann 2004, pp. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt; The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels' sense of defending their homeland and community. Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to the revolt in the plural as ''thawrat al-Shimal'' (Northern revolts) rather than the singular ''thawra'', and referred to the leadership of the revolt as the plural ''quwwad al-thawra'' rather than ''qiyadat al-thawra'', which refers to a central command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy514&quot;/&gt;

The rebels of the Hananu Revolt were motivated by three principal factors: defense of the homeland, which the rebels referred to as ''al-bilad'' or ''al-watan'', defense of Islam in the face of conquest by an infidel enemy referred to as ''al-aduw al-kafir'', in this case the French, and the defense of the rebels' traditional and sedentary way of life and the prevailing social order from foreign interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy514&quot;&gt;Méouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early phase of the revolt, Hananu and Barakat acted as representatives of Faisal's Arab government and continued to claim that they had the support of Faisal after the latter was ousted from Syria in July 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi594&quot;&gt;Arsuzi-Elamir, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the collapse of the state they were ostensibly fighting under, the rebels resumed their struggle. In his memoirs, al-Sa'dun stated that the rebels engaged in ''jihad'' as an individual responsibility, instead of a duty delegated to them by a state. In his view, the individual rebel was required to behave virtuously in his personal life and with expertise and courage on the battlefield. Moreover, he had to strive to be a popular hero (''batal sha'bi'') close to his people, brave and pious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meouchy514&quot;/&gt; Arsuzi-Elamir asserts that while religious terminology was used by the rebels, the rebels' &quot;motivation was fundamentally nationalist&quot; and that &quot;religion does not seem to have played a more important role&quot; than nationalist feeling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arsuzi594&quot;/&gt; Moreover, the Islamic solidarity between the Turks and the Syrians did not prevent the withdrawal of Turkish support for the revolt in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Keith David Watenpaugh]], the language used by Hananu and Saleh al-Ali in their address to the League of Nations &quot;undermine&quot; Arab and Turkish nationalist claims that their revolts represented part of the Arab or Turkish national awakenings. Hananu and al-Ali both referred to their revolts as part of a unified national resistance movement, but Watenpaugh states that the nation referred to was an Islamic community rather than the ethnic nationalism that steadily dominated Syrian and Turkish politics and society in the 20th century. Hananu and al-Ali also stressed modernist principles about individual rights, and according to Watenpaugh, Hananu did not view the concepts of modernity, Islam and the Ottoman state to be mutually exclusive. Hananu had opposed many Ottoman policies in the pre-World War I period, but was nonetheless wary of separatism as someone who formed part of the educated Ottoman middle class, while al-Ali sought a return to a &quot;decentralized Ottoman polity dominated by Muslims in which the state would protect his hegemony as a landowning rural chieftain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh179&quot;&gt;Watenpaugh 2014, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Hananu and the rebel commanders had a deep attachment to their place in society and viewed French rule as an assault on their status, ambitions and dignity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watenpaugh179&quot;/&gt;

As a result of the Hananu and Alawite revolts, the French authorities discovered pacifying northern Syria was a more difficult task than pacification of the Damascus region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury111&quot;/&gt; Following the collapse of the Hananu Revolt, some political leaders in Aleppo continued to hope that the Turks would oust the French from northern Syria and unify Aleppo with its Anatolian hinterland,&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury111&quot;/&gt; but the withdrawal of Turkish support for the rebels in Syria, following agreements with France, caused a deterioration in Syrian-Turkish ties and left the rebels and nationalists of northern Syria feeling betrayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury111&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Disillusionment with Mustafa Kemal's policies regarding Syria made Turkey's remaining Syrian supporters realign their positions closer to Aleppo's Arab nationalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury112&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In the few years after the revolt, Aleppo's elite largely embraced the concept of a united Syrian struggle for independence from French rule. This shift also began a process of strengthening ties with the leaders of Damascus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury112&quot;/&gt;

Hananu's leadership of the revolt gained him wide popularity in Syria. Referring to Hananu, Khoury wrote &quot;No name was more familiar to children growing up in Syria in the twenties and thirties; stories of his heroics were standard bedtime fare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] historiography, Hananu became a hero of the Syrian Arab nationalist movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neep110&quot;/&gt; The Hananu Revolt was a turning point in Aleppo's relationship with the Arab nationalist movement. Under the influence of Hananu, his Arab Club, and other Aleppine leaders with similar politics, the Muslim elite of Aleppo gradually embraced Arab nationalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury106&quot;/&gt; Hananu later became a founding member of the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] in 1928, which according to Syrian historian [[Sami Moubayed]], was &quot;created out of the defeat of the armed revolts of the 1920s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moubayed376&quot;&gt;Moubayed 2006, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Bloc advocated diplomatic means to combat French rule and was the principal opposition movement against the French authorities until Syria's independence in 1946. Hananu served as the ''za'im'' (chief) of the movement until his death in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moubayed376&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moubayed 2006, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Syrian nationalists.jpg|thumb|right|Nationalist leaders in Syria in the late 1920s. Hananu is seated first from the right at the top row, while [[Saleh al-Ali]] who led the [[Alawite Revolt of 1919|Alawite Revolt]] is seated first from right at the bottom row]]

In September 1920, Gouraud established the [[State of Aleppo]], which consisted of the northern half of former Ottoman Syria, excluding the [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] district. The French authorities established a new bureaucratic administration in Aleppo led by four local, pro-French sympathizers and mostly staffed by their family members. After the revolt was stamped out, the French authorities arrested or exiled numerous Arab nationalist politicians in an attempt to end the nationalist alliance between Aleppo and Damascus. The authorities also began appointing former Ottoman administrators who were willing to cooperate with them to senior bureaucratic posts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury112&quot;/&gt; According to Khoury, &quot;by 1922, the Aleppo bureaucracy had become more unwieldy and inefficient than it had been in the last years&quot; of Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury114&quot;&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite French attempts to completely exclude the nationalists from any administrative role, the overwhelming majority of Aleppo's population supported the nationalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury114&quot;/&gt;

As a result of the Franco-Syrian War, Turkey annexed the southwestern Anatolian [[sanjak]]s (districts) that had been part of Aleppo Vilayet, such as Mar'ash, Gaziantep ('Ayntab), [[Rumkale]] (Qal'at Rum), Urfa (al-Ruha). These sanjaks became part of Turkey following the October 1921 treaty with France. Aleppans opposed the Turkish annexation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khoury110&quot;/&gt; The Franco-Turkish treaty allowed for a resumption of commerce between Aleppo and the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta|Alexandretta Sanjak]], including Antioch, due to improved security conditions, but commerce between Aleppo and Anatolia largely ceased. Alexandretta was considered by Aleppans to be their port to the Mediterranean Sea and a crucial part of their socio-economic region. It remained part of Syria under French control, but was administered by a semi-autonomous government that was heavily influenced by Turkey. Aleppo's merchants and nationalist politicians feared this autonomy would ultimately lead to its annexation by Turkey and consequently precipitate an economic crisis in Aleppo;&lt;ref&gt;Khoury 1987, pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexnadretta was separated from Syria in 1938 and became part of Turkey in the following year.
