==Baden to Bismarck?==
&quot;That the basic design of the Bayern class was carried over into the Bismarck class twenty years later is just a legend. The only similarity between the Bayern and Bismarck class is the arrangement of the main artillery in 4 turrets with 2 barrels.&quot;

There is another opinion about the similarity of those ships: http://www.avalanchepress.com/Baden.php &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:88.114.153.102|88.114.153.102]] ([[User talk:88.114.153.102|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/88.114.153.102|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:This comment relates to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bayern_class_battleship&amp;oldid=106828087 2007 version] which contained the quote.  The quote was uncited and has since been removed.  Other sources in addition to the avalanche press article also trace the Bismarcks' design to Baden.

== Ship years ==

Why is it [[SMS Baden (1915)]] if it was launched in 1916 and completed in 1917? Likewise [[SMS Württemberg (1915)]] is a redlink, but [[SMS Württemberg (1918)]] redirects to the ship class article. There might be other oddities, but these are the ones that struck me.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps; whitespace:nowrap;&quot;&gt;[[User:Headbomb|Headbomb]] {[[User talk:Headbomb|talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/Headbomb|contribs]] / [[WP:PHYS|physics]] / [[WP:WBOOKS|books]]}&lt;/span&gt; 15:56, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:''Baden'' was launched on 30 October 1915. As for ''Württemberg'', the ship was launched in 1917; if you look where the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SMS_W%C3%BCrttemberg_%281917%29&amp;action=history used to be], you'll see the 1918 dab was a mistake from the original creator in 2006 that was subsequently fixed. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 16:16, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::Someone had put 1916 as the year of launch for ''Baden'' in the lead of its article.  Now rectified. --[[User:Simon Harley|Simon Harley]] ([[User talk:Simon Harley|Talk]] | [[User:Simon Harley/Library|Library]]). 16:48, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
::::I'd wager it was a typo on my part :) [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 16:57, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:::If [[SMS Württemberg (1918)]] is a mistake, then [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/SMS_W%C3%BCrttemberg_%281918%29] should be updated and [[SMS Württemberg (1918)]] sent to {{tl|db-r3}}.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps; whitespace:nowrap;&quot;&gt;[[User:Headbomb|Headbomb]] {[[User talk:Headbomb|talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/Headbomb|contribs]] / [[WP:PHYS|physics]] / [[WP:WBOOKS|books]]}&lt;/span&gt; 16:54, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

== Notes on metacentric height  ==

Needs a more balanced approach; the article seems to suggest that a high MH is an unreserved advantage, when it is one of many design compromises. Highly stable designs, though resistant to list, are more affected by wave action and consequently tend relatively poorer gun platforms &amp; seaboats, described as &quot;unsteady.&quot; Which quality (steady vs stable) a nation chooses prioritise tends to represent it's expectations of the ships service life &amp; the nature of likely combat. 
Obviously ship design does not exist in such mutatis mutandis terms, plain &quot;better&quot; design occurs, achieving high stability while still producing good gunnery ships.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/194.75.48.5|194.75.48.5]] ([[User talk:194.75.48.5|talk]]) 15:42, 30 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:I merely reported what the sources say; Gröner, for example, says &quot;very good, stable sea-boats.&quot; I don't have Lyon in front of me, but what I wrote is a fair representation of what he said. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 15:52, 30 March 2011 (UTC)

== 38 cm L/45 gun ==

Bayern class used 38 cm L/45 guns. The link  {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[Langer Max|SK L/45]] (4 × 2) refers to the railway gun, which was developed from the naval gun. There seems to be no article on the naval version. The railway version is two hops from Bayern class ships (Bayern -&gt; 38 cm naval gun -&gt; 38 cm raiway gun). Should there be a short article on on naval gun, which would be linked to its railway modification?

:The guns themselves are identical, the only real difference is the mounting. The article in question should really be moved to [[38 cm SK L/45 gun]] and cover both the naval and land usage - there's no real reason to have two separate articles.
