'''Robert Rathbun Wilson''' (March 4, 1914 – January 16, 2000) was an American [[physicist]] known for his work on the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]], as a [[sculpture|sculptor]], and as an architect of the [[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]] (Fermilab), where he was the first director from 1967 to 1978.

A graduate of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (BA and PhD), Wilson received his doctorate under the supervision of [[Ernest Lawrence]]  for his work on the development of the [[cyclotron]] at the Berkeley [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]]. He subsequently went to [[Princeton University]] to work with [[Henry DeWolf Smyth]] on [[electromagnetic separation]] of the [[isotopes of uranium]]. In 1943, Wilson and many of his colleagues joined the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where Wilson became the head of its Cyclotron Group (R-1), and later its Research (R) Division.

After the war, Wilson briefly joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]] as an associate professor, then went to [[Cornell University]] as professor of physics and the director of its new Laboratory of Nuclear Studies. Wilson and his Cornell colleagues constructed four electron [[synchrotron]]s. In 1967 he assumed directorship of the National Accelerator Laboratory, subsequently known as the [[Fermilab]]. He managed to complete the facility on time and under budget, but at the same time made it aesthetically pleasing,  with a main administrative building purposely reminiscent of the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], and a restored prairie with a herd of [[American Bison]]. He resigned in 1978 in a protest against inadequate government funding.

== Early life ==
Robert Rathbun Wilson was born in [[Frontier, Wyoming]], in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McDaniel, Boyce|authorlink=Boyce McDaniel|author2=Silverman, Albert|title=Obituary: Robert Rathbun Wilson|journal=Physics Today|date=April 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=82–83|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/53/4/10.1063/1.883056|doi=10.1063/1.883056|bibcode = 2000PhT....53d..82M }}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Platt Elvin and Edith Elizabeth (Rathbun) Wilson. He had an older sister, Mary Jane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=DESC&amp;db=dowfam3&amp;id=I375691 |publisher=Ancestry.com |title=Dowling Family Genealogy |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents separated when he was eight years old,{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=4}} and custody was awarded to his father, although he lived with his mother from time to time.&lt;ref name=&quot;oral&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4972.html  |accessdate=February 15, 2013  |title=Oral History Transcript — Dr. Robert R. Wilson |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his early life was spent on cattle ranches. He changed schools frequently, and attended a number of schools, including the [[Todd Seminary for Boys|Todd School]] in [[Woodstock, Illinois]],{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=4}} where his grandmother worked.&lt;ref name=&quot;oral&quot; /&gt;

Wilson entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1932, and was awarded his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (AB) degree ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1936.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=4}} He joined [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]'s [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]], which was at that time blossoming into the top American site for both [[experimental physics|experimental]] and [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] [[physics]] due to the efforts of Lawrence and [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], respectively.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=11-15}} Wilson received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in 1940 for his thesis on &quot;Theory of the Cyclotron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/theory-of-the-cyclotron/oclc/29834068 |type=PhD|title=Theory of the Cyclotron |date=May 1940 |last=Wilson |first=Robert R. |publisher=-University of California }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year he married Jane Inez Scheyer.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=5}}

Wilson ran into trouble with Lawrence's harsh frugality while working on his [[cyclotron]] and was fired twice from the Radiation Laboratory. The first time was for losing a rubber seal in the 37-inch cyclotron which prevented its use in a demonstration to a potential donor. He was later rehired at [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]]'s urging, but melted an expensive pair of pliers while welding, and was fired again. Though offered his job back, he decided instead to go to [[Princeton University]] to work with [[Henry DeWolf Smyth]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=47-48}}&lt;ref name=&quot;oral&quot; /&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
At Princeton, Wilson eventually took over Smyth's project the development of an alternative approach to [[electromagnetic separation]] from Lawrence's [[calutron]] method, used for the purpose of separating the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] [[isotope]] of [[uranium]] from the much more common [[uranium-238]], which is a key step to producing an [[atomic bomb]]. By 1941 the project had produced a device called the &quot;isotron,&quot; which, unlike the calutron, used an electrical field to separate the uranium instead of a magnetic one.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=47-48}}

[[File:Robert Wilson ID badge.png|thumb|left|Robert R. Wilson's ID badge photo from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]]]
The work at Princeton was terminated during [[World War II]] when Oppenheimer's secret laboratory for research on the [[atomic bomb]], the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], opened in 1943. &quot;Like a bunch of professional soldiers,&quot; Wilson later recalled, &quot;we signed up, en masse, to go to Los Alamos.&quot;{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=59}}

Wilson moved there with some of his Princeton staff and [[Harvard University]]'s cyclotron, and was appointed as head of the Cyclotron Group (R-1) by Oppenheimer. Only in his late twenties, he was the youngest group leader in the experimental division.&lt;ref name=&quot;reluctant&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/p/hist_wilson.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219041105/http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/p/hist_wilson.shtml |archivedate=February 19, 2005 |title=A Reluctant Division Leader |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] |accessdate=February 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=5}} The cyclotron would be used for measurements of the [[neutron cross section]] of [[plutonium]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=78-79}}

When Oppenheimer reorganized the laboratory in August 1944 to focus on the development of an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]], Wilson became head of R (Research) Division.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=78-79}} As such he had four groups reporting to him: the Cyclotron Group (R-1), still headed by himself; the Electrostatic Group (R-2), headed by John H. Williams; the D-D ([[Deuterium]]-Deuterium) Group (R-3), headed by [[John Henry Manley|John H. Manley]]; and the Radioactivity Group (R-4), headed by [[Emilio G. Segrè]]. In March 1945, R Division acquired the additional responsibility of developing instrumentation for the [[Trinity nuclear test]] in July 1945. Wilson helped stack boxes of explosives for the [[Trinity nuclear test#Test preparation|100-ton test]] that preceded it.&lt;ref name=&quot;reluctant&quot; /&gt; At Los Alamos, he was also active in community affairs, serving on the town council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919143155/http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/00/1.20.00/Wilson_obit.html |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/00/1.20.00/Wilson_obit.html |newspaper=[[Cornell Chronicle]] |title=Robert R.

[[File:Trinity Test - 100 Ton Test - High Explosive Stack 002.jpg|thumb|right|Men stack crates of high explosives for the 100 ton test]]
In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and the initial motivation for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as it was discovered that the [[German nuclear energy project]] was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie Groves]], director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary ''[[The Day After Trinity]]'' (1980), Wilson would say that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | year = 1980 | title = [[The Day After Trinity]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], Wilson helped organize the [[Association of Los Alamos Scientists]] (ALAS), which called, with a scientists' petition, for the [[international control of atomic energy]].{{sfn|Hunner|2004|pp=112-115}} The petition was carried by Oppenheimer to [[Washington, D.C.]], eventually making its way via Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] to President [[Harry S. Truman]].{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=324-325}}

== Post-World War II ==

After the war, Wilson also helped form the [[Federation of American Scientists]] and served as its chairman in 1946. He accepted an appointment as an associate professor at Harvard, but spent the first eight months of 1946 at Berkeley designing a new 150 MeV cyclotron for Harvard to replace the one taken to Los Alamos.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=5}} At Harvard, Wilson published a seminal paper, &quot;Radiological Use of Fast Protons&quot;, which founded the field of [[proton therapy]].&lt;ref name=Robert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proton-therapy.org/pr10.htm |title=Robert R. Wilson: Remembered as &quot;Father of Proton Therapy&quot; |publisher=The National Association for Proton Therapy |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal |title=Radiological Use of Fast Protons |journal=Radiology |date=November 1946 |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=487–491 |doi=10.1148/47.5.487 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cornell ===

In 1947 Wilson went to [[Cornell University]] as professor of physics and the director of its new [[Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education|Laboratory of Nuclear Studies]]. At Cornell, Wilson and his colleagues constructed four electron [[synchrotron]]s. The first, a 300 MeV synchrotron, was under construction when he arrived.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=5}} In a 1948 report to the [[Office of Naval Research]], he described their purpose:{{quote|The most important problems of nuclear physics, to our minds are: What are the elementary particles of which nuclei are made and what is the nature of the forces that hold these particles together? A more general but connected problem concerns the general expression of electrical laws at such high energies as will be produced by our synchrotron. Our experiments are planned to attack all three problems. Thus we hope to produce artificial [[mesons]] which are supposedly elementary particles and to study the interactions of these mesons with nuclei. Further, we shall explore the electrical interactions of high energy electrons with electrons and protons in search of evidence pointing to a correct theory of electricity at high energy.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=5}} }}

Wilson initiated the construction of a 1.4 GeV synchrotron in 1952. As he had foreseen in 1948, it produced artificial [[K meson]]s and [[rho meson]]s, and tested [[quantum electrodynamics]] at short distances. The last machine he built at Cornell was a 12 GeV synchrotron that remains in use as an injector for the [[Cornell Electron Storage Ring]] (CESR), built between 1977 and 1999.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |pp=7-8}} It is located in what is now known as the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/public/lab-info/wilson.html |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |title=Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory |accessdate=February 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was one of the first physicists to use [[Monte Carlo method]]s, which he used to model electron and proton initiated [[particle shower]]s. He invented the [[quantometer]] so that he could measure the intensity of high-energy X-ray beams.&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot; /&gt;

=== Fermilab ===
[[File:Fermilab WilsonHall.JPG|thumb|right|Wilson had a direct role in the aesthetic design of [[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Shown here is Robert Rathbun Wilson Hall.]]
In 1967 he took a leave of absence from Cornell to assume directorship of the nascent National Accelerator Laboratory at Batavia, Illinois, which was to be largest particle accelerator constructed to date. In 1969, Wilson was called to justify the multimillion-dollar machine to the Congressional [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]]. Bucking the trend of the day, Wilson emphasized it had nothing at all to do with national security, rather:
{{quote|It only has to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of men, our love of culture... It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things that we really venerate and honor in our country and are patriotic about. In that sense, this new knowledge has all to do with honor and country but it has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to help make it worth defending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.fnal.gov/testimony.html |title=R.R. Wilson's Congressional Testimony, April 1969|publisher=Fermilab History and Archives Project |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thanks to Wilson's talented leadership, a management style very much adopted from Lawrence, the facility was completed on time and under budget. According to Wilson, he gave [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] chairman [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] his assurance &quot;signed in blood&quot; that he would not exceed the authorized $250 million budget and &quot;would rot in Hell&quot; if he did.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starting Fermilab&quot; /&gt; The facility centered on a four-mile circumference, 400 GeV accelerator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starting Fermilab&quot; /&gt; Wilson subsequently initiated the design of the [[Tevatron]], a 1 TeV  [[particle accelerator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot; /&gt; The National Accelerator Laboratory, was renamed the [[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]] in 1974, after [[Enrico Fermi]]. It is frequently referred to as &quot;Fermilab&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.fnal.gov/dedication.html |title=NAL Dedication |publisher=[[Fermilab]] |accessdate=February 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bizony przed plotem.jpg|thumb|left|Bison graze on the prairie close to Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]
Wilson had studied sculpture at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] in Italy while on sabbatical in 1961,&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot; /&gt; and he wanted Fermilab to be an appealing place to work, believing that external harmony would encourage internal harmony as well, and labored personally to keep it from looking like a stereotypical &quot;government lab&quot;, playing a key role in its design and architecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starting Fermilab&quot; /&gt; Surrounding the facility was a restored prairie which served as a home to a herd of [[American Bison]] that started with Wilson bringing in a bull and four cows in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/announcements/prairie.html |title=Fermilab Bison and Prairie Info |publisher=[[Fermilab]] |accessdate=February 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also had ponds, and a main building purposely reminiscent of the [[Beauvais Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Starting Fermilab&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.fnal.gov/GoldenBooks/gb_wilson2.html |title=Starting Fermilab |first=Robert |last=Wilson |publisher=[[Fermilab]] |accessdate=February 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab also celebrates his role as a sculptor, featuring several of his works, including &quot;The Mobius Strip&quot;, &quot;The Hyperbolic Obelisk&quot;, &quot;Tractricious&quot;, and &quot;Broken Symmetry&quot;. Another metal sculpture &quot;Topological III&quot; sits in the lobby of the [[Harvard Science Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= Science News |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/m%C3%B6bius-fermilab |title=Möbius at Fermilab |first=Ivars |last=Peterson |date=March 17, 2003  |accessdate=February 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab's Central Laboratory building was named Robert Rathbun Wilson Hall in his honor in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.fnal.gov/highrise.html |title=Robert Rathbun Wilson Hall  |publisher=[[Fermilab]] |accessdate=February 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson served as the director of Fermilab until 1978, when he resigned in protest against what he considered was inadequate funding by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib-docs.web.cern.ch/lib-docs/Archives/biographies/Wilson_RR.pdf |title=Resignation of Bob Wilson |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=February 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] as Ritzma Professor at the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]]. He became Emeritus Professor of Physics at Chicago in 1980. He moved to [[Columbia University]], where he became I. I. Rabi Visiting Professor of Science and Human Relations in 1979, [[Michael I. Pupin]] Professor of Physics in 1980, and Emeritus Professor in 1982. He retired in 1983 and moved back to Ithaca, NY.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=5}}

== Awards and honors ==
Wilson received many awards and honors, including the [[Elliott Cresson Medal]] from the [[Franklin Institute]] in 1964, the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1973, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]'s [[Enrico Fermi Award]] in 1984. He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]], and was president of the [[American Physical Society]] in 1985.{{sfn|McDaniel|Silverman|2001 |p=14}}

== Death ==
Wilson suffered a [[stroke]] in 1999, from which he never recovered. He died on January 16, 2000, at the age of 85, at a nursing home in [[Ithaca, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/wilson.html |title= Robert R.
