An '''emergency tow vessel''', also called '''emergency towing vessel''', (ETV) is a multi purpose boat used by state authorities to tow disabled vessels on high seas in order to prevent dangers to man and environment. The disabled vessel is either towed to a safe haven or kept in place against wind and current until commercial assistance by [[tug boat]]s has arrived on site or until it has been repaired to the extent of being able to manoeuvre on its own. The need for ETVs as a preventive measure has arisen since the number of available commercial [[salvage tug]]s was reduced while potential dangers from individual vessels have increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/tugs,-towing-and-salvage/and_more_etvs_to_come |title=And More ETVs to Come |work=Maritime Journal | date=1 March 2005 |quote=The provision of Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs) is becoming a serious issue for many governments and coastal states and is increasingly seen as a tangible preventative measure capable of dealing with a wide range of potential maritime incidents.}}&lt;/ref&gt; E.g. [[Spain]] has fourteen, [[Turkey]] has eleven, [[Germany]] operates eight, [[Norway]] has seven, [[France]] has five, [[Sweden]] three and the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[South Africa]], [[Iceland]] and [[Finland]] each have one official emergency tug boat. Australia also operates emergency response vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.deu.edu.tr/maritime/imla2008/Papers/18.pdf |title=Government support for sustainability of marine salvage services: a case for Turkey |first=Oğuz |last=Atik |author2=A Güldem Cerit |work=International Maritime Lecturers Association 16th Conference on Mhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-15131307ET |date=14–17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]]'s four strong ETV fleet was to be disbanded in September 2011 due to budget cuts but the two vessels operating in Scottish waters received an extension of contract until the end of 2011.&lt;ref name=MJnoreprieve&gt;{{cite web|title=No reprieve for UK Emergency Towing Vessels |work=Maritime Journal |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=5 November 2011 |url=http://www.maritimejournal.com/features101/tugs,-towing,-pollution-and-salvage/tugs,-towing-and-salvage/no-reprieve-for-uk-emergency-towing-vessels}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ETVScotland&gt;{{cite web|title=Three-month extension' for Scotland's coastguard tugs |work=[[BBC News]] |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=5 November 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-15131307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External requirements==
Distressed vessels that request the service of towing vessels have means to make towing as safe as possible. Oil tankers have emergency towing equipment fixed at the forward and aft part of the vessel that will allow to connect the towing line. The connection of these apparatuses to the vessel's hull is reinforced according with class requirements. [[Bulk carrier]]s and general cargo vessels are not required to have a specialized emergency towing arrangement. Depending on the vessel's type and keel laid date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Towing Procedures Implementation dates|url=http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/Emergency_Towing_procedures%20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the MSC256(84) standard they must have on board an emergency towing procedure manual. This ship-specific manual describes procedures that will allow the vessel to be towed using its own equipment. The procedure should make use of the standard mooring equipment like mooring ropes, bits, rollers and Panama chock.

==National ETV fleets==

===Algeria===
In 2010 Algeria has ordered three tug boats of the ''Bourbon'' class which is already in use in the French harbours of [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Cherbourg]]. The ships have been built by [[STX Europe|STX OSV]] in Norway and STX Tulcea in Romania. A first vessel ''El Moundjid'' was ready for delivery in December 2011, the two others are scheduled for delivery in June and September 2012.

With a [[bollard pull]] of 200 tons and a speed of {{convert|20|kn|0|kph}}, the Algerian ETVs are an improved version of the French ''Bourbon'' class. They will be based in [[Oran]] and [[Skikda]]. By acquiring these three ships, Algeria has become the leading Mediterranean nation in terms of marine salvage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meretmarine.com/article.cfm?id=118280 |title=L'Algérie se paye trois sisterships de l'Abeille Bourbon |language=French |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2012 |work=Mer et Marine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
The Ministry of the Environment operates the ''[[Finnish pollution control vessel Louhi|Louhi]]''. The ship is listed as a  multi-purpose oil recovery vessel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamor.com/2011/04/finland%E2%80%99s-newest-oil-spill-response-vessel/ Louhi oil recovery ship]-Retrieved 09-20-15&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used for emergency towing, fire-fighting, icebreaking, mine-laying, to combat oil/chemical spills, as well as other rescue operations. The vessel has a bollard pull of 60 t.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itameriportaali.fi/en/ajankohtaista/itameri-tiedotteet/2011/en_GB/torjunta-alus/ |title=New oil and chemical spill response vessel was given the name Louhi |publisher=The Baltic Sea portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; YAG ''Louhi'' is based at the Port of [[Upinniemi]] approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Helsinki]] in the [[Archipelago Sea]].

===France===
[[Image:Abeille Bourbon - Brest 2008-2.jpg|thumb|French ETV ''Abeille Bourbon'' in Brest]]
For assistance and salvage, 5 ocean-going tugs and their crews are ready to respond around-the-clock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bourbon-offshore.com/en/marine-services/coastline-protection/assistance-and-salvage |title=Assistance and Salvage |publisher=Bourbon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Abeille Bourbon]]'': based in [[Brest, France|Brest]], bollard pull of 200 tons.
*''[[Abeille Liberté]]'': based in [[Cherbourg]], bollard pull of 200 tons.
*''[[Abeille Flandre]]'': based in [[Toulon]], bollard pull of 160 tons.
*''Abeille Languedoc'': based in [[La Rochelle]], bollard pull of 160 tons.
*''Jason'': based in [[Toulon]], bollard pull of 124.2 tons.
The tugs are chartered by the French government and manned by a crew of [[merchant marine]] seamen. France also shares funding of the [[Dover]] based British ETV.

===Germany===
[[File:Mehrzweckschiff Arkona Warnemuende 1.jpg|thumb|German multi-purpose vessel ''Arkona'']]
The German concept of emergency towing prescribes a maximum response time of two hours for any incident in German coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsv.de/hk/aktuelles/expertenkonferenz/Vortraege/Expertenkonferenz04_Peter_Koehler.pdf |first=Peter |last=Köhler |title=Emergency Towing: German strategy |page=3 |publisher=Havariekommando (German Central Command for Maritime Emergencies)|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires three ETVs in the North Sea and five in the [[Baltic Sea]] despite a considerably smaller area to cover there. Equipment and performance of the vessels have been adapted to the size of the vessels in the respective areas of operation and include the ability to operate in shallow waters. Moreover, it is mandatory to have one vessel with 200 t of [[bollard pull]] and 100 t each in the North Sea and Baltic respectively. Both ship types are also required to be able to operate under hazardous conditions such as explosive areas and gas leaks.

Four out of the eight German ETVs are multi purpose vessels owned by the Federal Water and Shipping Administration while another four have been chartered from tug companies. Since 2001 a cooperation agreement with the Netherlands comprises the Dutch ETV and the German ''Nordic'' (successor to ETV ''Oceanic'').

As of 2010, four ETVs, ''Anglian Prince'', ''Anglian Princess'', ''[[Anglian Sovereign]]'' and ''Anglian Monarch'', were based in strategic locations around the UK, with two covering the [[south coast of England]], at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in [[Cornwall]] and [[Dover]] in [[Kent]], and two in Scottish waters, at [[Stornoway]] the [[Western Isles]] (the Outer Hebrides), and [[Lerwick]] in the [[Northern Isles]] (Shetland and Orkney).&lt;ref name=BBCNews22Oct2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=MaritimeJournal15March2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimejournal.com/features/tugs,-towing,-pollution-and-salvage/tugs,-towing-and-salvage/lowestoft-tug-fleet-changes-livery-and-title-by-jack-gaston |title=Lowestoft tug fleet changes livery and title|first=Jack |last=Gaston |work=Maritime Journal |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tfkALFow |archivedate=22 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four strong ETV fleet was intended to be operational 24 hours a day 365 days a year and maintained at 30 minutes readiness to sail, with one tug is allocated to each of the four operating areas on a rotational basis, worked around maintenance schedules.&lt;ref name=MaritimeJournal01Dec2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCNews20Oct2010/&gt; The Dover station was funded jointly with French maritime authorities.&lt;ref name=MaritimeJournal01Dec2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=MaritimeJournal15March2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=DoverLifeboatMonarch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dover-lifeboat.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=40:general&amp;id=139:anglian-monarch |title=Anglian Monarch |work=Dover Lifeboat}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth tug, the ''Anglian Earl'', was an anchorhandling and salvage tug regularly used on commercial work, but also fitted the ETV criteria, and acted as cover for any of the four ETV stations as and when required.&lt;ref name=MaritimeJournal15March2010/&gt;

In 2010, the Government announced as part of the [[Department for Transport]]'s share of cuts in the [[Spending Review#2010 Comprehensive Spending Review|Comprehensive Spending Review]], that the ETV fleet would be no longer be funded by the MCA from September 2011, saving £32.5m over the Spending Review period.
