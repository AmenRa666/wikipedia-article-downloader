'''Minefields in Croatia''' cover {{convert|480.77|km2|abbr=off}} of territory.&lt;ref name=Cromac&gt;{{cite web|title=Mine Situation|url=http://www.hcr.hr/en/minSituac.asp|website=Croatian Mine Action Center|publisher=Cromac}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minefields (usually known as &quot;mine suspected areas&quot;) are located in 69&lt;ref name=&quot;Cromac&quot;/&gt; [[List of cities in Croatia|cities]] and [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]] within 9&lt;ref name=&quot;Cromac&quot;/&gt; [[Counties of Croatia|counties]]. These areas are thought to contain approximately 46,317&lt;ref name=&quot;Cromac&quot;/&gt; land mines, in addition to [[unexploded ordnance]] left over from the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Land mines were used extensively during the war by all sides in the conflict; about 1.5&amp;nbsp;million were deployed. They were intended to strengthen defensive positions lacking sufficient weapons or manpower, but played a limited role in the fighting.

After the war {{convert|13000|km2|abbr=off}} of territory was initially suspected to contain mines, but this estimate was later reduced to {{convert|1174|km2|abbr=off}} after physical inspection. {{as of|2013}} [[demining]] programmes were coordinated through governmental bodies such as the Croatian Mine Action Centre, which was hiring private demining companies employing 632 deminers. {{as of|2015|September p}}, [[Croatia]] plans to clear all suspected minefields by 2019. The areas are marked with 13,274&lt;ref name=&quot;Cromac&quot;/&gt; warning signs.

{{as of|2013|04|04}}, 509 people had been killed and 1,466 injured by land mines in Croatia since the war; with these figures including 60 deminers and seven [[Croatian Army]] engineers killed during demining operations. In the immediate aftermath of the war there were about 100 civilian mine casualties per year, but this gradually decreased to below ten per year through demining, mine-awareness and education programmes. Croatia has spent approximately €450&amp;nbsp;million on demining since 1998, when the process was taken over by private contractors coordinated by the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The cost to complete the demining is estimated at €500&amp;nbsp;million or more. Economic loss to Croatia (due to loss of land use within suspected minefields) is estimated at €47.3&amp;nbsp;million per year.

{{main article|Croatian War of Independence}}
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat of the Communist regime]] in [[Croatia]] by the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), ethnic tensions between [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] worsened. After the elections, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) confiscated Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] weapons to minimize potential resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August, tensions escalated to an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] by the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]]. The JNA stepped in, preventing Croatian police from intervening.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around the city of Knin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]] and [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] regions and [[eastern Croatia]]n settlements with a significant Serb population.&lt;ref name=MarticICTY&gt;{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contiguous area was subsequently named the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK). The RSK declared its intention to join [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]], and as a result came to be viewed by the [[Government of Croatia]] as a [[Secession|breakaway]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1991, the conflict had escalated into what became known as the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia declared its independence]] as [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia disintegrated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|26 June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1992, the RSK held {{convert|17028|km2}} of territory within borders claimed by Croatia. This territory ranged from {{convert|2.5|to|63.1|km|abbr=off}} in depth, and had a {{convert|923|km|adj=on}} front line along Croatian-controlled territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime use==
[[File:NE PRILAZITE - NA OVOM PODRUCJU JE VELIKA OPASNOST OD MINA (Hrvatska, 7 Travanj 2007).jpg|thumb|Marking of a minefield left over from [[Croatian War of Independence]]]]
Land mines were first used by the JNA in early 1991, before its withdrawal from Croatia, to protect military barracks and other facilities. Even JNA facilities located in urban centres were secured in this way, using mines such as the [[PROM-1]] [[bounding mine]] and [[MRUD]] directional anti-personnel mine.&lt;ref name=Haluzan142&gt;{{harvnb|Halužan|1999|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Croatian Army]] (HV) and Croatian police began laying land mines in late 1991, relying heavily on them to stop advances by the JNA and the [[Military of Serbian Krajina|Army of the RSK]] (ARSK) until early 1992. These early minefields were laid with little documentation. In 1992 the ARSK increased its use of mines to secure the front line,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halužan|1999|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to its limited number of troops. Consequently, the ARSK constructed static defensive lines (consisting of [[Trench warfare|trenches]], [[bunker]]s and large numbers of mines designed to protect thinly-manned defences) to delay HV offensives. This approach was necessitated by the limited depth of RSK territory and the lack of reserves available with which to [[counterattack]] (or block) breaches of its defensive line, which meant that the ARSK was unable to employ [[defence in depth]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balkan Battlegrounds|2002|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The combination of poor documentation of minefield locations and the lack of markings (or fencing) led to frequent injuries to military personnel caused by mines laid by friendly forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halužan|1999|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that a total of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million land mines were laid during the war.&lt;ref name=Haluzan142/&gt;

The HV successfully used [[anti-tank mine]]s as obstacles in combination with infantry [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank weapons]], destroying or disabling more than 300 JNA tanks (particularly during defensive operations in [[Slavonia]]).&lt;ref name=Haluzan142/&gt; Conversely, [[anti-personnel mine]]s deployed by the ARSK proved less effective against the HV during  [[Operation Flash|operations Flash]] and [[Operation Storm|Storm]] in 1995. During these operations, the HV crossed (or bypassed) many ARSK minefields based on information from land-based and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] reconnaissance of the movement of ARSK patrols, civilian populations and the activation of mines by wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halužan|1999|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 224 HV personnel killed in operations Flash and Storm, only 15 fatalities were caused by land mines. Similarly, out of 966 wounded in the two offensives only 92 were injured by land mines.&lt;ref name=Haluzan148&gt;{{harvnb|Halužan|1999|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
{{As of|2013|04|04}} a total of 509 people had been killed and 1,466 injured by land mines in 1,352 incidents in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|tportal.hr|4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 557 civilian casualties from land mines between 1991 and 1995, during the war and in its immediate aftermath. Between 1996 and 1998 there were approximately 100 civilian casualties from land mines per year in Croatia,&lt;ref name=Haluzan149/&gt; but the number gradually decreased to less than ten per year by 2010.&lt;ref name=HCR2010&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, 57 HV troops were killed or injured by mines in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halužan|1999|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, 169 were killed or injured (most during operations Flash and Storm)&lt;ref name=Haluzan148/&gt; out of 130,000 HV troops involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Index.hr|5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven HV engineers were killed and 18 injured by land mines during HV mine clearance operations between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref name=Haluzan149&gt;{{harvnb|Halužan|1999|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilian casualties include 60 [[deminer]]s killed since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatia has established an extensive framework to assist those injured by mines and the families of mine victims. This assistance includes emergency and ongoing medical care, [[physical rehabilitation]], psychological and social support, employment and social-integration assistance, public awareness and access to public services. Institutions and organizations supporting mine victims include a wide range of governmental bodies and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Assistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existing minefields==
[[File:Mines in Croatia.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A white painted rectangular warning sign on a metal pole|upright|Standard minefield sign]]
{{further|List of minefields in Croatia}}
{{as of|2015|11|27}}, there were {{convert|487.4|km2|abbr=off}} of Croatian territory suspected to contain [[land mine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cromac&quot;/&gt; These areas are located in 9 [[Counties of Croatia|counties]] and 70 [[List of cities in Croatia|cities]] and [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cromac&quot;/&gt; They are thought to contain approximately 46,317 land mines, as well as [[unexploded ordnance]] left over from the Croatian War of Independence. Areas suspected to contain land mines are marked with more than 12,000 warning signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OMA|July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas thought to contain unexploded ordnance (but no land mines) are marked with 409 warning signs.&lt;ref name=HCR2010/&gt; Suspected minefields are primarily located in forests (62 percent); the remainder are on [[agricultural land]] (26 percent), [[karst]] and [[shrubland]] (12 percent).&lt;ref name=HCR-Intro/&gt;

==={{anchor|Social and economic impact}}Social and economic impacts===
Land mines are a safety issue for populations living near minefields. In 2008, an estimated 920,000 people in Croatia were endangered by their proximity to mined areas (20.8 percent of the population). Land mines are also a significant problem for development, because a substantial portion of the minefields in Croatia are on agricultural land and in forests. Some [[drainage channel]]s are consequently inaccessible for maintenance, resulting in intermittent flooding; this is particularly severe in areas bordering [[Hungary]]. Similar problems are caused by mines laid on the banks of the [[Drava]], [[Kupa]] and [[Sava]] rivers.&lt;ref name=Prog6&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Programme|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of land mines adversely affected post-war recovery in rural areas, reducing the amount of available agricultural land, impeding development and affecting the quality of life for people in mined areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MVEP|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to agriculture, the most significant economic problem caused by mines in Croatia is their impact on [[Tourism in Croatia|tourism]] (especially on forested areas and hunting in areas inland from the [[Adriatic Sea]] coast). In 2012, it was estimated that the [[economy of Croatia]] lost 355&amp;nbsp;million [[Croatian Kuna|kuna]] ({{circa}} 47.3&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s) a year from the effects of mine-suspected areas on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|tportal.hr|21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the importance of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for [[demining]].&lt;ref name=Prog6/&gt; Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. [[National parks in Croatia]] were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Programme|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ezadar.hr|28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.

The Government of Croatia established several bodies to address the problem of land mines in Croatia; foremost among them are the Office for Mine Action and the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Office for Mine Action is a government agency tasked with providing expert analysis and advice on demining. The Croatian Mine Action Centre is a public-sector body tasked with planning and conducting demining surveys, accepting cleared areas, marking mine-suspected areas, quality assurance, demining research and development, and victim assistance. The work of the Croatian Mine Action Centre is supervised by the Office for Mine Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vlada RH|22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HCR-MAC/&gt;

As refugees flee to Europe, from Syria and other Middle Eastern nations, some are migrating through Croatia due to Hungary's recent closing of its borders. These immigrants trying to cross to Europe are seeking Croatia's help in finding safe routes of passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Index.hr|21 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mine awareness and education===
[[File:Landmine warning sign in Croatia.jpg|thumb|alt=A large advertising poster on a standalone mount|right|Mine-awareness billboard]]
Croatia has implemented a mine-awareness educational programme aimed at reducing the frequency of mine-related accidents through an ongoing information campaign. The programme is conducted by the [[Croatian Red Cross]], the [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|Ministry of Science, Education and Sports]] and a number of NGOs in cooperation with the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Croatian Mine Action Centre actively supports NGOs to develop as many programmes as possible and attract new NGOs to mine-awareness and educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Programme|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains an accessible online database with cartographic information on the location of mine-suspected areas in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Awareness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One mine-awareness campaign involving [[billboard]] advertising attracted criticism from the [[Ministry of Tourism (Croatia)|Ministry of Tourism]] and the [[Croatian National Tourist Board]] (CNTB) because the signs were placed in tourist areas, far from any mine-suspected areas. The Ministry of Tourism and the CNTB welcomed the effort's humanitarian aspect, but considered the signs a potential source of unwarranted negative reaction from tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MT|23 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist guidebooks of Croatia include warnings about the danger posed by mines in the country, and provide general information about their location.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bousfield|2003|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demining==
[[File:Stroj za razminiranje KA (5).jpg|thumb|alt=A self-propelled machine being loaded onto a vehicle transportation trailer|left|[[Mine flail]] used for demining in Croatia]]
At the end of the Croatian War of Independence, approximately {{convert|13000|km2|abbr=off}} of the country was suspected of containing land mines.&lt;ref name=VL7Mar12&gt;{{harvnb|Večernji list|7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war and in its immediate aftermath, demining was performed by HV [[Combat engineer|engineers]]&lt;ref name=Haluzan149/&gt; supported by police and [[civil defence]] personnel. Wartime demining was focused on clearance tasks in support of military operations and the safety of the civilian population. In 1996 the [[Parliament of Croatia]] enacted the Demining Act, tasking police with its organization and the government-owned AKD Mungos company with the demining itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Programme|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1998 approximately {{convert|40|km2|abbr=off}} had been cleared of mines, and the initial estimate of minefield areas was reduced after inspection. By 2003 the entire territory of Croatia was reviewed, and the minefield area  reduced to {{convert|1174|km2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Programme|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since May 1998&lt;ref name=HCR-Intro&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Croatian Mine Action Centre has been tasked with the development of demining plans, projects, technical inspections, cleared-area handover, demining quality assurance, expert assistance and the coordination of mine-clearance activities.&lt;ref name=HCR-MAC&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Activities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demining is performed by 35 licensed companies, employing 632 demining professionals and 58 auxiliary personnel. The companies do their work with 681 [[metal detector]]s, 55 [[mine roller]]s and [[mine flail]]s, and 15 [[Mine action#Mine Detection Dogs|mine-detection dogs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Licensees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mine-clearing machines include locally designed models produced by [[DOK-ING]].&lt;ref name=Index4April13&gt;{{harvnb|Index.hr|4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deminers typically earn €.50&amp;ndash;1.20 for each {{convert|1|m2|abbr=off}} cleared, or €800&amp;ndash;900 a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DW|4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, demining has been funded through the government and by donations. From 1998 to 2011, donations amounted to €75.5&amp;nbsp;million (17 percent of the total of €450&amp;nbsp;million spent on demining during that period). Most donations were from foreign contributors, including NGOs and foreign governments (among them [[Japan]], [[Germany]], [[Monaco]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[United States]]). The [[European Union]] was also a significant contributor during that period, providing €20.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|HCR|Donations}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}}, the Croatian Mine Action Centre has been allocated approximately 400&amp;nbsp;million kuna ({{circa}} 53&amp;nbsp;million euros) a year for demining.&lt;ref name=Index4April13/&gt; An estimated further €500&amp;nbsp;million (or more) will be needed to remove all remaining land mines from Croatia by 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|tportal.hr|7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the deadline for land-mine clearance set by the [[Ottawa Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nacional|14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian Mine Action Centre spends approximately 500,000 kuna ({{circa}} 66,600 euros) a year to maintain minefield warning signs (including the replacement of stolen signs).&lt;ref name=VL7Mar12/&gt;
