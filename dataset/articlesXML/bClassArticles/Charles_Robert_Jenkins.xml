'''Charles Robert Jenkins''' (born February 18, 1940) is a former [[United States Army]] soldier who lived in [[North Korea]] from 1965 to 2004 after [[desertion|deserting]] from his unit and crossing the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/20/60minutes/main959455.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Deserter Recalls N. Korean Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United Nations Human Rights Council 2014&quot;/&gt;

==Military service and desertion==
Jenkins was born in [[Rich Square, North Carolina]]. He joined the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] in 1955, aged 15, well below the minimum enlistment age. He joined the regular army in 1958 and was assigned to the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]. He served in [[South Korea]] from 1960 to 1961, in Europe from 1962 to 1964, and in South Korea again.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jun 5, 2004 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/FF05Dh05.html |title=Asia Times Online - The trusted news source for information on Japan |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2004-06-05 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, Jenkins was assigned to night patrols. He subsequently crossed into North Korea and surrendered to forces there, in hopes of being sent to the USSR and then, through prisoner exchange, eventually returned to the United States. Shortly thereafter, North Korean [[propaganda]] declared that a U.S. sergeant had defected, and broadcast statements allegedly made by the [[defector]], reportedly in stilted English. The U.S. Army claimed Jenkins wrote four letters stating his intention to defect (an allegation Jenkins denies); however, the original letters are reportedly lost. His relatives maintained throughout his absence that he was abducted.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;/&gt;

==Life in North Korea==
Information about Jenkins' status was unavailable outside North Korea for many years. Jenkins says he almost immediately regretted his desertion. He says that he and three other U.S. servicemen, [[Larry Abshier]], [[Jerry Parrish]] and [[James Dresnok]], were quarantined in a one-room house with no running water for seven years until 1972, where they were made to study the [[Juche]] philosophy of [[Kim Il-sung]] daily. They were forced to memorize large passages of Kim's in Korean, and beaten frequently by their guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes1&quot;/&gt;

He says that at one point in 1966, he found his way to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] embassy in [[Pyongyang]] and requested [[Right of asylum|asylum]], which was denied. Eventually, Jenkins was placed in separate housing and began teaching English at the [[Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;United Nations Human Rights Council 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=John M. Glionna |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/16/world/fg-japan-jenkins16 |title=Second life of GI who deserted to North Korea |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Jenkins was introduced to [[Hitomi Soga]], a 21-year-old Japanese nursing student who had been [[North Korean abductions of Japanese|abducted by North Korean agents in 1978]], along with her mother, during a search for Japanese citizens who could train future spies in Japanese language and culture. Soga's mother was never heard from again, and Soga was &quot;given to&quot; Jenkins. Thirty-eight days after meeting, they were married. They had two daughters, Roberta Mika Jenkins (born 1983) and Brinda Carol Jenkins (born 1985). In 1982, Jenkins appeared in the North Korean film ''[[Unsung Heroes (film)|Unsung Heroes]]'', which provided the first evidence to the Western world that he was alive. The U.S. government did not publicly reveal this information until 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United Nations Human Rights Council 2014&quot;/&gt;

==Confirmation and return==
Jenkins drew international interest again in 2002, when North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] confirmed that North Korea had abducted Japanese citizens. In an effort at [[détente]], surviving abductees were allowed to travel to Japan, including Jenkins' wife. The visit was intended to last for a week, but the Japanese government chose not to return them on schedule and instead negotiated for their families to join them in Japan. Most of the families did ultimately travel to Japan, but Jenkins and his daughters stayed behind out of fear that the North Korean government was testing his loyalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;/&gt;

After assurances of protection from the Japanese government, he travelled with his daughters to Japan by way of [[Indonesia]] for medical treatment, arriving in Japan on July 18, 2004. Japan formally requested a pardon for Jenkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040516a1.html |title=&quot;Japan asks U.S. to pardon abductee's American husband&quot;, The Japan Times Online, May 16, 2004 (accessed April 18, 2010) |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2004-05-16 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the U.S. declined to grant. After expressing a desire to put his conscience at rest, Jenkins reported on September 11, 2004 to [[Camp Zama]] in Japan. He reported in respectful military form, [[salute|saluting]] the receiving [[United States Army Military Police Corps|military police]] officer.

On November 3, Jenkins pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and aiding the enemy, but denied making disloyal or seditious statements &amp;ndash; the latter charges were dropped.  He was sentenced to 30 days' confinement, received a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and benefits and was reduced in rank to E-1 private (the lowest rank in the US Army). He was released six days early, on November 27, 2004, for good behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;/&gt;

Jenkins and his family settled on [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]] in Japan, which is Soga's home. On June 14, 2005, Jenkins, his wife, and two daughters traveled to the [[United States]] to visit his 91-year-old mother in [[North Carolina]], returning later in the month.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews2005&quot;/&gt; He found work as a greeter in a shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes&quot;/&gt;

There were three other American deserters who remained in North Korea as well: [[James Joseph Dresnok]] (who was interviewed for a 2006 British documentary ''[[Crossing the Line (documentary)|Crossing the Line]]''), Private [[Larry Allen Abshier]], and Specialist [[Jerry Wayne Parrish]]. The former two defected in 1962, while the latter defected in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;United Nations Human Rights Council 2014&quot;/&gt; As of 2007, Dresnok is living in North Korea and says he does not regret his defection.&lt;ref name=&quot;60mins&quot;&gt;&quot;An American in North Korea&quot;, ''60 Minutes'', CBS Television. Produced by Robert G. Anderson and Casey Morgan.  Reported by Bob Simon.  First broadcast on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/movies/19cros.html?fta=y An American in North Korea, Pledging Allegiance to the Great Leader]{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}; ''[[New York Times]]''; October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to North Korean official reports, Abshier and Parrish died of natural causes while living in that country.&lt;ref name=&quot;60mins&quot;/&gt;

On July 15, 2008, Jenkins obtained permanent residency status in Japan, just half a month after he applied for the status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080716b2.html |title = Jenkins gets permanent residency |publisher = [[The Japan Times]] |date = 2008-07-16 |accessdate = 2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins commented that he wanted to stay in Japan for the rest of his life, and would also like to obtain [[Japanese nationality law|Japanese citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20080715-OYT1T00377.htm ジェンキンスさんに永住許可「死ぬまでここにいたい」].

===Military awards===
[[File:JenkinsUniform.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Jenkins at the time of his court martial]]
Although dishonorably discharged from military service (meaning that Jenkins is ineligible to display [[Awards and decorations of the United States Armed Forces|U.S. military awards]], request replacements from the Army, or purchase them on his own), Jenkins' years of status as a deserter technically qualified him for several automatic military decorations which he displayed at the time of his court martial.

During his active duty service in the 1960s, Jenkins was presented one award of the Good Conduct Medal, this being the only award he was ever formally presented by the military.  During his years as a deserter, however, Jenkins was &quot;carried on the rolls&quot; of the U.S. Army in a desertion status meaning that he was not discharged but classified as an active duty soldier under &quot;Time Lost&quot; due to his [[AWOL]] status.

In 2004, when Jenkins surrendered himself as a deserter, the U.S. Army placed him back on the active duty rolls as a &quot;deserter returned to military control&quot;.  He was credited with 14,494 days time lost as a deserter and, by default, became eligible for all automatic [[service medal]]s which had been created during his long period of absence.  This included all automatic awards created for soldiers serving in Korea as well as active duty awards for service after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.

At his court martial in November 2004, Jenkins appeared wearing the following awards on his Army uniform.

* [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)#Army Good Conduct Medal|Army Good Conduct Medal]]
* [[National Defense Service Medal]]
* [[Global War on Terrorism Service Medal]]
* [[Korea Defense Service Medal]]
* [[Army Service Ribbon]]
* [[Overseas Service Ribbon]]

Jenkins further displayed the [[Awards and decorations of the National Guard#North Carolina|North Carolina Service Ribbon]] to denote his status as a Guardsman transferred to the Regular Army during his original tour in the 1950s and 60s.  His one authorized Army badge is the [[Marksmanship Badge (United States)|Marksmanship Badge]] with Rifle bar.

==Memoirs==
Jenkins published a book in Japanese in October 2005, titled ''To Tell the Truth'' ({{lang-ja|告白}}; [[Romaji]]: kokuhaku; ISBN 4-04-791510-6), about his experiences in North Korea. A [[Korean language|Korean]]-language edition was also released in June 2006 by Mulpure Publishing of South Korea. (Korean: 고백, ''gobaek'', ISBN 89-8110-234-1)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Escape from Pyongyang|first=James|last=Card|date=November–December 2006|periodical=Foreign Policy|accessdate=2008-03-15|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An English-language version, titled ''The Reluctant Communist: My Desertion, Court-Martial, and Forty-Year Imprisonment in North Korea'', co-authored with journalist [[Jim Frederick]] (ISBN 978-0520253339), was published by the [[University of California Press]] on March 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10992.html|contribution=Charles Robert Jenkins with Jim Frederick: The Reluctant Communist|title=New titles|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120537252745332373.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Bookshelf: To Hell and Back|last=Schoenfeld|first=Gabriel|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2008-03-15|page=D9|periodical=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Jenkins - who deserted his post in the ROK in 1965 – reports having lived in close proximity to the three US nationals who crossed over to the DPRK before him, Mr Larry Allen Abshier (1962), Mr James Joseph Dresnock (1962) and Mr Jerry Wayne Parrish (1963).  According to Mr Jenkins, the four were closely monitored and managed with their freedom of movement seriously constrained. The four unsuccessfully attempted to escape in 1966 by seeking asylum in the Russian Embassy, after which they were convinced there was no chance they could leave the DPRK. They had crossed voluntarily, but found themselves trapped in captivity. Mr Jenkins and the couple’s two daughters were able to reunite with Ms Soga in Japan in 2004. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
