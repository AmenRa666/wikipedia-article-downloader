The '''8th Field Ambulance''' was a medical unit of the [[Australian Army]]. It was original formed for service during World War I as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]], and served mainly on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] between 1916 and 1918, before disbanding in early 1919. During World War II, the unit was re-raised as a [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] unit and served in Western Australia, New Guinea and Bougainville. During the Vietnam War, the unit served in [[Vung Tau]] in support of the [[1st Australian Task Force]] between 1967 and 1968, before being disbanded in 1972. The unit's designation is now perpetuated by one for the [[1st Close Health Battalion (Australia)|1st Close Health Battalion]]'s close health companies.

==History==

The 8th Field Ambulance was first formed during World War I, being raised in Egypt in January 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1014567/?image=2#display-image |title=AWM4 26/51/1: January &amp;ndash; March 1916: 8th Australian Field Ambulance  |work=War Diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] was expanded following the unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grey |first=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Grey |title=A Military History of Australia |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne, Victoria|year=2008|pp=99&amp;ndash;100 |isbn=978-0-521-69791-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assigned to the [[8th Brigade (Australia)|8th Brigade]], [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division]], the 8th Field Ambulance was subsequently deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Responsible for providing second line evacuation from [[regimental aid post]]s that were deployed forward with the attacking troops, to casualty clearing stations, Australian field ambulances at the time consisted of 10 officers and 224 other ranks and were organised into a headquarters and two company-sized sub-divisions known as the &quot;tent sub-division&quot; and the &quot;bearer sub-division&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Likeman |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Men of the Ninth: A History of the Ninth Australian Field Ambulance 1916&amp;ndash;1994 |publisher=Slouch Hat Publications |location=McCrae, New South Wales |isbn=9780957975224 |p=10  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The unit's first major battle came during the disastrous [[Battle of Fromelles]] in July 1916, after which it served throughout the remainder of the war supporting the 8th Brigade's operations in France and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rslvirtualwarmemorial.org.au/explore/units/325 |title=8th Field Ambulance |work=RSL Virtual War Memorial |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit's last war diary entry was made in March 1919, after which it was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/AWM4/26/51/ |title=AWM4 Subclass 26/51: 8th Australian Field Ambulance |work=War Diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, the 8th Field Ambulance was re-raised as a [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] unit in [[Geraldton, Western Australia]], in 1942. It later deployed on active service during the [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Bougainville Campaign]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/070358/ |title=070358 |work=Collection |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Allan |title=The Island Campaigns |series=Australia in the War of 1939–1945.

In early April 1966, the unit was re-raised with the intent to deploy to South Vietnam as part of [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's contribution to the Vietnam War]], and was based initially at [[Puckapunyal, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=Vampire&gt;{{cite web | url= http://callsignvampire.org/content/view/33/37/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080908075319/http://callsignvampire.org/content/view/33/37/ |title=Callsign Vampire |archivedate=8 September 2008 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was staffed primarily by [[Citizens Military Force]] (CMF) medical officers on full-time service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Brendan|last2=Smith|first2=Francis|title=Medicine at War: Medical Aspects of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1950–1972|series=The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975|volume=Volume Three|publisher=Allen and Unwin|location=St Leonards, New South Wales|year=1994|isbn=1863733019|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year-long period of training followed before the unit finally deployed, arriving at [[Vung Tau]] in late April 1967, and taking over from the 2nd Field Ambulance. Forming part of the [[1st Australian Logistic Support Group]], the unit's main force of about 100 personnel established a field hospital at Vung Tau capable of supporting about 50 patients. A smaller team of around [[platoon]]-strength deployed forward inland, working directly with the [[1st Australian Task Force]]'s deployed infantry battalions.&lt;ref name=Vampire/&gt; In 1968, the field hospital was redesignated the 1st Australian Field Hospital as the medical services in Vietnam were expanded,&lt;ref name=1chb&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.army.gov.au/Who-we-are/Divisions-and-Brigades/Forces-Command/17th-Combat-Service-Support-Brigade/1st-Close-Health-Battalion |title=1st Close Health Battalion |work=Who We Are |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the forward medical detachment retained the 8th Field Ambulance designation. It was subsequently disbanded in 1972 following the conclusion of its tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vvaa.org.au/oob.htm |title=Australian Order of Battle for Vietnam 1962&amp;ndash;1972 |author=Ross, Brian |publisher=Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit's designation is perpetuated by the 8th Close Health Company (8 CHC), which forms part of the [[1st Close Health Battalion (Australia)|1st Close Health Battalion]], which is assigned to the [[17th Combat Service Support Brigade (Australia)|17th Combat Service Support Brigade]] and was previously designated the 1st Health Support Battalion. 8 CHC was formed in 2011 from the 1st Combat Service Support Battalion's (1 CSSB) health company, following a restructure of Army health elements, which resulted in the CSSBs losing their integral health companies. 8 CHC is currently based in Darwin and provides close health support to the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Brigade]].&lt;ref name=1chb/&gt;
