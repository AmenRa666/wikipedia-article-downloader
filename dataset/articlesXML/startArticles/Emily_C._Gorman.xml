Colonel '''Emily C. Gorman''' (April 9, 1909 â€“ July 4, 2005) was the director of the United States [[Women's Army Corps]] from 1962 to 1966. She was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for her service during the [[Cold War]].

==Early life and education==
Emily C. Gorman was born in New York on April 9, 1909. She was valedictorian of her graduating high school class in Pulaski, New York,&lt;ref name=Standard05&gt;{{cite news |title=Emily C. Gorman |author= |url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/onondaga/obits/tps/2005/jul/tps11jul2005.txt |work=Syracuse Post Standard |date=11 July 2005 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=Standard05/&gt; At Cornell, she was a member of the [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] sorority.&lt;ref name=Standard05/&gt; Gorman also completed graduate work in education and English literature at both [[Syracuse University]] and the [[University of Rochester]]. She worked as a teacher in New York until she enlisted in the [[Women's Army Corps]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=Standard05/&gt;

Gorman graduated from the Women's Army Corps Officer Candidate School in October 1942. After graduating, she was appointed as chief of the School's administration school. In 1944, Gorman was appointed as the staff director for the Women's Army Corps surgeon general in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Women's Army Corps, 1945&amp;ndash;1978 |author=Bettie J.

==Military career==

===World War II and early career===
In August 1945, Gorman was assigned to [[Berlin]], where she worked as executive security officer of the [[Allied Control Council]]. In February 1947, she was [[demobilization|demobilized]] and returned to the states. Soon afterward, she was categorized as active duty and aided in the organization and planning of a new Women's Army Corps center. In 1948, Gorman became a training officer at [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Camp Lee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990)&quot;/&gt; 

Two years later, she was promoted to lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990)&quot;/&gt; She served as commander of the basic training battalion until 1951, when she re-joined the Women's Army Corps as staff adviser at [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]]. In 1954, Gorman also represented the Women's Army Corps on the [[Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the Services|Defense Advisory Committee for Women]] in Washington.&lt;ref name=LIFE54&gt;{{cite news |title=Theirs is the Hard-Earned Job of Command |author= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=emily+c.+gorman |work=LIFE Magazine |date=18 January 1954 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorman worked as deputy director at Fort Meade until January 1957, when she became deputy chief of the Plans and Training Division at [[Fort Monroe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990)&quot;/&gt; 

===Women's Army Corps and Vietnam war===

Gorman May 1963.png|thumb|right|[[United States Under Secretary of the Army|Under Secretary of the Army]] [[Stephen Ailes]] cuts the ribbon to open the WAC Exhibit Unit on [[The Pentagon]] concourse with Gorman and enlisted members of the newly formed WAC Exhibit Team.]]
In May 1962, [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] invited Gorman to the [[White House]] to publicly congratulate her on the development of the Women's Army Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), p 186&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), p 186&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1963, Gorman became director of the Women's Army Corps and chose Lt. Col. Mary E. Kelly as her deputy director.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990)&quot;/&gt;  Gorman enrolled the Women's Army Corps in an exhibiting program to increase public awareness of the Corps' functions. The exhibit was unveiled at the Pentagon on May 14, 1963. Gorman had assigned Lt. Col. Mildred I. C. Bailey as the head of the exhibit's planning team. The exhibit, which featured a profile image of Athena, the Greek goddess of war, toured the country for six and a half years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), pp 189-191&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), pp 189&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1963, Gorman approved and enforced a new policy to increase the role of [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] women in the [[United States|American]] military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), pp 189-191&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), pp 189&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; The plan included special dispensations for female soldiers based on the demands of currently enlisted women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), pp 196, 198&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), pp 196, 198&lt;/ref&gt; These changes included increased security in living environments, and designated living spaces accessible only by female personnel. Female personnel had also requested locks on the doors to their private dormitories, and Gorman's plan provided these.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), p 196&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), p 196&lt;/ref&gt; Through the policy, female soldiers were also permitted to decorate and personalize some areas of their living space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), p 197&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), p 197&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1966, reports showed that Gorman's policy had increased enlistment around 12% new enlistees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), p 193&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), p 193&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gorman continued to push for improvements in housing for female personnel throughout the 1960s. In 1963, she adjusted some of her policy's plans for all-female housing, stating that female soldiers in some cases could live in gender-specific wings of male dorms, although they were ideally to be provided female-only entrances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), p 199&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), p 199&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Gorman selected American female soldiers to assist in the structuring of a Women's Armed Forces Corps in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), p 241&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), p 241&lt;/ref&gt; These women were assigned to support female Vietnamese soldiers in training and supporting a new infrastructure following the departure of American forces from the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), pp 242&amp;ndash;252&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), pp 242-252&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last year of Gorman's career as director of the WAC, she pushed for military engineers to maximize living space in bathrooms, private bedrooms and kitchens for female personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), p 200&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), p 200&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the Women's Army Corps held a [[Groundbreaking|groundbreaking ceremony]] for its newly designed barracks, and Gorman refused to attend, believing the engineers had not made adequate changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morden (1990), pp 200-201&quot;&gt;Morden (1990), pp 200-201&lt;/ref&gt; Gorman later retired from her position as director in July 1966.&lt;ref name=Sarasota66&gt;{{cite news |title=New Director For Women's Army Named |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19660624&amp;id=WAwfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FowEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4607,3430293&amp;hl=en |work=The Sarasota Journal |date=24 June 1966 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-military career==
Upon her retirement, Gorman was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for her military service during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=Valor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=105023 |title=Valor awards for Emily C. Gorman |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Military Times |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of her career, Gorman also received an [[Commendation Medal#Army|Army Commendation Medal]], a [[Women's Army Corps Service Medal|WAC Service Medal]], American and European-African-Middle Eastern campaign medals, a [[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]], an [[Army of Occupation Medal]], a [[National Defense Service Medal|National Defense Medal]] and a [[Army Staff Identification Badge|General Staff Identification Badge]].&lt;ref name=Standard05/&gt;

After retiring from the military, Gorman worked at the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]], aiding the implementation of programs against poverty.

Lt. Col. Gorman died in 2005&lt;ref name=USWAF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armywomensfoundation.org/doc/bmp/MemorialPam2007.pdf |title=In Memory Of... |author= |date=2007 |work= |publisher=Army Women's Foundation, Inc. |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 96.

==Personal life==
In 1962, Gorman received the Kappa Kappa Gamma Alumnae Achievement Award. She was a member of the [[American Association of University Women]], the [[Business and Professional Women's Foundation]], the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors, Robert Edwards American Legion Post 358, Monday [[Historical society|Historical Club]] and Northern Oswego County Ambulance.
