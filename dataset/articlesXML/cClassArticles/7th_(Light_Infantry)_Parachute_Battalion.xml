The '''7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion''' was an [[Airborne forces|airborne]] [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], formed by the [[British Army during the Second World War]]. The battalion was raised in November 1942 by the conversion of the 10th Battalion, [[Somerset Light Infantry]] to parachute duties. It was initially assigned to the [[3rd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Parachute Brigade]], part of [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]], but moved to the [[5th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Parachute Brigade]], alongside the [[12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion|12th]] and [[13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion|13th Parachute]] battalions, of the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] soon afterwards.

The battalion saw combat on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] in [[Operation Tonga]] on 6 June 1944, the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December and the [[Operation Varsity|River Rhine crossing]] in March 1945. After the war ended in Europe, the battalion, with the 5th Parachute Brigade, was sent to the [[Far East]] to undertake operations against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]]. However, the war ended just after the men had started [[Jungle warfare|jungle training]]. Moving by sea, the battalion took part in the reoccupation of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]]. Problems in [[Java]] resulted in the battalion being sent to [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (Jakarta) to control the unrest, until relieved by a Dutch force.

The battalion then rejoined the [[6th Airborne Division in Palestine]]. Post war army reductions saw the battalion amalgamated with the [[17th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|17th Parachute Battalion]], but still remaining the 7th Parachute Battalion. But further reductions eventually saw the battalion disbanded.

==Formation==
Impressed by the success of German airborne operations during the [[Battle of France]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], directed the [[War Office]] to investigate the possibility of creating a [[corps]] of 5,000 parachute troops.&lt;ref&gt;Otway, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 1940, [[No. 2 Commando]] was turned over to parachute duties and, on 21 November, redesignated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.&lt;ref&gt;Shortt &amp; McBride, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, [[Operation Colossus]], on 10 February 1941.&lt;ref name=guard218&gt;Guard, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was later redesignated as the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st Parachute Battalion]]. The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the existing airborne force, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in [[Derbyshire]] in April 1942, and creating the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] as well as converting a number of infantry battalions into airborne battalions in August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Harclerode, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion was formed, in November 1942, by the conversion of the 10th Battalion, [[Somerset Light Infantry]], a war service battalion created two years earlier, to parachute duties. The battalion was assigned to the [[3rd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Parachute Brigade]], originally part of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] but later transferred to the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[1st Canadian Parachute Battalion]] arrived in Britain, it was assigned to the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the 7th Parachute Battalion was transferred to the [[5th Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Parachute Brigade]], which was also a part of the 6th Airborne Division.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, a parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (three [[Platoon|platoons]] each) supported by a [[Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar|3&amp;nbsp;inch mortar]] platoon and a [[Vickers machine gun]] platoon.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; By 1944, a support company was added to command the battalion's heavy weapons. It comprised three platoons: a Mortar Platoon with eight 3 inch mortars, a Machine Gun Platoon with four Vickers machine guns and an Anti-tank Platoon with ten [[PIAT]] (Projecter, Infantry, Anti-Tank) anti-tank projectors.&lt;!--my reference disagrees, see talk--&gt;&lt;ref name=guard37&gt;Guard, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normandy==
{{further|Operation Deadstick|Operation Tonga|Invasion of Normandy}}

On 6 June 1944, the 7th Parachute Battalion landed in Normandy. Many men of the battalion were scattered or landed on the wrong [[drop zone]]. So badly scattered were they that, by 03:00, [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Richard Geoffrey Pine-Coffin|Pine-Coffin]] in command had only around forty percent of the battalion at the forming up point, although men continued to appear throughout the day. Relatively few of their supply containers had been found, meaning that they possessed few heavy weapons or radio sets.&lt;ref&gt;Harclerode, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; However, the battalion managed to rendezvous with the coup-de-main forces of the 2nd Battalion, [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|Ox and Bucks Light Infantry]] at the Caen and Orne bridges. They then set up a defensive perimeter against German counter-attacks. The first German assault on the bridges came between 05:00 and 07:00 and consisted of isolated and often uncoordinated attacks by tanks, armoured cars and infantry, which grew in intensity throughout the day. The [[Luftwaffe]] attempted to destroy the Caen bridge with a {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bomb, which failed to detonate, and two German Navy coastal craft, which attempted to attack the bridge, were also repelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otway 178&quot;&gt;Otway, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main forces were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when leading elements of the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd British Infantry Division]] arrived and began to relieve the battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otway 178&quot; /&gt; By midnight, the battalion was being held in reserve behind the [[12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion|12th Parachute Battalion]] occupying Le Bas de Ranville and the [[13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion|13th Parachute Battalion]] holding [[Ranville]].&lt;ref&gt;Harclerode, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ardennes==
{{further|Battle of the Bulge}}
The 6th Airborne Division was called to intervene in the German offensive through the Ardennes on 20 December 1944. On the 29th of that month, they attacked the tip of the German thrust and the 3rd Parachute Brigade was given responsibility for the Rochefort sector, which they took after meeting stiff resistance. After several months of heavy patrolling, in Belgium and, in February, the Netherlands, the Division was withdrawn to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=1 April 2011|publisher=Pegasus archive|title=3 Para Bde|url=http://www.pegasusarchive.org/normandy/unit_3parabgd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Second World War==
With the war in Europe over, the battalion moved to the Far East with the 5th Parachute Brigade between 1945â€“1946. Thereafter, it returned to the [[6th Airborne Division in Palestine]] and was incorporated into the [[17th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|17th Parachute Battalion]] in July 1946 while retaining its name. After the 5th Parachute Brigade was disbanded, the men of the battalion were reallocated among the remainder of the division and the unit re-designated [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|3rd Parachute Battalion]] at [[Itzehoe]] in July 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paradata&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
