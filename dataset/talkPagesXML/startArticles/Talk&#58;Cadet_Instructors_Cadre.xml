There are no concerns amongst Canadian Forces Officers of the Cadet Instructors Cadre with regard to the kit that they are issued.  As required all are provided the kit suitable for their employment including field clothing for instructors of army and air cadets, and sea going workdress for instructors of sea cadets.  There is absolutely no reason for any member of the CF CIC to be improperly turned out for their assigned duty.  G. 02 Dec 06

Except maybe for those members who don't fit into normal CF sizes should they not be as fit as real CF officers. :P--[[User:Evilbred|Evilbred]] ([[User talk:Evilbred|talk]]) 15:44, 15 September 2009 (UTC)
::Are you deliberately trying to be a troll?  Members of the CIC ''are'' real CF officers. [[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] ([[User talk:Jpjohnsn|talk]]) 10:42, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

Air Element CIC officers are not issued any combats. Our &quot;work dress&quot; is essentially the cadet uniform without the tunic. While this would work for some PRes and Reg Force members in some positions, it is useless in the woods. There was a brief time where if you went and asked nicely you could get a set of CADPAT &quot;loaned&quot; to you, but those days are now long over unless you are Land Element. Air officers have to basically go out and buy OD surplus if they want combats for use on cadet excercises outside of summer camp duties that require them, since they are provided in that context. Otherwise it is fine so long as you have enough points initially to obtain extra uniform parts if you go to summer training centres as staff. If you are attested and sized initially for uniforms after April of the year, it can be difficult to get enough changes of pants/skirts, and sometimes shirts, if only because they tend to get dirty through mysterious means in the middle of the day at CSTCs as a habit. As well, sometimes finding the pumps (high heeled shoes) as specified in the Dress Regulations is hard since they are not availiable in the supply system, particularily if you have feet that fall outside the range of standard women's shoe sizes. [[User:T. Sutherland|T. Sutherland]] 01:01, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;particularily if you have feet that fall outside the range of standard women's shoe sizes&quot; please see my reply above.--[[User:Evilbred|Evilbred]] ([[User talk:Evilbred|talk]]) 01:44, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

== Uniforms ==

&lt;nowiki&gt;This is a current issue that is substantially affecting the CIC.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Ranks ==
Shouldn't the ranks of the officers be named in order of army/air cadets followed by sea cadets? The sea cadets are only 1/3 of the cadet program. I'm about to change it, but you can revert it if you disagree. Simply talk it out here. --[[User:Patar knight|Patar knight]] 02:29, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

Ranks should be listed in order of traditional precedence.  Sea, Army then Air.[[User:Jpjohnsn|CU L8R AV8R ... J-P]] 15:29, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

== JOLC ==
Looking through the article in the courses section, I noticed that no mention is made of the Junior Officer Leadership Course (JOLC), which can be taken in the place of MOC. Has this set of courses ceased, or is it just not featured on this page?[[User:JMesh|JMesh]] ([[User talk:JMesh|talk]]) 22:32, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

----

I think the last time JOLC was taught was May 2006. 

Found that in [http://www.cadet-world.com/cwforums/showthread.php?p=566110#post566110 cadet-world] :

'''Ref: CRCSO 126/06 CANCELLATION OF JUNIOR OFFICER LEADERSHIP COURSES SEA, LAND AND AIR'''

1. Effective immediately, the subject
courses are cancelled.

2. Additional serials and/or vacancies on
the appropriate Military Occupation Courses will
be added to offset the loss of training vacancies
on the subject courses.

3. As part of the ongoing CIC Change
Management Project (CMP) it has been
recognized that there is a continuing requirement
for a specific set of skills and knowledge for
those personnel who fulfil the role of a
Platoon/Flight or Division Commander at a
Cadet Summer Training Centre. In the near
future, those skill sets and knowledge will be
provided during the Platoon/Flight/Divisional
Officer course that will be a component of the
revised CIC Officer Training program.

== March past ==

Recent updates to CATO 14-22 (Marches and calls authorized by the director - history and heritage) Annex A confirm &quot;La feuille d'érable&quot; (The Maple Leaf) as the official march past for the CIC.

==Name Change==

This article has a slight situation around it now. The Cadet Instructors Cadre now exists as a branch and a military occupation, but is no longer a sub-component of the reserve force, as it has now been renamed the Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service (COATS). We need to figure out how to reflect this change appropriately in this and/or other articles.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JMesh|JMesh]] ([[User talk:JMesh|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JMesh|contribs]]) 12:40, 24 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==&quot;Auxiliary Officers&quot;==

== Wings ==

Doesn't seem I can change, it, but can we get the part that says navigator wings, changed to ACSO wings, we havn't been Navs for 2 years now.  And as for the Army cadet officer being allowed to wear jump wings that they earned as cadets, arn't all CF members authorized to wear them since the course is done at CFLOC to the same standard?
