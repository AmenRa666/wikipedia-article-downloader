The '''Czech Air Force''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Vzdušné síly Armády České republiky'', literally the &quot;Air Force of the Army of the Czech Republic&quot;), is the [[air force]] branch of the [[Army of the Czech Republic]]. Along with the [[Czech Land Forces|Land Forces]], the Air Force is the major Czech military force. Former Joint Forces Command and Support Forces Command [[Headquarters|HQs]] were disbanded by 30 June 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Professional Army&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Army|url=http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=5762|website=army.cz|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Air Force succeeded the [[Czechoslovak Air Force]] together with the [[Slovak Air Force]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://merln.ndu.edu/whitepapers/Czech_ENG_2011.pdf|title=The White Paper on Defence|work=The Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127082102/http://merln.ndu.edu/whitepapers/Czech_ENG_2011.pdf|archivedate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/343491/20140813-DSB_International_Defence-REPLACEMENT-O.pdf|format=PDF|title=NATO Defence Expenditure: 2009 - 2013|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Force is responsible for securing the integrity of the Czech Republic's airspace through the [[NATO Integrated Air Defence System]] (NATINADS), [[close air support]] to the Land Forces and for transportation tasks including government and state priority flights. In peacetime the Air Force is contributing to tasks originating in the [[Czech law]]s and interministerial agreements, for example to the [[air ambulance]] service or the [[Search and rescue|SAR]] role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yearbook 2013&quot; /&gt;

Czech [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|JAS-39C/D Gripen]] [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighters]] fulfill primarily the tasks related to the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]] of the Czech Republic and the NATO within the system of NATINADS. In the so-called national reinforcement system the subsonic [[Aero L-159 Alca|L-159 ALCA]] jets could be deployed to fulfil this task too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Live firing beyond the Arctic Circle|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2012|page=32|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[radar]] surveillance of the [[airspace]] of the Czech Republic is a responsibility of the 26th Air [[Command and control|Command, Control]] and [[Surveillance]] [[Regiment]] at [[Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav|Stará Boleslav]]. Altogether seven radio-technical [[Company (military unit)|companies]] are spread around the country so that they can continuously cover its whole territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Czech anti-aircraft defence radars|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2013|page=50|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Czechoslovak Air Force#History}}

===First years===
[[File:1-3cc-area-51.JPG|thumb|left|Czech Air Force [[PZL W-3 Sokół|PZL W-3A]]]]
The separation saw a large reduction in types, numbers and bases. In 1994, 3rd Corps of Tactical Aviation was created. The newest fighter in the [[Czechoslovak Air Force]] arsenal was the [[MiG-29]] (Izdelie 9.12). As there was only one general maintenance kit, which was given to newly created Slovak Republic, and all the material was split 1:1 with Slovakia, maintenance costs for the Czech Fulcrums would be too high. Along with the unreasonably high costs, speculative costs for spare parts imported from Russia, which were realised through third-party companies ([[Mil Mi-24]] rotor blades acquisitions were over-priced by 400%), led to exchange of 10 MiG-29s with Poland for [[PZL W-3]]A Sokół rescue helicopters with avionics and ground support. Therefore, 10 air superiority fighters were exchanged for 11 light helicopters and this acquisition became a strongly discussed affair around a half of 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=W-3A Sokol helicopters in the Czech Air Force service|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2012|page=43|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of readiness squadron passed to the [[MiG-23]]s. Those participated in air exercises with western air forces, where MiG-23MLs were capable of outperforming [[Mirage III]], [[Dassault Mirage F1|F1C]], and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|2000]] and [[F-4]]F in vertical manoeuvering and acceleration and Mirage III, F1C and Phantom even in horizontal manoeuvering, while being outperformed by [[F-16A]] in all aspects and by Mirage 2000 in horizontal manoeuvering.

The new-era Air Force of the Czech Army was effectively formed on 1 July 1997 when the 3rd Corps of Tactical Aviation and the 4th Air Defence Corps were united. The members of both units have taken part in [[Atlantic Alliance|Alliance]] actions since the Czech Republic entered NATO on 12 March 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yearbook 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Čadil|first=Jan|title=The Czech Air Force|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2013|date=7 August 2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force began to revise and update its doctrines and aircraft and the acquisition of a new, western fighter was considered. MiG-23MFs were retired in 1994, MLs in 1998 and [[MiG-21]]s were reestablished as an interim type for what was supposed to be a transition period before buying a new fighter – which was determined to be the Swedish [[JAS 39 Gripen]] multi-role fighter aircraft. Because of the devastating floods that hit the country during 2002, the deal was deferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/domaci/_zprava/349737|title=NKÚ: Vláda nezdůvodnila potřebu pronajmout gripeny|language=Czech|publisher=Rozhlas.cz|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Saab JAS 39 Gripen Czech Air Force.jpg|thumb|right|Saab [[JAS 39 Gripen|Gripen]] of the Czech Air Force]]

===2000s===
A new international tender was issued for an interim solution. Gripen again won this tender among six different bidders as the Czech Republic accepted a government-to-government 10-year lease from [[Sweden]] that did not involve [[BAE Systems]]. Media allegations of BAE Systems kickbacks to decision makers during the original sales effort have led nowhere in judicial inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/273008-kauza-gripenu-po-12-letech-konci-za-udajnou-korupci-nikdo-obvinen-nebude/|title=Kauza gripenů po 12 letech končí, za údajnou korupci nikdo obviněn nebude|language=Czech|publisher=Ceskatelevize.cz|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the Czech Air Force wanted to train helicopter pilots for desert conditions for the upcoming mission in [[Afghanistan]]. [[Israel]] was the only country that was ready to help out, as it saw this as an opportunity to thank the Czech Republic for training Israeli pilots and supporting Israel when it first became a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=350692|title=-|publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=12559|title=Czech Helicopters over the Negev Desert|language=Czech|publisher=Army.cz|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independence of the Czech Air Force was terminated on 1 December 2003 when the force became a part of newly established Joint Forces of the Czech Army with the command post located at [[Olomouc]]. Within the new structure the Air Force Commander-in-Chief was named as a Joint Forces Chief Commander Deputy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yearbook 2013&quot; /&gt;

===2010s===
The Air Force operated within this structure until 30 June 2013. Within the framework of the reorganisation of the Army, on  1 July 2013 the independent [[Command (military formation)|High Command]] of the Czech Air Force ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Velitelství vzdušných sil'') was established, [[Headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Prague]] with new Commander in Chief [[Brigadier general|Brigadier General]] Libor Štefánik.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yearbook 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Čadil|first=Jan|title=The Czech Air Force|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2014|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Gripen contract due to expire in 2015, speculation mounted about whether that leasing agreement will be renewed or another type of fighter plane chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modernization&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Air Force Modernization|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/cz-af-modernization.htm|website=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech government expected a tender to be organised to provide a force of 18 supersonic fighters after 2015. The [[JAS-39 Gripen]] was generally accepted as the most effective option owing to the existing infrastructure, the availability of trained personnel and previous good operational experience. However, the background of the existing contract – specifically the broadly discussed issue of alleged corruption – prevented politicians from settling for this quick solution, favouring instead a general tender with more bidders offering such types as the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15SE]] or [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceskenoviny.cz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/zpravy/613856|title=-|publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/armada-zvazuje-najem-ci-nakup-az-osmnacti-stihacek-fsl-/ln_domov.asp?c=A110324_080238_ln_domov_mc|title=Armáda zvažuje nájem či nákup až osmnácti stíhaček|publisher=Lidovky.cz|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:L-159 ALCA Czech Air Force.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aero L-159 Alca|Aero Vodochody L-159A]] Advanced Light Combat Aircraft of the Czech Air Force]]
The creation of a non-supersonic air force has also been discussed as an option, owing to the perceived high costs and limited usefulness of keeping supersonic assets in a country surrounded by allied countries (all are [[Member state of the European Union|European Union members]] and [[Member states of NATO|NATO members]], except [[Austria]]). In this scenario the subsonic [[L-159]] would become the backbone of the air force. The latest 2011 White Book clearly states that the supersonic fleet is to be continued for the protection of the Czech Republic and for co-operation within the NATO Integrated Air Defence System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/ministr-a-ministerstvo/odkazy/odkazy-46088|title=České strategické dokumenty|publisher=Army.cz|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a number of close support helicopters [[Mi-24|Mi-24/35]] will be decommissioned (the Mi-35 will even be sold before the end of its operational life). Twelve single-seat and two twin-seat aircraft are viewed as sufficient for patrolling the Czech Republic, while 18 can support the sentry role in other NATO countries. A preliminary RFI requested 18 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceskenoviny.cz&quot;/&gt; The White Book specifies the 12+2 solution, requiring strategic requirements for the supersonic air force to be specified by November 2011.

On 16 May 2014, the director general of the Swedish defence and export agency FXM and the Czech deputy defence minister for defence acquisitions signed the &quot;Annex prolonging agreement of lease of the JAS-39 Gripen aircraft&quot;, ensuring also the continuous upgrading and increasing the capabilities of these machines. The Swedish [[supersonic aircraft]] will equip the Czech Air Force until 2027 with an [[Option (aircraft purchasing)|option]] for further two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=I am happy that the Gripens carry on|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2014|page=18|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Czech Army, the Air Force's Yak-40s are due to retire between 2016 and 2017 and be replaced by CASA C-295s or another aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanovisko&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Růžičková|first1=Jana|title=Stanovisko AČR k článku v E15 ohledně pořízení dvou letounů CASA|url=http://www.acr.army.cz/informacni-servis/zpravodajstvi/stanovisko-acr-k-clanku-v-e15-ohledne-porizeni-dvou-letounu-casa-108847/|website=Armáda České republiky|publisher=acr.army.cz|accessdate=22 April 2015|language=Czech|trans-title=Statement of the Czech Armed Forces regarding E15 article about the purchase of two CASA aircraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modernizace vrtulníků i nové radary: Armáda dá na vzdušné síly miliardy|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/308716-modernizace-vrtulniku-i-nove-radary-armada-da-na-vzdusne-sily-miliardy/|website=ČT24|publisher=Česká televize|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech Defense Minister [[Martin Stropnický]] has unveiled plans to replace [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-designed military equipment with new weapons and to acquire helicopters and radars for the Czech Air Force, with tenders expected to be launched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Military To Buy Helos, Vehicles, Radar|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/2015/01/27/czech-military-procurement-helicopters-vehicles-radar-stropnicky/22415825/|website=DefenseNews|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Military To Purchase Helicopters, Vehicles, Radar|url=https://www.defenseworld.net/news/12032/Czech_Military_To_Purchase_Helicopters__Vehicles__Radar#.VTiaRCHtmko|website=Defense World|publisher=Digitalwriters Media|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CzAF-NATO cooperation==
Since the Czech Republic joined the [[NATO]], the regular participation at a number of Alliance's [[Military exercise|international exercises]] became a matter of course for the Czech Air Force. In 2009, the Czech Republic concluded an agreement regarding the [[cross-border]] collaboration and training with neighbouring [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cross Border training|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2014|page=40|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO Tiger Association===
[[File:We are prepared for the NATO Tiger Meet! (5693018996).jpg|thumb|Gripen prepared for the Tiger Meet]]
In 2002, the NATO Tiger Meet has been held at Portuguese Beja air base. The 331st Helicopter Squadron was honored there by proclaiming it as the full member of the [[NATO Tiger Association]]. The squadron also received the most prestigious trophy, the Silver Tiger. With new 221st Helicopter Squadron designation the unit continues, rejuvenated by new incoming members, in Tiger tradition until today.

After the deployment of new [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|JAS-39 Gripen]] fighters in 2005, four Gripens took part in the NATO Tiger Meet for the first time in 2008 at [[France|French]] [[Landivisiau]]. In 2010, the 211st Tactical Squadron has been accepted as the NATO Tiger Association full member at [[Volkel Air Base]] and it has been awarded by a Silver Tiger Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tigers in Czechia are Twenty|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2011|page=25|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AWACS===
In 2011, the Czech Republic became the eighteenth country taking part in the NATO [[Airborne Early Warning and Control]] (NAEW&amp;C) programme. Taking part in that international initiative means for Czech Air Force members an active participation in [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] operations. A participation on the NAEW&amp;C programme will cost the Czech Republic some 90 million [[Czech koruna|CZK]] a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Czechs are flying with the AWACS|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2011|page=12|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign deployments==

===Afghanistan===
[[File:TF HIPPO.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Emblem of the Task Force Hippo]]
[[File:Mi-17 CZ 9887 LKCV.jpg|thumb|[[Mil Mi-17|Mil Mi-171Sh]] of the Czech Air Force]]
In December 2009, the Czech Air Force members started to build-up a rear for their new helicopter unit to be deployed in [[Afghanistan]]. After that the first three modernized [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-171Sh]] helicopters armed for self-defense with [[PK machine gun|PKM machine guns]] were air-transported to Afghanistan by [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan]] [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]] on 5 January 2010. To the FOB [[Sharana, Afghanistan|Sharana]] permanent forward operational base all helicopters and unit members numbering 110 soldiers were flown on 17 January 2010. The Czech helicopter unit known as Task Force Hippo was ranged under Alliance Regional Command East. TF Hippo entered [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] operations on 25 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Task Force Hippo in the second year|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2011|page=18|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mise.army.cz/aktualni-mise/afghanistan-sarana/zpravodajstvi/strelby-z-palubnich-zbrani-vrtulniku-mi-171s-v-afghanistanu-15869/ |title = Střelby z palubních zbraní vrtulníků Mi-171Š v Afghánistánu |last = Mikulka |first = Zdeněk |publisher = Ministerstvo obrany |date = 19 February 2010 |work = Zahraniční mise |accessdate= 16 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first advisory group of the Czech Air Force was sent to Afghanistan in April 2008. Involved then there were members of the 231st of the time and the recent 221st Helicopter Squadron who have been tasked to participate in an establishment of the new [[Afghan National Army]]. As a part of the international [[Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team]] (OMLT) they started to work as instructors during training of Afghan [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24]] [[attack helicopter]] crews and in the same way to train ground personnel.

A new Czech team was added to the deployment in 2010. The new Czech group consisted of pilots and technicians from the 243rd Helicopter Squadron, respectively from the 24th Transport Air Base at [[Prague 19|Prague-Kbely]]. The main task of Kbely AMT (Air Mentoring Team) section has been defined as air training of Afghan [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17/Mi-171]] transport helicopter crews.

The Czech Republic also provided a material help to [[Afghan Air Force]] which included supplies of aviation equipment – six Mi-17 transport helicopters and six Mi-24 attack helicopters. After selected helicopters underwent major overhauls and modernizations all have been presented to the Afghan National Army during the 2007-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Czech AMT reinforcement in Afghanistan|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2011|page=40|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltics===
[[File:EYSA (8697649149).jpg|right|thumb|Gripen during the 2012 BAP]]
The Czech Republic first joined the BAP ([[Baltic Air Policing]]) mission from 1 May until 31 August 2009 when four-Gripen contingent was based in [[Baltic region]]. The second mission of the task force took place from 1 September 2012 until 4 January 2013. The main task of the Baltic Air Policing 2012 mission was to ensure protection of the [[airspace]] over the land and water territory of the three [[Baltic states]] – [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]]. The whole mission was a part of NATINADS, operating from the [[Šiauliai International Airport|Šiauliai Air Base]] in Lithuania. Remaining Czech Air Force Gripens were also in a [[24/7 service|24/7 readiness]] on their home base at [[Čáslav]].

[[File:Nykodym DSC03235A (15094753595).jpg|left|thumb|Czech CASA C-295M]]
One of the most important tasks of the Czech [[Military transport aircraft|military transport]] aviation in recent years is to provide support to the international MFO ([[Multinational Force and Observers]]) [[Peacekeeping|peace mission]] at the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. A small unit with one transport [[EADS CASA C-295|C-295M]] [[turboprop]] belonging to the equipment of the 24th Transport Air Base at [[Prague 19|Prague-Kbely]] has operated there since early November 2013 and contributes to the surveillance and monitoring the peace agreement between [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]]. The command of the MFO already asked the Czech side for extending its stay for the coming years 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Czech C-295M at Sinai|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2014|page=12|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
In relation to the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] the Government of the [[Czech Republic]] decided to provide help to the Ukrainian people. The first large-scale evacuation took place on 27 February 2014, when two aircraft departed the 24th Transport Air Base at [[Prague 19|Prague-Kbely]] for [[Kiev]], Ukraine. The [[Airbus A320 family|A319CJ]] was fitted with two PTUs (Patient Transport Units) and two [[stretcher]]s, the [[EADS CASA C-295|C-295M]] carried one PTU and 12 stretchers. The aircraft brought 27 Ukrainian citizens to the Czech Republic. Medical care was provided during the flight by a team of military medical personnel from the Centre of the aviation rescue service at [[Líně|Plzeň-Líně]] and from the Central Military Hospital in Prague. The second [[Medical evacuation|MEDEVAC]] mission took place on 6 March 2014, when one C-295M brought to the Czech Republic further 11 wounded persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=MEDEVAC helps abroad|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2014|page=46|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
