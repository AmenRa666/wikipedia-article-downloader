[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1975-021-20, Belgien, Brüssel, Parade vor dem Schloss.jpg|thumb|German cavalry parade past the [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]] in Brussels shortly after the invasion, May 1940.]]
The '''German occupation of Belgium''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Occupation allemande}}, {{lang-nl|Duitse bezetting}}) during [[World War II]] began on 28 May 1940 when the Belgian army surrendered to German forces and lasted until [[Belgium in World War II#Liberation|Belgium's liberation]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] between September 1944 and February 1945. It was [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|the second time]] that Germany had occupied Belgium in under thirty years.

After the success of the invasion, [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|a military administration]] was established in Belgium, bringing the territory under the direct rule of the {{lang|de|''[[Wehrmacht]]''}}. Thousands of Belgian soldiers were taken as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and many were not released until 1945. The German administration juggled competing objectives of maintaining order while extracting material from the territory for the war effort. They were assisted by the Belgian civil service, which believed that limited co-operation with the occupiers would result in the least damage to Belgian interests. Belgian Fascist parties in both [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]], established before the war, [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated]] much more actively with the occupiers; they helped recruit Belgians for the German army and were given more power themselves toward the end of the occupation. Food and fuel were tightly rationed, and all official news was closely censored. Belgian civilians living near possible targets such as railway junctions were in danger of Allied aerial bombing.

From 1942, the occupation became more repressive. Jews suffered [[The Holocaust in Belgium|systematic persecution]] and deportation to concentration camps, as measures were taken against potential political opposition. Despite vigorous protest, the Germans deported Belgian civilians to work in factories in Germany. Meanwhile, the [[Belgian Resistance]], formed in late 1940, expanded vastly. From 1944, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Nazi Party]] gained much greater control in Belgium, particularly after the military government was replaced in July by a Nazi civil administration, the {{lang|de|''[[Reichskommissariat of Belgium and Northern France|Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich]]''}}. In September 1944, Allied forces arrived in Belgium and quickly moved across the country. That December, the territory was incorporated ''[[de jure]]'' into the Greater German Reich although its collaborationist leaders were already in exile in Germany and German control in the region was virtually non-existent. Belgium was declared fully liberated in February 1945. In total, 40,690 Belgians, over half of them Jews, were killed during the occupation and the country's pre-war [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) was reduced by eight percent.

==Background==
{{main|Battle of Belgium}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-382-0201-09, Belgien, Beaumont, Häuserruinen.jpg|thumb|War damage in the Walloon town of [[Beaumont, Belgium|Beaumont]] incurred during the fighting in May 1940]]
Belgium had pursued a policy of neutrality since its [[Belgian Revolution|independence in 1830]], successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent [[Belgium and the Franco-Prussian War|in the Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71). In [[World War I]], the [[German Empire]] invaded Belgium. During [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|the ensuing occupation]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the German army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium: A History|year=2002|pages=102–7|isbn=0-8204-5824-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As political tensions escalated in the years leading to World War II, the Belgian government again announced its intention to remain neutral in the event of war in Europe.&lt;ref name=neutrality1&gt;{{cite book|title=Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression|volume=I|chapter=10. Aggression against Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg|url=http://fundamentalbass.home.mindspring.com/x6860.htm|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military was reorganised into a defensive force and the country left several international military treaties it had joined in the aftermath of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Various authors|title=Belgium: The Official Account of What Happened, 1939–40|year=1941|publisher=Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|location=London|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Belgium/Belgium_1939-40/|page=9; 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began of defences in the east of the country. When France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Belgium remained strictly neutral while mobilising its reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Various authors|title=Belgium: The Official Account of What Happened, 1939–40|year=1941|publisher=Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|location=London|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Belgium/Belgium_1939-40/|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without warning, the Germans invaded Belgium on 10 May 1940. During the following [[Battle of Belgium|18 Days' Campaign]], the [[Belgian Land Component|Belgian army]] was [[Battle of the Lys (1940)|pushed back into a pocket]] in the north-west of Belgium and surrendered on 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Various authors|title=Belgium: The Official Account of What Happened, 1939–40|year=1941|publisher=Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|location=London|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Belgium/Belgium_1939-40/|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government fled to [[French Third Republic|France]], and later the United Kingdom, establishing [[Belgian government in exile|an official government in exile]] under pre-war Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yapou|first=Eliezer|title=Governments in Exile, 1939–1945|year=2006|location=Jerusalem|url=http://governmentsinexile.com/yapoubelgium.html|chapter=Belgium: Disintegration and Resurrection}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were responsible for forming a small military force made up of Belgian and [[Belgian colonial empire|colonial troops]], known as the [[Free Belgian Forces]] and which fought as part the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain, 1940–1945|last1=Conway|first1=Martin|last2=Gotovitch|first2=José|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|year=2001|isbn=1-57181-503-1|pages=81–5 and 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and governance==

Shortly after the surrender of the Belgian army, the {{lang|de|''[[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Militärverwaltung in Belgien und Nordfrankreich]]''}} (a &quot;Military Administration&quot; covering Belgium and the two French departments of [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais|Nord and Pas-de-Calais]]){{efn|The Nord-Pas-de-Calais region (with a population of around three million) fell under the jurisdiction of the [[Lille]] ''Oberfeldkommandantur'' and therefore under the Brussels-based ''Militärverwaltung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Lynne|title=Between Resistance and Collaboration: Popular Protest in Northern France, 1940-45|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2000|isbn=0-333-73640-0|pages=10–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the entire region remained ''de jure'' part of [[Vichy France]], all French laws had to be approved by the Germans before implementation. French government structures were preserved intact. Its border with the rest of France, along the [[Somme river]], was sealed off to all without official approval. The unification of historical [[French Flanders]] with Belgium may have been part of an ideological attempt to reunite the historical [[County of Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Lynne|title=Between Resistance and Collaboration: Popular Protest in Northern France, 1940-45|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2000|isbn=0-333-73640-0|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was created by the Germans with [[Brussels]] as administrative centre. Germany annexed [[Eupen-Malmedy]], a German-speaking region given to Belgium under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=Thomas J.|title=Belgium Leaves the War, 1940|journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]]|volume=41|issue=1|date=March 1969|page=55|jstor=1876204|doi=10.1086/240347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Military Government was placed under the control of General [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]], an aristocrat and career soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geller|first=Jay Howard|title=The Role of Military Administration in German-occupied Belgium, 1940–1944|journal=[[Journal of Military History]]|date=January 1999|volume=63|issue=1|page=99|doi=10.2307/120335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under von Falkenhausen's command, the German administration had two military units at its disposal: the {{lang|de|''[[Feldgendarmerie]]''}} (&quot;Field Gendarmerie&quot;, part of the {{lang|de|''[[Wehrmacht]]''}}) and the ''[[Gestapo]]'' (the &quot;Secret State Police&quot;, part of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]).&lt;ref name=NHdB19-20&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940–1950|work=Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, 1905–1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=Éd. Complexe|location=Brussels|isbn=2-8048-0078-4|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The section of the Military Government that dealt with civil matters, the {{lang|de|''Militärverwaltungsstab''}}, commanded by [[Eggert Reeder]], was responsible for all economic, social and political matters in the territory.&lt;ref name=NHdB19-20/&gt;

[[File:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation Belgium inset.png|thumb|left|Territory of the military administration established in 1940. It included the two French departments of [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais|Nord and Pas-de-Calais]] and all of Belgium except [[Eupen-Malmédy]].]]

Before leaving the country in 1940, the Belgian government had installed a panel of senior civil-servants, the so-called &quot;[[Committee of Secretaries-General]]&quot;, to administer the territory in the absence of elected ministers.&lt;ref name=NHdB19-20/&gt; The Germans retained the Committee during the occupation; it was responsible for implementing demands made by the {{lang|de|''Militärverwaltungsstab''}}. The Committee hoped to stop the Germans becoming involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory, allowing the nation to maintain a degree of autonomy.&lt;ref name=NHdB20-26&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940–1950|work=Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, 1905–1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=Éd. Complexe|location=Brussels|isbn=2-8048-0078-4|pages=20–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also hoped to be able to prevent the implementation of more radical German policies, such as forced labour and deportation.&lt;ref name=NHdB20-26/&gt; In practice, the Committee merely enabled the Germans to implement their policies more efficiently than the Military Government could have done by force.&lt;ref name=NHdB20-26/&gt;

In July 1944, the military administration was replaced by [[Reichskommissariat of Belgium and Northern France|a civilian government]] ({{lang|de|''Zivilverwaltung''}}), led by [[Josef Grohé]].&lt;ref name=NHdB19-20/&gt; The territory was divided into {{lang|de|''[[Reichsgau]]e''}}, considerably increasing the power of the Nazi Party and SS in the territory.&lt;ref name=NHdB19-20/&gt; By 1944 the Germans were increasingly forced to share power, and day-to-day administration was increasingly delegated to Belgian civil authorities and organisations.&lt;ref name=Conway16&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leopold III===
[[File:Leopold III - 25 Cents 1943.jpg|thumb|[[25 centimes (World War II Belgian coin)|A Belgian coin]] with the [[Monogram#Royal monograms|monogram]] of [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]], minted during the occupation.]]
{{main|Leopold III of Belgium}}
Leopold III became [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]] in 1934, following the death of [[Albert I of Belgium|his father]] in a mountaineering accident. Leopold was one of the key exponents of Belgian political and military neutrality before the war. Under the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]], the King played an important political role and served as commander-in-chief of the military, and personally commanded the Belgian army during the 18 Days' Campaign of May 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Various authors|title=Belgium: The Official Account of What Happened, 1939–40|year=1941|publisher=Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|location=London|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Belgium/Belgium_1939-40/|pages=32–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 1940, the King surrendered to the Germans alongside his soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mercer|editor1-first=Derrik|editor2-last=Burne|editor2-first=Jerome|title=Chronicle of the 20th Century|year=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|isbn=0-7513-3006-X|pages=529–531|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violated the constitution, as it contradicted the orders of his ministers, who wanted him to follow the example of the Dutch [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] and flee to France or England to rally resistance. His refusal to leave Belgium undermined his political legitimacy in the eyes of many Belgians and was viewed as a sign of his support for the new order.&lt;ref name=Conway30-2&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|pages=30–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was denounced by the Belgian Prime Minister, Hubert Pierlot, and declared &quot;incompetent to reign&quot; by the government in exile.&lt;ref name=Talmon150-1&gt;{{cite book|last=Talmon|first=Stefan|title=Recognition of Governments in International Law, with particular reference to Governments in Exile|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-924839-1|pages=150–1|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold was keen to find an accommodation with Germany in 1940, hoping that Belgium would remain as a unified and semi-autonomous state within a [[New Order (Nazism)|German-dominated Europe]].&lt;ref name=Conway30-2/&gt; As part of this plan, in November 1940, Leopold visited [[Adolf Hitler]], the ''[[Führer]]'' of Germany, in [[Berghof (residence)|Berchtesgaden]] to ask for [[Belgian prisoners of war in World War II|Belgian prisoners of war]] to be freed.&lt;ref name=church1&gt;{{cite web|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Feeding the Crocodile: Was Leopold Guilty?|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-138/898-feeding-the-crocodile-was-leopold-guilty|publisher=Churchill Centre|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was not reached and Leopold returned to Belgium.&lt;ref name=Conway30-2/&gt; This fueled the belief that Leopold, who had expressed anti-Semitic views before the war, was [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborating]] with the Nazis rather than defending his country's interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pierre|last=Havaux|title=Léopold III, l'impossible réhabilitation|newspaper=[[Le Vif]]|url=http://www.levif.be/info/actualite/belgique/leopold-iii-l-impossible-rehabilitation/article-4000270606454.htm|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0 Château Royal de Laeken.JPG|thumb|left|Modern view of the [[Royal Palace of Laeken]], where Leopold was imprisoned during the occupation]]
For the rest of the war, Leopold was held under house-arrest in the [[Royal Palace of Laeken|Palace of Laeken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alan|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth-Century History, 1900–1991|year=1992|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-051264-0|page=42|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, while still incarcerated, he married [[Lilian, Princess of Réthy|Mary Lilian Baels]], undermining his popularity with the Belgian public which disliked Baels and considered the marriage to discredit his claim to martyr status.&lt;ref name=Conway30-2/&gt; Despite his position, he remained prominent in the occupied territory, and coins and stamps continued to carry his portrait or monogramme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schloss|first=Andrew|title=Obituary for the Belgian Franc: Belgium's Post-War Political Landscape Reflected Through its Coinage|journal=[[American Numismatic Society|ANS Magazine]]|date=Summer 2004|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://ansmagazine.com/Summer04/Belgium|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While imprisoned, he sent a letter to Hitler in 1942 credited with saving an estimated 500,000 Belgian women and children from forced deportation to munitions factories in Germany.&lt;ref name=EBLeopold&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2009|title =Leopold III|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336691/Leopold-III}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1944, Leopold was moved to Germany where he remained for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=Gotovich398-9&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch| editor1-first=José| editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=André Versaille éd.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|pages=398–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his position, Leopold remained a figurehead for right-wing resistance movements and Allied propaganda portrayed him as a martyr, sharing his country's fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutry-Soinne|first=Tinou|title=Les Méconnus de Londres: Journal de Guerre d'une Belge, 1940–1945|year=2006|volume=1|publisher=Racine|location=Brussels|isbn=2-87386-483-4|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts by the government in exile to pursue Leopold to defect to the Allied side were unsuccessful; Leopold consistently refused to publicly support the Allies or to denounce German actions such as the deportation of Belgian workers.&lt;ref name=Conway30-2/&gt;  After the war, allegations that Leopold's surrender had been an act of collaboration provoked a political crisis over whether he could return to the throne; known as the [[Royal Question]], the crisis ended with Leopold's abdication in 1951.&lt;ref name=church1/&gt;

==Life in occupied Belgium==
[[File:Cartoon satirising fuel shortages in occupied Belgium.JPG|150px|thumb|Contemporary cartoon satirising fuel shortages in occupied Belgium. The man is saying: &quot;Amélie, I feel...all fired up&quot; to which the woman replies &quot;Great, because there isn't any more coal left&quot;.]]
Living standards in occupied Belgium decreased significantly from pre-war levels. Wages stagnated, while the occupying authorities tripled the amount of money in circulation, leading to rampant [[Inflation#Monetarist view|inflation]].&lt;ref name=NBB1914-1944&gt;{{cite web|title=1914–1944: Wars and Monetary Upheavals|url=http://www.nbb.be/pub/02_00_00_00_00/02_02_00_00_00/02_02_04_00_00/02_02_04_02_00.htm|work=History of the Belgian franc|publisher=[[National Bank of Belgium]]|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupying authorities tightly controlled which newspapers could be published and what news they could print.&lt;ref name=warpress1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Press under German Censorship during the Second World War|url=http://warpress.cegesoma.be/en/node/8|work=The Belgian War Press|publisher=[[Cegesoma]]|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers of pro-Nazi political parties continued to be printed, along with so-called &quot;stolen&quot; newspapers such as ''[[Le Soir]]'' or ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'', which were published by pro-German groups without their owners' permission.&lt;ref name=warpress1/&gt; Despite the tight censorship and propagandist content, the circulation of these newspapers remained high, as did the sales of party newspapers such as ''[[Le Pays Réel]]'' and ''[[Volk en Staat]]''.&lt;ref name=warpress1/&gt; Many civilians listened to regular broadcasts from Britain, so-called ''[[Radio Belgique]]'', despite being officially prohibited from December 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch|editor1-first=José|editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=André Versaille éd.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|pages=372–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Belgians continued their pre-war professions during the occupation. The Belgian cartoonist [[Hergé]], whose work since 1928 had contributed to the popularisation of comics in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Allied bombing===

Factories, ports and other strategic sites used by the German war effort were frequent targets of [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombers]] from both the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and American [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Many of these were located in towns and cities, and inaccuracy of the bombing resulted in substantial civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic situation==
The German government levied the costs of the military occupation on the Belgians through taxes, while also demanding &quot;external occupation costs&quot; (or &quot;[[Anti-communism|Anti-Bolshevik]] charges&quot;) to support operations elsewhere.&lt;ref name=occupationcharge1&gt;{{cite book|author=ECR-32 and EC-401|chapter=XIII: The Western Occupied Countries|title=Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression|volume=I|url=http://fundamentalbass.home.mindspring.com/x9293.htm|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Belgium was forced to pay nearly two-thirds of its national income for these charges, equalling 5.7 billion [[Reichsmark]]s over the course of the occupation.&lt;ref name=occupationcharge2&gt;{{cite book|author=ECR-86|chapter=XIII: The Western Occupied Countries|title=Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression|volume=I|url=http://fundamentalbass.home.mindspring.com/x9293.htm|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the [[Belgian franc]] was artificially suppressed, further increasing the size of the Anti-Bolshevik charge and benefitting German companies exporting to the occupied country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemkin|first=Raphael|title=Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation, Analysis of Government, Proposals for Redress|year=2005|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|location=Clark, N.J.|isbn=1584775769|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galopin Doctrine===
Before fleeing in May 1940, the Belgian government established a body of important economic figures, under the leadership of [[Alexandre Galopin]], known as the &quot;Galopin Committee&quot;.&lt;ref name=NHdB34&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940–1950|work=Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, 1905–1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=Éd. Complexe|location=Brussels|isbn=2-8048-0078-4|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galopin was the director of the ''[[Société Générale de Belgique]]'' (SGB), a company which dominated the Belgian economy and controlled almost 40 percent of the country's industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940–1950|work=Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, 1905–1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=Éd.

Galopin pioneered a controversial policy, known as the &quot;Galopin Doctrine&quot;. The Doctrine decreed that Belgian companies continue producing goods necessary for the Belgian population (food, consumer goods etc.) under the German occupiers, but refused to produce [[Materiel|war materiel]] or anything which could be used in the German war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Various|title=La Société Générale de Belgique, 1822–1972|year=1972|publisher=Société Générale|location=Brussels|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy hoped to prevent a repeat of World War I, when the Allies had encouraged Belgian workers to passively resist the Germans by refusing to work.&lt;ref name=SGB146&gt;{{cite book|last=Various|title=La Société Générale de Belgique, 1822–1972|year=1972|publisher=Société Générale|location=Brussels|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans instead deported Belgian workers and industrial machinery to German factories, benefitting their economy more.&lt;ref name=SGB146/&gt; The policy also hoped to avoid an industrial decline which would have negative effects on the country's recovery after the war; however, many viewed the policy as collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940–1950|work=Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, 1905–1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=Éd.

After the Belgian defeat, around 225,000 Belgian soldiers (around 30 percent of the total force mobilised in 1940)&lt;ref name=CLHAM/&gt; who had been made prisoners of war in 1940 were sent to prisoner of war camps in Germany.&lt;ref name=CLHAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceux de XIIIB: Recueil de Textes extraits du Mensuel de L'Amicale des Anciens Prisonniers de Guerre du Stalag XIIIB|url=http://www.clham.org/Compilations/Stalag%20XIIIB.pdf|publisher=Centre Liégois d'Histoire et d'Archaeologie Militaire|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of those in captivity (145,000) were Flemish, and 80,000 were Walloons.&lt;ref name=CLHAM/&gt; Most had been reservists, rather than professional soldiers, before the outbreak of war and their detention created a large labour shortage in civilian occupations.&lt;ref name=CLHAM/&gt;

==Repression==
[[File:Breendonk004.jpg|thumb|View of the entrance to [[Fort Breendonk]], a prison camp largely reserved for resistance members and political dissidents, near [[Mechelen]]]]

From 1941, the regime became significantly more repressive.&lt;ref name=Conway14/&gt; This was partly a result of the increasing demands on the German economy created by the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], as well as the decision to implement Nazi racial policies.&lt;ref name=Conway14&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From August 1941, the Military Government announced that for every German murdered by the resistance, five Belgian civilian hostages would be executed.&lt;ref name=SHaM182&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gildea|editor1-first=Robert|title=Surviving Hitler and Mussolini: Daily Life in Occupied Europe|year=2006|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=1845201817|page=182|edition=English|editor2-last=Wieviorka|editor2-first=Olivier|editor3-last= Warring|editor3-first= Anette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the German military command, the {{lang|de|''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]''}} (OKW), had advised a ratio of 50 civilians for every one German soldier killed, von Falkenhausen moderated the policy and decreed that the hostages be selected from political prisoners and criminals rather than civilians picked at random.&lt;ref name=SHaM182/&gt; The systematic persecution of minorities (such as [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]) began from 1942, and was also coupled with much stricter repression of Belgian political dissent.&lt;ref name=Conway14/&gt;

As part of the &quot;[[Final Solution]]&quot; from 1942, the persecution of Belgian Jews escalated.

Jews chosen from the lists were required to turn up at the newly established [[Mechelen transit camp]]; they were then deported by [[Holocaust train|train]] to concentration camps at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]].&lt;ref name=EHRI1/&gt; Between August 1942 and July 1944, around 25,000 Jews and 350 Roma were deported from Belgium; more than 24,000 were killed before their camps were liberated by the Allies.&lt;ref name=tele1&gt;{{cite news|last=Waterfield|first=Bruno|title=Nazi hunters call on Belgium's justice minister to be sacked|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8518997/Nazi-hunters-call-on-Belgiums-justice-minister-to-be-sacked.html|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was the celebrated artist [[Felix Nussbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Jews – Across Europe Murder of the Jews of Western Europe|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/09/europe.asp|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1942 and the introduction of the Star-of-David badges, opposition to the treatment of the Jews among the general population in Belgium grew. By the end of the occupation, more than 40 percent of all Jews in Belgium were in hiding; many of them hid by [[gentile]]s and in particular Catholic priests and nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michman|first=Dan|chapter=Research on the Holocaust: Belgium and General|editor1-last=Michman|editor1-first=Dan|title=Belgium and the Holocaust: Jews, Belgians, Germans|year=1998|publisher=Yad Vashem|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-308-068-7|edition=2nd|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were helped by the organised resistance, such as the {{lang|fr|''[[Comité de Défense des Juifs]]''}} (CDJ), which provided food and safe housing.

===Political dissent===

Because of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi-Soviet Pact]], signed in 1939, the [[Communist Party of Belgium|Communist Party]] was briefly tolerated in the early stages of the occupation.&lt;ref name=VanDoorslaar1/&gt; Coinciding with the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 however, the Germans rounded up a large number of Communists (identified in [[Belgian State Security Service|police]] dossiers compiled before the war) in an operation codenamed &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; (''Sommersonnenwende'').&lt;ref name=VanDoorslaar1/&gt; In September 1942, the Germans arrested over 400 workers which they feared were plotting a large-scale strike action.&lt;ref name=Gotovich220-1/&gt;

[[File:Uniform of a Belgian political prisoner in Dachau.jpg|thumb|200px|Uniform of a prisoner in [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. The [[Nazi concentration camp badges|red triangle]] (with the letter &quot;B&quot;) identifies the wearer as a political prisoner from Belgium.]]
Many important politicians who had opposed the Nazis before the war were arrested and deported to concentration camps in Germany and German-occupied Poland, as part of the {{lang|de|''[[Nacht und Nebel]]''}} (literally &quot;Night and Fog&quot;) decree. Among them was the 71-year-old [[Paul-Émile Janson]] who had served as [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] between 1937 and 1938.&lt;ref name=NDB1&gt;{{cite book|author=Delzenne, Yves-William; Houyoux, Jean (dir.)|title=Le Nouveau Dictionnaire des Belges|volume=2: I-Z|publisher=Éd.

[[Albert Guérisse]] (one of the leading members of the &quot;Pat&quot; escape line) was imprisoned at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and briefly served as president of the camp's &quot;International Prisoners' Committee&quot; after its liberation by the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Alan J.|title=Captivity, Flight, and Survival in World War II|location=Westport|publisher=Praeger|year=2000|pages=10–1|isbn=0-275-96955-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the German army had requisitioned a former Belgian army [[Fort Breendonk|fort at Breendonk]] and transformed it into an {{lang|de|''Anhaltelager''}} or prison camp.&lt;ref name=Gotovich71&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch| editor1-first=José|editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=André Versaille éd.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the prison camp was used for detaining Jews, but from 1941 most of those detained at Breendonk were political prisoners or captured members of the resistance.&lt;ref name=Gotovich71/&gt; Though it was reasonably small, the camp was infamous for its poor conditions and high death rate. It was also where summary executions of hostages as reprisals for resistance actions occurred.&lt;ref name=Gotovich71/&gt; Unusually, Breendonk was mainly guarded by Flemish collaborators of the {{lang|nl|''Vlaamse SD-wacht''}}, rather than German soldiers.&lt;ref name=NHdB79-86/&gt; Prisoners were often tortured, or even mauled by [[Philipp Schmitt|the camp commander]]'s dog, and forced to move tonnes of earth around the fort by hand. Many were summarily executed and still more died as a result of the conditions at the camp. Of the 3,500 people incarcerated in Breendonk between November 1942 and April 1943, around 300 people were killed in the camp itself with at least 84 dying as a result of deprivation or torture.&lt;ref name=Gotovich71/&gt; Few inmates remained long in Breendonk itself and were sent on to larger concentration camps in Germany.&lt;ref name=Gotovich71/&gt;

==Collaboration==
Both Flanders and Wallonia had right-wing Fascist parties which had been established in the 1930s, often with their own newspapers and paramilitary organisations. All had supported the Belgian policy of neutrality before the war, but after the start of the occupation began to collaborate actively with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Various authors|title=Belgium: The Official Account of What Happened, 1939–40|year=1941|publisher=Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|location=London|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Belgium/Belgium_1939-40/|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their different ideological backgrounds, they often differed with the Nazis on a variety of ideological issues such as the role of [[Catholicism]] or the status of Flanders. Though allowed more freedom than other political groups, the Germans did not fully trust these organisations and, even by the end of 1941, identified them as a potential &quot;threat to state security&quot;.&lt;ref name=VanDoorslaar1/&gt;

After the war, 53,000 Belgian citizens (0.6 percent of the population) were found guilty of collaboration, providing the only estimate of the number involved during the period.&lt;ref name=NHdB79-86&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940–1950|work=Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, 1905–1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=Éd.

By 1944, Belgian collaborationist groups began to feel increasingly abandoned by the German government as the situation deteriorated. As resistance attacks against them escalated, collaborationist parties became more violent and launched reprisals against civilians, including the [[Courcelles Massacre]] in August 1944.&lt;ref name=Independent1&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=C.J.|title=Old wounds reopened, guilty memories revived: Collaboration in Belgium|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/book-review--old-wounds-reopened-guilty-memories-revived-collaboration-in-belgium--martin-conway-yale-pounds-30-1426688.html|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=3 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Flanders===
[[File:WardHermans.jpg|thumb|A VNV meeting in [[Ghent]] in 1941]]
Before the war, several Fascist movements had existed in Flanders. The two major pre-war [[Flemish Movement]] parties, the {{lang|nl|''[[Flemish National Union|Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]]''}} (VNV) and {{lang|nl|''[[Verdinaso]]''}}, called for the creation of an independent authoritarian Flanders or &quot;''[[Greater Netherlands|Dietse Staat]]''&quot; encompassing both Flanders and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerard|first1=Emmanuel|title=La Démocratie Rêvée, Bridée et Bafouée, 1918–1939|work=Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, 1905–1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=Éd.

During the occupation in World War I, the Germans had favoured the Flemish area of the country in the so-called ''Flamenpolitik'', supporting Flemish cultural and political movements. This policy was continued during World War II, as the military government encouraged Flemish Movement parties, especially the VNV, and promoted Flemish nationalists, like [[Victor Leemans]], to important administrative positions in the occupied territory.&lt;ref name=NHdB20-26/&gt; In turn, the VNV was important in recruiting men for a new &quot;Flemish Legion&quot;, an infantry unit within the {{lang|de|''Wehrmacht''}}, formed in July 1941 after the invasion of Russia.&lt;ref name=Gotovich241&gt;{{cite book

From 1942, VNV's dominance was increasingly challenged by the more radical DeVlag, which had the support of the SS and Nazi Party.&lt;ref name=Conway18&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeVlag was closely affiliated to the paramilitary {{lang|nl|''Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen''}} (&quot;General-SS Flanders&quot;), which was stationed in Belgium itself and involved in the so-called Antwerp Pogrom of 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saerens2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Saerens|first=Lieven |title=Vreemdelingen in een wereldstad: een geschiedenis van Antwerpen en zijn joodse bevolking (1880-1944)|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&amp;id=Ok-o6daGPDYC&amp;q=1941#v=snippet&amp;q=%22antwerpse%20pogrom%22&amp;f=false|page=674|accessdate=28 September 2013|year=2000|publisher=Lannoo Uitgeverij|language=Dutch|isbn=978-90-209-4109-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==
{{main|Belgian Resistance}}
Resistance to the German occupiers began in Belgium in the winter of 1940, after the German defeat in the [[Battle of Britain]] made it clear that the war was not lost for the Allies. Involvement in illegal resistance activity was a decision made by a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]].&lt;ref name=Conway21/&gt; If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchinson|first1=James Lee|title=Bombs away!: WWII Eighth Air Force Stories|year=2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington|isbn=9781438903668|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Céline|last=Préaux|title=La Gestapo devant ses juges en Belgique|location=Brussels|publisher=Éd.

Striking was the most notable form of passive resistance and often took place on symbolic dates, such as 10 May (the anniversary of the German invasion), 21 July ([[Belgian National Day|National Day]]) and 11 November (anniversary of the German surrender in World War I).&lt;ref name=Gotovich220-1/&gt; The largest was the &quot;[[Strike of the 100,000]]&quot;, which broke out on 10 May 1941 in the [[Cockerill-Sambre|Cockerill steel works]] in [[Seraing]].&lt;ref name=Gotovich220-1/&gt; News of the strike spread rapidly and soon at least 70,000 workers were on strike across the [[Liège (province)|province of {{not a typo|Liége}}]].{{efn|The official spelling for the province (and [[Liège|town of the same name]]) at the time was &quot;Liége&quot; with an [[acute accent]].

Active resistance in Belgium took the form of sabotaging railways and lines of communication as well as hiding Jews and Allied airmen. The resistance produced large numbers of [[Underground media in German-occupied Europe|illegal newspapers]] in both French and Dutch, distributed to the public to provide news about the war not available in officially approved, censored newspapers.

The resistance was never a single group; numerous groups evolved divided by political affiliation, geography or specialisation.&lt;ref name=Conway21&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of infiltration posed by German informants&lt;ref&gt;For instance [[Prosper Dezitter]], a spy who infiltrated several Belgian resistance groups, see {{cite web|title=German Intelligence Agents and Suspected Agents|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2005/highlights_march/march1/agents.htm|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archive (UK)]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant that some groups were extremely small and localised, and although nationwide groups did exist, they were split along political and ideological lines.&lt;ref name=Conway225&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ranged from the far left, such as the Communist {{lang|fr|''Partisans Armés''}} or Socialist {{lang|fr|''Front de l'Indépendance''}}, to the far-right, such as the monarchist {{lang|fr|''[[Mouvement National Royaliste]]''}} and the {{lang|fr|''[[Légion Belge (resistance)|Légion Belge]]''}}, which had been created by members of the pre-war Fascist {{lang|fr|''Légion Nationale''}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bosworth|editor1-first=R.J.B.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Fascism|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-959478-3|page=482|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as {{lang|fr|''[[Groupe G]]''}}, had no obvious political affiliation, but specialised in particular types of resistance activity and recruited only from very specific demographics.&lt;ref name=Conway21-23&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=The Sorrows of Belgium: Liberation and Political Reconstruction, 1944–1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969434-1|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberation==

&lt;!--{{main|Liberation of Belgium}} (not yet created, but planned--&gt;
In June 1944, the [[Western Allies]] landed in Normandy in Northern France, around {{convert|400|km}} west of the Belgian border. After fierce fighting in the areas around the landing sites, the Allies broke through the German lines and began [[Western Front (World War II)#Liberation of France|advances toward Paris]] and then [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|toward the Belgian border]]. By August, the main body of the German army in Northern France (with the exception of the garrisons of fortified towns such as [[Dunkirk]]) was openly retreating eastward.&lt;ref name=Gotovich246-7/&gt; As the Allies neared the border, coded messages broadcast on {{lang|fr|''Radio Belgique''}} encouraged the resistance to rise up.&lt;ref name=Gotovich246-7/&gt; The German civil administrator, Joseph Grohé, ordered a general retreat from the country on 28 August, and on 1 September the first Allied units (amongst them the [[5th Special Air Service|Free Belgian SAS]]) crossed the Belgian frontier.&lt;ref name=Gotovich249&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch|editor1-first=José|editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=André Versaille éd.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 4 September, Brussels was in Allied hands.&lt;ref name=Brussels1&gt;{{cite web|title=1944, the liberation of Brussels|url=http://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm/5562|work=History of Brussels|publisher=City of Brussels|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian government in exile returned to the country on 8 September and began rebuilding the Belgian state and army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Conway|editor1-first=Martin|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain 1940–45|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1-57181-503-1|page=61|edition=1st|editor2-last=Gotovitch|editor2-first=José}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold III's brother, [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders|Charles]], was appointed Prince-Regent while a decision was made about whether the King could return to his functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=D.D.|title=Le Prince Charles est nommé Regent de la Belgique|newspaper=[[Le Soir|Le Soir Illustré]]|date=27 September 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the German army regrouped and the Allies' supply lines became stretched, the front line stabilised along Belgium's eastern border. Areas in the south-east of the country remained in German hands, and were briefly recaptured during the German [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes Offensive]] in the winter of 1944. This no more than delayed the total liberation of the country and on 4 February 1945, with the capture of the village of [[Büllingen|Krewinkel]], the entire country was in Allied hands.&lt;ref name=Gotovich246-7&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch| editor1-first=José| editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=André Versaille éd.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|pages=246–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
