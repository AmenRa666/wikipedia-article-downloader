The '''Vought XSO2U''' was an [[United states|American]] observation [[floatplane]] developed by [[Vought-Sikorsky]] for the [[United States Navy]] during the late 1930s. Intended to replace the [[Curtiss SOC Seagull]] in service as a scout aboard cruisers, it proved superior to the [[Curtiss SO3C]] in evaluation, but failed to win a production contract due to Vought's lack of manufacturing capacity.

==Design and development==
In the late 1930s the United States Navy developed a set of specifications for a new scout-observation aircraft to operate from its [[cruiser]]s in the reconnaissance and [[gunnery spotting]] roles. Intended to replace the [[Curtiss SOC]] [[biplane]], the requirements included that the aircraft should have [[folding wing]]s, have a superior range and speed to that of the SOC, and that the new type should be powered by the [[Ranger V-770]] inline engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;&gt;Adcock 1991, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs were submitted in response to the Navy's specifications by [[Vought-Sikorsky]] and [[Curtiss-Wright]]. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's [[Vought OS2U Kingfisher|OS2U Kingfisher]], which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy [[battleship]]s, but had its [[monoplane]] wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt; In addition, the [[radial engine]] of the OS2U was replaced by an inline [[Ranger V-770]] in a squared-off cowling.&lt;ref&gt;Green 1967, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capable of being operated with either the float as a seaplane or with a conventional [[taildragger]] [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] as a landplane, the XSO2U utilised all-metal construction, with the exception of its [[Flight control surfaces|control surfaces]] which were fabric-covered. The wings folded to the rear for storage in a manner similar to that of the [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]], .&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

The aircraft was capable of performing [[dive bombing]], and could be fitted with a single bomb or [[depth charge]] on a [[hardpoint]] under each wing for the mission, or for [[anti-submarine warfare]]. Gun armament consisted of two [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 Browning]] [[machine gun]]s, one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using [[synchronization gear|synchronizer]] gear, while the other was in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==
Assigned the [[BuNo|serial number]] 1440,&lt;ref&gt;Baugher 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the XSO2U-1 flew for the first time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its first flight as a seaplane took place that December. Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability; the addition of a large [[ventral fin]], connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

The aircraft also suffered from engine problems, however, that were not so easily cured; the Ranger engine was well known for unreliability, and was particularly prone to overheating problems that were never satisfactoriarly solved. The aircraft's original XV-770-4 engine was replaced by a XV-770-6, with a repositioned oil cooler, during flight testing; despite this, the problems continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

Despite the engine issues, the SO2U-1 was considered overall to be superior to the competing [[Curtiss SO3C|Curtiss XSO3C-1]]; however, Vought's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U Kingfisher scout and [[F4U Corsair]] fighter. As a result, the XSO3C was declared the winner of the contract, and was ordered into production.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1979, p.419.&lt;/ref&gt; Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the [[Royal Navy]], the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service,&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt; and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pol&quot;&gt;Polmar 2004, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the [[flyoff]] competition, the XSO2U-1 was used as a general utility aircraft and [[hack (aircraft)|hack]] by the Navy, before being supplied to the [[Ranger Engine Corporation]] in July 1942 for use in tests of the V-770 engine. These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the [[Bell XP-77]] lightweight fighter and [[Edo XOSE]] floatplane, but the V-770 remained troublesome, and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy. Having no further use for the aircraft, the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy's rolls on 6 July 1944, being subsequently scrapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;
