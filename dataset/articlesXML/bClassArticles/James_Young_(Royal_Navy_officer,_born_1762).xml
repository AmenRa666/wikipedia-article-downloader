'''James Young''' (1762 &amp;ndash; 8 March 1833) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] who saw service during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], rising to the rank of [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|vice-admiral of the white]].

Young was born in 1762, the son of a naval officer. He followed his father, and an older half-brother, into the navy and was promoted to commander early in the French Revolutionary Wars while serving in the [[West Indies]] with [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]]. His first command was a [[fireship]], though he was also temporary commander of a 74-gun warship, before being promoted to [[post captain]] and given a [[frigate]]. He was successful in cruising against [[privateer]]s, and was given another ship, in which in late 1799, he was involved in the chase of two Spanish frigates, capturing one of them. They were found to be transporting valuable cargoes from the Spanish colonies, and their capture made the captains involved extremely wealthy men, with their crews also receiving huge sums of money comparative to their usual wages.

Young commanded a frigate in the Mediterranean for the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars, paying her off at the [[Treaty of Amiens|peace]]. He did not immediately return to service with the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, and it was not until 1807 that he commissioned a 74-gun ship and joined the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|expedition to Copenhagen]]. Promoted to flag rank towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Young was further advanced to vice-admiral in 1830, and died three years later with the rank of [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|vice-admiral of the white]].

== Family and first commands ==
James Young was born into a naval family in 1762, the son of the naval officer [[James Young (1717–1789)|James Young]], who would become an [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|admiral]], and his second wife Sophia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNBJY&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Young, James (1717–1789)|chapterurl=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30265/?back=,30285,30265,30285,30265,30285|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/30265  |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Young (1751–1821)|William]], his half-brother by his father's first marriage to Elizabeth Bolton, also embarked on a naval career and rose to be [[Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom]], with the rank of [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|admiral of the red]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Young, Sir William (1751–1821)|chapterurl=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30285/?back=,30285,30265|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/30285 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Young followed his father and brother into the navy, and after several years of service, was promoted to [[commander]] in 1794, shortly after the start of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], by [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= |title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|page=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been serving with Jervis in the [[West Indies]] prior to this, and on returning to Britain aboard ''Reprisal'', was given command of the [[fireship]] {{HMS|Comet|1783|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield369&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young briefly served as acting-commander of the 74-gun {{HMS|Zealous|1785|6}} from June 1795, after her previous captain, Christopher Mason, had been promoted to rear-admiral.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield51&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young went out to the Mediterranean, before returning to resume command of ''Comet''. He was promoted to [[post captain]] on 5 October 1795.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;

Young was given command of the 32-gun {{HMS|Greyhound|1783|6}} in 1796 and cruised in the North Sea, and then in the English Channel, where he was particularly successfully against [[privateer]]s, capturing the 16-gun ''Aventure'' off Cape [[Barfleur]] at 4.am on 19 December 1796 and ''Tartane'' off [[Beachy Head]] at 7.am on 18 February 1797.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield183&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aventure'' was a privateer [[brig]] carrying sixteen 4-pounder guns and a crew of 62 men, under the command of Citizen Peltier. She was two days out of [[Calais]] on her first cruise and had not captured any prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;UP&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= |title=The Universal Politician |page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tartane'' was also a brig, mounting sixteen 4-pounder guns and carrying 60 men, on a cruise from [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]]. She had not taken any prizes, and in his report on the capture, Young paid tribute to Captain Cheshire of the 18-gun [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Plover|1796|6}}, who having seen the chase, manoeuvred to cut off ''Tartane''{{'}}s escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;EM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= |title=The Edinburgh Magazine|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young commanded ''Greyhound'' until March 1797, when he took command of the 32-gun {{HMS|Unicorn|1794|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield132&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Ethalion'' and ''Thetis'' ==
{{main article|Action of 16 October 1799}}
[[File:Ethalion with Thetis.jpeg|thumb|right|HMS ''Ethalion'' in action with the Spanish frigate ''Thetis'' off Cape Finisterre, 16 October 1799, [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1800]]
Young's next ship was the 38-gun {{HMS|Ethalion|1797|6}}, which he took over in February 1799.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield136&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 3pm on 16 October 1799 ''Ethalion'' sighted three sails, and bearing up, discovered that they were two enemy frigates, being pursued by the 38-gun {{HMS|Naiad|1797|6}}, under Captain [[William Pierrepont (Royal Navy officer)|William Pierrepoint]].&lt;ref name=&quot;European&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= |title=[[The European Magazine]]|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young joined the chase, and the following morning the British were joined by another frigate, {{HMS|Alcmene|1794|6}}, under Captain [[Henry Digby (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Digby]], while a fourth frigate, {{HMS|Triton|1796|6}}, under Captain [[John Gore (Royal Navy admiral)|John Gore]], was also sighted, joining from astern.&lt;ref name=&quot;European&quot;/&gt; Pierrepoint signalled his intention to engage the foremost ship, leaving the sternmost for Young in ''Ethalion'', and at 7am the ships, now discerned to be Spanish frigates, separated. ''Ethalion'' pursued the sternmost frigate, exchanging fire from their stern and bow chasers, and after closing and firing two broadsides, the Spanish ship surrendered.&lt;ref name=&quot;European&quot;/&gt; She was discovered to be the 36-gun ''Thetis'', carrying 12- and 6-pdr guns and with a crew of 250, under the command of Don Juan de Mendoza. She was bound from [[Veracruz]] to a Spanish port, carrying a cargo of 1,411,526 dollars and cocoa.&lt;ref name=&quot;European&quot;/&gt; ''Ethalion'' suffered no casualties during the chase, while there was one man killed and nine wounded aboard ''Thetis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;European&quot;/&gt;  Meanwhile, ''Naiad'', in company with ''Alcmene'' and ''Triton'', chased down and captured the other Spanish frigate, which was discovered to be the ''Santa Brigada'', also carrying a valuable cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;European&quot;/&gt; Each captain received £40,730.18s. in prize money,&lt;ref name=&quot;European&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|A|a|none}} approximately £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|40730.9|1799|r=-4}}}} at today's prices.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

The sum paid out was so large that it was said that the crew of the ships involved roamed around [[Portsmouth]] with 'bank notes stuck in their hats, buying watches for the fun of frying them, and issuing laws that any of their crew who appeared without a gold-laced hat should be cobbed, so that the unlucky man who appeared in silver could only escape by representing that the costlier articles were all bought up, but he had compelled the shopkeeper to take money for gold lace.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Hannay133-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hannay |title=Admiral Blake |pages=133–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each seaman involved received £182 4s 9¾d, the equivalent of ten years pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodger&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodger |title=The Command of the Ocean|page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Pique'' and ''Valiant'' ==
Young took command of the 36-gun {{HMS|Pique|1800|6}} in June 1800 and commanded her in the Mediterranean for the remainder of the French Revolutionary Wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield153&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June 1801 he came across a large French squadron under [[Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume]], sailing to land troops in Egypt. The fleet pursued ''Pique'' for a time, but could not catch her. Young escaped, and then made his way to report the French movements to Admiral [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |title=The Naval History of Great Britain|volume=3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young sailed back to Britain to pay ''Pique'' off after the end of the wars, and arrived in port on 2 July 1802.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt; He does not appear to have returned to service after the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until April 1807, when he commissioned the new 74-gun {{HMS|Valiant|1807|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield72&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young went out with Rear-Admiral [[William Essington]]'s force [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|to Copenhagen in mid-1807]], arriving off the city on 7 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |title=The Naval History of Great Britain|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flag rank and later life ==
Young was promoted to rear-admiral in 1814, and to vice-admiral in 1830. He died at [[Barton End|Barton End House]], [[Gloucestershire]] with the rank of [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral of the White]] on 8 March 1833 at the age of 67.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt; He had married the daughter of Colonel (later Lieutenant-General) Fyers of the [[Royal Engineers]] while at [[Gibraltar]] in 1802. She was renowned as the 'beauty of the rock', and together the two had a large family.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;

Their second daughter, Sabine Anne Young, married Captain [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Tucker, John Jervis|John Jervis Tucker]] RN.
