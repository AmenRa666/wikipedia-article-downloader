'''Mersea Fort''', also known as '''Cudmore Grove Blockhouse''', was an artillery fort established by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] on the [[East Mersea]] coast in 1543. It formed part of the King's [[Device Fort|Device programme]] to protect against invasion from France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and defended the River Colne that led to the town of Colchester. It was triangular in shape, with earthwork walls and three bastions to hold artillery. It was demobilised in 1552, but was brought back into use several times over the next century and saw service during the [[Second English Civil War]] of 1648. The fort hosted an [[admiralty court]] to oversea the local oyster trade, until the dilapidation of the site forced the court to move to the Moot Hall in Colchester in the middle of the 18th century. A new gun battery was built at the fort during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], but the fortification then fell into decline and was extensively damaged by the construction of a sea wall along the coast. The remains of the earthworks were excavated by archaeologists between 2002 and 2003.

==History==
===16th – 17th centuries===
Mersea Fort was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the final years of the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Traditionally [[the Crown]] had left coastal defences to local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1987|p=111}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modest defences based around simple [[blockhouse]]s and towers existed in the south-west and along the [[Sussex]] coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were limited in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fort Mersea plan.jpg|thumb|left|Simplified plan of the fort]]
In 1533, Henry broke with Pope [[Paul III]] over the annulment of his long-standing marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was the aunt of [[Charles V of Spain|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, who took the annulment as a personal insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Hale|1983|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of England appeared certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hale|1983|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;[[Device Fort|device]]&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county of [[Essex]] was not a priority for new investment, but the town of [[Harwich]] was reinforced in 1539 and further new fortifications, including Mersea Fort, were built along the coast in 1543, under the direction of Richard Lee and Richard Cawarden, at an estimated total cost of £2,717.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colvin|Ransome|Summerson|1982|p=470}}; {{cite web | url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1013832 | title=Tudor Blockhouse 300m South of Mersea Stone| mode = cs2| accessdate=7 April 2016 | publisher=Historic England}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Money16thC|Comparing early modern costs and prices with those of the modern period is challenging. £2,717 in 1543 could be equivalent to between £1.26 million and £601 million, depending on the price comparison used. For comparison, the total royal expenditure on all the Device Forts across England between 1539 and 1547 came to £376,500, with St Mawes and [[Sandgate Castle]], for example, costing £5,018 and £5,584 apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biddle|Hiller|Scott|Streeten|2001|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Harrington|2007|p=8}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ | title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present| author1 = Lawrence H.

In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority all the way up to the top of the estuary.&lt;ref name=BritHistPhillips&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol9/pp264-269 | title=Fishery| author1 = A.

====English Civil War and Interregnum====
During the First English Civil War between the supporters of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Roundheads|Parliament]], Mersea Fort saw no action; after the victory of Parliament in 1646, the fort's garrison was demobilised.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;

===18th – 21st centuries===
[[File:Eastern Tip of Mersea Island - geograph.org.uk - 137919.jpg|thumb|The marshland around the fort, overlooking the estuary and Brightlingsea]]
By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; The fishery rules were reinforced by fresh legislation in 1758, which created a court of conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed to sit at the fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall.&lt;ref name=BritHistPhillips/&gt; Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking.&lt;ref name=BritHistPhillips/&gt; The fort was recommissioned during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the start of the 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9&amp;nbsp;kg) guns.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; After this the fort was abandoned once again.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; A [[sea wall]] was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort.&lt;ref name=FautleyGaron2005&gt;{{harvnb|Fautley|Garon|2005|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort.&lt;ref name=BritHistPhillips/&gt; A defensive [[pill-box]] was constructed at the castle during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=FautleyGaron2005/&gt;

In the 21st century, the remains of the site are protected under UK law as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland1&quot;/&gt; The site was [[archaeological survey|surveyed]] in 1982 and [[archaeological excavation|excavations]] were carried out between 2002 and 2003, analysing surviving timber structures that had been exposed by coastal erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/impact-07-10/impact07-10.pdf/ | title=Historic Environment Commissions Report: Impact| page =15| mode = cs2|date = 2011| accessdate=7 April 2016 | publisher=English Heritage}}; {{cite web | url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1013832 | title=Tudor Blockhouse 300m South of Mersea Stone| mode = cs2| accessdate=7 April 2016 | publisher=Historic England}}&lt;/ref&gt;
