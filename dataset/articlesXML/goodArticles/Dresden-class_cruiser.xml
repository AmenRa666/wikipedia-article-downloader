The '''''Dresden'' class''' was a pair of [[light cruiser]]s built for the [[Imperial German Navy]] in the early part of the 20th century. The class comprised {{SMS|Dresden|1907|6}}, the [[lead ship]], and {{SMS|Emden|1906|6}}. Both ships were laid down in 1906; ''Dresden'' was launched in 1907, and ''Emden'' followed in 1908. They entered service in 1908 and 1909, respectively. The design for the ships was an incremental improvement over the preceding [[Königsberg class cruiser (1905)|''Königsberg'' class]], being slightly larger and slightly faster, but with the same primary armament of ten {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} guns. ''Dresden'' and ''Emden'' were powered by [[steam turbine]]s and [[triple expansion engine]]s, respectively, as part of continued experiments with the new turbine technology.

Both ships served extensively on foreign stations; ''Emden'' was assigned to the [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Squadron]] from her commissioning, and ''Dresden'' was sent to Caribbean waters in 1913. ''Dresden'' was due to return to Germany for periodic maintenance shortly before the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, but this became impossible with the onset of hostilities. She therefore operated as a commerce raider, before linking up with ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' [[Maximilian von Spee]]'s East Asia Squadron. ''Dresden'' thereafter participated in the [[Battle of Coronel]] in November 1914 and the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] the following December. She was the only German vessel to escape destruction at the latter engagement, and she remained at large for several more months. ''Dresden'' finally put into the Chilean island of [[Robinson Crusoe Island|Más a Tierra]] in March 1915 owing to worn-out engines. A pair of British cruisers violated Chilean neutrality and attacked ''Dresden'' while she lay at anchor; the Germans scuttled their ship to prevent her capture.

''Emden'', meanwhile, had been detached from the East Asia Squadron to pursue an independent commerce raiding campaign in the Indian Ocean. She captured or sank numerous [[Triple Entente|Entente]] vessels, including the steamer [[SMS Cormoran (1909)|''Ryazan'']], which was converted into the [[auxiliary cruiser]] ''Cormoran''. In September 1914, ''Emden'' raided [[Penang]] and caught the Russian [[protected cruiser]] [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|''Zhemchug'']] and the French [[destroyer]] [[French destroyer Mousquet|''Mousquet'']] and quickly destroyed both ships. Shortly thereafter, ''Emden'' was caught by the Australian cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} off the [[Cocos Islands]] and forced to beach after a ferocious engagement.

==Design==
The two ships of the ''Dresden'' class were ordered in the 1905&amp;ndash;1906 construction program. Their design represents an incremental improvement over the earlier [[Königsberg class cruiser (1905)|''Königsberg'' class]]. They carried the same main battery of {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} guns on a slightly greater [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]]. Like the ''Königsberg''s, one ship&amp;mdash;''Dresden''&amp;mdash;was fitted with a [[steam turbine]] engine to compare its performance with the traditional [[triple-expansion engine]] in an otherwise-identical [[sister ship]].&lt;ref name=GG157/&gt; All subsequent designs of German cruisers utilized turbine propulsion systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, pp. 159&amp;ndash;163&lt;/ref&gt;

===General characteristics===
[[File:Dresden class cruiser diagrams Janes 1914.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Left elevation and deck plan as depicted in [[Jane's Fighting Ships]] 1914&lt;/center&gt;]]

The two ''Dresden''-class cruisers were {{convert|117.90|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|118.30|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.53|m|ftin|abbr=on}} forward. They displaced {{convert|3664|t|LT|LT|sp=us}} as designed and up to {{convert|4268|t|LT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Their hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames. The hulls contained thirteen [[watertight compartment]]s and had a [[double bottom]] that extended for 47&amp;nbsp;percent of the length of the [[keel]].&lt;ref name=G105&gt;Gröner, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships were good sea boats, but they were [[:wikt:crank|crank]] and rolled up to twenty degrees. They were also very wet at high speeds and suffered from a slight [[weather helm]]. Nevertheless, the ships turned tightly and were very maneuverable. In a hard turn, their speed fell up to 35&amp;nbsp;percent. They had a transverse [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|.59|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. ''Dresden'' and ''Emden'' had a crew of 18&amp;nbsp;officers and 343&amp;nbsp;enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one [[picket boat]], one barge, one [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[dinghy|dinghies]].&lt;ref name=G105/&gt;

===Machinery===
''Dresden''{{'}}s propulsion system consisted of two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] steam turbines, designed to give {{convert|15000|shp|kW|lk=on|0}}. ''Emden'', instead, was equipped with two triple expansion engines rated at {{convert|13500|ihp|kW|lk=on|0}}. Both ships had a top speed of {{convert|24|kn|lk=in}}. In both vessels, the engines were powered by twelve coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s. Both ships carried up to {{convert|860|MT|LT}} of coal, though their ranges were slightly different, owing to their different propulsion systems. ''Dresden'' could steam for {{convert|3600|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}, while ''Emden'' had a range of {{convert|3760|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. Electrical power was supplied by three [[turbo-generator]]s that provided a total of 125&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt]]s at 110&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s.&lt;ref name=G105/&gt;

===Armament and armor===
[[File:Emden-gun-3.jpg|thumb|One of ''Emden''{{'}}s 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm guns, preserved in [[Sydney, Australia]]]]

The ships were armed with ten [[10.5 cm SK L/40 naval gun|10.5&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/40 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were side by side aft.&lt;ref name=GG157&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The guns had a maximum elevation of 30&amp;nbsp;degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to {{convert|12700|m|yd|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. The ships were also equipped with eight [[5.2 cm SK L/55 naval gun|5.2 cm SK L/55]] guns with 4,000 rounds of ammunition. Both ships were also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]].&lt;ref name=G105/&gt;

The ships were protected by an armored deck that was up to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships with {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick sloping armor on the sides. The deck was reduced to {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} further aft and then again to {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} toward the stern. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the guns were protected by 50&amp;nbsp;mm thick shields.&lt;ref name=G105/&gt;

===''Dresden''===
[[Image:SMS Dresden before scuttling.jpg|thumb|''Dresden'', flying a white flag, moments prior to her scuttling]]
{{main|SMS Dresden (1907)}}

''Dresden'' spent most of her career on foreign stations. After her commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 as part of Germany's delegation to the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine &amp; Panetta, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to North American waters in late 1913, when she was stationed off the Mexican coast to protect German nationals during the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenz, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rebels' victory the following year, ''Dresden'' evacuated the former dictator [[Victoriano Huerta]] to [[Jamaica]], where the British had granted him asylum. In need of repairs, the cruiser was scheduled to return to Germany in July 1914, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] prevented this from taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ''Dresden'' operated as a commerce raider in South American waters in the Atlantic in the first months of the war before moving to the Pacific Ocean in September and thereafter joining [[Maximilian von Spee]]'s [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dresden'' participated in two major battles with the East Asia Squadron. The first, the [[Battle of Coronel]], took place in November, and ''Dresden'' engaged the British cruiser {{HMS|Glasgow|1909|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; The second, the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]], followed in December, where British [[battlecruiser]]s annihilated the German squadron; ''Dresden'' was the only vessel to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into [[Robinson Crusoe Island|Más a Tierra]] in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and she had almost no coal left for her boilers; the ship's captain contacted the local Chilean authorities to have his vessel interned for the duration of the conflict. There, she was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent ''Glasgow''; the British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans scuttled ''Dresden'' and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck remains in the harbor and was first surveyed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Emden''===
[[File:SMS Emden SLV AllanGreen.jpg|thumb|''Emden''{{'}}s wreck after the battle]]
{{main|SMS Emden (1908)}}

Following her commissioning into the fleet, ''Emden'' was assigned to the East Asia Squadron. In 1913, ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' (Corvette Captain) [[Karl von Müller]] became the ship's commander. At the outbreak of war, ''Emden'' was the only major German warship in [[Tsingtao]], the main German naval base in Asia. Müller immediately began to operate as a commerce raider, and captured one ship, the Russian steamer [[SMS Cormoran (1909)|''Ryazan'']]. ''Emden'' was thereafter ordered to rendezvous with the rest of Spee's cruisers.&lt;ref&gt;Forstmeier, pp. 2&amp;ndash;4&lt;/ref&gt; She remained with the East Asia Squadron for only a few days, as Müller convinced Spee to detach ''Emden'' as an independent raider in the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Forstmeier, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in the Indian Ocean in September, ''Emden'' captured several British merchantmen along the sea lanes from India to [[Aden]]. On 22 September, the ship bombarded [[Madras]], before resuming the hunt for merchant ships. She captured several more vessels, and then raided the port of [[Penang]]. There, ''Emden'' caught the Russian [[protected cruiser]] [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|''Zhemchug'']] in the harbor and quickly destroyed her. As ''Emden'' was departing, she encountered and sank the French [[destroyer]] [[French destroyer Mousquet|''Mousquet'']].&lt;ref&gt;Forstmeier, pp. 10&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Emden'' thereafter proceeded to the [[Cocos Islands]], where Müller intended to destroy a [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless]] station. The Australian cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} reacted to British wireless signals warning of the Germans' presence. After a fierce gunnery duel, ''Sydney'' caused serious damage to ''Emden'' and forced her to [[Beaching (nautical)|beach]] on [[North Keeling]] island. Most of her surviving crew, including Müller, were thereafter taken into captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Forstmeier, pp. 16&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck was eventually broken up ''[[in situ]]'' in the early 1950s by a Japanese salvage company, though parts of the ship remain scattered around the area.&lt;ref&gt;von Mücke, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;
