[[File:US T2 WW2 tanker Hat Creek.JPG|thumb|400px|The T2 tanker ''Hat Creek'' in August 1943]]

The '''T2 tanker''', or '''T2''', was an oil tanker constructed and produced in large quantities in the United States during [[World War II]]. After the [[T3 Tanker|T3]]s, they were the largest &quot;navy oilers&quot; of the period, some 500 being built between 1940 and the end of 1945. Post war many T2's remained in use, like other hastily built World War II ships pressed into peace time service there were safety concerns. As was found during the war, the [[United States Coast Guard]] Marine Board of Investigation in 1952 stated that in cold weather the ships were prone to metal fatigue cracking, so were &quot;belted&quot; with steel straps.&lt;!--wasn't this done to Libertys in the war?--&gt; This occurred after two T-2s, {{SS|Pendleton||2}} and {{SS|Fort Mercer||2}}, split in two off Cape Cod within hours of each other. Engineering inquiries into the problem suggested the cause was due to poor welding techniques. It was found the steel (that had been successfully used in riveted ship design) was not well suited for the new war time welding construction. The high sulfur content made the steel brittle and prone to metal [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] at lower temperatures.

==Designs==

===T2 design===
The T2 design was formalized by the [[United States Maritime Commission]] as its medium-sized &quot;National Defense tanker,&quot; a ship built for merchant service which could be militarized as a fleet auxiliary in time of war. MarCom subsidized the excess cost of naval features beyond normal commercial standards. The T2 was based on two ships built in 1938-39 by [[Bethlehem Steel]] for [[Mobil|Socony-Vacuum Oil Company]], ''Mobilfuel'' and ''Mobilube'', differing from the Mobil ships principally in the installation of more powerful engines for higher speed. Standard T2s were {{convert|501|ft|6|in|m|1|abbr=on}} in total length, with a beam of {{convert|68|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}. Rated at 9,900 tons gross ([[Tonnage|GRT]]), with {{DWT|15,850|long|disp=long}}, standard T2s displaced about 21,100 tons. [[Steam turbines]] driving a single [[Propeller (marine)|propeller]] at {{convert|12000|hp}} delivered a top speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}. Six were built for [[commerce]] by [[Sparrows Point Shipyard|Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard]] in [[Maryland]], only to be taken over by the [[United States Navy]] following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] as the [[Kennebec-class oiler|Kennebec class oiler]].

===T2-A design===
Keystone Tankships company ordered five tankers in 1940 from [[Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock]] of Chester, PA, based on the T2 but longer and with increased capacity; Marcom would designate this design T2-A. Bigger but faster, they were {{convert|526|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} in total length, displaced about 22,445 tons, and were rated at 10,600 tons gross with {{DWT|16,300}} — yet they attained a top speed approaching {{convert|16.5|kn|km/h}}. All five were requisitioned by the Navy during the war and converted to fleet oilers as the ''Mattaponi'' class.

===T2-SE-A1===
By far the most common variety of the T2-type tanker was the T2-SE-A1, another commercial design already being built in 1940 by the Sun Shipbuilding Company for [[Standard Oil Company]] of New Jersey. They were {{convert|523|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|68|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} abeam, with {{GRT|10,448|disp=long}} and {{DWT|16,613}}. Their (steam) [[turbo-electric transmission]] system delivered 6,000 shaft horsepower, with maximum [[thrust]] of {{convert|7240|hp}}, which produced a top-rated speed of about {{convert|15|kn|km/h}} with a cruising [[range (vehicle)|range]] of up to {{convert|12600|mi|km}}. After Pearl Harbor, the [[United States Maritime Commission]] ordered this model built ''en masse'' to supply U.S. warships already in accelerated production, and provide for the fuel needs of US forces in Europe and the Pacific, as well as to replace the tanker tonnage being lost at an alarming rate to German U-boats. 481 were built in extremely short production times by the [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Mobile, Alabama]], the [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Company]] at their [[Swan Island Yard]] at [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Marinship]] Corp. of [[Sausalito, California]] and the [[Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]] of [[Chester, Pennsylvania]]. During that period, average production time from laying of the [[keel]] to &quot;fitting out&quot; was 70 days. The record, however, was held by Marinship, which had the {{SS|Huntington Hills||2}} ready for [[sea trial]]s in just 33 days.

===T2-SE-A2 and -A3===
The T2-SE-A2 variation, built only by Marinship of Sausalito, was nearly identical to the T2-SE-A1 version, only with maximum thrust of {{convert|10000|hp}} rather than the former’s 7,240. The A3 variation was essentially an A2 built as a Navy oiler from the start, rather than converted later as many A2s were.

===T3-S-A1===

Despite the confusing T3 designation, the T3-S-A1s built by [[Bethlehem Sparrows Point]] for [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] were identical to the original T2s except for having less powerful engines of 7700&amp;nbsp;hp. 25 of this design were ordered by the Maritime Commission, of which five became Navy oilers as the [[Chiwawa class oiler|''Chiwawa'' class]].

== Notable incidents ==

=== Navy service ===
[[File:TankerSchenectady.jpg|thumb|300px|The new T2 tanker {{SS|Schenectady||2}} broke in two at its dock due to brittle metal and bad welding]]
*{{SS|Schenectady||2}}, broke in two in 1943.
At 11pm on 16 January 1943, a few days after completing her sea trials, the 501 ft long T2 tanker ''Schenectady'' broke in two amidships while lying at the outfitting dock in the constructors yard in Portland, Oregon, USA. The temperature of the harbor water was about 39°F (4°C) and water conditions were still. The air temperature was approximately 26°F (-3°C) and winds were light. The hull failure was sudden and accompanied by a report that was heard a mile away.

The ''Schenectady'', built by a [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipyard]], was the first catastrophic T2 hull failure, made all the more impressive by the still conditions under which it occurred. The failure of the ''Schenectady'' initiated on the deck between two bulkheads and ran down to the keel (see photo). A defective weld was present in a region of stress concentration arising at a design detail point. Poor welding procedures were cited by the committee investigating the failure as contributory; however, at that time the [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] problems were not fully understood.

=== Commercial service ===
*{{SS|Pendleton||2}}, broke in two on February 18, 1952
*{{SS|Fort Mercer||2}}, broke in two on February 18, 1952
*{{SS|Marine Floridian||2}}, collided with a drawbridge in Virginia in 1977
*{{SS|Marine Electric||2}}, foundered off the coast of Virginia in 1983
* ''Delta Conveyor'' sunk in the [[Mississippi River]] adjacent to Delta Bulk Terminal in [[Convent, Louisiana]].  Raised in two sections: the bow in early 2003 and the aft section in late 2003.&lt;!-- In 2003, the [[Marmac 300]] was used to raise one-half—the forward section of the sunken Delta Conveyor, &quot;a converted [[T2 tanker]] that [had sunk] in the Mississippi River adjacent to Delta Bulk Terminal in [[Convent, Louisiana]].&quot;  It was a {{convert|4000|ST}} lift, reportedly the largest lift ever accomplished on the [[Mississippi River]].  The task was accomplished by sinking the bow of the Marmac 300 into a {{convert|140|x|70|x|20|ft}} trench that was dredged into the bottom of the river before pulling the wreck onto the inclined barge using [[chain pullers]]. --&gt;&lt;ref name=idr200304&gt;
