{{historomania}}
The '''Wallachian Revolution of 1848''' was a [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Romantic nationalism|nationalist]] uprising in the [[Wallachia|Principality of Wallachia]]. Part of the [[Revolutions of 1848]], and closely connected with the [[1848 Moldavian Revolution|unsuccessful revolt]] in the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], it sought to overturn the administration imposed by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] authorities under the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, and, through many of its leaders, demanded the abolition of [[boyar]] privilege. Led by a group of young [[intellectual]]s and officers in the [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian Militia]], the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], whom it replaced with a Provisional Government and a [[Regent|Regency]], and in passing a series of major [[Progressivism|progressive]] reforms, first announced in the [[Proclamation of Islaz]].

Despite its rapid gains and popular backing, the new administration was marked by conflicts between the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|radical wing]] and more [[Conservatism|conservative]] forces, especially over the issue of [[land reform]]. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united [[Romania]].

==Origins==
{{main|Regulamentul Organic}}
The two [[Danubian Principalities]], Wallachia and Moldavia, came under direct Russian supervision upon the close of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]], being subsequently administered on the basis of common documents, known as ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]''. After a period of Russian military occupation, Wallachia returned to Ottoman [[suzerainty]] while Russian oversight was preserved, and the throne was awarded to [[Alexandru II Ghica]] in 1834—this measure was controversial from the onset, given that, despite the popular provisions of the [[Akkerman Convention]], Ghica had been appointed by Russia and the Ottomans, instead of being elected by the [[Sfatul boieresc|Wallachian Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.325&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the Prince was faced with opposition from both sides of the political spectrum, while also attempting to quell the peasantry's discontent by legislating against the abuse of [[Leasehold estate|estate lessors]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.325, 328–329&lt;/ref&gt; The first liberal movement, taking inspiration from the [[French Revolution]] and having for its stated purpose the encouragement of culture, was ''Societatea Filarmonică'' (the Philharmonic Society), established in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostility towards Russian policies erupted later in 1834, when Russia called for an &quot;Additional Article&quot; (''Articol adițional'') to be attached to the ''Regulament'', as the latter document was being reviewed by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.329&quot;&gt;Djuvara, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed article sought to prevent the Principalities' Assemblies from modifying the ''Regulament'' any further without the consent of both protecting powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.329&quot; /&gt; This move met with stiff opposition from a majority of deputies in Wallachia, among whom was the radical [[Ioan Câmpineanu]]; in 1838, the project was nonetheless passed, when it was explicitly endorsed by [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abdülmecid I]] and by Prince Ghica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.329&quot;/&gt;

Câmpineanu, who had proposed a reformist constitution to replace the ''Regulament'' entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation of activists, both Wallachian and Moldavian.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.329–330&lt;/ref&gt; The latter group, comprising many young [[boyars]] who had studied in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the ''[[Carbonari]]'' (and even, through [[Teodor Diamant]], from [[Utopian socialism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.330; Grenville, p.82–83; Stavrianos, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; It was this faction who would first explicitly publicize the demands for national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and European solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Frunzetti, p.11; Stavrianos, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; ''Societatea Studenților Români'' (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] for its honorary president.&lt;ref&gt;Frunzetti, p.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-revolutionary events and outbreak==
In October 1840, the first specifically revolutionary [[secret society]] of the period was repressed by Prince Ghica.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.330&lt;/ref&gt; Among those arrested and taken into confinement were the high-ranking boyar [[Mitică Filipescu]], the young radical [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], and the much older [[Dimitrie Macedonski]], who had taken part in the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|uprising of 1821]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.330; Giurescu, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rosenthal Rosetti Phrygian.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=1.27|[[Lithograph]] of a group portrait by [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]], showing Paris-based revolutionaries during the early 1840s. From left: Rosenthal (wearing a [[phrygian cap]]), [[C. A. Rosetti]], anonymous Wallachian]]
The new ruler, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], released Bălcescu and other participants in the plot during 1843; soon afterwards, they became involved in founding a new [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]-inspired secret society, known as ''Frăția'' (&quot;The Brotherhood&quot;), which was to serve as the central factor in the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.330–331; Giurescu, p.132; Stavrianos, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, ''Frăția'''s nucleus was formed by Bălcescu, [[Ion Ghica]], [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], and Major [[Christian Tell]]; by spring 1848, the leadership also included [[Dimitrie Brătianu|Dimitrie]] and [[Ion Brătianu]], [[Constantin Bălcescu]], [[Ștefan Golescu|Ștefan]] and [[Nicolae Golescu]], [[Gheorghe Magheru]], [[C. A. Rosetti]], [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]], and [[Ioan Voinescu II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.132&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; It was especially successful in [[Bucharest]], where it also reached out to the [[middle class]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.132&quot;/&gt; and kept a legal facade as ''Soțietatea Literară'' (the Literary Society), whose meetings were attended by the Moldavians [[Vasile Alecsandri]], [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], and [[Costache Negruzzi]], as well as by the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] subject [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunzetti, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; During the early months of 1848, Romanian students at the [[University of Paris]], including the Brătianu brothers, witnessed and, in some cases, took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|French republican uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.331; Stavrianos, p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebellion broke out in late June 1848, after ''Frăția'''s members came to adopt a single project regarding the promise of [[land reform]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution, which had initially caused dissension, was passed into the revolutionary program upon pressures from Nicolae Bălcescu and his supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot; /&gt; The document itself, destined to be read as a proclamation, was most likely drafted by Heliade Rădulescu, and Bălcescu himself was possibly responsible for most of its ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; It called for, among other issues, national independence, [[civil rights]] and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, [[responsible government]], a five-year term of office for Princes and their election by the Assembly, [[freedom of the press]], and [[decentralization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Proclamaţia de la Islaz (1848).jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The [[Proclamation of Islaz]]]]
Originally, the revolutionary grouping had intended to take over various military bases throughout Wallachia, and planned to simultaneously organize public gatherings in Bucharest, [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]], [[Ploiești]], [[Romanați County]] and [[Islaz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 1848, Heliade Rădulescu and Tell were present in Islaz, where, with the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest [[Popa Șapcă|Șapcă of Celei]], they revealed the revolutionary program to a cheering crowd (''see [[Proclamation of Islaz]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; A new government was formed on the spot, comprising Tell, Heliade Rădulescu, [[Ștefan Golescu]], Șapcă, and [[Nicolae Pleșoianu]]—they wrote Prince Bibescu an appeal, which called on him to recognize the program as the embryo of a constitution and to &quot;listen to the voice of the motherland and place himself at the head of this great accomplishment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot; /&gt;

The revolutionary executive left Islaz at the head of a gathering of soldiers and various others, and, after passing through [[Caracal, Romania|Caracal]], triumphantly entered [[Craiova]] without meeting resistance from local forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, the gathering comprised as many as 150,000 armed civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; As these events were unfolding, Bibescu was shot at in Bucharest by Alexandru or Iancu Paleologu (the father of French diplomat [[Maurice Paléologue]]) and his co-conspirators, whose bullets only managed to tear one of the Prince's [[epaulette]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.131–132; Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following hours, police forces clamped down of ''Frăția'', arresting Rosetti and a few other members, but failing to capture most of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot; /&gt;

==Provisional Government==

===Creation===

Early on June 23, Bibescu also attempted to regain the loyalty of his [[Wallachian military forces|Militia forces]] by an order to take a renewed oath of allegiance—the officers agreed to do so, but added that under no circumstances did they agree to shed the blood of Romanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon, the Bucharest populace, feeling encouraged by this development, rallied in the streets; around four o'clock, the [[church bell]]s on [[Dealul Mitropoliei]] began sounding the [[Wiktionary:Tocsin|tocsin]] (by banging their tongues on only one side of the drum).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.133&quot; /&gt; Public readings of the Islaz Proclamation took place, and the [[Flag of Romania|Romanian tricolor]] was paraded throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.133–134&lt;/ref&gt; At ten o'clock in the evening, Bibescu gave in to the pressures, signed the new constitution, and agreed to support a Provisional Government as imposed on him by ''Frăția''.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, p.85; Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.134; Stavrianos, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively disestablished ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'', causing the Russian consul to Bucharest, [[Charles de Kotzebue]], to leave the country for [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.134&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; Bibescu himself [[Abdication|abdicated]] and left into self-exile.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, p.85; Djuvara, p.331; Stavrianos, p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Verkündigung der walachischen Constitution am 27. Juni 1848.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.14|Proclamation of the Wallachian constitution, June 27, 1848]]
On June 25, the two proposed cabinets were reunited into ''Guvernul vremelnicesc'' (the Provisional Government), based on the Executive Commission of the [[Second French Republic]]; headed by the conservative {{Interlanguage link multi|Neofit II|ro|3=Neofit al II-lea}}, [[Metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia|Neofit II]], the [[Metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia]], it consisted of [[Christian Tell]], [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]], [[Ștefan Golescu]], [[Gheorghe Magheru]], and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant [[Gheorghe Scurti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.134&quot; /&gt; Its secretaries were [[C. A. Rosetti]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], and [[Ion Brătianu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.134&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; The Government was doubled by ''Ministerul vremelnicesc'' (the Provisional Ministry), which was dived into several offices: ''Ministrul dinlăuntru'' (the Minister of the Interior, a position held by [[Nicolae Golescu]]); ''Ministrul dreptății'' (Justice – [[Ion Câmpineanu]]); ''Ministrul instrucției publice'' (Public Education – Heliade Rădulescu); ''Ministrul finanții'' (Finance – [[C. N. Filipescu]]); ''Ministrul trebilor dinafară'' (Foreign Affairs – [[Ioan Voinescu II]]); ''Ministrul de războiu'' (War – [[Ioan Odobescu]], later replaced by Tell); ''Obștescul controlor'' (the Public Controller – [[Gheorghe Nițescu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.134, 135&lt;/ref&gt; It also included [[Constantin Crețulescu]] as President of the City Council (later replaced by [[Cezar Bolliac]]), [[Scarlat Crețulescu]] as Commander of the National Guard, and [[Mărgărit Moșoiu]] as Police Chief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.134&quot; /&gt;

The Wallachian revolutionaries maintained ambiguous relations with leaders of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], as well as with the latter's [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] adversaries in Transylvania. As early as April, Bălcescu, who maintained close contacts with many Romanian Transylvanian politicians, called on [[August Treboniu Laurian]] not to oppose the unification of Transylvania and revolutionary [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Romsics &amp; Király, p.102&quot;&gt;Romsics &amp; Király, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, secretive negotiations were carried out between [[Lajos Batthyány]] and Ion Brătianu, which were in connection to a project of creating a Wallachian–Hungarian [[confederation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Romsics &amp; Király, p.102&quot; /&gt; Although it drew support from radicals, the proposal was ultimately rejected by the Hungarian side, who notably argued that this carried the danger of deteriorating relations with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Romsics &amp; Király, p.102–103&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively, Romanian Transylvanians distanced themselves from the rapprochement, and clarified that their goal was the preservation of Austrian rule, coming into open conflict with the Hungarian revolutionary authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Maior, p.17–18, 320–321, 369; Romsics &amp; Király, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early reforms===

The following day, the new administrative bodies issued their first decrees. One of them instituted the horizontal tricolor with the inscription ''DPEПTATE – ФРЪЦIE'' (&quot;Justice – Brotherhood&quot; in [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]] as used at the time).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.134&quot; /&gt; It proclaimed all [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|traditional civil ranks]] to be destitute, indicating that the only acceptable distinctions were to be made on the basis of &quot;virtues and services to the motherland&quot;, and creating a national guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.134; Stavrianos, p.348&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.134; Stavrianos, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; The Government also abolished [[censorship]], as well as [[Capital punishment|capital]] and [[corporal punishment]], while ordering all [[political prisoner]]s to be set free.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.134; Stavrianos, p.348&quot; /&gt; In line with earlier demands, a call for unification of all Romanian-inhabited lands, as &quot;one and indivisible [nation]&quot;, was officially voiced during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, p.348, 349&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view was still only shared by a relatively small and highly factionalized section of the [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, p.349&lt;/ref&gt;

The official [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]] was sanctioned by a decree also issued on June 26.&lt;ref&gt;Achim, p.110; Kogălniceanu; Giurescu, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; This was the culmination of a process begun in 1843, when all state-owned slaves had been liberated, and continued in February 1847, when the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] had followed suit and set free its own Roma labor force.&lt;ref&gt;Achim, p.109; Kogălniceanu&lt;/ref&gt; The decree notably read: &quot;The Romanian people discards the lack of humanity and the shameful sin of owning slaves and declares the freedom of privately owned slaves. Those who have so far had the sinful shame of owning slaves are forgiven by the Romanian people; and the motherland, as a good mother, shall compensate, out of its treasury, whosoever shall complain of detriment as a result of this [[Christianity|Christian]] deed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kogălniceanu&quot;&gt;Kogălniceanu&lt;/ref&gt; A three-member Commission was left to decide on the matters of legal implementation and compensation for slave owners—it comprised Bolliac, [[Petrache Poenaru]], and [[Ioasaf Znagoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Achim, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities publicized their reforms by making use of new press institutions, the most circulated of which were ''[[Poporul Suveran]]'' (a magazine edited by Bălcescu, Bolliac, [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] and others) and ''[[Pruncul Român]]'' (published by Rosetti and [[Eric Winterhalder]]).&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.134–135&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the Bucharest populace could regularly hear public communiques read on the fields of [[Filaret, Bucharest|Filaret]] (known as the &quot;Field of Liberty&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes and intrigue==
[[Image:Rosenthal - Romania rupandu-si catusele pe Campia Libertatii.jpg|thumb|''Romania Breaking off Her Chains on the Field of Liberty'', painting by [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]] (a reference to the field of [[Filaret, Bucharest|Filaret]])]]
Support for the Provisional Government began to be tested when the issue of [[land reform]] and [[corvée]]s was again brought to the forefront. Aside from the important conservative forces, opponents of the measure were to be found inside the leadership body itself, and included the moderates Heliade Rădulescu and [[Ioan Odobescu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot; /&gt; Revolutionaries who favored passing land into the property of peasants were divided over the amount that was to be ceded, as well as over the issue of compensation to be paid to boyars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135; Kogălniceanu&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.135; Kogălniceanu&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was reached through postponing, with a decision taken to submit all proposals to the vote of the Assembly, which was yet to be convened, instead of drafting a decree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135; Kogălniceanu&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, a Proclamation to estate-holders was issued (June 28, 1848), indicating that the reform was to be eventually enforced in exchange for unspecified sums, and calling on peasants to fulfill their corvées until autumn of the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

This appeal caused a reaction from the opposition forces: Odobescu rallied to the cause of conservatives, and, on July 1, 1848, together with his fellow officers [[Ioan Solomon]] and [[Grigorie Lăcusteanu]], arrested the entire Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot; /&gt; The coup almost succeeded, being ultimately overturned by the reaction of Bucharesters, who organized street resistance against mutinied troops, mounted [[barricade]]s, and, eventually, stormed into the executive's headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; The latter assault, led by [[Ana Ipătescu]], resulted in the arrest of all coup leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot; /&gt;

Despite this move, disputes regarding the shape of land reform continued inside the Government. On July 21, 1848, Nicolae Bălcescu obtained the issuing of a decree to create ''Comisia proprietății'' (the Commission on Property), comprising 34 delegates, two for each [[Counties of Romania|Wallachian county]], representing respectively peasants and landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; The new institution was presided over by the landowner [[Alexandru Racoviță]], and had the Moldavian-born [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]] for its vice president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135; Kogălniceanu&quot;/&gt;

During the proceedings, a number of boyars had switched to supporting peasants: the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] boyar Ceaușescu, a delegate to the Commission's fourth session, made a celebrated speech in which he addressed laborers as &quot;brothers&quot; and deplored his own status as a landowner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.331&quot;&gt;Djuvara, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; An emotional audience applauded his gesture, and peasants proclaimed that God forgave Ceaușescu's deeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.331&quot;/&gt; Other landowners, more circumspect, asked peasants what they planned to use for compensation, for which they were to be largely responsible; according to [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], their answer was &quot;With these two slave's arms, we have been working for centuries and provided for all the landowners' expenses; once freed, our arms would work twice as much and rest assured that we will not leave you wanting of what the country's judgment will decide we should pay you&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kogălniceanu&quot; /&gt; This reportedly caused an uproar inside the Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kogălniceanu&quot; /&gt;

Peasants and their supporters advocated the notion that each family was supposed to receive at least four [[hectare]]s of land; in their system, which made note of differences in local traditional, peasants living in [[wetland]]s were to be assigned 16 ''pogoane'' (approx. eight hectares), those living in plains 14 (approx. seven hectares), inhabitants of hilly areas 11 (between five and six hectares), while people inhabiting the [[Southern Carpathians|Southern Carpathian]] areas were supposed to receive eight ''pogoane'' (approx. four hectares).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; This program was instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided that the ultimate resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135; Kogălniceanu&quot;/&gt; The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic efforts and regency==
[[Image:Entering of Soliman Pasha, 21 August 1848.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] envoy [[Suleiman Pasha (Ottoman general)|Süleyman Pașa]] entering [[Bucharest]] in August 1848]]
Faced with the clear hostility of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], Wallachian revolutionaries sought instead a rapprochement with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, p.85; Giurescu, p.135; Stavrianos, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to clarify that the movement did not seek to reject Ottoman [[suzerainty]]: for this purpose, [[Ion Ghica]] was sent to [[Istanbul]] as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abdülmecid I]] to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.135; Stavrianos, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suleiman Pasha (Ottoman general)|Süleyman Pașa]], Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to [[Bucharest]] with orders to report on the situation and take appropriate measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot; /&gt;

Warmly received by the city's inhabitants and authorities, Süleyman opted to impose a series of formal moves, which were intended to appease Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced the Government with a [[Regent|regency]], ''Locotenența domnească'', and asked for some changes to be operated in the text of the constitution (promising that these were to ensure Ottoman recognition).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot; /&gt; The new ruling body, a [[triumvirate]], comprised Heliade Rădulescu, [[Nicolae Golescu]], and [[Christian Tell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.135&quot; /&gt;

On Süleyman's explicit advice, a revolutionary delegation was dispatched to Istanbul, where it was to negotiate the movement's official recognition—among the envoys were Bălcescu, [[Ștefan Golescu]], and [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.135–136&lt;/ref&gt; By that moment, Russian diplomats had persuaded the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] to adopt a more reserved attitude, and to replace Süleyman with a ''[[rapporteur]]'' for the [[Divan]], [[Keçecizade Mehmet Fuat Pasha|Fuat Pasha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.136&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Russia ordered its troops in [[Bessarabia]] to prepare for an intervention over the [[Prut River]] and into Bucharest—the prospect of a Russo-Turkish war was inconvenient for Abdülmecid, at a time when the [[French Second Republic]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] failed to clarify their positions in respect to Ottoman policies.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.136; Grenville, p.83; Stavrianos, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|Stratford Canning]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the Ottoman Empire|British Ambassador to the Porte]], even advised Ottoman officials to intervene against the Revolution, thus serving [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]]'s policy regarding the preservation of Ottoman rule in the face of outside pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Grenville, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; The Wallachian delegation was denied reception, and, after a prolonged stay, had to return to Bucharest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.136&quot; /&gt;

==Metropolitan Neofit's coup==
[[Image:Arderea Regulamentului Organic şi a Arhondologiei.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.14|The burning of ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' and of the register of [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|boyar ranks]]]]
On July 11, 1848, the false rumor that the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]] had left Bessarabia and was moving southwards cause the regency to leave Bucharest and take refuge in [[Târgoviște]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.136&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after Russia had occupied Moldavia in April, a result of the [[1848 Moldavian revolution|unsuccessful revolt]] in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, p.85; Djuvara, p.331; Grenville, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; The moment was seized by conservatives: headed by [[Neofit II, Metroplitan of Ungro-Wallachia|Metropolitan Neofit]], the latter grouping took over, and announced that the revolution had ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.136&quot; /&gt; When a revolutionary courier returned from the Moldavian town of [[Focșani]] with news that Russian troops had not left their quarters, the population in the capital prepared for action—during the events, Ambrozie, a priest from the [[Bishopric of Buzău|Buzău Bishopric]], made himself the revolutionary hero of the hour and earned the nickname ''Popa Tun'', the &quot;Cannon Priest&quot;, after ripping out the lit fuse of a gun aimed at the crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.136&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome caused Neofit to invalidate his own proclamation, and to transfer his power back to the Provisional Government (July 12).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.136&quot; /&gt;

Over the following months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, just one week before the Revolution was crushed, crowds entered the Interior Ministry, taking over the official copies of ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' and the register of [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|boyar ranks]] (''Arhondologia'').&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.136–137&lt;/ref&gt; The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, in the public square on [[Mitropoliei Hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a [[curse]] on both pieces of legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot; /&gt;

On {{OldStyleDate|September 25|1848|September 13}}, Ottoman troops headed by [[Omar Pasha]] and assisted by [[Keçecizade Mehmet Fuat Pasha|Fuat Pasha]] stormed into Bucharest, partly as an attempt to prevent the extension of Russian presence over the [[Milcov River (Siret)|Milcov River]].&lt;ref&gt;Grenville, p.83; Stavrianos, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of that day, Fuat met with local public figures at his headquarters in [[Cotroceni]], proclaiming the reestablishment of the ''Regulament'' and appointing [[Constantin Cantacuzino (kaymakam)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] as ''[[Kaymakam]]'' of Wallachia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; While all revolutionaries who attended the meeting were placed under arrest, [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] and [[Christian Tell]] sought refuge at the British consulate in Bucharest, where they were received by [[Robert Gilmour Colquhoun]] in exchange for a sum of [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Austrian florins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot; /&gt;

The radical faction around Nicolae Bălcescu and [[Gheorghe Magheru]] had planned resistance on the [[Danube]], but their opinion had failed to rally significant appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; A group of several thousands soldiers, comprising [[Oltenia]]n ''[[pandurs]]'' and volunteers from throughout the land, rallied in [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]] under Magheru's command, without ever going into action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.137&quot;&gt;Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; In Bucharest itself, as Fuat prepared to lead his 6000 troops into the garrison on [[Dealul Spirii]], a 900-strong force led by a detachment of firemen met him with resistance, provoking a brief [[Battle of Dealul Spirii|battle]] that only lasted two and a half hours during which 158 Turks and 48 Romanians died and 400 Turks and 57 Romanians were wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot; /&gt; In the evening, the entire city had been pacified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, a Russian force under [[Alexander von Lüders]] joined the occupation of Bucharest, taking over administration over one half of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.137&quot;/&gt; Russia's expedition into the two [[Danubian Principalities]] was the only independent military initiative of her foreign interventions against the [[Revolutions of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;Grenville, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the events, 91 revolutionaries were sentenced to exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot; /&gt; Of these, a small group was transported by [[barge]]s from [[Giurgiu]], on their way to the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Svinița]], near the Danube port of [[Orșova|Orschowa]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.332; Frunzetti, p.18–20; Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionary artist [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]] and [[Maria Rosetti]], both of whom had been allowed to go free and had subsequently followed the barges on shore, pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of Svinița to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Frunzetti, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The escapees then made their way to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Frunzetti, p.21; Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

Most other revolutionaries were detained in areas of present-day [[Bulgaria]] until spring 1849, and, passing through [[Rousse|Rustchuk]] and [[Varna]], were taken to the [[Anatolia]]n city of [[Bursa|Brusa]], where they lived at the expense of the Ottoman state.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.332; Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; They were allowed to return after 1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; During their period of exile, rivalry between the various factions became obvious, a conflict which became the basis for political allegiances in later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.332&quot;&gt;Djuvara, p.332&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Magheru, upon the advice of Colquhoun,&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.331&quot;/&gt; ordered the [[demobilization]] of his troops (October 10), and, accompanied by a few of his officers, passed the [[Southern Carpathians]] into [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]]—at the time, the [[Transylvania]]n city was nominally in the Austrian Empire, but gripped by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot; /&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Wallachian activities in Transylvania===
Starting in December 1848, a number of Wallachian revolutionaries who had escaped or had been set free from arrest began mediating an understanding between Hungary's [[Lajos Kossuth]] and those Romanian Transylvanian activists and peasants who, under the leadership of [[Avram Iancu]], were mounting military resistance to the ''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|Honvédség]]'' troops of [[Józef Bem]]. Nicolae Bălcescu emerged from his refuge in the [[Principality of Serbia]], and, together with [[Alexandru G. Golescu]] and [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], began talks with Iancu in [[Zlatna]].&lt;ref&gt;Maior, p.334&lt;/ref&gt; The Wallachians presented Kossuth's proposal that Iancu's fighters should leave their base in the [[Apuseni Mountains|Apuseni]] and help rekindle revolution in Wallachia, leaving room for Hungary to resist Russian invention, but the offer was dismissed on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;Maior, p.334–340&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Magheru reached out to Hungarian authorities, asking them to consider confederating Hungary proper and Transylvania; this plan was also rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Maior, p.340–353&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 1849, Nicolae Bălcescu met with Kossuth in [[Debrecen]], and, despite his personal disappointment with the Hungarian discourse and his ideal of full political rights for Romanians in the region,&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.332; Maior, p.375&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to mediate an understanding with Iancu, which resulted in a [[ceasefire]] and a series of [[concession (politics)|political concessions]].&lt;ref&gt;Romsics &amp; Király, p.70–72; Maior, p.375–403&lt;/ref&gt; This came as Russian troops were entering Transylvania, a military operation culminating in Hungarian defeat at the [[Battle of Segesvár]] in late July.

===Political outcome===
[[Image:Theodor Aman - Proclamarea Unirii.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4545455|Proclamation of the Moldo-Wallachian union, painting by [[Theodor Aman]]]]
The Ottoman–Russian occupation prolonged itself until 1851, while the [[Treaty of Balta Liman|1849 Convention of Balta Liman]] awarded the Wallachian crown to [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, p.85; Giurescu, p.139; Kogălniceanu&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the 1848&amp;ndash;1849 setbacks, the period inaugurated by the [[Crimean War]] disestablished both Russian domination and the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, and, within the space of one generation, brought about the fulfillment of virtually all revolutionary projects.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.332; Giurescu, p.139; Kogălniceanu&lt;/ref&gt; The common actions of Moldavians and Wallachians, in pace with the presence of Wallachian activists in Transylvania, helped circulate the ideal of national unity, with the ultimate goal of reuniting all majority-Romanian territories within one state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1859, at the close of a turbulent period, Wallachia and Moldavia entered a [[personal union]], later formalized as the [[United Principalities|Romanian United Principalities]], under Moldavian-born ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] (himself a former revolutionary).&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.332&quot;/&gt; Having been allowed to return from exile after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], most of the surviving revolutionaries played a major part in the political developments, and organized themselves as ''[[Partida Națională]]'', which promoted Cuza during simultaneous elections for the [[ad hoc Divan|''ad hoc'' Divan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.140–141; Kogălniceanu&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Paris-based Wallachian ''[[émigré]]s'' in promoting sympathy for common Romanian goals was decisive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p.137&quot; /&gt; ''Partida'' succeeded in becoming the major factor in Romanian political life, before forming the basis of the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.333&quot;&gt;Djuvara, p.333&lt;/ref&gt; With Cuza's rule, the pace of [[Westernization]] increased, and, during the 1860s, a moderate [[land reform]] was carried out, monastery estates were [[Secularization of monastery estates in Romania|secularized]], while [[corvée]]s and [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|boyar ranks]] were outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.332–333; Giurescu, p.137; Kogălniceanu&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an 1866 conflict between the increasingly [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] Cuza and the political class, various trends organized a coup which brought [[Carol I of Romania|Prince Carol]], a [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], to the Romanian throne&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.333&quot; /&gt;—echoing a will expressed by some of the 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.333&quot;&gt;Djuvara, p.333&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, as a consequence of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], Romania proclaimed her independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djuvara, p.333&quot; /&gt;
