==Inconsistency==
A lot of this article is inconsistent. This includes data on the size of the Yemeni military and the amount of governmental military spending. [[User:Andyo2000|Andyo2000]] ([[User talk:Andyo2000|talk]]) 05:57, 14 November 2009


Yemen isnt poo country, its very rich but unfortunatly and cz of corruption its said to be poor......... &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:117.200.160.244 |117.200.160.244 ]] ([[User talk:117.200.160.244 |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/117.200.160.244 |contribs]]) 23:22, 9 April 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

you jokers never mentioned that yemen was defeated in the Hanish war and 200 yemeni prisoners were taken. eritrea only left the island after an international court decided the larger island belongs to yemen.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.89.24.67|213.89.24.67]] ([[User talk:213.89.24.67|talk]]) 11:49, 8 January 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==MAJOR CLEAN UP NEEDED==
This article needs major clean up the inventory of the military is extremely ridiculous most of the weapons mentioned there are completely false as they have never been and nor are being used by Yemen now or by any of its predecessor states, and what's more ridiculous is the numbers claimed to be in its inventory!!! like the M53/59 PRAGA SPAAG system, they claim that Yemen has 5000x of these when only 330-500 of them were ever produced and they were souley used by Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia and its successor states Libya was the only arab country to have a few of these in service and neither Libya nor the two countries which produced it ever exported arms to Yemen, so I'm totally intrigued to were are the people who wrote this article getting this number.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.31.57.185|62.31.57.185]] ([[User talk:62.31.57.185|talk]]) 13:14, 1 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I agree, I've been trying to get some sources for (in particular) the use of US equipment and Soviet what I can only assume is Soviet aid, on Global Security (the stated source) there is no record of equipment before 2005. The figures are just over-blown, if they are correct, it means that Yemen has more Armour than Kuwait which is far richer than Yemen and just under half the strength in Armour terms of Saudi Arabia to the north?!

==Article title change==
I have noticed that the other &quot;Military of...&quot; articles are usually redirects to &quot;Armed Forces of (Country name)&quot; or &quot;(Country name) Armed Forces.&quot;  Should the article title be &quot;Armed Forces of Yemen&quot; or &quot;Yemeni Armed Forces&quot; or something else?

==Asian Affairs May 2011 quote==
&quot;Meanwhile, Mohsen watched nervously as his power base flattened under the weight of the second-generation Saleh men. One by one, Mohsen's close old-guard allies were replaced: In 2007, Saleh sacked Gen. Al Thaneen, commander of the Republican Guard in Taiz. In 2008, Brig. Gen. Mujahid Gushaim replaced Ali Sayani, the head of military intelligence (Ali Sayani's brother, Abdulmalik, Yemen's former defense minister, was one of the first generals to declare support for the revolt against Saleh); the same year, Gen. Al Thahiri al Shadadi was replaced by Brig Gen. Mohammed al Magdashi as Commander of the Central Division; Saleh then appointed his personal bodyguard Brig. Gen. Aziz Mulfi as Chief of Staff of the 27th mechanized brigade in Hadramout. Finally, in early 2011, Saleh sacked Brig. Gen. Abdullah Al Gadhi, commander of Al Anad Base that lies on the axis of Aden in the south and commander of the 201st mechanized brigade. As commander of the northwestern division, Mohsen had been kept busy by an al Houthi rebellion that ignited in 2004, and he became a convenient scapegoat for Saleh when the al Houthis rose up again in 2009 and began seizing territory, leading to a rare Saudi military intervention in Yemen's northern Saada province.&quot; &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Buckshot06 |Buckshot06 ]] ([[User talk:Buckshot06 |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Buckshot06 |contribs]]) 04:14, 28 October 2012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
