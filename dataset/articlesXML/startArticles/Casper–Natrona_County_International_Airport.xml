'''Casper–Natrona County International Airport''' {{airport codes|CPR|KCPR|CPR}} is  {{convert|7|mi|km}} northwest of [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], in [[Natrona County, Wyoming|Natrona County]], [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAA&quot; /&gt; Before December 19, 2007 the airport was called '''Natrona County International Airport'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = NCIA adds Casper to name | work = Casper Star-Tribune | url = http://www.trib.com/articles/2007/12/20/news/casper/8bcc0fb6a2bbaad5872573b600835823.txt | date = 2007-12-20 | accessdate = 2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheduled passenger service is offered by [[SkyWest Airlines]] operating as [[Delta Connection]] on behalf of [[Delta Air Lines]] and also as [[United Express]] on behalf of [[United Airlines]].  [[Trans States Airlines]] operates as [[United Express]] on behalf of [[United Airlines]] as well.  Both of these regional airlines operate regional jet aircraft into Casper.  [[Allegiant Air]] also serves the airport and operates mainline jet aircraft. Charter flights (known as &quot;casino or gamblers' flights&quot;) are occasionally flown to [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]] or [[West Wendover, Nevada|Wendover]], [[Nevada]]. Located near the airport is the NCIA Business Park, which houses a World War II museum and over 35 business ranging from manufacturing to aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iflycasper.com/businesspark.php|title=NCIA Business Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Casper had airline flights in the 1930s at Wardwell Field, north of town at {{coord|42.913|-106.35|display=inline}}. The airport started as the '''Casper Army Airfield''' in September 1942,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formerbases.com/wy_casperaaf_history.htm History - Casper Army Air Field]&lt;/ref&gt;  consisting of four asphalt hard surfaced runways - N/S, NE/SW, E/W, NW/SE - varying in length between 8900' and 8600'.
)
Casper AAF was assigned to [[Second Air Force]] as a heavy bomber ([[B-17]]; [[B-24]]) replacement training unit, with the 331st Bombardment Group being the training unit with four squadrons (461st, 462d, 463d and 464th Bombardment) training of personnel in heavy bomber operations.  The 331st Combat Crew Training School provided ground instruction. Once personnel completed the training course, they were sent to various combat units overseas as replacement personnel.

The 331st was converted to a Very Heavy ([[B-29]]) group in July 1944 and began training for deployment to [[Twentieth Air Force]] in the Pacific.  The 211th Army Air Force Base Unit took control of the airfield.   Casper AAF became part of [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] as a transit station for WASP pilots ferrying combat aircraft across the United States.   The airfield was inactivated in March 1945, and on 30 September 1945 was turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers as surplus.

The War Assets Administration turned the airfield over to civil control in the late 1940s, and in 1949 it became ''Natrona County Municipal Airport'', replacing the former Casper Airport, Wardwell Field, whose runways are now streets in the town of [[Bar Nunn, Wyoming|Bar Nunn]].

==Past airline service==

[[Challenger Airlines]] and successor [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)]] served at Casper from the 1940s until 1986.  In 1950, Frontier was serving the airport with [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft and by the early 1960s the airline had introduced larger [[Convair 340]] and [[Convair 440]] propliners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Nov. 1, 1950 &amp; July 1, 1961 Frontier Airlines system timetables&lt;/ref&gt;  During the mid 1970s, Frontier began replacing their [[Convair 580]] turboprop flights with [[Boeing 737-200]] jet service primarily to its Denver (DEN) hub.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, April 1, 1974 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Denver-Casper flight schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Western Airlines]] served the airport for many years as well from the 1940s until 1987 when this major air carrier was merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] which in turn continued service into Casper until the mid 1990s with nonstop flights to its Salt Lake City (SLC) hub operated with [[Boeing 727-200]] and [[737-200]] jetliners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Dec. 15, 1989 &amp; Dec. 15, 1991 editions, Official Airline Guide (OAG), Salt Lake City-Casper flight schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  Aircraft types operated by Western over the years included [[Douglas DC-3]], [[Convair 240]] and [[Douglas DC-6B]] propliners, [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] turboprops and [[Boeing 727-200]] and [[737-200]] jetliners with direct flights to Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and other destinations in the intermountain western and north central U.S. as well as direct service to Calgary, Alberta in Canada&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, 1950s &amp; 1960s Western Air Lines system timetables&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Denver-Casper flight schedules&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continental Airlines]] began flights in 1980 when this air carrier was operating a hub at Denver and was serving Casper with [[Boeing 727-200]] and [[Douglas DC-9-10]] jetliners during the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1982 Continental Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, [[United Airlines]] was serving Casper with nonstop [[Boeing 727-100]] and [[727-200]] jet flights to its Denver hub.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 15, 1985 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Denver-Casper flight schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Continental and United then ceased mainline flights and turned their respective services over to regional airline partners which operated [[code sharing]] flights as [[Continental Express]] or [[United Express]] with various turboprop aircraft types from the mid 1980s through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 15, 1985; Dec. 15, 1989; Oct. 1, 1991; April 2, 1995 and June 1, 1999 editions, Official Airline Guide (OAG), Denver-Casper flight schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  Continental Express service was operated by [[Pioneer Airlines]] with [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner]] aircraft and later by [[Rocky Mountain Airways]] with [[Beechcraft 1900C]] and [[ATR-42]] aircraft while United Express service was flown by [[Aspen Airways]] with [[Convair 580]] aircraft, [[Mesa Airlines]] with [[Beechcraft 1900C]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8]] and [[Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia]] aircraft, and [[Air Wisconsin]] with [[Dornier 328]] propjets.  Prior to becoming a Continental Express air carrier, [[Rocky Mountain Airways]] was serving Casper in 1983 as an independent airline with [[de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7]] turboprops while commuter air carrier Air US was also serving the airport at this same time with the regional airliner version of [[Grumman Gulfstream I]] business propjet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, April 3, 1983 Official Airline Guide (OAG),Denver-Casper flight schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  Delta eventually turned its mainline service over to its [[code sharing]] regional airline partner, [[SkyWest Airlines]], which in 1995 was operating as the [[Delta Connection]] with nonstop [[Canadair CRJ]] regional jet flights to Delta's Salt Lake City hub.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, April 2, 1995 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Salt Lake City-Casper flight schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  SkyWest continues to operate Delta Connection service with CRJ aircraft nonstop to Salt Lake City at the present time.

==Airport renovations and increased airline service==

In July 2004 the airport was renovated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Airport renovations to start in July | work = Casper Star-Tribune | url = http://www.trib.com/articles/2004/06/25/news/casper/df2cf5905afb1d8b87256ebd00816ba0.txt | date = 2004-06-24 | accessdate = 2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] baggage screening was moved from in front of the ticket counters to the area behind them.  The rental car counters were moved next to baggage claim. The upper level of the gate area, once used for jet flights, was transformed into a viewing station.

Since early 2008 the airport has been in talks with the carriers to increase capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Into rare air | work = Casper Star-Tribune | url = http://www.trib.com/articles/2008/01/27/news/business/f5ed78b34879b341872573dc0026832c.txt | date = 2008-01-27 | accessdate = 2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to the 5.8% increase in the Natrona County population in 2000-2006 and a 1.8% growth rate in 2006 alone. Some of the increased capacity was being provided by larger regional jet aircraft.  On April 30, 2008, [[SkyWest Airlines]] began operating flights as [[United Express]] for [[United Airlines]] with [[Canadair]] [[CRJ 200]] regional jets, replacing smaller [[Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia]] turboprops. Other increases in capacity have come as a result of additional flights. More recently Delta Connection announced the addition of an extra flight in summer 2011 on Saturdays and Sundays &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Delta adds summer weekend flight | work = Casper Star-Tribune | url =http://trib.com/news/local/casper/article_e5c6f8a4-dd19-5fdf-a9c6-ce75073bc911.html | date = 2011-03-20 | accessdate = 2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport hopes to bring fares down; a recent leakage study shows that many travelers drive to Denver International Airport to get lower fares. The information was passed on to the airlines in the hopes of lower fares. Perhaps this strategy worked, as data obtained on May 20, 2008 found that fares had decreased from the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Casper airfares plummet after study | url = http://www.trib.com/articles/2008/05/26/news/business/7469981912c198058725745300210131.txt |date = 2008-05-26 | accessdate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental investigation==
As a formerly used defense site (FUDS) the Army has had to review sites according to the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act]] since 1980. It was not until 2014, that funding became available. The [[Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality]]'s main concern is chemical contamination in the area of a former landfill and sewage treatment plant. Together with the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] it is investigating 12 sites.&lt;ref name=CST&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graff|first1=Trevor|title=Regulators investigate Casper airport for WWII-era contamination|url=http://trib.com/news/local/casper/regulators-investigate-casper-airport-for-wwii-era-contamination/article_987c64a9-d2bf-5ac7-a645-36d22cf177bf.html|accessdate=28 July 2014|work=Casper Star-Tribune Onlinedate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The airport covers {{convert|5,131|acre|ha}} and has two [[asphalt]] [[runway]]s: 3/21 is 10,165 x 150&amp;nbsp;ft (3,098 x 46 m) and 8/26 is 8,679 x 150&amp;nbsp;ft (2,645 x 46 m).

In the year ending May 31, 2006 the airport had 47,210 aircraft operations, average 129 per day: 60% [[general aviation]], 24% scheduled airline, 14% [[air taxi]] and 1% military. 90 aircraft are based at the airport: 51% single-engine, 34% multi-engine, 9% jet and 6% [[helicopter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAA&quot; /&gt;
The airport is governed by a Board of Trustees with 5 members each serving a 5-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflycasper.com/board.php NCIA - Airport Board of Trustees]. Retrieved on 2007-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
