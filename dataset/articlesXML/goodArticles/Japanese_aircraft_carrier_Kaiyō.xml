{{nihongo|'''''Kaiyō'''''|海鷹|meaning Sea Hawk}}&lt;ref name=s2&gt;Stille, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[escort carrier]] operated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]]. The ship was originally built as the [[ocean liner]] ''Argentina Maru''. She was purchased by the IJN on 9 December 1942, converted into an escort carrier, and renamed ''Kaiyō''.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;&gt;Tully&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was primarily used as an aircraft transport, escort carrier and [[training ship]] during the war. She was badly damaged by repeated air attacks in July 1945 and was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1946–48.

==Description==
The ship was ordered as the fast luxury passenger liner ''Argentina Maru'' by ''Osaka Shosen Kaisha'' (OSK) in 1938. In exchange for a subsidy of her building costs by the Navy Ministry, she was designed to be converted to an aircraft carrier.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer &amp; Rehm-Takahara 1985a, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

''Argentina Maru'' was completed in 1939 and rated at {{GRT|12,755|disp=long}}. After being rebuilt, the ship had a length of {{convert|155|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.04|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|13600|t|LT}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]]. As part of her conversion, her original [[diesel engine]]s, which had given her a top speed of {{convert|21.5|kn|lk=in}}, were replaced by a pair of destroyer-type geared [[steam turbine]] sets with a total of {{convert|52000|shp|kW|lk=in}}, each driving one propeller. Steam was provided by four [[water-tube boiler]]s and ''Kaiyō'' now had a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn}}. She carried enough [[fuel oil]] to give her a radius of {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}}. Her crew numbered 829 officers and men.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's [[flight deck]] was {{convert|72|ft|m|1|flip|sp=us}} wide&lt;ref&gt;Palomar &amp; Genda, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kaiyō'' had a single [[hangar]], served by two [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|aircraft elevator]]s, mounted on the centerline.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; She was not built with an [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]] and could operate 24 aircraft.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt; The ship's primary armament consisted of eight 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|12.7&amp;nbsp;cm Type 89]] [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) guns in twin mounts on [[sponson]]s along the sides of the hull. They fired {{convert|23.45|kg|lb|adj=on|sp=us}} projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|700|-|725|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}; at 45°, this provided a maximum range of {{convert|14800|m|yd|sp=us}}, and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|9400|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 192–93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaiyō'' was also initially equipped with eight triple [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25&amp;nbsp;mm Type 96]] light AA guns, also in sponsons along the sides of the hull.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt; They fired {{convert|.25|kg|lb|adj=on|sp=us}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|900|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}; at 50°, this provided a maximum range of {{convert|7500|m|yd|sp=us|0}}, and an effective ceiling of {{convert|5500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In early July 1944, 20 single 25&amp;nbsp;mm guns were added as were eight [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt; Some sources say that a number of 28-round AA rocket launchers were added in late 1944.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|However, this is not confirmed by Stille,&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; nor in Lengerer's article on the rocket launcher.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer &amp; Rehm-Takahara 1985b, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Each {{convert|12|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} rocket weighed {{convert|22.5|kg|lb|sp=us}} and had a maximum velocity of {{convert|200|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. Their maximum range was {{convert|4800|m|yd|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Early warning was provided by a [[List of Japanese World War II radar#Shipborne Radar|Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1]] air search [[radar]] that was installed on the side of the flight deck in November 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt;

==Service history==
''Argentina Maru'' was initially used for troop transport after the beginning of the [[Pacific War]] in December 1941.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt; The ship began conversion at Nagasaki on 10 December 1942, the day after she was purchased. After the conversion was completed on 23 November 1943, she was renamed ''Kaiyō''. Her initial duties were to transport aircraft to Japanese overseas bases. Her first such task was to ferry aircraft for the [[23rd Air Flotilla]] to [[Singapore]] via [[Manila]] in January 1944 as part of [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-33]]. On her return journey, the ship transported aircraft of the 551st Air Group to [[Chuuk State|Truk]]. On 10 February, en route to Truk from [[Palau]], the [[submarine]] {{USS|Permit|SS-178|2}} made a night attack on ''Kaiyō'', but the [[torpedo]]es missed. ''Kaiyō'' was briefly refitted between 23 February and 2 March and was assigned to the 1st Surface Escort Division on 17 March. She escorted [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-57]] to Singapore via [[Taiwan]] and [[Indochina]] in April. She escorted [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-58]] on the return voyage; one of her aircraft spotted the submarine {{USS|Robalo|SS-273|2}} on the surface behind the convoy. The submarine was damaged by the escorts, but escaped.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt;

In late May, ''Kaiyō'' formed part of the escort for [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-65]], together with the escort carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinyo||2}}, bound for Singapore. One of the escorts was torpedoed en route and two of the merchantmen collided while trying to dodge the other torpedoes. The rest of the convoy arrived at Singapore on 12 June. ''Kaiyō'' was assigned to fast [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-66]] for the return voyage and reached Japan on 26 June. She was briefly docked at [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] in early July to have more 25&amp;nbsp;mm AA guns fitted. Together with the escort carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taiyō||2}}, ''Kaiyō'' was loaded with aircraft bound for the Philippines to be delivered in [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-69]]. They departed on 13 July and arrived a week later. The convoy left Manila four days later and reached Japan on 1 August. The ship's machinery broke down as she was preparing to join another convoy on 4 August and she was transferred to Sasebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt;

On 25 October, ''Kaiyō'' ferried a dozen transport aircraft to [[Keelung]], Taiwan, and arrived at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] on 2 November. The ship was assigned to escort [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-83]] to Singapore via Taiwan and [[Hainan Island]] on 25 November and arrived on 13 December. En route, she was assigned to the First Escort Fleet on 10 December. While returning to Japan with [[Hi convoys|Convoy HI-84]] later that month, ''Kaiyō'' was attacked and missed by the submarine {{USS|Dace|SS-247|2}} on 31 December. After arriving at [[Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū|Moji]] on 13 January 1945, the ship was transferred to Kure and assigned to pilot training in the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt;

On 19 March 1945, while moored at Kure, ''Kaiyō'' was attacked by an American carrier aircraft from [[Task Force 58]]. She was hit in the port engine room by a bomb that started fires and caused some flooding. The ship started to [[list (watercraft)|list]] and was moved into shallow water near [[Etajima]] Island lest she sink. On 20 April she was assigned to serve as a target ship for [[kamikaze]] crews. ''Kaiyō'' resumed her pilot training duties a month later and hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] on 18 July with only minor damage.

Six days later, she was attacked as part of a [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|renewed aerial campaign]] against remaining Japanese warships, and hits were attributed to [[Fleet Air Arm]] aircraft from the [[British Pacific Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, pp. 266–67&lt;/ref&gt; While attempting to avoid the attack, she also struck a mine.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt; The ship was towed overnight to [[Beppu Bay]] and deliberately [[Beaching (nautical)|grounded]] the following morning to prevent her from sinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt; The ship was [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|attacked again on 28 July]] by American carrier aircraft that knocked out the ship's power and stopped her pumps. ''Kaiyō'' was also hit by 18 rockets and a total of 20 crewmen were killed by the attacks. The damage caused her to ground again with a list to port. The next day she was attacked again by [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25J Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s of the [[Fifth Air Force]] as well as by aircraft from the carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}}. The amount of damage inflicted by these attacks, if any, is unknown, but they did cause the ship's [[captain (nautical)|captain]] to abandon attempts to repair the ship. He ordered that the boilers be flooded with sea water and the machinery coated in oil to better preserve it. Some crewmen were left aboard to man the AA guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt;

Low-level air strikes by Okinawa-based B-25J Mitchells of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[38th Bombardment Group|38th Bomb Group]] on 9 August further damaged the carrier, despite extensive use of camouflage netting and foliage. The following day, the ship's list increased and she was ordered abandoned. ''Kaiyō'' was struck from the Navy List on 20 November and scrapped in place from 1 September 1946 and 30 January 1948 by Nissan Salvage.&lt;ref name=&quot;movements&quot;/&gt;
