The '''''Bouvines'' class''' was a pair of [[Coastal defence ship|coastal defense ship]]s built for the [[French Navy]]. The class comprised two ships: [[French coast defense ship Bouvines|''Bouvines'']], named after the [[Battle of Bouvines]], and [[French coast defense ship Amiral-Tréhouart|''Amiral-Tréhouart'']], named after the prominent Admiral. The ships were very similar to the preceding {{sclass|Jemmapes|coast defense ship}}s and differed mainly by the addition of a forecastle deck and a smaller main armament of {{convert|305|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns. They were sold for scrap after World War I.

==General characteristics==
The ''Bouvines'' class ships were half-sisters to the ''Jemmapes'' class laid down at the same time. They were virtually identical to them except that they were given a forecastle deck to improve seaworthiness and the main armament was lightened to offset the additional weight, {{convert|305|mm|in|abbr=on}} Mle 1887 guns were installed rather than the 340&amp;nbsp;mm (13.4&amp;nbsp;in) Mle 1887 guns of the ''Jemmapes'' class.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Conway's, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bouvines'' and ''Amiral-Tréhouart'' were {{convert|89.38|m|ft|abbr=on}} long at the waterline and {{convert|122.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[length overall|overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.86|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|6.38|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|7.54|m|ft|abbr=on}} aft. She was only slightly heavier than the ''Jemmapes'' class and displaced {{convert|6798|MT|LT}}, only {{convert|300|MT|LT|-2}} more than the earlier ships. Once in service they proved to roll badly so [[bilge keels]] were later fitted&lt;ref name=s&gt;Sturton, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propulsion==
The ''Bouvines'' class ships used two inclined horizontal triple-expansion steam engines built by Menpenti of [[Marseilles]], one engine per shaft. ''Bouvines's'' engines were powered by eighteen d'Allest-Lagrafel [[water tube boiler]]s and had two funnels, but ''Amiral-Tréhouart'' used sixteen Belleville boilers instead and had only one funnel. The engines produced a total of 8865 ihp and gave a top speed of {{convert|16.05|knots|lk=in}} on trials. The ships carried a maximum of {{convert|557|MT|LT}} of coal which allowed the ship to steam for {{convert|3900|nmi|km}} at a speed of {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

==Armament==
Like the ''Jemmapes'' class which preceded her, the ''Bouvines'' class ships carried their main armament of two {{convert|305|mm|in|abbr=on}} 45 [[Caliber#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|caliber]] Modèle 1887 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. The guns fired {{convert|340|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at the rate of 1 round per minute at a [[muzzle velocity]] of approximately {{convert|780|m/s|ft/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNFR_12-40_m1893.htm|title=French 305 mm/40 (12&quot;) Model 1893/1896 305 mm/45 (12&quot;) Model 1893 305 mm/40 (12&quot;) Model 1893 305 mm/45 (12&quot;) Model 1887|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guns could be depressed to −4° and elevated to +10°.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

The ship's secondary armament consisted of eight {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} 45 caliber Modèle 1892 guns, four of which were mounted in individual [[casemate]]s. The other four were carried on pivot mounts with [[gun shield]]s on the shelter deck directly above the four casemated guns on the corners of the superstructure. The guns fired {{convert|16|kg|lb|adj=on}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|703|m/s|ft/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNFR_39-45_m1892.htm|title=100 mm/45 (3.9&quot;) Model 1891 --- 100 mm/45 (3.9&quot;) Model 1892 --- 100 mm/45 (3.9&quot;) Model 1893 --- 100 mm/45 (3.9&quot;) Model 1897 --- 100 mm/45 (3.9&quot;) Model 1917|date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially four {{convert|47|mm|in|abbr=on}} 40 caliber [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|Canon de 47 mm Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns]] were mounted as anti-[[torpedo boat]] guns in the [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]], but this was later increased to eight. They were mounted in platforms in the mainmast and on the superstructure. They fired a {{convert|1.49|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectile at {{convert|610|m/s|ft/s}} to a maximum range of {{convert|4000|m|yd}}. Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute, but only seven rounds per minute sustained. Initially ten 37&amp;nbsp;m revolving Hotchkiss revolving cannon were carried on the superstructure, but this was reduced to three when the additional 47&amp;nbsp;mm guns were mounted. Two {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted above the waterline, but they were removed in 1906.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

==Armor==
The ''Bouvines'' class ships had a complete waterline armor belt of Creusot steel that tapered from the maximum thickness of {{convert|464|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the ship's ends. The belt's height was an average of {{convert|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but increased to {{convert|2.86|m|ft}} at the bow and to {{convert|2.18|m|ft}} at the stern. The ship was intended to have {{convert|40|cm|in}} of the belt showing above the waterline, but they were approximately {{convert|200|t|LT}} too heavy as completed and only {{convert|24|cm|in}} of the belt was above the waterline. The hull above the belt was completely unarmored. The maximum thickness of the armored deck was {{convert|92|mm|in|abbr=on}} and it was joined to the top of the armor belt. The main [[Gun turret|turret]] armor was {{convert|370|mm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness although the turret bases were only {{convert|320|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} of armor.&lt;ref&gt;Sturton, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
''Bouvines'' was authorized in the Supplementary Estimates of 1889 although ''Amiral-Tréhouart'' had been authorized in the 1889 Ordinary Naval Estimates. ''Bouvines'' was laid down at Les Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée at [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]] 30 September 1890. She was launched on 29 March 1892, began sea trials on 15 October 1894, but took until 1 December 1895 to enter service.&lt;ref name=s/&gt; ''Amiral-Tréhouart'' was laid down at [[Lorient]] during October 1890, launched in May 1893 and entered service in May 1896.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

==History==
''Bouvines'' served as a flagship for the entirety of her active service where she served both in the ''Northern Squadron'' and ''Channel Flotilla'' in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[English Channel]] as well as in the ''Mediterranean Squadron''. She was stricken on 1 July 1913 and was used by the Inspection Service at [[Cherbourg]] between 1914 and 1917. She was condemned in 1918 and sold for scrapping in 1920.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

Little is known of ''Amiral-Tréhouart's'' career other than she served as a [[submarine tender]] during [[World War I]] and was sold for scrapping in 1922.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;
