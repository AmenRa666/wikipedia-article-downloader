'''HMS ''Hippomenes''''' was a former Dutch corvette built in [[Vlissingen]] in 1797 for the [[Batavian Republic]]. The British took her in 1803 and she served with the [[Royal Navy]] until sold in 1813. With the Royal Navy she participated in two notable [[single-ship action]]s in the West Indies.

==Dutch service==

''Hippomenes'' was a sister ship to ''Atalanta'', but brig-rigged and built in 1796. {{HMS|Scorpion|1804|2}} captured ''Atalanta'' in 1804 but the British did not take her into service.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; The two sister ships were named for [[Atalanta]] and [[Hippomenes]], two lovers from Greek mythology.

Early in 1802, ''Hippomenes'', under the command of Captain-Lieutenant Melvill, was assigned to the West Indies and Guinea coast division of the [[Batavian Republic]]'s navy. After the end of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the British returned the Dutch colonies they had captured in the West Indies to the Republic. In August 1802, Captain Cornelius Hubertus Buchman, of [[HMS Halstarr (1807)|''Kenau Hasselar'']], took a small squadron that also included the frigate [[Dutch frigate Proserpine (1801)|''Proserpina'']], ''Hippomenes'', the [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''Rose'', and the schooner ''Serpent'', to take possession of [[Curaçao]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartog (1968), p.197-8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kenau Hasellar'' and ''Rose'' arrived at [[Willemstad]] on 22 December. The other vessels in the squadron sailed to other destinations.

==Capture==

In the summer of 1803 the Dutch ''Hippomenes'' was acting as a guard ship at [[Georgetown, Guyana|Fort Stabroek]], [[Guyana|Demerara]]. She was responsible for the Governor's maritime affairs and served as harbour master for visiting ships and was under the command of Lieutenant Sistermans.&lt;ref&gt;''Verhandelingen en Berigten...'' (1852), Vol. 12, p.624.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Sir Samuel Hood]] arrived to take command in the [[Leeward Islands]], he raised his pennant in the 74-gun [[third rate]] {{HMS|Centaur|1797|2}}. This [[ship of the line]] seized ''Hippomenes'' on 20 September 1803 at the taking of [[Demerara]].&lt;ref&gt;Southey (1827), Vol. 3, pp.232-4.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hippomenes'' was the only vessel belonging to the [[Batavian Republic]] and was included in the terms of capitulation.&lt;ref name=LG15649&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15649|date=26 November 1803|startpage=1659|endpage=1663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports described her as a corvette of 18 guns,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15643|date=12 November 1803|startpage=1573}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because she was pierced for 18, though only 14 were mounted.&lt;ref name=LG15649/&gt;

==British service==
The British then took her to [[Antigua]] where they added her to the Navy as the 18-gun [[sloop-of-war]] HMS ''Hippomenes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-368606&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_i.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 368606|work=Warship Histories, vol i|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entailed the replacement of her 14 Dutch guns, which were incompatible with British requirements—Dutch 8-pounders, in particular, could not take Royal Navy ammunition—with 18 British guns.{{#tag:ref|Aspinall reports that two of ''Hippomenes''{{'}}s 18-pounder went to fortifying [[Diamond Rock]], which took place in early 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Aspinall (1969), p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; This is inconsistent with her armament either in Dutch or British service.  Actually, ''Hippomenes'' brought the two 18-pounders from the Gun Wharf at [[English Harbour]], [[Antigua]].|group=Note}} 

Her first British commander was Lieutenant John C. Woolcombe.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-368606&quot;/&gt; On 26 January 1804, ''Hippomenes'' recaptured the Scottish ship ''Mercury'', which was carrying a cargo of lumber to [[Demerara]] via New York.&lt;ref name=LG15735&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15735|date=8 September 1804|startpage=1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French 12-gun privateer schooner ''Harmonie'' had captured ''Mercury'' before herself falling prey to {{HMS|Cyane|1796|2}} on 27 January; ''Harmonie'' was taken into British service as {{HMS|Unique|1804|6}}.

Conway Shipley transferred from {{HMS|Saint Lucia|1803|2}} and took command of ''Hippomenes'' on 22 March 1804. On 25 March 1804, he and the 18-gun [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Osprey|1797|2}} retook the French prize ''Rigby'', which was carrying troops.&lt;ref name=LG15735/&gt; More importantly for subsequent developments, they also recaptured the ''Reliance'', out of London.&lt;ref name=LG15702/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG15735/&gt; From her Shipley obtained information about the whereabouts of the French privateer [[Egyptienne (ship)|''Egyptienne'']] (the former frigate [[List of French sail frigates#Frigates of Louis XVI (1774–1792), the Revolutionary era and the First Empire (to 1815)|''Railleuse'']]). 

Two days later, after a 54-hour chase, and a running fight of over 3 hours, ''Hippomenes'' captured ''Egyptienne''.&lt;ref name=LG15702/&gt; The French vessel [[Striking the colours|struck her colours]] as soon as ''Hippomenes'' pulled alongside, with the result that the British suffered only one man wounded. A few days earlier, on 23 March, ''Egyptienne'' had battled ''Osprey'', losing eight men killed and 19 men wounded before she could escape.&lt;ref name=LG15702&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15702|date=15 May 1804|startpage=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently this demoralized her captain so that when faced with yet another British warship he surrendered without putting up strong resistance.&lt;ref name=LG15702/&gt; (''Osprey'' had lost one man killed and 16 wounded.&lt;ref name=LG15702/&gt;) ''Egyptienne'' had 36 guns (12 and 9-pounders) and a crew of 240 men when captured; when she battled ''Osprey'' her crew had been about 250 men.&lt;ref name=LG15702/&gt; The British took ''Egyptienne'' into service as {{HMS|Antigua|1804|2}}. ''Antigua'' served as a prison ship until she was scrapped in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge (1967), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hippomenes'' formed part of Commodore Hood's squadron at the capture of [[Suriname|Surinam River]] in 1804. The squadron consisted of Hood's flagship ''Centaur'', [[Hector (1784)|''Pandour'']], {{HMS|Serapis|1782|2}}, {{HMS|Alligator|1787|2}}, ''Hippomenes'', [[Earl of Mornington (1799 ship)|''Drake'']], the schooner ''Unique'', and transports carrying 2000 troops under [[Brigadier-General]] Sir Charles Green.&lt;ref name=LG15712&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15712|date=19 June 1804|startpage=761|endpage=762}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April, ''Hippomenes'' escorted a convoy carrying a division of the army under Brigadier-General [[Frederick Maitland]] to land at Warappa creek to collect enough boats from the plantations to transport troops to the rear of Fort New Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1818-19), p.131-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April, Kenneth Mackenzie (or M'Kenzie) of the 16-gun, ex-French privateer brig {{HMS|Guachapin|1801|2}}, who had left his ship 50 [[League (unit)|leagues]] to leeward and brought up her boats,&lt;ref name=LG15712/&gt; assisted Shipley in superintending the landing of Maitland's troops at Warappa. The Dutch governor initially rejected the surrender terms but surrendered on 5 May after the British captured the battery of Friderici. Hood made Shipley [[post-captain]] into ''Centaur''. (One day earlier the Admiralty had promoted him into the ex-French 28-gun frigate [[French corvette Sagesse (1794)|HMS ''Sagesse'']]; he later assumed command of her at Jamaica.)

On 1 May ''Hippomenes'' and {{HMS|Emerald|1795|2}} captured the sloop ''Lizard'' and her cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15914|date=29 April 1806|startpage=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Mackenzie took over command of ''Hippomenes'', whose crew, he complained, consisted mainly of discontented foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1825), Vol. 2, Part 2, p.899.&lt;/ref&gt; When the British had commissioned her, Shipley had to get men for her crew by drawing on other vessels, which gave the commanders of those vessels an opportunity to rid themselves of &quot;skulkers, raw hands, incorrigible rogues and foreign renegades.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 3, p.269.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The poor quality of the crew came to the fore on 21 June when ''Hippomene'' was cruising off Antigua. Taking advantage of ''Hippomenes{{'}}'' Dutch design, Mackenzie had disguised her as a Guinea trader.&lt;ref name=Clowes/&gt; A Guadeloupe privateer, the ''Buonaparte'', of 18 long 8-pounders and a crew of 146 men, sighted ''Hippomenes'' and sailed to take her. The two vessels exchanged fire until ''Buonaparte'' ran into ''Hippomenes''.&lt;ref name=Clowes/&gt; Mackenzie had his crew lash the privateer's bowsprit to the mainmast and jumped on board the privateer, followed by his officers and a few men, some 18 in all.&lt;ref name=Clowes/&gt; Unfortunately, the rest of the crew remained behind. In the fight on the privateer, the British lost five dead and eight wounded; only nine of the original 18 managed to escape back to ''Hippomenes'' (two officers and two men remained on board ''Buonaparte'' as prisoners).&lt;ref name=Clowes/&gt; The boarding party barely got back in time before the lashings gave way and the vessels parted, at which time the privateer sailed away. On ''Hippomenes'' his wounds rendered Mackenzie himself senseless for a while. In the engagement prior to the boarding, the ''Buonaparte'' had lost five dead and 15 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;James (1902), pp.273-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

During August 1804, ''Hippomenes'', retook the English ship ''Young Nicholas'', which was laden with mahogany.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15794|date=2 April 1805|startpage=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1805 ''Hippomenes'' was under the command of Commander William Autridge. By 11 November Commander Edward Woolcombe, who had been promoted out of ''Centaur'', was listed as commanding ''Hippomenes'' at the capture of the brig ''Hiram''. ''Hipomenes'' was part of a flotilla that received credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16266|date=13 June 1809|startpage=877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 1807, a court martial acquitted Woolcombe of &quot;wasteful expenditure of His Majesty{{'}}s stores&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Byrn (1989), p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 1808 the boats of ''Hippomenes'' joined those of {{HMS|Ulysses|1779|2}}, {{HMS|Castor|1785|2}}, and {{HMS|Morne Fortunee|1803|2}} in an attempt to cut out the 16-gun French brig [[French brig Griffon (1806)|''Griffon'']] at [[Le Marin|Marin]], [[Martinique]].&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; They succeeded in capturing a battery but were driven back empty handed, having suffered heavy casualties from the brig's fire.&lt;ref name=Clowes&gt;Clowes (1897-1903), Vol. 5, p.414.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1808 Commander K.H. Waede took command of ''Hippomenes'' at Barbados, somewhat to his dismay, as he had been appointed to command {{HMS|Julia|1806|2}}, a new vessel, the news arriving too late. ''Hippomenes'' then escorted a convoy to England.&lt;ref&gt;O'Byrne (1849), p.1248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==

On 25 September 1808 ''Hippomenes'' arrived in [[Portsmouth]] and was laid up. The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy first offered the sloop ''Hippmenes'', of 417 tons, then lying at Portsmouth, for sale 27 November 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=9 November 1811|issue=16539|startpage=2169}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finally sold on 28 April 1813 for £600.
