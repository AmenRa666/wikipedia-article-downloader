'''Operation Danni''' ({{lang-he|מבצע דני}}, ''Mivtza Dani'') was an [[Israeli military]] offensive launched at the end of the first truce of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The objectives were to capture territory east of [[Tel Aviv]] and then to push inland and relieve the [[Jew]]ish population and forces in [[Jerusalem]]. The main forces fighting against the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] were the [[Arab Legion]] and Palestinian irregulars &lt;ref&gt;Chaim Herzog, 'The Arab-Israeli Wars' ISBN 0-85368-367-0 (1982). page 80: 'A blow against the Arab Legion was the essence of Operation 'Danny' planned as the main Israeli offensive to be mounted on the resumption of hostilities.'&lt;/ref&gt;

It was launched at the end of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War#First truce (11 June 1948–8 July 1948)|first truce]], July 9–19, 1948. On 10 July, [[Glubb Pasha]] ordered the defending [[Arab Legion]] troops to &quot;make arrangements...for a phony war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CC7381HrLqcC&amp;pg=PA287|title=1948|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation commander was [[Yigal Allon]] and his deputy was [[Yitzhak Rabin]]. The total force numbered around 6,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Kimche, Jon and David (1960) ''A Clash of Destinies. The Arab-Jewish War and the Founding of the State of Israel.'' Frederick A. Praeger. Library of Congress number 60-6996. Page 225:&quot;largest force yet assembled under one Israeli.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Name==
The operation was named after [[Palmach]] officer [[Daniel Mass|Daniel &quot;Dani&quot; Mass]], who had fallen on January 16, 1948 while commanding a relief action known as &quot;[[Convoy of 35]]&quot;.
 
==Objectives==
The first phase of Operation Dani was to capture the cities of [[Lod|Lydda]] and [[Ramle]], located on the road to [[Jerusalem]], southeast of [[Tel Aviv]]. Ramle was one of the main obstacles blocking Jewish transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, Arnon. &quot;Lydda and Ramle: from Palestinian-Arab to Israeli towns, 1948-67,&quot; Middle Eastern Studies, October 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; From the start of the war, Lydda and Ramle militiamen had attacked Jewish traffic on nearby roads.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Ramle became a focal point for blocking Jewish transportation, forcing traffic from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv to a southern bypass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111203784.html Lydda and Ramle: from Palestinian-Arab to Israeli towns, 1948-67]. by Golan, Arnon&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase was to capture the fort at [[Latrun]] and break through [[Ramallah]]. The operation was carried out under [[Palmach]] command using the [[Yiftach Brigade]], the [[Harel Brigade]], the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]] and two [[battalions]] from the [[Kiryati Brigade|Kiryati]] and [[Alexandroni Brigade|Alexandroni]] [[brigades]].

===Lydda and Ramle===
{{main article|1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle}}
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20793 The Palmach.jpg|thumb|[[Palmach]] (Yiftach brigade) soldiers with a (just destroyed by a [[PIAT]]) captured Jordanian army armored car, Operation Dani . 15 July 1948]]

On 9 July units from the Yiftach Brigade began approaching Ramle from the south. At the same time troops from the other brigades began attacking villages north of Lydda. Caught in a pincer movement and with only a token Arab Legion presence the two towns were captured the following day. This put [[Ben Gurion Airport|Lydda airport]] and the strategic railway station at Ramle in Israeli hands. Two days after the capture of Lydda and Ramle only a few hundred of the 50,000 to 70,000 residents remained in the two towns.

===Latrun===
{{main article|Battles of Latrun (1948)}}
[[File:Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.]]

The second phase of the operation failed after several costly attacks on Arab Legion positions at [[Battle of Latrun|Latrun]] and the threat of a [[UN]]-imposed cease-fire.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===
The Palmach record the names of ninety-one of its members killed during this Operation. Forty-four were killed at [[Shilta|Khirbet Kurikur]] on 18 July 1948. Seven were killed in the capture of Lydda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmach.org.il/show_item.asp?itemId=8519&amp;levelId=42855&amp;itemType=0|title=פלמ&quot;ח|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
