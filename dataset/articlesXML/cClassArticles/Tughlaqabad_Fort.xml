'''Tughlaqabad Fort''' is a ruined [[fort]] in [[Delhi]], stretching over 6&amp;nbsp;km, built by [[Ghiyas ud din Tughluq Shah I|Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq]], the founder of [[Tughlaq dynasty]], of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]  of [[India]] in 1321, as he established the third historic city of Delhi, which was later abandoned in 1327. It lends its name to the nearby Tughlaqabad residential-commercial area as well as the Tughlaqabad Institutional Area. Tughlaq also built  [[Qutub]]-[[Badarpur, Delhi|Badarpur]] Road, which connected the new city to the [[Grand Trunk Road]]. The road is now known as [[Mehrauli-Badarpur Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Delhi and its Neighbourhood|chapter=33. Badarpur|author=Y. D. Sharma|publisher=Director General, Archaeological Survey of India |year=1974|isbn= |page=105 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also nearby is the [[Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range]] and Okhla Industrial Area.

== History ==
[[Image:Tughluqabad information.JPG|right|150px|thumb|Stone tablet by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]]]
Ghazi Malik was a [[feudatory]] of the [[Khilji]] rulers of Delhi, India. Once while on a walk with his Khilji master, Ghazi Malik suggested that the king build a [[fort]] on a hillock in the southern portion of [[Delhi]]. The king jokingly told Ghazi Malik for building the fort himself when he would become king.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

In 1321, Ghazi Malik drove away the Khiljis and assumed the title of Ghias-ud-din Tughlaq, starting the [[Tughlaq dynasty]]. He immediately started the construction of his fabled city, which he dreamt of as an impregnable, yet beautiful fort to keep away the [[Mongol]] marauders. However, destiny would not be as he would have liked.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

=== The Curse of Nizamuddin Auliya ===
Ghias-ud-din is usually perceived as a liberal ruler. However, he was so passionate about his dream fort that he issued a [[edict|dictate]] that all labourers in Delhi must work on his fort. Saint [[Nizamuddin Auliya]], a Sufi mystic, got incensed as the work on his ''baoli'' (well) was stopped. The confrontation between the Sufi saint and the royal emperor has become a legend in India. The saint uttered a curse which was to resonate throughout history right until today: ''Ya rahey ujjar, ya basey gujjar'' which can roughly be translated to &quot;either remain inhabited or would live gujjars&quot;. So, after the fall of sultanate, Gujjars of the area captured the Qila and till date village Tughlakabad is situated in it.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

=== The Death of the ruler ===
Another of the saint's curses was '''Hunuz Dilli dur ast''' (Delhi is still far away). The Emperor was engrossed in a campaign in [[Bengal]] at this time. He was successful and was on his way to Delhi. However, his son, [[Muhammad bin Tughlaq]], met him at [[Kara (Kaushambi)|Kara]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Allegedly at the prince's orders, a ''Shamiana'' ([[Tent]]) fell on the Emperor, who was crushed to death (1324).

== Mausoleum of Ghiyas ud-Din Tughluq ==
[[File:Ghiyath aldin tughluq tomb.JPG|thumb|199x199px|right| ''[[Mausoleum of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]]'' at [[Tughluqabad]], also showing a side tomb.]]
The 'Mausoleum of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq' is connected by a causeway to the southern outpost of the fortification. This elevated causeway 600&amp;nbsp;ft in length, supported by 27 arches, leads across a former artificial lake, however sometime in 20th century portion of causeway was pierced by the [[Mehrauli]]-[[Badarpur, Delhi|Badarpur]] road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Modernity pierces fort link |publisher= Hindustan Times| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Modernity-pierces-fort-link/Article1-926849.aspx|date=September 9, 2012| accessdate = 2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing an old [[Pipal tree]], the complex of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq's tomb is entered by a high gateway made up of red [[sandstone]] with a flight of steps.

[[Image:Ghiyath aldin tughluq tomb inscription.JPG|left|150px|thumb|Information by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]]]
The actual mausoleum is made up of a single-domed square [[tomb]] (about 8&amp;nbsp;m x8&amp;nbsp;m) with sloping walls crowned by [[parapet]]s. In contrast to the walls of the fortification made up of granite, the sides of the mausoleum are faced by smooth red sandstone and inlaid with inscribed panels and arch borders from [[marble]]. The edifice is topped by an elegant [[dome]] resting on an octagonal drum that is covered with white slabs of marble and slate.

[[File:GHIYĀTHU’D-DĪN TUGHLUQ’S TOMB 04.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Graves inside the [[Mausoleum of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq|Mausoleum]]]]
Inside the mausoleum are three graves: The central one belongs to [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] and the other two are believed to be those of his wife and his son and successor [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]]. In the north-western [[bastion]] of the enclosure wall with its pillared corridors is another [[octagon]]al tomb in similar style with a smaller marble dome and inscribed marble and sandstone slabs over its arched doors. According to an [[inscription]] over its southern entrance this tomb houses the remains of [[Zafar Khan (general)|Zafar Khan]]. His grave has been at the site prior to the construction of the outpost and was consciously integrated into the design of the mausoleum by Ghiyath al-Din himself.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Tughlaqabad walls.jpg|thumb|200px|Tughlaqabad Fort walls by the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road.]]Tughluqabad still consists of remarkable, massive stone fortifications that surround the irregular ground plan of the city. The sloping rubble-filled city walls, a typical feature of monuments of the [[Tughluq dynasty]], are between 10 and 15&amp;nbsp;meters high, topped by battlemented [[parapet]]s and strengthened by circular [[bastion]]s of up to two stories height. The city is supposed to once have had as many as 52 gates of which only 13 remain today. The fortified city contained seven rainwater tanks.

Tughluqabad is divided into three parts:
# the wider city area with houses built along a rectangular grid between its gates
# the citadel with a tower at its highest point known as '''Bijai-Mandal''' and the remains of several halls and a long underground passage
# the adjacent palace area containing the royal residences. A long underground passage below the tower still remains.
[[File:Underground passage of Tuglaqabad fort.jpg|thumb|199x199px|Underground passage of Tughlaqabad fort]]
Today most of the city is inaccessible due to dense thorny vegetation. An ever increasing part of the former city area is occupied by modern settlement, especially in the vicinity of its lakes.

South of Tughlaqabad was a vast artificial [[reservoir (water)|water reservoir]] within the fortified outpost of [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq's Tomb]]. This well preserved [[mausoleum]] remains connected to the fort by an elevated causeway that still stands today.

Well visible in the southeast are the remains of the [[Fortress of Adilabad]], built years later by Ghiyathu'd-Din's successor, Muhammad Tughluq (1325–51) which shares the main characteristics of construction with Tughlaqabad fort.
