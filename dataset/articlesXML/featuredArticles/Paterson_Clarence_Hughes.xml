'''Paterson Clarence''' &quot;'''Pat'''&quot; '''Hughes''', [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (19 September 1917&amp;nbsp;– 7&amp;nbsp;September 1940) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&amp;nbsp;II. Serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), he was credited with as many as seventeen aerial victories during the [[Battle of Britain]], before being killed in action on 7&amp;nbsp;September 1940. His tally made him the highest-scoring Australian of the battle, and among the three highest-scoring Australians of the war.

Born in [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], New South Wales, Hughes joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as a cadet in 1936. After graduating as a pilot,  he chose to take a commission with the RAF. In July 1937, he was assigned to [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;64 Squadron]], which operated [[Hawker Demon]] and, later, [[Bristol Blenheim]] fighters. Posted to [[No. 234 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron]] following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, Hughes began flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s as a [[flight commander]]. He shared in his unit's first aerial victory on 8&amp;nbsp;July 1940, and began scoring heavily against the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' the following month. Known for his practice of attacking his targets at extremely close range, Hughes is generally thought to have died after his Spitfire was struck by flying debris from a German bomber that he had just shot down. He was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and was buried in England.

==Early life==
Paterson Clarence Hughes was born in Numeralla, near [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], New South Wales, on 19&amp;nbsp;September 1917. He was the second-youngest of twelve children, the last of four boys in his family.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hughes-paterson-clarence-10564 |title= Hughes, Paterson Clarence (1917–1940)|last=Newton|first=Dennis|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate= 26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander30&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' father was a teacher by profession but at the time of Pat's birth was running the community post office; christened Percival Clarence Hughes, and known as Percy, he had apparently adopted the name Paterson by the time of his marriage to Catherine Vennell in 1895. Percy was also a writer, contributing to newspapers and magazines such as ''[[The Bulletin]]'', and &quot;Paterson&quot; may have been homage to the poet [[Banjo Paterson]]. In any case, Pat shared his father's interest in literature. He also grew to love the landscape of the local [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro district]] in the shadow of the [[Snowy Mountains]], which he described as &quot;unrivalled in the magnificence and grandeur of its beauty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes was educated at Cooma Public School until the age of twelve, when the family moved to [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]] in [[Sydney]]; his father was by then working as a labourer.&lt;ref name=Alexander30/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham Boys' School]], becoming a [[school prefect|prefect]] in 1932 and vice captain the following year.&lt;ref name=Alexander30/&gt; As well as playing sport, he was a keen aircraft modeller and built [[crystal radio]] sets.&lt;ref name=Claason141&gt;Claasen, ''Dogfight'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Having attained his [[Intermediate Certificate (Australia)|intermediate certificate]], Hughes entered [[Fort Street High School]] in February 1934.&lt;ref name=Alexander30/&gt; He left after eight months to take up employment at Saunders' Jewellers in [[George Street, Sydney]], and enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1936.&lt;ref name=Alexander30/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrisson&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes had also applied to, and been accepted by, the [[Royal Australian Navy]], but chose the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''A Few of {{'}}the Few{{'}}'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Training as an air cadet at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]] near [[Melbourne]], Hughes learnt to fly in [[de Havilland Moth]]s before progressing to [[Westland Wapiti]]s in the middle of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 40, 46&lt;/ref&gt; A practical joker who bridled under RAAF discipline, his euphoria during his first solo on 11&amp;nbsp;March 1936 was such that he &quot;went mad, whistled, sang and almost jumped for joy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 42, 45&lt;/ref&gt; A fellow cadet recalled that Hughes &quot;loved life and lived it at high pressure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation in December 1936, Hughes was assessed as having &quot;no outstanding qualities&quot; despite being &quot;energetic and keen&quot;.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Under a pre-war arrangement between the British and Australian governments, he volunteered for transfer to the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), and sailed for the United Kingdom in January 1937.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to transfer had not been quick or easy; though keen to &quot;try and do something special&quot; in England, and intrigued by &quot;a fascinating picture of easy life, beer and women&quot; that had been presented to him, in the end he felt that it was simply &quot;willed&quot; that he should go.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early RAF service==
On 20&amp;nbsp;March 1937, Hughes was granted a five-year short-service commission as a [[pilot officer]] in the RAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34376|startpage=1417|date=20 March 1937|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like some of his compatriots, he refused to exchange his dark-blue RAAF uniform for the lighter-coloured RAF one.&lt;ref name=Claason141/&gt; He undertook advanced flying instruction at [[No. 2 Flying Training School RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Flying Training School]] in [[Digby, Lincolnshire|Digby]], Lincolnshire. Slated to fly bombers, he appealed and in July was posted as a fighter pilot to [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;64 Squadron]], which operated [[Hawker Demon]]s out of [[RAF Martlesham Heath]], Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron was transferred to [[RAF Church Fenton]], Yorkshire, in May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 19&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34577|startpage=7695|date= 19 November 1938|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;64 Squadron subsequently received [[Bristol Blenheim|Bristol Blenheim&amp;nbsp;1F]] twin-engined fighters, and completed its conversion to the type in January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes was promoted to acting [[flight lieutenant]] in November 1939 and became a [[flight commander]] in the newly formed [[No. 234 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron]], which, like No.&amp;nbsp;64 Squadron, came under the control of [[No. 13 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;13 Group]] in the north of England.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. viii, 90, 127&lt;/ref&gt; On establishment the previous month at [[RAF Leconfield]], East Yorkshire, No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron was equipped with Blenheims, [[Fairey Battle]]s and [[Gloster Gauntlet]]s; it began re-arming with [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in March 1940 and was operational two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/234squadron.cfm|title=234 Squadron|publisher=[[Royal Air Force]]|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commanding officer, [[Squadron Leader]] Richard Barnett, rarely flew, and Hughes assumed responsibility for overseeing conversion to the Spitfire.&lt;ref name=Bungay1&gt;Bungay, ''The Most Dangerous Enemy'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 126, 398&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;More experienced and more mature&quot; than his fellow pilots, according to historian [[Stephen Bungay]], the Australian &quot;effectively led&quot; No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Bungay, ''The Most Dangerous Enemy'', p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Hughes had acquired a young [[Airedale Terrier]] known as Flying Officer Butch, who sometimes flew with him—against regulations. He had also met and begun dating Kathleen (&quot;Kay&quot;) Brodrick of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt; On 19&amp;nbsp;June, Hughes and his squadron transferred to [[RAF St&amp;nbsp;Eval]], Cornwall, under the jurisdiction of the newly formed [[No. 10 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 Group]] in south-west England.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. viii, xii, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Britain==
As the [[Battle of Britain]] got under way in July 1940, Hughes shared in No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron's first confirmed aerial victories.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He and his section of two other Spitfires shot down a German [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;88]] attacking convoys near [[Lands End]] on 8&amp;nbsp;July, and another south-east of [[Plymouth]] during a dawn patrol on 28&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 162, 179&lt;/ref&gt; A shared claim for a Ju&amp;nbsp;88 on 27&amp;nbsp;July could not be confirmed as destroyed; after a chase over the water at heights as low as {{convert|50|feet|m}}, the German escaped, despite being struck in the engines and cockpit, and was credited to the section as &quot;damaged&quot;.&lt;ref name=Few178&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''A Few of {{'}}the Few{{'}}'', pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; German records, made available post-war, confirm that a Junkers 88A piloted by Leutnant Ruckdeschel, was lost on this day.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''Battle Over Britain'', p.153 &lt;/ref&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;August, Hughes was seconded from No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron to help set up the only [[Gloster Gladiator]]-equipped unit to operate during the Battle of Britain, [[No. 247 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;247 (China British) Squadron]] in Plymouth.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shores; Williams, ''Aces High'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, he married Kay Brodrick, who likened him to [[Errol Flynn]], in the [[register office]] at [[Bodmin]], Cornwall.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bungay310&gt;Bungay, ''The Most Dangerous Enemy'', p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Flying Officer Butch, the witnesses were strangers; Kay arrived alone, and no-one from No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron could attend.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''A Few of {{'}}the Few{{'}}'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett was transferred out of No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron on 13&amp;nbsp;August, and Hughes took temporary command until the arrival of Squadron Leader Joe &quot;Spike&quot; O'Brien four days later.&lt;ref name=Bungay1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 198, 210&lt;/ref&gt; By now the fighting was intensifying over southern England, and the squadron relocated from St&amp;nbsp;Eval to [[RAF Middle Wallop]], Hampshire, on 14&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=Bungay1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price66&gt;Price, ''Spitfire Mk.I/II Aces'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately after Hughes landed the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombed the airfield; several ground staff and civilian workers were killed, but No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron's Spitfires escaped damage.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

It was following No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron's move to Middle Wallop that Hughes began to score heavily against German fighters.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price66/&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;August, in one of the costliest engagements of the Battle of Britain, known thereafter to the ''Luftwaffe'' as &quot;Black Thursday&quot;, Hughes claimed victories (one of them shared) over two [[Messerschmitt Me&amp;nbsp;110]]s.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bungay, ''The Most Dangerous Enemy'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  He again achieved dual success on 16, 18 and 26&amp;nbsp;August, all six victims being [[Messerschmitt Bf&amp;nbsp;109]]s brought down in the vicinity of the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; Whereas in July he had fired at his targets from a range of {{convert|150|to|50|yd}}, it was now his habit to close to {{convert|30|yd}}, approximately three Spitfire lengths, before delivering his final burst; he also made head-on attacks against enemy aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a narrow escape on the 16th after his second victory of the day, when he chased a quartet of [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;87]]s and had his [[tailplane]] shot up from behind by another Bf&amp;nbsp;109; he dived and forced the German to overshoot, then broke off having exhausted his ammunition firing at his former attacker. In the pub with Kay and his squadron mates that evening, Hughes jokingly told his wife, &quot;In case of accidents make sure you marry again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 207–210&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3&amp;nbsp;September, Hughes' promotion to [[substantive rank|substantive]] flight lieutenant was promulgated in ''[[The London Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34954|startpage=5715|date= 3 September 1940|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed three Me&amp;nbsp;110s in the space of fifteen minutes south of [[Haslemere]] on 4&amp;nbsp;September, two Bf&amp;nbsp;109s while patrolling [[Kenley]] the following day, and a Bf&amp;nbsp;109 destroyed plus one probable near [[Dover]] on 6&amp;nbsp;September; he had to break off combat with the last-mentioned when its tanks ruptured, covering Hughes' canopy in oil.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 247–250&lt;/ref&gt; One of his victims on 5&amp;nbsp;September may have been Oberleutnant [[Franz von Werra]], who was captured and subsequently became famous as &quot;[[The One That Got Away (film)|the one that got away]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claasen, ''Dogfight'', pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes and his protégé, [[Bob Doe]], claimed half of No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron's victories between mid-August and early September.&lt;ref&gt;Bungay, ''The Most Dangerous Enemy'', pp. 172, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes was killed in action on the evening of 7&amp;nbsp;September 1940, after he intercepted a [[Dornier Do&amp;nbsp;17]] bomber taking part in a large-scale attack on London.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''A Few of {{'}}the Few{{'}}'', pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; His Spitfire crashed in a field between [[Sundridge, Kent|Sundridge]] and [[Bessels Green]] in [[Kent]]. He apparently bailed out, but his parachute failed to open; his body was found in a garden on Main Road, Sundridge, not far from the wreck of his Spitfire. The Dornier came down in the [[River Darent]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 260–261, 343&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron lost its commanding officer, O'Brien, in the same action.&lt;ref name=Bungay310/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bishop&gt;Bishop, ''Battle of Britain'', p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Mystery surrounds exactly how Hughes came to grief, though his close-in tactics are believed to have played a major part in it.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; The strain of regular combat without respite, manifesting itself in fatigue and spots before the eyes, may also have contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 250–254, 259–260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''A Few of {{'}}the Few{{'}}'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally thought to have collided with flying wreckage from the crippled German bomber, rendering his Spitfire uncontrollable.&lt;ref name=Garrisson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bishop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Hughes accidentally rammed his target. Further speculation suggested that he was the victim of [[friendly fire]] from another British fighter attacking the same Dornier, or was struck by German bullets from a Bf&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bungay472&gt;Bungay, ''The Most Dangerous Enemy'', p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers on the ground, including [[Coal mining|collier]] Charles Hall, maintained that Hughes rammed the Dornier on purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Four days after his death, No.&amp;nbsp;234 Squadron was moved back to the relative quiet of Cornwall.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander265&gt;Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;
