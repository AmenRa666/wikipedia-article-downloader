The '''Yakovlev Yak-25''' was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military aircraft, an early turbojet-powered interceptor aircraft designed by the [[Yakovlev]] [[OKB]]. The designation was later reused for a [[Yakovlev Yak-25|different interceptor design]]. Tasked by the Council of Ministers in a directive issued on 11 March 1947, with producing a straight winged fighter similar to the earlier [[Yakovlev Yak-19|Yak-19]], but powered by a [[Rolls-Royce Derwent|Rolls-Royce Derwent V]], OKB-115 swiftly produced the Yak-25, which blazed several trails as the first Soviet fighter with a fully pressurised cockpit, air conditioning, jettisonable canopy, and hydraulic airbrakes on the fuselage amongst other innovations.&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The Yak-25 closely followed the Yak-19 in layout if not in detail. The straight wings, though similar in planform, were fractionally larger and much thinner (9% t/c throughout), using laminar flow sections. The CAHI flaps were also hydraulically powered. The vertical tail unit differed from the Yak-19 in being swept back at 40° on the leading edge, while the horizontal tail was swept back at 35 degrees.&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Derwent V engine was attached to the rear of the centre fuselage in a manner similar to the Yak-19. Though the fuselage had a different non-circular cross-section from the Yak-19, a similar double bulkhead directly behind the wing allowed the rear fuselage to be completely removed, giving access to the engine for removal or maintenance. The undercarriage was very similar to the Yak-19.&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The cockpit was very similar to the earlier Yakovlev jets, though the Yak-25 was pressurized using an air-cycle system based on engine bleed. The single aft-sliding canopy was powered. The bulletproof front windscreen was 57&amp;nbsp;mm thick, while 8&amp;nbsp;mm of armor protected the pilot from behind. The ejection seat was an improvement over the Yak-19, with a longer stroke gun, and leg restraints. Armament was also improved, with three NR-23 cannon, each with 75 rounds.&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
The Yak-25-I was given the callsign &quot;yellow 15&quot;, and had a number &quot;2&quot; painted on the airbrake rudder. It was flown in factory testing by Anokhin between 31 October 1947 and 3 July 1948.&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Flight tests followed quickly, and showed that the Yak-25 was easy to fly, and had exceptional performance and maneuverability for a straight-wing aircraft. Unfortunately it soon became clear that the laminar flow section used for the tail unit was totally unsuitable, with extremely severe buffeting setting in at 500&amp;nbsp;km/h (310&amp;nbsp;mph). Test pilot L.L. Selyakov reporting that the buffeting was so bad that he was thrown about in the cockpit, banging his head on the canopy, and the needles fell off all the flight instruments. To cure the buffeting the tail unit was replaced with one using an [[NACA 004]] aerofoil section.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon quotes 20% thickness, while NACA004 is rarely used in tail units thicker than 9%&lt;/ref&gt; Worse yet, both its rivals, the [[Lavochkin La-15]] and rival swept-wing [[MiG-15]] had superior performance. The Mig-15 was selected for mass production. Yakovlev was never again to build a single-engine fighter superior to the rival aircraft coming from Mikoyan, though neither was Lavochkin. Development was halted, but two of the prototypes were used for test and development purposes.&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Yak-25 never received an ASCC reporting name or USAF type number despite being known to the west at the time.&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental work==
Further development, replacing the straight wing with one of 35° sweepback, was undertaken as the [[Yakovlev Yak-30 (1948)|Yak-30]].&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yak-25E===
The Yak-25E (Eksperimentalnyi) was the Yak-25-I specially modified to be towed by a [[Tupolev Tu-4]] strategic bomber. This came in response to a proposal by the headquarters of Long Range Aviation, calling for a method of towing short-range jet fighters, code-named ''Burlaki'' (barge hauler).&lt;ref name=Gunston&gt;Gunston, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Production aircraft would have used [[Klimov RD-500]] engines.

At the same time the Soviets were developing the Yak-25E, the U.S. Air Force was experimenting with a similar system known as [[Project Tom-Tom]]. The U.S. system would have employed either a specially modified [[F-84]] or an [[XF-85 Goblin]] parasite aircraft. Early attempts differed by attaching two fighters to the bomber's wingtips. Later plans called for a [[parasite aircraft]] to be stowed internally within the belly of a [[B-36]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
