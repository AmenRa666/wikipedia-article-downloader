The '''Battle of Caldera Bay''', or the '''Sinking of the Blanco Encalada''', was an engagement fought in the port of [[Caldera Bay]] during the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] between Balmacedist and Congressional naval forces on 23 April 1891. It involved two [[Liberal Democratic Party (Chile)|Balmacedist]] [[torpedo boat]]s, ''[[Chilean ship Almirante Lynch (1891)|Almirante Lynch]]'' and ''[[Chilean ship Almirante Condell (1891)|Almirante Condell]]'', and the [[Government Junta of Chile (1891)|Congressional]] [[armored frigate]] [[Chilean ironclad Blanco Encalada|''Blanco Encalada'']].

After both torpedoes from ''Almirante Condell'' had missed, ''Blanco Encalada'' was hit by a torpedo from ''Almirante Lynch'' and sank in minutes, with the loss of 182 men. The loss of ''Blanco Encalada'' hindered the Congressional forces, but they ultimately defeated the Balmacedist forces that August. ''Blanco Encalada'' was the first ironclad warship lost to a [[Robert Whitehead#The first torpedo|self-propelled torpedo]]. The engagement prompted countries to rapidly grow both their torpedo boat and torpedo boat destroyer forces  (the latter commonly referred to as [[destroyer]]s).

==Background==
In 1891, after a series of struggles about [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[nitrate]] interests, Chilean President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]] refused to sign the national budget passed by the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean National Congress]]. Balmaceda then dissolved Congress.{{sfn|Hervey|1892|pp=101–102}} The dissolution split both the [[Chilean Army]] and [[Chilean Navy|Navy]], with some forces remaining loyal to Congress and others to the President. An armed conflict ensued after a mutiny by the navy, which at that time was docked at [[Valparaíso]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

Supporters of those forces loyal to Congress, including members of the dissolved parliament and their backers among multinational nitrate interests, bought weaponry from Europe and the United States. Better equipped than the forces loyal to the President, they rapidly captured Chile's northern provinces, which had recently been conquered from [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] during the [[War of the Pacific]].{{sfn|Espinosa|1891|p=9}}

Since the Congressionalists controlled all of the current ships in the Chilean Navy, the Balmacedists commandeered vessels that were nearing completion in England and France, including the torpedo boats ''Almirante Condell'' and ''Almirante Lynch''{{sfn|Espinosa|1891|p=10}} They were built by [[Laird Brothers]], the same firm that built the [[Confederate States Navy|Confederate]] raider ''Alabama'' thirty years before.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9405E0DE1730E033A2575BC0A9619C94659ED7CF|title=Chile's Great Naval Battle|date=8 July 1894|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Almirante Lynch'' and ''Almirante Condell'' carried an armament of five Whitehead torpedoes, two {{convert|14|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} guns in echelon on the forecastle and one on the poop, four {{convert|3|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} guns and two machine guns. Their maximum speed was around 21 knots.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

The two ships arrived at Valparaíso on 21 March. Both ships docked at [[Quintero|Quintero Bay]] on 18 April. While at Quintero, their commanding officers, Commander Carlos E. Moraga of the ''Almirante Condell'' and Commander Juan Fuentes of the ''Almirante Lynch'', were informed of the possibility that ''Blanco Encalada'', a Congressionalist frigate, was going to be in Caldera Bay in five days. The two commanders consulted with one another and sent their proposal to attack ''Blanco Encalada'' to the Balmacedist government, which was approved.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

''Blanco Encalada'' arrived at [[Caldera Bay]] on 22 April, under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Goñi, escorting several transports. The troops on these ships landed and captured the surrounding railroad and town of [[Copiapó]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; At about 01:20, Goñi returned to the ''Blanco Encalada''. Although it was known that Balmacedist torpedo boats were nearby, the Congressionalists believed that they would not attack the transports.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; Because of this, torpedo nets were left onshore, and watertight bulkheads which would have isolated a hull breech were left open. {{sfn|Branfill-Cook|2010|pp=173}} 

==Battle==
[[File:BlancoEncalada 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Blanco Encalada'' in 1879|alt=A three-masted black and white ship at port.]]
At 04:00 on 23 April, ''Almirante Condell'' set out toward Caldera Bay about {{convert|450|mi}}{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p=22-23}} away, with ''Almirante Lynch'' {{convert|20|yd|m}} behind her.{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p=22-23}}The armed steamer ''Imperial'' traveled with the torpedo boats, taking up a position to the left of both boats. It was to wait some distance off Caldera, in order to escort the ships back home when the attack ended. Both torpedo boats entered Caldera at roughly 3:30.{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p=22-23}} When they were {{convert|500|yd|m}} from ''Blanco Encalada'', both boats came under fire by rapid-fire guns on board the frigate, which only had seven men stationed as guards.{{sfn|Thursfield|p=138}} About {{convert|100|yd|m}} from ''Blanco Encalada'', ''Almirante Condell'' fired her bow torpedo at the Congressional [[frigate]]. It missed and landed on the shore, unexploded.{{sfn|Urruita|p=444}}  Moraga then turned the torpedo boat into the direct fire of the frigate and fired both his starboard torpedoes. The front torpedo hit, but failed to explode, and the rear torpedo passed clear under the frigate.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

As all of ''Blanco Encalada''{{'}}s guns were occupied by ''Almirante Condell'', the crew did not notice ''Almirante Lynch'' approaching from the opposite direction of ''Almirante Condell''.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; From {{convert|50|yd|m}} out, ''Almirante Lynch'' fired her bow torpedo, which missed, and then fired her forward starboard torpedo after executing a turning maneuver like ''Almirante Condell'' had done. The second torpedo struck ''Blanco Encalada'', creating a hole roughly {{convert|7|by|15|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; The ship sank within minutes, taking 182 men with it.  Several of the men who escaped, including Captain Goñi, did so by clinging to animals in ''Blanco Encalada''{{'}}s  cargo hold, including a llama and a cow. {{sfn|Branfill-Cook|2010|pp=173}} 

As she was sinking, the torpedo boats fired their [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder Hotchkiss gun]]s at the survivors, killing about forty.{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p=27}} The torpedo boats also fired at the transport ''Biobio'', which had been trying to rescue the surviving crew.{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p=27}} Including Captain Goñi, 106 men survived out of the 288 aboard.{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p=22-23}}The entire engagement lasted nine minutes, and ''Blanco Encalada'' sank two minutes after the torpedo hit.{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p=22-23}} As ''Lynch'' and ''Condell'' left the harbor, they spotted the transport ''Aconcagua'', which they attacked with their 14-pounder guns (after ruling out their Gatling guns due to their potential for [[Overkill (term)|overkill]]).{{sfn|Wilson|1897|p= 30}}{{sfn|Urruita|p=445}} The ''Aconcagua'' surrendered after an hour and a half battle, but the torpedo ships were unable to seize her due to an approaching ship which they thought was the [[Japanese cruiser Izumi|Chilean cruiser ''Esmeralda'']]. It turned out to be the [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[HMS Warspite (1884)|HMS ''Warspite'']].{{sfn|Hervey|1892|p=181}} The ''Almirante Lynch'' was slightly damaged in the battle, suffering hits to her steam-pipe and flooding in her aft compartment, but besides that, the two torpedo boats were undamaged. {{sfn|Thursfield|p=147}}

==Aftermath and impact on torpedo use==
The sinking of ''Blanco Encalada'' led to an attack by ''Almirante Condell'' and ''Almirante Lynch'' on her sister ship, the [[Chilean ironclad Almirante Cochrane|''Almirante Cochrane'']], at that time moored at [[Iquique]].{{sfn|Hervey|1892|p= 198}} ''Almirante Cochrane'' retreated before any torpedoes were fired.{{sfn|Hervey|1892|p=213}} On 28 August, the Balmacedist army was defeated at the [[Battle of La Placilla]]. Their army lost about 1,000 men, and three days later Congressional forces marched into [[Santiago]], effectively ending the Chilean Civil War.{{sfn|Forbes|1897|p=251}} The ''Blanco Encalada'' underwent some re-floating attempts after the war, which were ultimately unsuccessful, and she was left in Caldera Bay until being demolished in 1954 when a new bridge was under construction. {{sfn|Branfill-Cook|2010|pp=173}}  The Chilean government launched another ''Blanco Encalada'',  a cruiser, in 1894.{{sfn|Urruita|p=454}}

The battle had a wider impact on naval weapons development because ''Blanco Encalada'' was the first ironclad warship sunk by a [[Robert Whitehead#The first torpedo|self-propelled torpedo]].{{sfn|Scheina|1987|p=64}} News of the attack spread and as a result of the action, navies of several major powers realized the potential of torpedoes as a cheap counter to expensive pre-dreadnoughts,{{sfn|Colomb|p=434}} which led to the acceleration of submarine and torpedo boat production, the addition of torpedo nets to ships for use when they were moored in port, and the addition of torpedo tubes to surface ships. During the [[Russo-Japanese War]], over 300 self-propelled torpedoes were fired, in one instance finishing off the already seriously damaged Russian [[flagship]] [[Russian battleship Knyaz Suvorov|''Knyaz Suvorov'']] at the [[Battle of Tsushima]].{{sfn|Olender|2010|pp=235–236}} Torpedo boats also sank two [[armored cruiser]]s and two [[destroyer]]s during the course of the war.{{sfn|Olender|2010|p=234}} By the start of [[World War I]], torpedo boats and submarines were in widespread use in many navies.
