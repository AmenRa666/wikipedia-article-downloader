==Query==
Just wondering if D-day can really be called a turning point? Prior to D-day the germans being contiuously pushed back by the russians and d-day only sped up the end of the war.

:It was a turning point in that it put Nazi Germany's hold over Europe into a vice (Russia on one side, Allies on the other). It didn't just &quot;speed up the end of the war,&quot; but provided the USSR military relief in forcing the Germans to fight on two separate fronts. It is really doubtful the Russians could have taken over Europe themselves.

::I would argue against that.  The Soviet juggernaut by the time the Allies landed was seemingly quite capable of defeating the remaining of the German forces at that time (the Germans still had the vast bulk of their manpower remain on the Eastern Front after the Allies landed).  It can be argued that the Allies didn't so much land to aid the Soviets, but to prevent them from conquering all of Europe. [[User:Oberiko|Oberiko]] 13:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

== British ==

The article seems not to indicate that a substantial number of British troops were involved in the Juno Beach operations; I think they should be included - I also think their numbers warrant inclusion in the combatants section of the battlebox. I'll try and dig up sources, but this entire page needs to be footnoted - at present there are none.[[User:Michael Dorosh|Michael Dorosh]] 15:06, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

I agree with you. This article is a joke, their were actualy more British military personal then Candian. But this article makes it seem like Canadian were the only military force their.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/81.152.14.149|81.152.14.149]] ([[User talk:81.152.14.149|talk]]) 12:48, 6 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I'm not too sure where you got your information from but its wrong. The british weren't involved in Juno. Go to a library, watch a documentary -- even googling it brings up many sources saying it was stictly a Canadian beachhead.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.17.138.72|92.17.138.72]] ([[User talk:92.17.138.72|talk]]) 22:43, 28 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Your correct on the British Commando troop landing on Juno, I was unware of there effort - my mistake.

However in reality 48 commando consisted of just under 400 men meaning the ratio of Canadian to British landing forces was still around 50:1, Therefore It is looked upon as almost exclusively a Canadian landing.. If you can find any sources saying other wise please, post them. I'll do the same showing it was a Canadian beachhead

http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/ww2_home/ww2_d_day/ww2_juno_beach/index.shtml

http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/ff7_junobeach.shtml

As for other sources there are several books on the subject, i'd also suggest watching the series 'the world at war (episode 17, morning)' which highlights that Juno was indeed a Canadian beachhead, also there is a Museum just a couple of miles from the beach crediting the Canadians on the invasion. (see Junobeach.org)

As for Naval support, the Royal Navy provided support for all 5 beaches. Being British myself I've no interest in trying to discredit our efforts in the landings - but our involvement in Juno beach simply wasn't that large - or atleast not in the context of D-day. &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:To butt in here, i dont think anyone is suggesting that this was anything other than the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division's beachhead - or that it wasnt &quot;their&quot; beach. However we also know that some British troops, the commandos, did indeed land here and surely they should be credited as well? Currently, going off the articles infobox, the UK flag is placed under the Canadian one following the manuel of style which states that countries should be listed in respect to the numbers of troops they committed thus it seems ok; whats the problem?
:This same question could be raised in regards to [[Operation Tonga]], the Canadians are credited there in a reversal of this situation because of a Canadain battalion taking part. Likewise with [[Sword Beach]] and the French.
::Finally, 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was the followup force for I Corps assault divisions - did it land any of its forces on Juno?--[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 21:34, 29 January 2009 (UTC)


Yeah your right, the British should be credited in the article. The statement I really disagree on is further up this page, saying that there was more British than Canadian troops - which is absolutely miles from the truth. The 51st highland infantry, from what I can gather landed near Ouistreham (Sword beach)  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.17.138.72|92.17.138.72]] ([[User talk:92.17.138.72|talk]]) 01:05, 30 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Elements of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division did land on June beach. See [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/89/a3098289.shtml link]

this time I was a Corporal No 1 in 12 Platoon `C' company attached to 5/7 GORDON HIGHLANDERS 153 BRIGADE. We landed at 5pm 6 June on Juno Beach (3rd Canadian Division Area).

In the case of the 51st, only the G.O.C. and small reconnaissance parties were intended to
land on the 6th. Actually, the G.O.C. did not get ashore until the following day, but three

==Deaths==
if someone is able to find correct statistics on the topic of death and casualties it would be much appreciated.  the article currently reports 50% death rate of forces yet the side bar reports 1079 casualties out of 15000 soldiers which is clearly not 50%.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.73.59.3|70.73.59.3]] ([[User talk:70.73.59.3|talk]]) 00:30, 29 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Juno in 2006==
Added in some pics I took in Sept 2006 at Juno Beach; found the same bunker as shown in two of the images on this page, which was extremely well preserved especially considering it's on the coast and totally unsheltered.  In response to the Polish string above, our tour guide stated that Polish units did come ashore on or soon after D-Day, and that they even had encounters against conscript Poles fighting for the Germans.  Clearly this isn't a great source, I'll see if I can find anyting concrete to confirm this.  [[User:Burtonpe|Burtonpe]] 21:20, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

==WP:MILHIST Assessment==
I'm awarding this B-class on account of the sheer volume of information. But I think that in order to improve this article beyond B-class, some serious reorganization needs to take place. The gallery should go at the bottom, I think, and the list-style sections should be somehow condensed or converted into a nicer format. As is, they take up too much of the page in terms of vertical scroll. [[User:LordAmeth|LordAmeth]] 07:50, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

== new section ==

It is my firm belief that another section needs to be added to this page.  The point needs to be made that, although only one squadron actually reached their objective [a group of hussars that reached the Caen Railway line] the Canadians managed to get closer to their objectives than anyone else on day one.

That was just the 1st Hussars like you said

==Allied or Canadian victory==
I'm changing the result back so it reads &quot;Canadian victory&quot;. I'm not trying to disrespect any British contribution, but, in the same way that [[Sword Beach]] reads British victory despite French contributions, Juno Beach has and will always be known as the Canadian's beach, and as a result I think it should be under a Canadian victory, as are the British and American beaches for their respective countries. --[[User:Plasma Twa 2|&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Plasma&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Plasma Twa 2|&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;Twa&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Plasma Twa 2|&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;]] 07:24, 6 August 2008 (UTC)


Sword's article is a mess. It doesn't give any information about what exact French formations took part in the battle for Sword and how. For Juno, the Canadians were placed under the command of British I Corp. In other words, Sword's article is messed up because it doesn't give any information about what the French did at the beach so it shouldn't be cited as precedent.[[Special:Contributions/70.232.161.236|70.232.161.236]] ([[User talk:70.232.161.236|talk]]) 20:57, 17 September 2008 (UTC)ShaneMarsh

== Bad Need ==

This article really needs a few good maps, especially one showing the inland geography in some detail and how it ties into the attempt to capture this or that objective in the weeks going forward. The troops landed had missions... beyond getting ashore and staying alive... what were they? // &lt;b&gt;[[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 21:25, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

== Notice ==

This is just a notification to everyone concerned that I am in the process of preparing a massive rewrite of the Juno Beach article in preparation for an eventual FA run. I will also let everyone know that I have saved the Order of Battle information in my sandbox, and that I will labour to create a corresponding article at as soon a date as is possible. It will, however, be cut from my final draft, as it heavily disrupts the flow of the article. For those wondering what this rewrite will look like, it will be conceptually similar to [[Omaha Beach]] and [[Operation Perch]] (both Featured Articles). I will give 24-hour notice when my draft is finished, as well as the link to it (although I suppose that anyone who really wants to see it before then can find it easily enough).

== Article missing specilaized armour. ==

The revised version of this page is quite good, however it relies too heavily on “Juno Beach” by Mark Zuehlke for much of its content.  This book is an excellent history of the Canadian units on Juno beach, but in common with other Canadian histories, it minimizes coverage of important British units that assaulted Juno with the Canadians.
The lack of any mention of the specialized armour that was critically important to the success of the assault landing on all three of the “British” beaches is a major oversight of this page.  About 40 Churchill AVRE tanks (2 squadrons) were present on Juno beach along with 19 Sherman CRABS of the 22nd Dragoons.  On some sections of the beach, these were the first tanks ashore, providing critical support to the assaulting companies.

::Afraid not. As you have noted the official maps would call the area Juno: Juno was only the codename for a certain stetch of coastline not a specific beach.

Out of these various beaches, actual landing areas were assigned. In the specific example given Green Beach, within Nan Sector, along the coastline codenamed Juno was a landing beach for Canadian units.

== Morgan and Ike planned Overlord?  ==

I was under the impression that Morgan's original COSSAC invasion plan was greatly expanded upon (with an invasion date of June 5 not 6th, it occured on the 6th due to weather) by Monty when was brought back to the UK ... hence Morgan and SHAEF did not plan Overlord ... ?

== needs claification ==

&quot;A second line of four infantry companies and one panzer company was stationed {{convert|1|mi|km}} inland.&lt;ref name=saunders42/&gt; Rommel also deployed the [[21st Panzer Division]] southeast of Caen to act as a counterattack against landings in that sector.&lt;ref name=saunders43&gt;Saunders, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Two battalions of Polish and Russian conscripts were also stationed on the flanks of Juno adjacent to Sword and Gold Beaches.&lt;ref name=saunders44&gt;Saunders, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

Since the 716th did not have a panzer element (bar its Panzerjagers) is it correct to assume that Saunders is referring to elements of the 21st Panzer that was moved closer to the beach? If so, this needs to be clarifed as the above implies that the 716th had a panzer element.

== inaccurate statement ==

&quot;The counterattack did not succeed in driving the British off of the beaches, as units of the British 6th Airborne Division—which had landed the previous night near the Orne river—were able to outflank the 21st and force it to withdraw.[148]&quot;

It may be sourced by Keegan but the above is inaccurate on several levels:
#Elements of 21st Panzer made it to the beaches on the flanks of the British (see any general history of the campaign)
#3rd Infantry fought off 21st Panzer counterattacks, one could argue actually halted the 21st Panzer attack in its tracks (any book on Sword)
#6th Airborne did not outfank the division: they landed to protect the flank of 3rd Infantry and did not move to attack 21st Panzer. The main weight of the 21st attack was towards 3rd Infantry. 6th Airborne did indeed fight off counterattacks all day long and distracted the division(D-Day the first 72 hours (iirc) is a good source on this), and due its capture and destuction of several bridges forced further delays on their main attack.[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 03:54, 10 July 2011 (UTC)

== What happened to the reference to the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division? ==

Seems it is at least worth a mention that follow forces started landing on the beach during D-Day, it was referenced with reliable sources. One would suggest that the Aftermath section could also do with some info on what the beach was used for post-D-Day.

How could you hit something inaccurately? How about changing 'were hit accurately' to 'were destroyed'?[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 09:28, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

== Notes ==

*Since [[Courseulles-sur-Mer]] in the Juno sector is the next village over from [[Arromanches]] in Gold, and since [[No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando]] landed so far west on Sword, I don't think it's a stretch to combine the second and third sentences, and I have (feel free to revert): &quot;The sector spanned from [[Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados|Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer]], just east of the British [[Gold Beach|Gold]] sector, to [[Courseulles-sur-Mer]], just west of the British [[Sword Beach|Sword]] sector.&quot; We don't need to repeat &quot;France&quot; and &quot;Normandy&quot;. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 14:04, 24 July 2011 (UTC)
*One change to the above: my milhist sources say &quot;Saint-Aubin&quot; rather than &quot;Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer&quot; (and the same for Courseulles).  Although Brits may get the analogy to British cities immediately ([[Newcastle upon Tyne]] can be shortened to [[Newcastle]] as soon as it's clear from context), American cities don't generally undergo the same transformation.  The French Wikipedia acknowledges that [[fr:Saint-Aubin|Saint-Aubin]], for example, can refer to the city we're talking about.  If our readers need explanation, I'd rather explain the point in the article about the city, rather than in our article about Juno Beach, and stick with the name more commonly used in our sources, Saint-Aubin. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 00:43, 25 July 2011 (UTC)
**[[fr:Courseulles-sur-Mer]] (in the French Wikipedia) illustrates the point ... it's &quot;Courseulles&quot; in the second sentence.  FWIW, the article notes that the &quot;Mer&quot; was added to the name of the town in 1957. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 03:04, 25 July 2011 (UTC)
**[[fr:Bernières-sur-Mer]] is tougher ... there are 3 towns in Calvados named Bernières, I don't know when the &quot;Mer&quot; was added, and ''Fields of Fire'' for instance lists the town both ways.  I'll add the &quot;Mer&quot; back and keep searching. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 03:18, 25 July 2011 (UTC)
**Grr, there are 2 other towns in Calvados named Saint-Aubin.  I'll keep checking what the sources say. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 03:36, 25 July 2011 (UTC)

::Okay I've got a bunch of sources here now, and all of them are usually using the shorter forms.  I added a note with 3 cites.  (It's a good excuse to get Ambrose and Ryan into the bibliography, too.)  On &quot;Saint-Aubin&quot; as opposed to St.-Aubin, St. Aubin or St Aubin: that's the official spelling, and if we stick with that, it's only 2 characters longer, and we avoid arguments over which of the shortened forms is best. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 19:14, 27 July 2011 (UTC)
*Obviously, WP:UNDUE and WP:N won't allow us to tell the personal stories of 100 servicemen in this article or in subarticles ... OTOH, the article feels dry to me, like a general's-eye view of the conflict, compared with the sources, which are rich in details that give a more immediate and more real picture.  FAC tends to become unmanageable when an article gets too long, so I don't want to put a lot more in this article, but I'm looking for opportunities for sub-articles that flesh things out a bit ... perhaps biographical articles. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]])
*One of the stories that needs to get told, either in this article or some other, is that up through at least 1991, and still today, a little bit, the leading historians had the performance of Normandy troops in general and the Canadian troops at Juno in particular spectacularly wrong (saying only 15% fired their weapons for instance), and were taking a very don't-confuse-me-with-the-facts attitude. It took Copp, Ambrose and others to set the record straight.  How military history can go so wrong is one thing military historians study (we've got a &quot;historiography&quot; tag at Milhist for this kind of thing). I'll be happy to collaborate on an article if anyone's interested. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 11:01, 28 July 2011 (UTC)

There's a world of difference between a historian and a writer. The sources have always been there but it's not always the case that publishers want to risk the truth when they can print the legend.[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 16:46, 28 July 2011 (UTC)

*&quot;Falaise, which could then be used as a pivot for a swing right to advance on Argentan, the Touques River and then towards the Seine River&quot;: those are a left pivot after heading south to Falaise; did the sources say they pivoted right? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 18:45, 8 August 2011 (UTC)
*:Correct left pivot, when writing it up i must have noted the talk about the right wing of the army and mixed it up a bit. Good catch.
*I'm lost here.  What does &quot;Company, 736th Grenadier Regiment&quot; mean in the infobox?  If all of the 716th Division troops were in the 736th Regiment, why do we say &quot;On Juno the 716th deployed four infantry companies: 7 Kompanie held what was to become &quot;Mike Sector&quot;, 6/736 was stationed in Courseulles, 5/736 at Bernières, while the fifth and ninth Grenadier companies held &quot;Nan Sector&quot; and Saint-Aubin.&quot;, which seems to say that 7 Kompanie wasn't in the 736th?  And was 5 Kompanie at Bernières, or Nan, or Saint-Aubin, or all three? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 01:06, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
**7 Kompanie was at Vers Sur Mer on Gold beach according to Kershaw D-Day p.431
:From left to right he has: 6/736 Couselles, 5/736 Bernieres, 9/736 St Aubin

::No the page is a diagram of the three Anglo-Canadian beaches. The locations of the 12 companies of the 736 are all displayed.

:::That clears it up thanks, so I'll change that &quot;716th&quot; (Division) to &quot;736th Grenadier Regiment&quot; since they're all in that regiment.

*Almost finished with copyediting now.  Several of the sentences had information different than the sources, and that's always going to be a problem with articles on Normandy, because sources often differ on the facts, because the interviewees differed on the facts ... they were often drugged (seasickness pills, mostly) and seasick (the pills didn't help a lot) and charging straight into hell, and they didn't have a lot of time to look around and admire the view.  So it may not be our fault, but I really think we need to check this against the sources before we take it to FAC.

I'm confused, does Zuehlke back up the new information, or not? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 03:53, 16 August 2011 (UTC)
** No he doesn't.  I used another source, but now my thinking is any referances to Canadian minesweepers should probably be removed from the article, as they dont really relate to Juno beach specifically.  All Canadian minesweepers were part of the &quot;Western Naval Task Force&quot; (The 2 US Beaches) They certainly had nothing to do with Juno Beach.

== Liberate Paris within 90 days ... ==

What exactly does the source (Grant, p. 18) state on this? As far as i was aware there was no actual objective for +90 days, only lines drawn on the map where the planners expected the troops to be due to supply issues. As we can see below by D-Day +90 Paris is not liberated due to those supply/plan concerns, so what does the source actually say?

&quot;This great turning movement would bring the Allied line forward to the Seine on a 140-mile front. General Montgomery afterwards commented on the &quot;academic&quot; nature of forecasts in an operation of this magnitude. Nevertheless, the Allied planners had some hope, if not expectation, that their troops would reach the Seine and the Loire 90 days after the initial assault.43 This tentative forecast was closely connected with the administrative aspects of the planning.&quot;(Stacey, p. 83)[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 07:32, 28 October 2011 (UTC)

== SP Guns ==

Re: D-Day landings / Early bombardment section

&quot;Additional firepower was provided by eight landing craft fitted with over 1,000 high-explosive rockets and 24 LCTs, each carrying four M7 Priest self-propelled guns.[52]&quot;

Were the SP guns actually Sextons, not Priests? Seems logical that the would be and this is from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexton_(artillery):

&quot;Later Sextons took part in the invasion of France and subsequent Battle of Normandy and the campaign in north-western Europe. During the D-day landings a number of Sextons were ordered to fire from their landing craft as they approached the beaches although the fire did not prove to be very accurate.[1]&quot;

*The four Canadian Artillery regiments used on Juno, the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 19th Field Artillery Regiments, RCA were all re-equipped with M7 Priests before D-Day.  Its very well documented in the official Canadian histories.  These are the same priests that were &quot;defrocked&quot; and converted to Kangaroos for operation Totalize in August.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_(armoured_personnel_carrier)  Although the Sexton was used by the Artillery Regiments of the British armoured divisions in Normandy, none of them were present during the initial assault on D-Day.  That portion of the cited reference from the Sexton article is incorrect, at least for JUNO.

== Naval and Air support at the beaches. ==

Perhaps a bit nitpicking but given the infobox inclusion for naval support at Omaha (and now Utah): the Free French cruiser Montcalm also supported Omaha (and may have been the first allied ship to open fire on Omaha), Canadian Minesweepers were (I believe) the first to come close inshore at Omaha, and Norwegian and Polish ships gave naval support in the British and Canadian sectors. These are just a few of the inconsistencies with the infobox inclusions/exclusions for the Normandy Invasion Beach articles. I am noting this here instead of editing because I realize the sensitivity of many folk to these issues. Why are these support issues recognized in some beach articles and not others?
