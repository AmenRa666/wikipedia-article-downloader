== POV Tag ==

As per the DYK discussion, there's [[WP:SYNTH]] involved and most of this article does not follow NPOV.

== Former home ministry official statement ==

I have also removed this conspiracy theory which was inserted by 79.170.54.190[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inter-Services_Intelligence_activities_in_India&amp;diff=605416483&amp;oldid=570107392] on 23 April without discussion. In its current form, the conspiracy or more like very isolated theory is being presented like it is the final report. There was an edit conflict concerning this theory on [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] a while ago. [[User:OccultZone|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkBlue;&quot;&gt;Occult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Zone&lt;/span&gt;''']] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:OccultZone#Top|Talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/OccultZone|Contributions]] • [[Special:Log/OccultZone|Log]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:56, 16 January 2015 (UTC)
:Also that he has not taken the responsibility of this statement, he rather referred to someone who is not even a part of the team anymore. [[WP:SOAPBOX]]. [[User:OccultZone|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkBlue;&quot;&gt;Occult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Zone&lt;/span&gt;''']] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:OccultZone#Top|Talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/OccultZone|Contributions]] • [[Special:Log/OccultZone|Log]])&lt;/small&gt; 10:18, 17 January 2015 (UTC)
:: You can't simply delete content sourced from a national newspaper. If you are convinced that there were no further references to this information in reliable sources, then you can reword it so that its weight is reduced. [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 11:15, 17 January 2015 (UTC)
:::How this statement is even important? None of these 2 had any involvement in the investigation and the such statement seems to be giving so much weight that it would convince reader to believe as an official or significantly accepted. It was largely a part of political conflict than it was actually a part of investigation. [[User:OccultZone|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkBlue;&quot;&gt;Occult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Zone&lt;/span&gt;''']] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:OccultZone#Top|Talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/OccultZone|Contributions]] • [[Special:Log/OccultZone|Log]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:31, 17 January 2015 (UTC)
:::: If it is regarded as a conspiracy theory in India, it can be attributed as such. There's very weak grounds for removal since it is a controversial and notable statement. Perhaps it could be reworded as Kautilya mentioned, in order to adjust [[WP:WEIGHT]]. It's not up to us to decide what goes in or what goes out; if the sources say it, it ought to be included. Neither is it up to us to decide what constitutes a conspiracy theory. For example, the notion that the ISI is involved in the Mumbai attacks itself can be called a conspiracy theory because it is only the position of the Indian government, and the Pakistani government rejects the accusations as invalid. Even that ought to be mentioned. '''[[User:Mar4d|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Mar4d&lt;/font&gt;]]''' ([[User talk:Mar4d|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]) 12:57, 17 January 2015 (UTC)
::::: Can you back up each of your new ideas? We cannot reword a meaningless conspiracy theory that is rejected even in Pakistan as one of the &quot;wackiest ideas&quot;.[http://tribune.com.pk/story/11701/will-the-real-zaid-hamid-please-stand-up/] An allegation that was founded after a significant investigation and it was published not only by the Pakistani media but also by the foreign media(CNN) is not a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy theory when it has no basis or any connection with the official investigation and it is made under the political pressure. Pakistani government doesn't say that India had staged any of these attacks, neither any of their own investigation revealed. [[User:OccultZone|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkBlue;&quot;&gt;Occult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Zone&lt;/span&gt;''']] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:OccultZone#Top|Talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/OccultZone|Contributions]] • [[Special:Log/OccultZone|Log]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:42, 17 January 2015 (UTC)

After digging into this a bit, [http://www.firstpost.com/india/ishrat-jahan-case-is-satish-verma-a-crazed-conspiracy-theorist-955643.html], what I find is that a lone CBI official, Satish Varma, allegedly &quot;believed&quot; that IB orchestrated the Mumbai attacks and the Parliament attack, supposedly because they would lead to stronger anti-terror legislation in India. This was cited by a Home ministry official to accuse Varma of being crazed conspiracy theorist. Varma himself didn't say anything of the sort in public. While I can see how something like this would cause a sensation in Pakistan, my feeling is that there is nothing wiki-worthy here. Somebody said that somebody believed something. There is no evidence of any kind. (Media in India wrote it off as part of the unfortunate tussles between the CBI and IB, and can't find anything more about it.)
