'''Wilfred Stanley (Wilf) Arthur''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (7&amp;nbsp;December 1919&amp;nbsp;– 23&amp;nbsp;December 2000) was a [[flying ace|fighter ace]] and senior officer of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War&amp;nbsp;II. Commonly known as &quot;Woof&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;Alexander, &quot;Cleaning the augean stables&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clash of Eagles&quot;&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes &quot;Wolf&quot; or &quot;Wulf&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Waters, ''Valiant Youth'', extract cited at [http://www.3squadron.org.au/subpages/wilfarthur.htm 3 Squadron Association Official Site]. Retrieved 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 81, 127&lt;/ref&gt; he was officially credited with ten aerial victories. As a commander, he led combat formations at [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] and [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] level, becoming at 24 the youngest [[group captain]] in the history of the RAAF.

Arthur joined the Air Force the day after Australia declared war in September 1939. He first saw action with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], where he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for shooting down four aircraft in a single [[sortie]]. Posted to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], he commanded first [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]], and later [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;81]] and [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|78&amp;nbsp;Wings]]. He earned the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for continuing to lead an attack on a formation of Japanese bombers after discovering that his guns were inoperable, and was twice [[mentioned in despatches]]. Arthur also played a leading part in—and gave name to—the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; of April 1945. Pursuing various interests in Australia and Vietnam following his discharge from the Air Force after the war, he died in 2000 at the age of 81.

==Education and early career==
[[File:P00405.001Arthur1940b.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Arthur (front row, second from right) with fellow cadets and instructors at Richmond, 1940]]
Wilfred Arthur was the son of stock inspector Stanley Oswald Darley Arthur from [[Goondiwindi, Queensland|Goondiwindi]], Queensland, a veteran of World War&amp;nbsp;I who had served overseas for the duration of the conflict.&lt;ref name=Stokes3&gt;Arthur; Stokes, &quot;Wilfred Arthur, 75 Squadron RAAF&quot;, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=File176&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=5375226|title=Confidential Folder&amp;nbsp;– Arthur, Wilfred Stanley|author=[[Royal Australian Air Force]]|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|pages=176–178|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Helena Elizabeth Chaffers, was from the [[Isle of Wight]], of Welsh descent.&lt;ref name=File176/&gt; Born in [[Sydney]] on 7&amp;nbsp;December 1919, Wilf grew up around his father's home town near the [[New South Wales]] border. The boy's early education was by correspondence, but he later attended school at [[Yelarbon, Queensland|Yelarbon]], Queensland, commuting on horseback. He then spent four-and-a-half years at [[The Scots PGC College|The Scots College]] in [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]], where he [[Matriculation|matriculated]].&lt;ref name=Stokes3/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/03.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 19 and still at The Scots College, Arthur applied to join the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He enlisted on 4&amp;nbsp;September 1939, the day after [[Military history of Australia during World War II|Australia's entry into World War&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seek and Strike&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''Seek and Strike'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria, and [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, he was commissioned a [[pilot officer]] on 30&amp;nbsp;March 1940, despite being prone to [[airsickness]] early on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur; Stokes, &quot;Wilfred Arthur, 75 Squadron RAAF&quot;, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; He served initially with [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22 (City of Sydney) Squadron]] at Richmond, operating [[Hawker Demon]]s and [[Avro Anson]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM DFC&quot;&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/REL27812.002 Distinguished Flying Cross: Flight Lieutenant W S Arthur, 3 Squadron, RAAF] at Australian War Memorial.

==Combat service==

===North Africa===
[[File:021809Arthur1941.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Flight Lieutenant Arthur draped in a German flag following action on 30&amp;nbsp;November 1941, when he shot down four enemy aircraft to win the DFC]]
Promoted to [[flying officer]], Arthur was posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron]] and departed with the unit for [[North African campaign|North Africa]] in July 1940. Piloting a [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane, he scored his first aerial victory by shooting down an Italian [[Fiat CR.42]] north-west of Sofafi, Egypt, on 12&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he himself was shot down by a CR.42 and had to bail out, narrowly avoiding disaster when he became entangled first with his oxygen hose and then with the Gladiator's wing-bracing wires; he was only torn loose at a height of {{convert|1,000|ft|m}} by the force of rushing air as his stricken plane fell to earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladiator&quot;&gt;Thomas, ''Gloster Gladiator Aces'', pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur claimed one further victim in a Gladiator before his unit re-equipped with [[Hawker Hurricane]]s in January 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladiator&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3Sqn&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11023second_world_war.asp 3 Squadron] at Australian War Memorial.

No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron began replacing its Hurricanes with [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Tomahawks]] in May 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;3Sqn&quot;/&gt; In October, Arthur was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] and appointed a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt; He shot down four enemy aircraft in a single [[sortie]] near Bir&amp;nbsp;El&amp;nbsp;Gubi on 30&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM DFC&quot;/&gt;  Flying one of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron's new Tomahawks, he claimed two [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;87 ''Stukas'']], one [[Fiat G.50]] and one [[Macchi C.200|Macchi MC.200]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clash of Eagles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  He destroyed the last of the four after his plane had been damaged and he was on his way back to base; he had to land in the desert and make his way to the airfield on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt;  His &quot;great skill and gallantry&quot; in this action earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC), which was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35425|supp=yes|startpage=344|date=20 January 1942|accessdate= 29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, Arthur met his future wife, Lucille, in a shop in [[Alexandria]]. They married on 24&amp;nbsp;December 1941 and honeymooned in Palestine and Syria. The sudden romance came as a shock to Arthur's parents; he later recalled, &quot;the first letter I got was a fair imitation of panic I think&quot;. While on leave, he was also able to make contact with his brother Norman, who was serving as a [[military police]]man in [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur; Stokes, &quot;Wilfred Arthur, 75 Squadron RAAF&quot;, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brother&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm108/awm108-0-0649.pdf Roll of Honour - Norman George Arthur] at Australian War Memorial.

[[File:P02821.004Polly.jpg|thumb|left|280px|P-40 Kittyhawk &quot;Polly&quot;, which Squadron Leader Arthur was flying when he earned the DSO in April 1943]]
As the Japanese advanced in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]], [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur was posted to No. 76 Squadron in April, flying [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawks]] in [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM DFC&quot;/&gt; His brother Norman was killed in action on 9 November 1942 while serving with the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Infantry Battalion]] in [[Territory of Papua|Papua]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brother&quot;/&gt; Promoted to [[squadron leader]], in February 1943 Wilf succeeded [[Leslie Douglas Jackson|Les Jackson]] as commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron, based at [[Milne Bay]] under the control of [[No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group RAAF]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/02.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 23–24, 35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur developed a reputation for diligence, courtesy, and concern for the welfare of his men. Despite the fact that, at 23, he was the youngest officer in his new squadron, he commanded the respect of his fellows because, he believed, &quot;they like that I work hard; they like that I am not frightened of anything (i.e. ''Pretends'' not to be) and above those, they like that I don't boast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 268, 320&lt;/ref&gt; Having shot down a [[Mitsubishi G4M|Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot;]] bomber on 10&amp;nbsp;March,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his &quot;gallantry, matchless leadership and devotion to duty&quot; on 14&amp;nbsp;April 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36027|supp=yes|startpage=2322|date=25 May 1943|accessdate= 29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/REL27812.001 Distinguished Service Order: Squadron Leader W S Arthur, 75 Squadron, RAAF] at Australian War Memorial.

Fortunately nobody else would know except me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt; To compensate for his lack of offensive weaponry, he repeatedly made as though attempting to ram one of the raiders, to try and force it down into the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;

Promoted acting [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]], which controlled No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron and three other combat units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seek and Strike&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt; On 5&amp;nbsp;November, he was involved in a collision at [[Kiriwina]] Airfield with a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] of [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Squadron]]. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/06.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; He later recalled, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;was just flames&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;And then all of a sudden the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur; Stokes, &quot;Wilfred Arthur, 75 Squadron RAAF&quot;, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Although his family was informed that his injuries were &quot;of a very slight nature&quot; and that he had been &quot;burnt but not badly&quot;, Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 329–330&lt;/ref&gt;  He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent [[plastic surgery]] at Yaralla Military Hospital (now [[Concord Repatriation General Hospital|Concord Hospital]]).

In April 1945, having recently assumed command of No.&amp;nbsp;1 TAF's [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]], Arthur helped trigger an incident that became known as the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; (a phrase originating in one of his ''aide memoires'' at the time). He was one of eight senior pilots, including Australia's top-scoring ace, Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], and fellow veterans from the North African campaign, [[Bobby Gibbes]] and [[John Lloyd Waddy|John Waddy]], who attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Frustrated at the lack of attention paid by Headquarters No.&amp;nbsp;1 TAF to a &quot;balance sheet&quot; he produced showing that operational losses outweighed results, Arthur later said that his object for the &quot;mutiny&quot; was to &quot;make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected.&quot; A government inquiry into the incident exonerated the pilots, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens 2&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur remained in charge of No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing for the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Battle of Tarakan]], which commenced on 1&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 453]&lt;/ref&gt; He handed over command of the wing on 24&amp;nbsp;May, but remained on Tarakan until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;No. 78 Wing Headquarters, &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur; Stokes, &quot;Wilfred Arthur, 75 Squadron RAAF&quot;, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to receiving the DFC and DSO, Arthur was twice [[mentioned in despatches]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=374160 Awarded: Mention in Despatches (1 January 1942)] at Australian War Memorial.
