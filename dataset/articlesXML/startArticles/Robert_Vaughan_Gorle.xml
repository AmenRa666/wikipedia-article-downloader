'''Robert Vaughan Gorle''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]]  (6 May 1896 &amp;ndash; 9 January 1937) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

Gorle was born in [[Southsea]] on 6 May 1896 and educated at [[Malvern College]] and [[Rugby School]]. Prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] was a farmer in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=Michael|title=Victoria Cross Heroes|date=2007|publisher=Headline Review |isbn=978 0 7553 1633 5|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorle was a temporary [[lieutenant]] in &quot;A&quot; Battery, 50th Brigade, [[Royal Field Artillery]], [[British Army]] at [[Ledegem|Ledeghem]], [[Belgium]], during the First World War when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. According to [[VCs of the First World War: The Final Days 1918]] by By Gerald Gliddon, Young Mr Gorle won his award on the 1st October. It was the fourth and last battle of Ypres when 50th Brigade supported an attack at the village of Ledegham. The attack began at 06H15 for about 30 minutes of artillery fire. Neither allied troops to the left or right of the British troops had been able to make any progress against the enemy, even with the artillery. This resulted in the line of British troops faltering and beginning to retreat to the north of Ledegham. Upon seeing this, Mr Gorle took it upon himself to charge his gun at the enemy and fire over open sights, ot once but three times. When the 38th (Ulster) division saw such gallantry and bravery in the face of the enemy infantry, they rallied to Gorle, and his men with the 18-pounder, and overcame the enemy machine gunner nests on Hill 41. Gorle was decorated nine months and 18 days later in the Quadrangle of Buckingham Palace by King George VI on 19 June 1919. It was a proud moment for his family after his father, Major Harry Vaughan Gorle D.S.O A.S.C., had only narrowly missed being awarded the V.C. too, receiving instead, the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] for his efforts in the Boer Wars in South Africa.

His citation in the [[London Gazette]] of 14 December 1918 reads:
{{quote|For most conspicuous bravely, initiative and devotion to duty during the attack on Ledeghem. on 1st October, 1918, when in command of an 18-pdr. gun working in close conjunction with infantry. He brought his gun into action in the most exposed positions on four separate occasions, and disposed of enemy machine guns by firing over open sights under direct machine-gun fire at 500 to 600 yards' range. Later, seeing that the infantry were being driven back by intense hostile fire, he, without hesitation, galloped his gun in front of the leading infantry, and on two occasions knocked out enemy machine guns which were causing the trouble. His disregard of  personal safety and dash were a magnificent example to the wavering line, which rallied and re-took the northern end of the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31067|date=13 December 1918 |startpage=14775|endpage=|supp=yes |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the war Gorle returned to Africa, eventually settling in [[Southern Rhodesia]] where he was appointed as [[Sergeant-at-Arms]] to the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly]]. He died on 9 January 1937 of [[yellow fever]] and was buried in Stellawood Cemetery, [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gliddon|first1=Gerald|title=VCs of the First World War: The Final Days 1918|date=2014|publisher=The History Press|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IJ2tAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;dq=gorle+vc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YCYTVambIczdauS1gIgL&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=gorle%20vc&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the [[Imperial War Museum]], London after being purchased privately in 1993 through an agent for an unknown private seller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lordashcroftmedals.com/collection/robert-vaughan-gorle-vc/ Lord Ashcroft Medals]&lt;/ref&gt;
