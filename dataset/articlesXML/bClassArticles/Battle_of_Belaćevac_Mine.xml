The '''Battle of Belaćevac Mine'''{{efn|{{lang-al|Beteja e Bardhit të Madh}}; {{lang-sh|Bitka za Belaćevački rudnik}}; [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: Битка за Белаћевачки рудник}} was a week-long clash between the [[Army of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] (VJ), Serbian police (MUP) and the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) in June 1998, during the [[Kosovo War]]. It was fought over the [[Belaćevac coal mine|Belaćevac]] [[Coal mining|coal mine]], which powered two [[generating station]]s that supplied electricity to most of Kosovo.

The KLA seized the mine on 22 June, taking nine [[Serbs|Serb]] mineworkers hostage, converting the mine into a base of operations and taunting the Yugoslav authorities by sending daylight patrols within sight of the provincial capital, [[Pristina]]. Over the next seven days, Yugoslav authorities and the KLA negotiated over the fate of the mineworkers. Once negotiations broke down, the VJ and MUP attacked the mine and forced the KLA out. Ten militants were killed in the clashes. The VJ and MUP reported suffering no casualties. Though the mine was recaptured, the hostages were nowhere to be found, and it is assumed they were killed by the militants. As of June 2014, the location of the mineworkers' remains is unknown. No one has ever been convicted of their deaths.

==Background==
Following [[World War II]], [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] was given the status of an autonomous province within the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], one of six constitutional republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Judah|year=2002|title=Kosovo: War and Revenge|publisher=Yale University Press|location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]]|isbn=978-0-300-09725-2|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sVf1na3FN_UC&amp;hl=en|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Yugoslavia's long-time leader ([[Josip Broz Tito]]) in 1980, Yugoslavia's political system began to unravel.&lt;ref&gt;Judah, pp. 38–9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, [[Belgrade]] revoked Kosovo's autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeBor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Adam LeBor]]|year=2002|title=Milosevic: A Biography|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-300-10317-5|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZgLko7wjK04C|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo, a province inhabited predominantly by ethnic [[Albanians]], was of great historical and cultural significance to [[Serbs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miranda Vickers|year=1999|title=The Albanians: A Modern History|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=New York|isbn=978-1-86064-541-9|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had formed a majority there before the mid-19th century, but by 1990 represented only about 10 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Summers|editor=James Summers|year=2011|title=Kosovo: A Precedent?|chapter=Kosovo: From Yugoslav Province to Disputed Independence|publisher=BRILL|location=[[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]]|isbn=978-90-474-2943-2|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oW2ad7wfz_YC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed by their dwindling numbers, the province's Serbs began to fear that they were being &quot;squeezed out&quot; by the Albanians, and ethnic tensions worsened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jasminka Udovički|author2=James Ridgeway|title=Burn This House: The Making and Unmaking of Yugoslavia|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2000|location=[[Durham, North Carolina]]|isbn=978-0-8223-2590-1|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=GuGe9fy4raoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as Kosovo's autonomy was abolished, a minority government run by Serbs and Montenegrins was appointed by Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] to oversee the province, enforced by thousands of heavily armed paramilitaries from Serbia-proper. Albanian culture was systematically repressed and hundreds of thousands of Albanians working in state-owned companies lost their jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeBor&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, a group of Albanian nationalists calling themselves the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) began attacking the [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|Vojska Jugoslavije}}; VJ) and the Serbian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|links=no|Ministarstvo unutrašnjih poslova}}; MUP) in Kosovo. Their goal was to separate the province from the rest of [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], which following the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1991–92, was just a rump federation consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. At first, the KLA carried out hit-and-run attacks (31 in 1996, 55 in 1997, and 66 in January and February 1998 alone).&lt;ref&gt;Judah, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly gained popularity among young Kosovo Albanians, many of whom rejected the non-violent resistance to Yugoslav authorities advocated by the politician [[Ibrahim Rugova]] and favoured a more aggressive approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dušan Janjić|editor1=Charles W. Ingrao|editor2=Thomas A. Emmert|year=2012|title=Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative|chapter=Kosovo under the Milošević Regime|edition=2|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=[[West Lafayette, Indiana]]|isbn=978-1-55753-617-4|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IDMhDgCJCe0C&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization received a significant boost in 1997, when an [[Albanian Rebellion of 1997|armed uprising]] in neighbouring [[Albania]] led to thousands of weapons from the [[Albanian Army]]'s depots being looted. Many of these weapons ended up in the hands of the KLA, which already had substantial resources due its involvement in the trafficking of drugs, weapons and people, as well as through donations from the Albanian diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;Judah, pp. x, 127–30&lt;/ref&gt;

The KLA's popularity skyrocketed after the VJ and MUP [[Attack on Prekaz|attacked]] the compound of KLA leader [[Adem Jashari]] in March 1998, killing him, his closest associates and most of his family. The attack prompted thousands of young Kosovo Albanians to join the ranks of the KLA, fueling the Kosovar uprising that eventually erupted in the spring of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Judah, pp. 138–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
On 22 June 1998, the KLA seized the [[Belaćevac coal mine|Belaćevac]] open-pit [[Coal mining|coal mine]], near the town of [[Obilić]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Abrahams|author2=Elizabeth Andersen|year=1998|title=Humanitarian Law Violations in Kosovo|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56432-194-7|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vELQpx1U9EcC|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located about {{convert|10|km}} west of the Kosovan capital, [[Pristina]], Belaćevac was strategically important because it supplied coal to two of Kosovo's most important power plants, which in turn provided electricity to most of province.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=New Serb offensive in Kosovo|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/122425.stm|date=30 June 1998|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack represented the most serious challenge to the Yugoslav establishment since fighting erupted earlier in the year, not only because of the mine's strategic significance but also because of its close proximity to Pristina.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Chris Hedges]]|publisher=The New York Times|title=Serbians Unleash Series of Heavy Attacks Against Albanian Separatists|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/europe/063098kosovo.html|date=30 June 1998|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Irish Times|title=Animals take over village that changed hands twice|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/animals-take-over-village-that-changed-hands-twice-1.169028|date=2 July 1998|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering the mine, the militants took a number of Serb mineworkers hostage, halting production.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1&quot;/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] identified the nine captives as Dušan Ađančić, Pero Ađančić, Zoran Ađančić, Mirko Buha, Filip Gojković, Božidar Lempić, Srboljub Savić, Mirko Trifunović and Dragan Vukmirović.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW&quot;/&gt; Some of the militants were armed with [[automatic weapons]], but most carried hunting rifles.

The KLA taunted the authorities by sending daylight patrols within sight of Pristina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornwell&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Rupert Cornwell|publisher=The Independent|title=New offensive dashes ceasefire hopes|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/new-offensive-dashes-ceasefire-hope-1168593.html|date=29 June 1998|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighters set up roadblocks, checkpoints and anti-sniper screens. Their heaviest weapons were two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and a {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} machine gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hundley&quot;/&gt; They forced the mineworkers to dig trenches separating the KLA from Yugoslav positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Walker|publisher=The Times|title=Guerrillas in Kosovo 'killed mine hostages'|date=1 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the mine was taken, Yugoslav authorities entered into negotiations with the KLA over the fate of the hostages.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW&quot;/&gt; The Yugoslavs also erected roadblocks of their own, closed off the road leading to Belaćevac, and surrounded the mine with snipers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philly&quot;/&gt;

Negotiations between the authorities and the KLA over the fate of the hostages apparently broke down just prior to the Yugoslav counterattack.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times&quot;/&gt; Backed by armoured vehicles, artillery and a number of tanks,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornwell&quot;/&gt; hundreds of VJ and MUP personnel moved to recapture Belaćevac beginning on 29 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Webb|year=2008|title=The Routledge Companion to Central and Eastern Europe Since 1919|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-13406-521-9|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qQZ9AgAAQBAJ|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first day, Yugoslav forces had advanced to within {{convert|600|ft}} of the mine.

==Aftermath==
The battle resulted in the deaths of 10 KLA militants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;/&gt; The Yugoslavs reported suffering no casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times&quot;/&gt; The KLA claimed two Kosovo Albanian civilians—an eight-year-old boy and a man—were killed in the clashes, and six injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Hurriyet Daily News|title=KLA rebels regroup in west Kosovo|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/kla-rebels-regroup-in-west-kosovo.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=kla-rebels-regroup-in-west-kosovo-1998-07-02|date=2 July 1998|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslav authorities confirmed that an eight-year-old boy had been killed in shelling near the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;/&gt; By 1 July, the mine was reportedly back in operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFE&quot;/&gt; The same day, Western journalists attempting to enter Belaćevac were attacked by a mob of angry Serb civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1&quot;/&gt;

Upon re-entering the mine, Yugoslav authorities found that the hostages had vanished, apparently taken by the group of KLA fighters that had retreated from Belaćevac prior to its capture. They are thought to have been executed by the militants.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times&quot;/&gt; Their families have since set up an organization dedicated to bringing the kidnappers to justice, and if possible, locating the missing mineworkers' remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Voice of Serbia|title=A gathering in Gracanica in memory of Serbs kidnapped in Kosmet 11 years ago|url=http://glassrbije.org/E/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=26&amp;limit=15&amp;limitstart=105|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mineworkers' whereabouts are unknown as of June 2014, as is the location of their remains (if any).
