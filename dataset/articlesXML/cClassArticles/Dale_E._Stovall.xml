'''Dale E. Stovall''' (born February 19, 1944&lt;ref name=militarytimes/&gt;) is a retired [[Brigadier General]] in the [[United States Air Force]] who figured prominently in several [[combat search and rescue|search and rescue]] operations during the [[Vietnam War]]. A member of the [[40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] based in Thailand, on June 2, 1972, he recovered Maj. [[Roger Locher]] from deep inside [[North Vietnam]], the deepest rescue made during the entire Vietnam War. For his efforts in rescuing Locher, Stovall was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]], which described how &quot;he willingly returned to this high threat area, braving intense ground fire, to recover the downed airman from deep in North Vietnam.&quot;.&lt;ref name=militarytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=3468  |title=Capt. Dale Stovall, Air Force Cross|work=Military Times |accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stovall was also recognized with the 1973 [[Jabara Award]] for Airmanship, two [[Silver Star]] awards and two [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] awards for other combat rescues among the 12 successful rescue missions he accomplished during his tour in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=dorr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/legacy/new/0-AIRPAPER-2642855.php |date=March 1, 2004|title=History in Blue |first=Robert F. |last=Dorr |publisher=Air Force Times  |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stovall retired from the Air Force as a Brigadier General on June 1, 1993.

==Background==

Stovall was born in [[Toppenish, Washington]] and graduated from the [[U.S. Air Force Academy]] at Colorado Springs, Colorado, in the class of 1967.&lt;ref name=militarytimes/&gt;

===Rescue of Roger Locher===

During the initial phase of [[Operation Linebacker]] in May 1972, an American  [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4D]] was shot down by a North Vietnamese [[Shenyang J-6]]. Pilot Maj. Robert Lodge refused to [[ejection seat|eject]], but&lt;ref name=oyster1b&gt;{{cite video|title=John Locher Survival Briefing|url=http://www.f4phantom.com/docs/oyster1b_pt1.mp3 |author=John Locher |accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Peter  ''F-4 Phantom&amp;nbsp;II vs. MiG-21: USAF &amp; VPAF in the Vietnam War'' (Osprey, 2008), p62&lt;/ref&gt; his [[Weapon Systems Officer|weapons officer]] [[Roger Locher]] was able to get out of the aircraft. Locher landed, unseen by either friendly or enemy forces, only {{convert|64|km}} from  Hanoi, North Vietnam.&lt;ref name=frisbee&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1992/March%201992/0392valor.aspx |title= Valor: A Good Thought to Sleep On |first=John L. |last=Frisbee| publisher=AirforceMagazine.com|volume= 75|number=3|date=March 1992|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maj. Locher  [[escape and evasion|evaded capture]] and covered over {{convert|19|km}}, gradually losing {{convert|30|lbs}} and his strength.&lt;ref name=eagle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/1986/locher_1986.asp |title=Eagle Biography Roger C. Locher |publisher=Air University, Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base |location=Montgomery, Alabama |accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 1, 1972, his 22nd day behind enemy lines, he was finally able to contact a flight of American jets overhead, calling, &quot;Any U.S. aircraft, if you read Oyster 1 Bravo, come up on Guard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Striving for Air Superiority: the Tactical Air Command in Vietnam |first= Craig C. |last=Hannah |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEb1sFobGgcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=roger+locher#v=onepage&amp;q=roger%20locher&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. James Dunn and others, including [[Richard Stephen Ritchie|Steve Ritchie]] in one of the F-4 aircraft overhead, heard his radio call and remembered Locher's call sign. When the aircraft answered, Locher calmly responded, &quot;Guys I've been down here a long time, any chance of picking me up?&quot;&lt;ref name=maurice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afcent.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123193928 |title='Legends of Aerospace' Visit 'The Rock' |date=March 9, 2010|first=Lindsey |last=Maurice |publisher=386th Air Expeditionary Wing Public Affairs|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His transmissions left some Americans who did not hear his call in doubt about the authenticity of his message, and they believed that the [[Vietnam People's Army|NVA]] may have manipulated a [[POW]] into impersonating him, setting a trap for the would-be rescuers.&lt;ref name=frisbee/&gt;

===Rescue operation===

Capt. Stovall, based at [[Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base]] in [[Thailand]] responded, piloting a [[Sikorsky MH-53|HH-53]] from the [[40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] along with a rescue force consisting of several [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|A-1H]]s and another [[Sikorsky MH-53|HH-53]].&lt;ref name=frisbee/&gt; As they neared Locher's position, the A-1 Skyraiders and HH-53C helicopters came under attack from two MiGs, several surface-to-air missiles and gunfire. The rescue force eluded one MiG in a narrow canyon, but were eventually driven back by the enemy fire and failed to get through to Locher on June 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;JabaraAwd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGee|first1=Lt. Col. Billy|title=1973 Jabara Award for Airmanship|url=http://jabara.usafalibrary.com/files/6050_FilePath.PDF|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dorr/&gt;

On June 2, 1972, General [[John W. Vogt, Jr.|John Vogt]], commander of the [[Seventh Air Force|7th Air Force]] canceled the entire strike mission set for [[Hanoi]] on that day. He sent a task force of 119 aircraft&lt;ref name=dorr/&gt; including Stovall piloting his [[Sikorsky MH-53|HH-53]] rescue helicopter, bombers, and an array of [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] escorts, [[Douglas B-66 Destroyer|EB-66]]s, [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|A-1Hs]], [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F105G Weasels]], and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC135]] tankers to get Locher out.&lt;ref name=lodge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/l/l068.htm |publisher=PowNetwork |title=Lodge, Robert Alfred |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We shut down the war to go get Roger Locher,&quot; Stovall later said.&lt;ref name=dorr/&gt;

Capt. Ronald E. Smith in an [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|A-1H]] guided Capt. Stovall to Locher's position. Only when Locher rose out of the jungle canopy riding the [[forest penetrator|jungle penetrator]] were all of the Americans sure it was him. Despite their proximity to [[Yên Bái Air Base]], no aircraft were lost during Locher's rescue.&lt;ref name=ritchie&gt;{{Cite video | people = Steve Ritchie | title = Brig. Gen. Steve Ritchie and the Rescue of Roger Locher  | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvRcP4go-eg | medium = video | publisher = | location = Eustis, Florida | date = Mar 24, 2011 |accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At only 60 miles (97 km) from Hanoi, it was the deepest rescue inside North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

{{quote|...Captain Stovall with superior airmanship and personal courage, repeatedly volunteered to fly as co-pilot of an HH-53C helicopter into an extremely hostile area in the rescue of a downed airman. While under intense ground fire, Captain Stovall correctly analyzed an in-flight emergency, maintained vital communications with the Search and Rescue forces, insured that all required checks were performed, and was an indispensable aid in assisting the pilot in avoiding hazardous areas...}}
 
Three months later, on June 27, 1972, he was instrumental in recovering another air man for which he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] with Bronze [[Oak Leaf Cluster]]:&lt;ref name=militarytimes/&gt;

{{quote|...Captain Stovall, as Aircraft Commander of an HH-53C Rescue Helicopter, voluntarily and at great risk to his own life piloted his aircraft into a hostile and heavily defended area of North Vietnam to effect the rescue of a downed American airman. Realizing the primary recovery aircraft had suffered crippling battle damage, he piloted his aircraft through intense hostile ground fire to complete the rescue of an injured survivor and crewman from encircled ground forces...}}

===Air Force Cross===
[[File:Air Force Cross ribbon.svg|thumb|150px|Air Force Cross]]
For his flights on two days deep inside North Vietnam on June 1 and 2, 1972, to rescue Maj. Lochar, Stovall received the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]] on November 22, 1972:&lt;ref name=militarytimes/&gt;

During this period, Captain Stovall, voluntarily and at great risk to his own life, repeatedly penetrated an extremely hostile and heavily defended area to effect the rescue of a downed American airman. Captain Stovall's first attempt to rescue the airman was thwarted by numerous hostile aircraft and missiles being directed at the rescue force.
