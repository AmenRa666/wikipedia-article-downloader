'''Samuel L. Pitkin''', born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] on April 1, 1803, was the [[Connecticut Adjutant General|Adjutant General]] for the State of [[Connecticut]] from 1837 to 1839.   He was a member of the Pitkin family of Hartford, who were very active in politics, the military, industry and banking in early Connecticut.  His great-great-great grandfather, William Pitkin, emigrated to the new world from England in 1635 after receiving an inheritance.  His grandson, also named [[William Pitkin]] would serve as governor of [[Connecticut Colony]] from 1766 to 1769.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carpenterpitkin.com/FamilyRecords/d96.htm#P4688 |title=Carpenter-Pitkin Family History |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pitkin Family Lineage==
Samuel’s family traces its roots to William, who immigrated to the United States with a sizeable inheritance and a legal education.  The family settled on the east side of the [[Connecticut River]] in what is now [[East Hartford, CT]] but was then Hartford.  With their proximity to the political center of the colony and the industrial and economic power of the Connecticut River, the family was in a prime position to prosper.  His son, also named William, would continue to be involved in law and rise to the position of Chief Justice of the Superior Court.  He would also establish '''Pitkin Mills''' in what became the [[Burnside Avenue|Burnside]] village of East Hartford that was dominated by various mills.

The family established clothing mills and continued to educate the males in the field of law.  Their legal training enabled them to become active in politics by assisting in settling civil disputes.  Samuel’s great-great uncle, [[William Pitkin|William III]], was known for his fairness and skill as a mediator and was appointed to the Council of War in 1740.  This began the family’s involvement in military affairs in the state.  He ultimately became governor of the colony in 1766 until his death in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.cslib.org/gov/pitkinw.htm |title=Connecticut State Library |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pitkin Street.JPG|left|thumb|Exit sign off of [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]] to Pitkin Street in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]], in honor of the Pitkin family]]Samuel’s great grandfather, Joseph, continued the tradition of political and military service, rising to the rank of [[Colonel]] of the 1st Regiment in 1751 as well as serving for twenty years on the [[Connecticut General Assembly]].    The family also became involved in the religious leadership of the community where Joseph became a Deacon of the Third Church of Hartford.  In addition to inheriting Pitkin Mills and running it with his brothers, he started '''Forge Falls''', a producer of gunpowder that would be outlawed by the [[British Parliament]] in 1750 and manufacture powder for the Continental Army during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

'''[[Pitkin Glassworks Ruin|Pitkin Glassworks]]''' was created by the next generation of which Samuel’s grandfather, Squire Elisha Pitkin was a contributor in current [[Manchester, CT]].   The glassworks would contribute greatly to the financial fortunes of the family as the company was granted a 25-year monopoly for the manufacturing of glass in Connecticut by the General Assembly (of which many family members were representatives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.manchesterhistory.org/prev_site/pitkinglass.htm |title=Manchester Historical Society |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Pitkin, the father of Samuel L. Pitkin, served in the General Assembly for thirteen years to continue the family tradition of political service.  He also served as a Deacon in the Third Church of Hartford and established the Sabbath School, serving as its first superintendent.

==Early life==
Samuel L. Pitkin was the youngest of three children and only son born to Samuel Pitkin and Sarah Parsons.  His older sisters were Sarah (born February 21, 1794) and Frances (born May 1, 1799).  He attended school in Hartford and attended the [[Norwich University|American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy]] in 1821, shortly after the founding of the school in 1819 in [[Norwich, Vermont]].  He wrote a series of letters that are currently being preserved by the school that relate his experiences at the school.  He graduated in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Leonard Pitkin Papers, 1816–1824&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Upon graduation he continued the family tradition of being involved in military service, politics and business.  He worked at Pitkin Mills, where the mill continued the production of gunpowder for military units in Connecticut and throughout the new nation.  He also served as state senator for Connecticut’s second district, representing the City of East Hartford.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

Having received military training while at college, Samuel entered military service in the State of Connecticut and was appointed to Adjutant General in 1837 at the age of 34.  Under his command, the Connecticut State Militia expanded by five companies and grew to a strength of 29,967 men.  Under state law at the time, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 45 in the state were required to enrolling in the state militia but there were no laws administering a punishment if they did not.  General Pitkin advocated the passing of state statutes to fine personnel who failed to enroll and also to fine those who left service without returning equipment.  He also advocated modernizing the militia with modern equipment as tension with [[Mexico]] continued to increase.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Adjutant General to His Excellency the Governor of Connecticut – 1839&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Samuel married Mary Ann Lewis of [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1831.  They would have no children.  He would die suddenly on February 18, 1845, at his home in East Hartford.
