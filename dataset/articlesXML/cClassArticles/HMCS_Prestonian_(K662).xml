'''HMCS ''Prestonian''''' was a {{sclass2-|River|frigate}} that served with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]] and as a {{sclass-|Prestonian|frigate|1}} from 1953–1956. She saw action primarily as a convoy escort. She was named for [[Preston, Ontario]], however due to possible confusion with {{HMS|Preston}}, her name was altered.&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910–1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages= |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 she began service with the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] as '''''Troll'''''.

''Prestonian'' was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943–1944 River-class building program.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/209.html|work=uboat.net |title=HMCS Prestonian (K 662) |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid down as ''Beauharnois''&lt;ref name=Lenton&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenton |first=H.T. |last2=Colledge |first2=J.J. |title=British and Dominion Warships of World War II |publisher=Doubleday and Company Inc. |year=1968 |place=New York |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 20 July 1943 by [[Davie Shipbuilding|Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd.]] at [[Lauzon, Quebec]] and launched 22 June 1944.&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt; Her name was changed to ''Prestonian'' and she was commissioned on 13 September 1944 at [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|River-class frigate}}

The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the [[Royal Navy]] at the time, including the [[Flower-class corvette]]. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the [[United Kingdom]], giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.friends-amis.org/index.php/en/document-repository/english/fact-sheets/44-canadian-river-class-frigate-1/file |title=Fact Sheet No. 21 – Canadian River Class Frigates |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral [[Percy Nelles]] of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book|title=Frigates of the Royal Canadian Navy 1943–1974 |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |publisher=Vanwell Publishing |year=1989 |place=Lewiston, New York |pages=6–7, 15 |isbn=0920277225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at {{convert|7200|nmi|km}} at 12 knots.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat [[U-boats]] including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt; 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of the {{HMCS|Valleyfield|K329|6}}, they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; The design was too big for the shipyards on the [[Great Lakes]] so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

==Service history==
Due to her late entry into the Second World War, ''Prestonian'' did not see much action. Upon arriving at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], she underwent major repairs and it was not until January 1945 that she began working up at [[Bermuda]]. After she returned she was assigned to EG 28, a local convoy escort group working out of Halifax. She remained with this unit until the end of the war in Europe. In preparation for service in the Pacific Ocean, ''Prestonian'' began a tropicalization refit at Halifax completing on 20 August 1945. However the plans to send her to the Pacific had been cancelled and she was paid off 9 November and sold to Marine Industries Ltd.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt;

''Prestonian'' was reacquired by the RCN to undergo conversion to a ''Prestonian''-class ocean escort as part of the need to expand the anti-submarine force within the navy. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] anti-submarine mortars.&lt;ref name=Jane&gt;{{cite book|title=Jane's Fighting Ships 1958–59 |editor=Raymond V.B. Blackman |publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc. |place=New York |year=1958 |isbn= |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the first ship to complete the conversion, she gave her name to the new class. In August 1953, ''Prestonian'' underwent builder's [[sea trials]], testing the conversion before being recommissioned on 22 August 1953 with pennant 307.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=First Converted Frigate Ready |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=September 1953 |volume=5 |number=11 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frigate was made a part of the First Canadian Escort Squadron in November 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Escort Squadron Formed at Halifax |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |number=1 |volume=6 |pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1954, the First Canadian Escort Squadron deployed to Caribbean Sea for a training cruise, making several port visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=West Indies Goal of Training Trips |publisher=Queen's Printer |magazine=The Crowsnest |date=May 1954 |volume=6 |number=7 |pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the First Canadian Escort Squadron took part in the [[NATO]] naval exercise &quot;New Broom II&quot; and in October, the exercise &quot;Morning Mist&quot; before performing a two-month training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea, making several port visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Escort Squadron Touring &quot;Med&quot; |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |number=1 |volume=7 |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron returned to Canada on 10 December 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Squadron Back From &quot;Med&quot; Cruise |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |number=3 |volume=7 |date=January 1955 |pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Royal Norwegian Navy===
It was announced in November 1955 that three ''Prestonian''-class frigates would be loaned to Norway; ''Prestonian'', {{HMCS|Penetang|K676|2}} and {{HMCS|Toronto|K538|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Three Frigates Lent to Norway |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |location=Ottawa |date=January 1956 |volume=8 |number=3 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frigate was paid off on 24 April 1956 and transferred to the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] and renamed HNoMS ''Troll''.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; She was employed primarily for fishery protection duties.&lt;ref name=Jane/&gt; In 1965 she was reclassified as a submarine depot ship and renamed HNoMS ''Horten''. She served in this capacity until 1972 when the ship was discarded.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;
