A '''fast attack craft''' ('''FAC''') is a small, fast, agile and offensive [[warship]] armed with [[anti-ship missile]]s, [[Naval gun|gun]] or [[torpedo]]es. FACs are usually operated in close proximity to land as they lack both the [[seakeeping]] and all-round defensive capabilities to survive in [[Blue-water navy|blue water]]. The size of the vessel also limits the fuel, stores and water supplies. In size they are usually between 50&amp;ndash;800 tonnes and can reach speeds of 25&amp;ndash;50 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiinter.com/pagex.php?pg=vesseltypes#fast_attack |title=AMI International - Definitions of Vessel Types [ &amp;#93; |publisher=Amiinter.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fast attack craft's main advantage over other warship types is its affordability. Many FACs can be deployed at a relatively low cost, allowing a navy which is at a disadvantage to effectively defend itself against a larger adversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/09/09/2003542316 |title=Taiwan must rethink naval strategy: expert |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2015-03-04 |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small boat, when equipped with the same weapons as its larger counterpart, can pose a serious threat to even the largest of capital ships. Their major disadvantages are poor seagoing qualities, cramped quarters and poor ability to defend themselves against aerial threat.

==History==
As early as the mid-19th century, the [[Jeune École]]'s ''poussiere navale'' theory called for a great number of small, agile vessels to break up invading fleets of larger vessels. The idea was first put into action in the 1870s with the steam-powered [[torpedo boat]], which was produced in large numbers by both the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[French Navy]]. These new vessels proved especially susceptible to rough seas and to have limited utility in scouting due to their short endurance and low bridges. The potential threat was entirely extinguished with the introduction of the Torpedo Boat Destroyer (TBD) in 1893, a larger vessel which evolved into the modern [[destroyer]]. It could mount guns capable of destroying the torpedo boat before it was within range to use its own weapons.

[[File:USS PT-105.jpg|thumb|PT boats at high speed in 1942]]

The idea was revived shortly before World War I with the craft using new gasoline engines. Italy and Great Britain were at the forefront of this design, with the [[Coastal Motor Boat]] (CMB) and the ''[[MAS (boat)|Motobarca Armata Silurante]]'' (MAS) ([[Italian language|Italian]]: &quot;Torpedo Armed Motorboat&quot;). The outstanding achievement of the class was the sinking of the Austro-Hungarian battleship {{SMS|Szent István}} by ''MAS. 15'' on June 10, 1918. The equivalent achievement for the CMBs was a lesser success; during the [[Russian Civil War]] CMBs attacked the Red Fleet at anchor at Kronstadt on 18 June 1919, sinking the cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Pamiat Azova||2}} for the loss of four craft.

The design matured in the mid-1930s as the [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s (MTBs) and [[Motor Gun Boat]]s (MGBs) of the Royal Navy, the [[PT boat]]s of the US Navy, and the [[E-boat]]s (''Schnellboote'') of the ''Kriegsmarine''. All types saw extensive use during [[World War II]] but were limited in effectiveness due to the increasing threat of aircraft; however, some successes were achieved in favourable conditions, as showcased by the crippling of the cruiser {{HMS|Manchester|15|6}} (later scuttled), in the night of 13 August 1942, by [[E-boat#Italian MS boat|Italian MS boats]].

After World War II, the use of this kind of craft steadily declined in the United States and Britain, despite the introduction of safer diesel engines to replace the highly flammable gasoline ones, although the [[Soviet Union]] still had large numbers of MGBs and MTBs in service.

With the development of the [[anti-ship missile]] FACs were reborn in the Soviet Union as &quot;[[missile boat]]s&quot; or &quot;missile cutters&quot;. The first few missile boats were originally torpedo boats, with the torpedo tubes replaced by missile launchers. Again, small fast craft could attack and destroy a major warship. The idea was first tested by the Soviet Union which, in August 1957, produced the {{sclass2-|Komar|missile boat|4}} which mounted two [[P-15 Termit]] missiles on a {{convert|25|m|ft|sing=on}} and a top speed of around {{convert|40|kn|lk=in}}. Endurance was limited to {{convert|1000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}} and the vessels had supplies for only five days at sea. 110 Komar-class vessels were produced, while over 400 examples were built of the following {{sclass2-|Osa| missile boat|4}} with a significant portion of the total being sold to pro-Soviet nations.

The first combat use of missile boats was by the Egyptian Soviet-built Komar-class craft fire of four [[P-15 Termit|Styx]] missiles on the Israeli destroyer [[INS Eilat (1955)|''Eilat'']] on 20 October 1967, shortly after the [[Six Day War]], causing the latter's sinking with 47 dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/k40-eilat.htm |title=Eilat Destroyer |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=1967-10-21 |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schnellboot Gepard-Klasse Typ 143 A.jpg|thumb|A {{sclass-|Gepard|fast attack craft|0}} vessel of the [[German Navy]]]]
The Soviet FACs prompted a [[NATO]] response, which became more intense after the sinking of ''Eilat''. The Germans and French worked together to produce a new FAC, resulting in 1968 in the [[La Combattante class fast attack craft]]. Built on a {{convert|47|or|49|m|ft|sing=on}} hull with  four MM-38 [[Exocet]] missiles, a 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun forward and 40&amp;nbsp;mm twin guns aft, these vessels have a top speed of {{convert|36|kn}}. Built until 1974, a total of 68 Combattante IIs were launched. The design was immediately followed by the [[La Combattante III-class fast attack craft|Combattante III]], and a great many other shipyards produced their own versions of the Combattante, notably the Israeli Sa'ar/''Reshef'' variants.

Size has also increased, some designs reaching up to [[corvette]] size, 800 tonnes including a [[helicopter]], giving them extended modes of operation. While the Israeli [[Sa'ar 4-class missile boat]]s, for example, had a 58 metre hull and 415 ton displacement, the [[Sa'ar 5-class corvette|Sa'ar 5]] is 85 metres in length and displaces 1,065 tons, and is officially rated as a corvette.

[[Iran]] and [[North Korea]] have some of the largest numbers of FACs in operation today. North Korea alone operates more than 300,&lt;ref&gt;Hy Sang Lee: ''North Korea: A Strange Socialist Fortress'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Iran]] has been seen developing &quot;swarm boats&quot; to be used as harassing vessels in the heavily contested littoral waters of the [[Persian Gulf]]. To counter the threat, the [[US Navy]] has been developing an ASUW Littoral Defensive Anti Surface Warfare doctrine, along with vessels such as the [[littoral combat ship]].
