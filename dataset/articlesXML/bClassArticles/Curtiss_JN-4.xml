The '''Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot;''' was one of a series of &quot;JN&quot; [[biplane]]s built by the Curtiss Aeroplane Company of [[Hammondsport, New York]], later the [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company]]. Although the Curtiss JN series was originally produced as a training aircraft for the U.S. Army, the &quot;Jenny&quot; (the common nickname derived from &quot;JN-4&quot;, with an open-topped four appearing as a ''Y'') continued after World War I as a civil aircraft, as it became the &quot;backbone of American post[[World War I|war]] [civil] aviation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Auliard 2009, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of surplus Jennys were sold at bargain prices to private owners in the years after the war and became central to the [[barnstorming]] era that helped awaken America to civil aviation through much of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Rumerman, Judy. &quot;The Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot;. ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
Curtiss combined the best features of the [[Curtiss Model J|model J]] and model N [[Training aircraft|trainers]], built for the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]], and began producing the JN or &quot;Jenny&quot; series of aircraft in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Roseberry 1972, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; Curtiss built only a limited number of the JN-1 and JN-2 [[biplane]]s. The design was commissioned by [[Glenn Curtiss]] from Englishman Benjamin Douglas Thomas, formerly of the [[Sopwith Aviation Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Angelucci 1973, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JN-2 was an equal-span biplane with [[aileron]]s controlled by a shoulder yoke in the aft [[cockpit]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1966, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It was deficient in performance, particularly climbing, because of excessive weight. The improved JN-3 incorporated unequal spans with ailerons only on the upper wings, controlled by a [[Joystick|wheel]]. In addition, a foot bar was added to control the [[rudder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald pp. 279–280&quot;&gt;Donald 1997, pp. 279–280.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Curtiss JN-3.jpg|thumb|left|Curtiss JN-3, the progenitor of the JN-4, deployed to Mexico, around 1916&lt;ref name=&quot;House p. 168&quot;/&gt;]]
The [[1st Reconnaissance Squadron|1st Aero Squadron]] of the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] received eight JN-2s at San Diego in July 1915. The squadron was transferred to [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]], in August to work with the Field Artillery School, during which one JN-2 crashed, resulting in a fatality.&lt;ref&gt;Larson 2004, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots of the squadron met with its commander, Capt. [[Benjamin Foulois]], to advise that the JN-2 was unsafe because of low power, shoddy construction, lack of stability, and overly sensitive rudder. Foulois and his executive officer Capt. [[Thomas D. Milling]] disagreed, and flights continued until a second JN-2 crashed in early September, resulting in the grounding of the six remaining JN-2s until mid-October. When two new JN-3s were delivered, the grounded aircraft were then upgraded in accordance with the new design. In March 1916, these eight JN-3s were deployed to Mexico for [[Reconnaissance|aerial observation]] during the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] of 1916–1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;House p. 168&quot;&gt;House 2003 p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful deployment of the JN-3, Curtiss produced a development, known as the JN-4, with orders from both the US Army and an order in December 1916 from the [[Royal Flying Corps]] for a training aircraft to be based in Canada.{{#tag:ref|Both the US Army version and the Canadian derivative for the Royal Flying Corps were known as JN-4s. To differentiate between the types, unofficially, the RFC designation was the JN-4 (Canadian).&lt;ref name=&quot;Molson and Taylor p. 219&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} The Canadian version was the JN-4 (Canadian), also known as the &quot;[[Canuck]]&quot;, had some minor differences from the US version, including a lighter airframe, ailerons on both wings, a bigger and more rounded rudder, and differently shaped wings, stabilizer, and elevators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molson and Taylor p. 219&quot;&gt;Molson and Taylor 1982, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:Curtiss JN-4s.jpg|thumb|Curtiss JN-4Ds at Camp Taliaferro, Texas, ''circa'' 1918]]
The Curtiss JN-4 is possibly [[North America]]'s most famous [[World War I]] aircraft. It was widely used during World War I to train beginning pilots, with an estimated 95% of all trainees having flown a JN-4.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 88&quot;/&gt;  The U.S. version was called &quot;Jenny&quot;, a derivation from its official designation. It was a twin-seat (student in front of instructor) dual-control biplane. Its [[tractor configuration|tractor]] propeller and maneuverability made it ideal for initial pilot training with a {{convert|90|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} [[Curtiss OX-5]] [[V8 engine]] giving a top speed of {{convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and a service [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]] of {{convert|6500|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald pp. 279–280&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Engine that Saved Aviation: OX-5.&quot; '' Air Classics,'' Issue 3, Fall 1965, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The British used the JN-4 (Canadian), along with the [[Avro 504]], for their primary World War I trainer using the [[Canadian Aeroplanes Ltd.]] indigenous variant.&lt;ref&gt;Molson and Taylor 1982, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Royal Flying Corps pilots earned their wings on the JN-4, both in [[Ontario]] and later in winter facilities at [[Camp Taliaferro]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Chajkowsky 1979, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JN-4 ambulance.jpg|thumb|Converted JN-4 ambulance, operated by the [[Camp Taliaferro]] medical teams, around 1918]]
Although ostensibly a training aircraft, the Jenny was extensively modified while in service to undertake additional roles. Due to its robust but easily adapted structure able to be modified with ski undercarriage, the Canadian Jenny was flown year-round, even in inclement weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abheritage.ca/aviation/history/ww1_toronto.html &quot;Royal Flying Corps Starts Training in Toronto.&quot;] ''abheritage.ca.'' Retrieved: 10 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The removable turtle-deck behind the cockpits allowed for conversion to stretcher or additional supplies and equipment storage, with the modified JN-4s becoming the first aerial ambulances, carrying out this role both during wartime and in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd and Jernigan 2002, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 6,813 Jennys built were unarmed, although some had [[machine gun]]s and [[bomb]] racks for advanced training. With deployment limited to North American bases, none saw combat service in World War I.

The Curtiss factory in Buffalo, New York, was the largest such facility in the world, but due to production demands, from November 1917 to January 1919, six different manufacturers were involved in production of the definitive JN-4D.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 88&quot;&gt;Winchester 2004, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Production from spare or reconditioned parts continued sporadically until 1927, although most of the final orders were destined for the civil market in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 89&quot;&gt;Winchester 2004, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the re-engined 'JN-4H' version of the most-produced JN-4 subtype, the final production version of the aircraft was the [[Curtiss JN-6H|JN-6]], powered by a [[Wright Aeronautical]] license-built, 150-hp (112-kW) [[Hispano-Suiza 8]] V-8, first ordered in 1918 for the US Navy. A [[floatplane]] version was built for the Navy which was so modified, it was essentially a different airframe. This was designated the [[Curtiss N-9|N-9]]. In [[U.S. Army Air Service]] usage, the JN-4s and JN-6s were configured to the JNS (&quot;S&quot; for &quot;standardized&quot;) model. The Jenny remained in service with the US Army until 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 88&quot;/&gt;
[[File:JN-4 and wingwalker.jpg|thumb|One of the many daredevil stunts performed by JN-4 pilots was to work with a &quot;wingwalker&quot;.]]
After World War I, thousands were sold on the civilian market, including one to [[Charles Lindbergh]] in May 1923, in which he then soloed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/firstplane.asp &quot;Charles Lindbergh's First Solo Flight &amp; First Plane.&quot;] ''Charles Lindbergh official site.''&lt;/ref&gt; Surplus US Army aircraft were sold, some still in their unopened packing crates, for as little as $50, essentially &quot;flooding&quot; the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 88&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Surplus JN-4s typically fetched between $200 and $500, depending on condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 88&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} With private and commercial flying in North America unhampered by regulations concerning their use, pilots found the Jenny's slow speed and stability made it ideal for stunt flying and [[Aerobatics|aerobatic]] displays in the barnstorming era between the world wars, with the nearly identical [[Standard J|Standard J-1]] aircraft often used alongside it. {{#tag:ref|The front cockpit that was normally for the student in military training was usually used for passengers in postwar joy rides, so  the pilot could keep an eye on his paying customer/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 89&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} Some were still flying into the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 89&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The JN-4 Canuck was often chosen for barnstorming as the lighter, more responsive, and more economical variant was also in large supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 89&quot;/&gt;|group=N}}

JN-4 airframes were used to produce early [[Weaver Aircraft Company]] / [[Advance Aircraft Company]] / [[Waco Aircraft Company|Waco]] aircraft, such as the [[Waco 6]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester p. 89&quot;/&gt;

===Notable firsts===
Between 1917 and 1919, the JN-4 type accounted for several significant aviation &quot;firsts&quot; while in service   with the US Army Signal Corps Aviation Section and the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) including flying the [[Airmails of the United States#U.S. Government flown Air Mail|first U.S. Air Mail]] in May 1918.

In a series of tests conducted at the U.S. Army's [[Langley Field]] in Hampton, Virginia, in July and August 1917, the world's first &quot;plane-to-plane&quot; and &quot;ground-to-plane, and vice versa&quot; communications by radiotelephony (as opposed to radiotelegraphy which had been developed earlier) were made to and from modified US Army JN-4s{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;A JN-4-d plane was used; speed was successful, transmitting about 3 miles from plane to plane and was also received from ground to plane, and vice versa.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Report of the Chief Signal Officer to the Secretary of War, October 15, 1919&quot;. ''Annual Report,'' War Department, 1919, pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} by [[Western Electric Company]] ([[Bell Labs]]) design engineers Lewis M. Clement and Raymond Heising, the developers of the experimental wind generator-powered airborne wireless voice transmitter and receiver equipment.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Handwritten letter, dated August 18, 1917, from Western Electric Co (Bell Labs) design engineer Lewis M. Clement to Vesta L. Clement, his wife, with a detailed first-person account of the first successful test of 'plane-to-plane' and 'plane-to-ground' radiotelephony from JN-4-d airplanes in flight conducted that day at Langley Field, VA.&quot; ''The Cooper Collection of U.S. Aviation History'' (Private collection: original letter location), Ardmore, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cprr.org/Museum/Radio.html &quot;Lewis Mason Clement: Pioneer of Radio.&quot;] ''CPRR.org,'' September 2010. Retrieved: 5 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1919, a United States Marine Corps (USMC) JN-4 was also credited with what is believed to be the first successful &quot;[[dive bombing]]&quot; attack during the [[United States occupation of Haiti]].  USMC pilot Lt Lawson H. Sanderson mounted a carbine barrel in front of the windshield of his JN-4 (previously, an unarmed trainer that had a machine gun mounted in the rear cockpit) as an improvised bomb sight that was lined up with the long axis of his aircraft, loaded a bomb in a canvas mail bag that was attached to the JN-4's belly, and launched a single-handed raid at treetop level, in support of a USMC unit that had been trapped by Haitian Cacos rebels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausflying.com.au/news/debunking-dive-bomber-myths &quot;Debunking dive bomber myths.&quot;] ''Flightpath'', Volume 21, Number 4, 17 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the JN-4 almost disintegrated in the pullout, the attack was effective and led to Sanderson in 1920 developing further dive-bombing techniques to provide Marine pilots with close aerial support to infantry comrades.&lt;ref&gt;Nowarra 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first series of JN-4s were virtually identical to the JN-3, the JN-4 series was based on production orders from 1915–1919.&lt;ref&gt;Auliard 2009, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''JN-4A'''&amp;nbsp;— production version of the JN-4, 781 built

Its use by the USAAC was curtailed as the lighter structure was claimed to cause more accidents than the US-built aircraft, although no air fatalities were attributed to the structural integrity of the type.&lt;ref&gt;Molson and Taylor 1982, pp. 225–226.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''JN-4D'''&amp;nbsp;— improved version, adopting the control stick from the JN-4 (Canadian) 2,812 built

===The &quot;Inverted Jenny&quot; stamp===
[[File:&quot;Inverted Jenny&quot; C-3a (P57).jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Inverted Jenny&quot; (C-3a P57)]]
The &quot;[[Inverted Jenny]]&quot; (C-3a) is a 24-cent 1918 US Air Mail [[postage stamp]] printing error in which the blue central [[Vignette (philately)|vignette]] of US Army Curtiss JN-4HM #38262, the nation's [[Airmails of the United States#U.S. Government flown Air Mail|first mailplane]], appeared as &quot;inverted&quot; on a single sheet of 100 stamps owing to an inadvertent error made by the operator of a hand-rolled spider press by printing the blue vignette impressions upside down after the red frames had previously been printed on the sheet.&lt;ref&gt;The 1918 24¢ Inverted “Jenny” (Siegel Auction catalogue, Sale 1010A, June 18, 2011), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As the Jenny vignette was only inverted on one sheet, this stamp represents the rarest and most valuable known [[United States Post Office Department|USPOD]] printing error of all time. A single example (sheet position 57) sold at auction in 2007 for $977,500.00.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siegelauctions.com/2007/946a/s946a.htm &quot;Robert A.

===Notable appearances in media===
In 1921, [[Lee De Forest]] made a [[short film]] ''Flying Jenny Airplane'' in his [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process. The film depicted a JN-4 flying, and recorded the sound of the Jenny, as well. The short documentary was the first production of the De Forest Phonofilm company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482207 &quot;Flying Jenny Airplane&quot; (1921).]  IMDB, Retrieved: 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Curtiss Jenny plane in Wichita Falls, TX IMG 6857.JPG|200px|right|thumb|This 1917 Curtiss Jenny still flies on occasion. Its home base is the Call Memorial Museum in [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]].]]
Among many later films depicting the barnstorming era when the Jennys &quot;ruled supreme&quot; and played a feature role, was ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The 
Spirit of St. Louis]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Great Waldo Pepper]]'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;Harwick and Schnepf 1989, pp. 57, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell]]'' (1955), authentic OX-5 Jennys were showcased as United States Army Air Service training aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Harwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast on April 15, 1987, by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], the ''[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]'' special entitled &quot;Treasures from the Past&quot; featured the restoration and first flight by Ken Hyde of a JN-4D that would go on to win the &quot;Lindy Award&quot; at the [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]] '87.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Gene. &quot;From Jets to Jennies: Ken Hyde's Grand Champion Curtiss JN4D.&quot; ''Sport Aviation,''Volume 36, No. 11, November 1987, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jenny appears in the 1963 film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.

Musician [[Al Stewart]] refers to the Jenny in his song &quot;[[A Beach Full of Shells|The Immelman Turn]]&quot; (2005) in which a barnstorming acrobat falls to his death from a Curtiss Jenny attempting the maneuver in a 1923 airshow.

On the TV show ''[[The Unit]]'' season 4: episode 11 &quot;Switchblade&quot;, new character Joss Morgan of Morgan Aviation Company owns a 1917 Curtis &quot;Jenny&quot; and cracks a piston and ends up showing up at the Unit's front fake aviation business looking for help fixing it. She meets her future husband, unit-member Sgt. 1st Class Charles &quot;Carlito&quot; Grey about the piston.

He then gets to buy her a drink for telling her what plane the piston was from. He then trades the broken piston for a real piston from the National Air Museum through a friend for his Colt BBQ gun. She was going to show him the &quot;[[Aerobatic maneuver|outside loop maneuver]]&quot;.
