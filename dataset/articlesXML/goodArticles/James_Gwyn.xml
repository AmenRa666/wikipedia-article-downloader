'''James Gwyn''' (November 24, 1828 - July 17, 1906) was an officer in the [[Union Army]] during the  [[American Civil War]].  He immigrated at a young age from [[Ireland]] in 1846, initially working as a storekeeper in [[Philadelphia]] and later as a clerk in [[New York City]].  At the onset of the war, in 1861, he enlisted and was commissioned as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]] with the [[23rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry]]. He assumed command of the [[118th Pennsylvania Regiment]] in the course of the war.  Gwyn led that regiment through many of its 39 recorded battles, including engagements at [[Battle of Seven Pines|Seven Pines]], [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Shepherdstown|Shepherdstown]], [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]], and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]].

Gwyn was wounded at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in 1864, but returned to service after recuperating to take command of the Third, and eventually the First and Second Brigades of the First Division of the Union Army's [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]].  Gwyn was [[Brevet (military)#American Civil War|brevetted]] as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and then as a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] by President [[Andrew Johnson]] for his service.  His men described him as &quot;a handsome and accomplished officer, and a bold and aggressive leader&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith639&quot;&gt;[[James Gwyn#cite note-1|Smith]] (1892), p. 639&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, Gwyn returned to Philadelphia, although later moving to New York, and resumed his business dealings.  He died on July 17, 1906, and was honored with a military funeral and buried in [[Woodlands Cemetery]], Philadelphia.

==Early life==
Gwyn was born in [[Derry]], Ireland on November 24, 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith638&quot;&gt;[[James Gwyn#cite note-1|Smith]] (1892), pp.&amp;nbsp;638–639&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of ten children raised in the [[Protestant]] household of Alexander Gwyn and Catherine Garvin. His brother, Hugh Garvin Gwyn, would later serve in the [[Confederate States Army]] as a [[Major (United States)|major]] with the [[23rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment]], as well as an adjutant to General [[John Hunt Morgan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coddington2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Coddington|first=Ronald S.|title=Faces of the Confederacy: An Album of Southern Soldiers and Their Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uFpcEsy4UbMC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=2013-01-13|date=2008-11-14|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9019-2|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in the rural Irish city until he enrolled in [[Foyle College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith638&quot; /&gt; Like many Irish in the 1840s, Gwyn left Ireland for the United States during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JGIR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gwynn, James|work=Famine Irish Passenger Record Data Files (FIPAS), 1/12/1846 - 12/31/1851|url=http://aad.archives.gov/aad/record-detail.jsp?dt=180&amp;mtch=3&amp;tf=F&amp;q=Gwynn&amp;bc=sl&amp;rpp=10&amp;pg=1&amp;rid=38361&amp;rlst=267076,38361,400224|date=1977–1989|publisher=The National Archives and Records Administration|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=February 13, 2013|postscript =, Note that Gwyn's name is spelled with two final &quot;n&quot;'s, but his own usage and common usage at the time spelled it with one &quot;n&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He boarded the John R.

Upon arriving in the United States, Gwyn and many other Derry immigrants made their way to Philadelphia as was noted by an Emigration Officer Edward Smith at Derry that, &quot;Nevertheless, the money that recent arrivals in America remitted for the passage of others was central to the whole link between Derry and Philadelphia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hsp.org/exhibits/Balch%20resources/phila_ellis_island.html|title=PHILADELPHIA: IMMIGRANT CITY|last=Miller|first=Fredric M.|publisher=Historical Society of Pennsylvania|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haultain|first1=Charles|last2=Allen|first2=Joseph|title=The New Navy List and General Record of the Services Officers of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6H9MAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;ots=HR5p693A10&amp;dq=Emigration%20Officer%20Edward%20Smith&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=August 1852|publisher=London: Parker, Furnivall, and Parker, Military Library |location=Greenwich Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlistment with the 23rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry===
[[File:Battle of Fair Oaks Franklin's corps retreating.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Seven Pines]],  Harper's Magazine, 16 August 1862 issue]]
Gwyn enlisted in Company G of the [[23rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry]] on April 21, 1861, one week after the American Civil War began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith638&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zouaves&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Zouaves|first=Birneys|title=History of the Twenty-Third Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry|url=https://archive.org/stream/birneyszouaves00pennrich#page/170/mode/2up/search/Gwyn|year=1904|publisher=Library of the [[University of California]]|page=171|accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in that company without interruption until July 31, 1861, when he transferred to Company F.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zouaves&quot; /&gt; He resumed duty with the new company on August 2, 1861. Gwyn served with the 23rd Volunteers for over one year; in that time, he took part in the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], where, on May 31, 1862, Gwyn led the 23rd in aiding other Union companies in collecting escaped fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=BIRNEY|first=D.

===Lieutenant colonel, 118th Pennsylvania Infantry===
[[File:James Gwyn Illustration.png|thumb|Illustration of James Gwyn in the History of the Corn Exchange Regiment&lt;ref&gt;[[James Gwyn#cite note-1|Smith]] (1892), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Gywn joined the [[118th Pennsylvania Infantry]], on July 25, 1862. The 118th, which was commissioned by the [[United States Department of War]] for three years of service, gathered recruits from the Philadelphia area during August 15 to 30th,1862. Gwyn was officially mustered into service on August 16, 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith638&quot; /&gt; During this time, the 118th became known as the &quot;Corn Regiment&quot;, because the funds for raising the regiment were furnished by the [[Philadelphia Corn Exchange|Corn Exchange Association of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor130&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Frank H.|title=Philadelphia in the Civil War 1861–1865|url=https://archive.org/stream/philadelphiainci00tayl#page/130/mode/2up/search/Corn+Exchange|accessdate=2013-02-13|year=1913|publisher=The City of Philadelphia|location=Philadelphia|pages=19, 130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having gathered 1,296 volunteers during the two-week period, the &quot;Corn Regiment&quot; left for Washington, D.C., to be assigned a position in the [[Union Army]] on September 1, 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor130&quot; /&gt; The regiment was embedded with the First Brigade, First Division, Fifth Army Corps under the regiment command of Colonel Charles Prevost, and brigade commander Colonel [[James Barnes (general)|James Barnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Frank H.|title=Philadelphia in the Civil War 1861–1865|url=https://archive.org/stream/philadelphiainci00tayl#page/132/mode/2up/search/Corn+Exchange|accessdate=2013-02-13|year=1913|publisher=The City of Philadelphia|location=Philadelphia|pages=19, 130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 118th Regiment moved out with the rest of the Fifth Army Corps marching towards [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt;  Upon reaching Maryland, the 118th along with the rest of the Fifth Army Corps, became involved in the [[Battle of Antietam]]. While that battle would become to be known as &quot;the bloodiest day in American history&quot; with over 22,000 casualties, the 118th was not involved on the front lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; They instead assisted in [[Field Artillery in the American Civil War#Ammunition|artillery stocking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt;

The 118th Regiment returned to battle three days afterwards, taking part in the [[Battle of Shepherdstown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith638&quot; /&gt; The regiment took heavy casualties during the battle, suffering 71 deaths, 75 wounded, and 67 captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith638&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; The Confederates also suffered heavy losses with approximately 262 casualties in the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; Among the Union wounded was Prevost, colonel of the 118th Regiment, who was shot through the shoulder on the last day of the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith638&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/12/news/sharpsburgh-visit-president-official-report-skirmish-blackford-s-ford.html?pagewanted=all|title=FROM SHARPSBURGH.; The Visit of the President.

On September 28, 1862, Gwyn sent a letter to Colonel Barnes stating that the 118th Regiment did not provide the [[Philadelphia Inquirer]] with information that the paper used to publish a map and a report of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/12/news/a-denial-headquarters-one-hundred-and-eighteenth-regiment-pennsylvania.html|title=A DENIAL.; HEADQUARTERS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH REGIMENT PENNSYLVANIA.|date=October 12, 1862|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 January 2013|location=SHARPSBURGH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Gwyn issued a report on the Battle of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight back against the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment to fall back.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2&quot; /&gt;

The 118th Regiment returned to the front lines on December 11, 1862, in the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Gwyn#cite note-1|Smith]] (1892), pp.&amp;nbsp;112–129&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes formed the First Brigade, First Division from the 118th Pennsylvania (Gwyn), 22nd Massachusetts, 25th New York, 13th New York, 1st Michigan, and 2nd Maine Regiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Reilly2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Francis Augustin|title=The Fredericksburg Campaign: Winter War on the Rappahannock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HRFtAcEHXREC|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=2006-04-01|publisher=[[Louisiana State University]] Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0-8071-3154-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recorded incident during the battle, a house was discovered with hidden tobacco crates which the soldiers raided.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Reilly2006&quot; /&gt; Gwyn sharply criticized the men for breaking rank but &quot;inwardly smiled at their enthusiasm&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Reilly2006&quot; /&gt;

Following the unsuccessful [[Mud March (American Civil War)|Mud March]] of January 1863, the regiment went into 'winter quarters' until June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; The Fifth Army Corps resumed activity on June 10, 1863, as it began to travel northward through enemy territory, with skirmishes frequently occurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; These travels ultimately led the Fifth Army Corps to Pennsylvania, where, on July 2, 1863, they arrived to aid the Union Army during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Gwyn#cite note-1|Smith]] (1892), pp.&amp;nbsp;262–263&lt;/ref&gt; Gwyn, still as acting commander of the regiment, was given the orders to position the 118th Regiment on [[Cemetery Hill]] and to hold the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; In the afternoon, the regiment was ordered to assist Major General [[Daniel Sickles]] on the left flank that same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt;  On July 3, the second day of the battle, Gwyn led the 118th to [[Little Round Top]] where they held their position for two days until Union forces had achieved albeit a costly victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Gwyn#cite note-1|Smith]] (1892), pp.&amp;nbsp;254–261&lt;/ref&gt; Following Gettysburg, the 118th Regiment moved around the state to various positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; On August 6, the regiment stationed at [[Warrenton, Virginia]], received 109 new recruits, and on September 5, another 185.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; On September 30, 1863, Prevost officially retired, and Gwyn was promoted to colonel and the commanding officer of the 118th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor131&quot; /&gt; During this time, Prevost had been stationed as [[commandant]] of a [[military prison]] in [[Elmira, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor130&quot; /&gt;

It was recorded in this time the regiment suffered heavy losses and according to Frank H. Taylor, &quot;Grant was remoselessly wearing out the besieged enemy.

Gwyn continued his military duties with service around the [[James River]] near [[City Point, Virginia]]. Feeling ill, he returned to Philadelphia on October 31, 1864. He was diagnosed with [[malaria]] fever and prescribed a seven-day break to rest and recover. His leave was approved on November 4, and he was permitted to recover for a week, resuming duty of November 7, 1864.

==Post Civil War==
Following the conclusion of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than the last time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuntBrown1990&quot; /&gt;

His wife gave birth to a third daughter, Margaret, on December 7, 1869. Gwyn and his family later moved from Philadelphia to a home in New York City.
