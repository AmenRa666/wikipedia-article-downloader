The '''''Minas Geraes'' class''', spelled ''Minas Gerais'' in some sources,{{efn-ua|&quot;Minas Geraes&quot; was the spelling when the battleship was commissioned, but later changes to [[Portuguese orthography]] deprecated it in favor of &quot;Minas Gerais&quot;. The words are pronounced {{IPA-pt|ˈminɐʃ ʒeˈɾajʃ|}} in Portuguese. [[Ship class]]es are named for the [[lead ship]], in this case {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}}. }} consisted of two [[battleship]]s built for the [[Brazilian Navy]] in the early twentieth century. Named {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian battleship|São Paulo||2}}, the ships were intended to be Brazil's first step towards becoming an international power, and they consequently initiated a [[South American dreadnought race|South American naval arms race]].

In 1904, Brazil began a major naval building program that included three small battleships. Designing and ordering the ships took two years, but these plans were scrapped after the revolutionary &quot;[[dreadnought]]&quot; concept rendered the Brazilian design obsolete—two dreadnoughts were instead ordered from the United Kingdom, making Brazil the third country to have ships of this type under construction—before traditional powers like Germany, France, or Russia. As such, the ships created much uncertainty among the major countries in the world, many of whom incorrectly speculated the ships were actually destined for a rival nation. Similarly, they also caused much consternation in Argentina and consequently Chile.

Soon after their delivery in 1910, both ''Minas Geraes'' and ''São Paulo'' were embroiled in the [[Revolt of the Lash]] (''Revolta da Chibata''), in which the crews of four Brazilian ships demanded the abolition of [[corporal punishment]] in the navy. The mutineers surrendered after four days, when a bill was passed granting amnesty to all those involved. In 1922, the two battleships were used to help put down [[18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt|a revolt]] at [[Fort Copacabana]]. Two years later, lieutenants on ''São Paulo'' mutinied but found little support from other military units, so they sailed to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and obtained [[right of asylum|asylum]]. ''Minas Geraes'' was modernized in the 1930s, but both battleships were too old to participate actively in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and instead were employed as harbor defense ships in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. ''São Paulo'' was sold in 1951 to a British [[ship breaking|shipbreaker]], but was lost in a storm north of the [[Azores]] while being towed to its final destination. ''Minas Geraes'' was sold to an Italian scrapper in 1953 and towed to [[Genoa]] the following year.

== Background ==
{{main|South American dreadnought race}}
Brazil's navy fell into obsolescence after an [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil#Fall|1889 revolution]], which deposed [[Politics of the Empire of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], and an [[Revolta da Armada|1893 civil war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss240&quot;&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore32&quot;&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martins75&quot;&gt;Martins, &quot;Colossos do mares,&quot; 75.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The civil war was begun by secessionists in the southern province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. In 1893, Rear Admiral [[Custódio José de Mello]], the minister of the navy, revolted against President [[Floriano Peixoto]], bringing nearly all of the Brazilian warships currently in the country with him. Mello's forces took [[Florianópolis|Desterro]] when the governor surrendered, and began to coordinate with the secessionists, but loyal Brazilian forces overwhelmed them both. Most of the rebel naval forces were sailed to Argentina, where their crews surrendered; the flagship, {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Aquidabã||2}}, held out near Desterro until sunk by a torpedo boat.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 67–76, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; }} Meanwhile, an Argentine–Chilean dispute over the boundary of [[Patagonia]] and control of the [[Beagle Channel]] kindled a naval arms race between the two beginning in the late 1880s and lasting until 1902. Restrictions were placed on the navies of both countries and major vessels under construction in both navies were sold as part of the British-mediated [[Treaty of Arbitration Between Chile and Argentina of 1902|three pacts]] which ended the dispute, but both countries retained the numerous vessels built in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, &quot;Beagle Channel Dispute,&quot; 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, by the turn of the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage,&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martins75&quot; /&gt;{{efn-ua|Chile's naval tonnage was {{convert|36896|LT|t}}, Argentina's {{convert|34425|LT|t}}, and Brazil's {{convert|27661|LT|t}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore32&quot; /&gt; }} despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways403&quot;&gt;Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soaring demand for [[São Paulo (state)#Early 20th century|coffee]] and [[rubber boom|rubber]] brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways403&quot; /&gt; Simultaneously, there was a drive on the part of prominent Brazilians, most notably the [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco|Baron of Rio Branco]], to have the country recognized as an international power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina80&quot;&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt; A large naval acquisition program was drawn up and passed by the [[National Congress of Brazil]] in October 1904 in accordance with their belief that a powerful navy would be crucial to the achievement of this goal, but it was two years before any ships were ordered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss240&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways403&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina80&quot; /&gt;

Two factions argued over the types of ships to be ordered. One favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships, while the other preferred a larger navy of smaller warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina80&quot; /&gt; The latter originally prevailed with a bill authorizing the construction of three small battleships, three [[armored cruiser]]s, six [[destroyer]]s, twelve [[torpedo boat]]s, three [[submarine]]s, and two [[river monitor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina80&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;English108&quot;&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Júlio César de Noronha]], signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 240–245.&lt;/ref&gt; While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship {{HNoMS|Norge||2}} and the British (originally Chilean) {{sclass-|Swiftsure|battleship|4}},{{efn-ua|Incidentally, the ''Swiftsure'' class, named ''Constitución'' and ''Libertad'' before being bought by the British, were the two Chilean warships sold as part of the 1902 Argentinian–Chilean pacts that ended their naval arms race.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 52, 349.&lt;/ref&gt; }} the contracted ships were to follow [[Armstrong Whitworth]]'s Design 439 (Design 188 in [[Vickers]]' files). They would displace 11,800&amp;nbsp;long&amp;nbsp;tons (12,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes), have a speed of 19&amp;nbsp;knots (22&amp;nbsp;mph; 35&amp;nbsp;km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9&amp;nbsp;inches (23&amp;nbsp;cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8&amp;nbsp;cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25&amp;nbsp;cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|2}}s.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 244–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a [[cablegram]] to his [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] in September 1906, warning them of the destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under [[Theodore Roosevelt]] tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as [[suzerainty|suzerain]] Cuba. The [[President of Brazil]], [[Afonso Pena]], supported the naval acquisitions in an address to the National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, &quot;Battleship Diplomacy,&quot; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design 439 was modified before these ships were [[keel laying|laid down]], increasing the displacement to {{convert|14334|LT|t}} and making them slightly longer and wider. Two of these ships were laid down by Armstrong at [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] (''Minas Geraes'' and ''Rio de Janeiro''), while the other was [[subcontract]]ed out to Vickers in [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]] (''São Paulo''). However, the new [[dreadnought]] concept, which was showcased upon the completion of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|the namesake ship]] in December 1906, rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss246&quot;&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 246.&lt;/ref&gt; A transition to a few large warships was finalized with the selection of Rear Admiral [[Alexandrino Faria de Alencar]] for the powerful post of minister of the navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina81&quot;&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The money authorized for naval expansion was redirected by de Alencar to building two dreadnoughts, with plans for a third dreadnought after the first was completed, two scout cruisers (which became the [[Bahia-class cruiser|''Bahia'' class]]), ten destroyers (the [[Pará-class destroyer (1908)|''Pará'' class]]), and three submarines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina81&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Brazil,&quot; ''Naval Engineers'', 883–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The three battleships on which construction had just begun were demolished beginning on 7 January 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss246&quot; /&gt;

An entirely new design incorporating the latest dreadnought technology was drawn up by [[J.R. Perret]], the head of [[Elswick Ordnance Company]], and approved by the Brazilian government on 20 February 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss246&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Brazil,&quot; ''Naval Engineers'', 834.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina and Chile immediately annulled the [[Treaty of Arbitration Between Chile and Argentina of 1902|1902 treaty]] that had ended their naval arms race, and both planned to expand their own navies, though Chile was delayed by a financial [[depression (economics)|depression]] in 1907 and a major earthquake the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore32&quot; /&gt;

{{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}}, the [[lead ship]], was laid down by Armstrong on 17&amp;nbsp;April 1907, while its [[sister ship]] {{ship|Brazilian battleship|São Paulo||2}} followed thirteen days later at Vickers. Construction of the partial hull needed to [[ceremonial ship launching|launch]] ''Minas Geraes'' was delayed by a four-month [[strike action|strike]] to 10 September 1908, and ''São Paulo'' followed on 19 April 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appendix7&quot;&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways404&quot;&gt;Scheina, &quot;Brazil,&quot; 404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss249&quot;&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialMinas&quot;&gt;&quot;Minas Geraes I,&quot; ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialPaulo&quot;&gt;&quot;São Paulo I,&quot; ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios''.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were [[ship christening|christened]] in front of large crowds by the wife of [[Francisco Régis de Oliveira]], the [[List of Ambassadors of Brazil to the United Kingdom|Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest Warships&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C17FA385A17738DDDA80994D1405B888CF1D3 Launch Greatest Warships],&quot; ''The New York Times'', 11 September 1908, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A16FB3E5D12738DDDA90A94DC405B898CF1D3 Launch Brazil's Battleship],&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 April 1909, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After multiple [[Sea trial|trials]] of the speed, endurance, efficiency, and weaponry of the ship,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brazilian Battleship,&quot; ''United States Artillery'', 185–188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brazilian Battleship,&quot; ''Scientific American'', 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Minas Geraes'' was completed and handed over to Brazil on 5 January 1910.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Minas Geraes,&quot; ''[[The Times]]'', 6 January 1910, 4d.&lt;/ref&gt; ''São Paulo'' followed in July, after its own trials.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trials of the Sao Paulo,&quot; ''The Times'', 3 June 1910, 7c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gun Trials&quot;&gt;&quot;Gun Trials of the Sao Paulo,&quot; ''The Times'', 4 June 1910, 9b.&lt;/ref&gt; The third dreadnought, which would have been named {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Rio de Janeiro||2}} and was provided for in the original contract, was laid down on 16 March, but as the ship had already been eclipsed by new naval technology (chiefly the advent of [[super-dreadnought]]s, beginning with the British {{HMS|Orion|1910|6}}), the Brazilian government canceled its on 7 May and asked Armstrong to prepare a new design.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 249, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|''Rio de Janeiro'' was eventually constructed as a much larger ship with fourteen 12-inch guns in seven turrets, all mounted on the centerline, but it was sold partway through construction to the Ottoman Empire. Later, shortly after the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out, the ship was taken over by the United Kingdom as {{HMS|Agincourt|1913|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 281–282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preston, &quot;Great Britain,&quot; 37.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

At this time, the dreadnought design had not been fully validated, despite the success of the British namesake;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina354&quot;&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 354.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, there were still concerns that the ''Minas Geraes'' class' [[superfire|superfiring]] turret arrangement—which had not been utilized on the original ''Dreadnought'', but was also being installed on the American {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|4}}—would cause [[Blast injury|blast]] to hurt the crew in the lower turret.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brazilian Battleship,&quot; ''United States Artillery'', 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times 22 January&quot;&gt;&quot;The New Brazilian Battleships,&quot; ''The Times'', 22 January 1910, 16f.&lt;/ref&gt; Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Times 22 January&quot; /&gt; though the [[The Times|''Times'']] (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during ''São Paulo''{{'}}s gun trials in June 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gun Trials&quot; /&gt;

The start of work on ''Minas Geraes'' meant that Brazil had become the third country—behind the United Kingdom and the United States but ahead of major powers such as Germany, France, Russia and Japan—to have a dreadnought under construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways403&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Although Germany laid down their first dreadnought, {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, two months after ''Minas Geraes'', the German vessel was completed first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways403&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, &quot;Germany,&quot; 145.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The order for the dreadnoughts caused an immediate stir in the United States and Europe; in the words of the British ''[[Navy League Annual]]'', they &quot;astonished the naval world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81 from ''The Navy League Annual'', ''1910–1911'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] opened an article on ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} launch with &quot;What on paper at least is the most powerful warship ever built for any navy ...&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest Warships&quot; /&gt; while ''[[Scientific American]]'' called ''Minas Geraes'' &quot;the last word in heavy battleship design and the ... most powerfully armed warship afloat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brazilian Battleship,&quot; ''Scientific American'', 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Some publications, like the American ''[[Advocate of Peace]]'', decried the dreadnought purchase for its cost, calling it &quot;a showy and pretentious naval policy seemingly for the sheer indulgence of national pride&quot; and continuing with &quot;[sinking] money into useless warships when, it is understood, foreign money has had to be borrowed for city improvements in Rio de Janeiro is pitiful politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mead, &quot;Reaction,&quot; 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debated purchasing the ships in March 1908 to bolster the Royal Navy while simultaneously ensuring they would not be sold to a foreign rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss246&quot; /&gt; The topic arose again in July and September, when [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Arthur Lee]] expressed his discomfort at the possible final dispositions of the Brazilian ships, as any sale had the potential to disrupt their &quot;[[Two-Power Standard]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss246&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19080912.2.100 British and Foreign News],&quot; ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]]'', 12 September 1908, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[International Marine Engineering]]'' analyzed the effect of a sale to Japan, stating that the total [[broadside]] weight of Japan's [[line of battle]] would be increased by 31.6%, and the only ships capable of matching the ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} in the near future would be the American {{sclass-|Delaware|battleship|5}} and German {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|4}}es.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; ''International Marine Engineering'', 362–363.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers and journals around the world speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, &quot;Colossos do mares,&quot; 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mead, &quot;Reaction,&quot; 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for a sale seemed strong, as Brazilian attempts to [[Float (money supply)|float]] a multi-million-dollar loan against the value of their coffee crop in 1908 were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss247&quot;&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 247.&lt;/ref&gt; With three dreadnoughts planned (including the upcoming {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Rio de Janeiro|1913|2}}), a Spanish naval journal stated &quot;it was only natural that rumors [would begin] to circulate supporting the argument that Brazil acted as an intermediary for some great power which would acquire them before they terminate their construction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Scheina, ''Naval History'', 354 from ''Revista General de Marina'' 64 (1908): 724.&lt;/ref&gt; Various British papers speculated that either the Germans, Japanese, or Americans were actually buying the ships, while naval experts in Germany thought the Americans, British, or Japanese were going to take them over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways404&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;British-Brazilian Warships,&quot; ''The Navy'', 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brazilian &quot;Dreadnoughts&quot;,&quot; ''The Navy'', 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NEM19090406.2.10 The Race for Naval Supremacy],&quot; [[The Nelson Mail|''Nelson Evening Mail'']], 6 April 1909, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the Atlantic, some American papers theorized that the ships would be sold to the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Germany May Buy&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany May Buy English Warships],&quot; ''The New York Times'', 9 August 1908, C8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1908-09-11/ed-1/seq-4/ Another British Dreadnought and a Brazilian Battleship on the Water],&quot; ''[[The New York Tribune]]'', 11 September 1908, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1908-07-01/ed-1/seq-6/ Brazil, Japan, and Great Britain],&quot; [[The Sun (New York)|''The Sun'']] (New York), 1 July 1908, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian government was forced to deny these spurious allegations several times.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Reported Purchase of Battleships,&quot; ''The Navy'' (Washington), 39; &quot;[http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000711/19090419/071/0002 Brazilian Minister and 'No Ulterior Designs'],&quot; ''Lancashire Evening Post'', 19 April 1909, 2; &quot;[http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19090420/118/0005 Brazilian Battleship Launched at Barrow],&quot; ''Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer'', 20 April 1909, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] remarked:
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:90%;&quot;&gt;The rumor is that the three warships&amp;nbsp;... ordered [in Britain] two years ago will be launched from English shores only to fly the German flag. It is asserted that these ships, which are named the Sao Paulo, the Minas Geras [''[[sic]]''] and the Rio de Janeiro, and all of which will be completed by next fall, will be conveyed to the German government on the payment of $30,000,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:90%;&quot;&gt;It may be recalled that when orders were placed for the ships&amp;nbsp;... there was much speculation as to the destiny of the vessels, as no naval expert could understand how a second-rate power like Brazil needed such formidable engines of war which would represent absolutely the latest stages of naval construction and armament. Meanwhile, it had been reported that the ships were being built for the Japanese government, which had a secret understanding with Brazil. But this theory was soon discarded by the fact that relations between these two countries were not extremely cordial on account of the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese laborers.{{efn-ua|''[[cf.]]'' [[Japanese Brazilian]]. A series of rumors supporting this theory, where Brazil was alleged to have placed large armament orders in the United Kingdom on behalf of Japan (who would then use them against the United States), was strongly denied by the Brazilian government. Rio Branco, through a [[telegram]] sent to the Brazilian ambassador to the United States [[Joaquim Nabuco]], based his counter-argument in the close relationship between Brazilian and American governments, saying &quot;every sensible person will understand that an honest and respectable government would not lend itself to play the part attributed to Brazil by the inventor of the news.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Reported Purchase of Battleships,&quot; ''The Navy'' (Washington), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; }} Then it was semi-officially stated that the ships would never leave the ways except to fly the British flag, but the money for such a purpose could only be raised by a loan or the Admiralty getting the sum from the sinking fund—contingencies which would naturally become public property long before they could be carried out. (&quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany May Buy English Warships],&quot; ''New York Times'', 9 August 1908, C8)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the speculation, the United States quickly began courting Brazil as an ally; caught up in the spirit, US naval journals began using terms like &quot;Pan Americanism&quot; and &quot;Hemispheric Cooperation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways404&quot; /&gt;

In South America, the ships came as a rude shock and kindled a naval arms race among Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. The 1902 treaty between the latter two was canceled upon the Brazilian dreadnought order so both could be free to build their own dreadnoughts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore32&quot; /&gt; Argentina in particular was alarmed at the possible power of the ships. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca]], remarked that either ''Minas Geraes'' or ''São Paulo'' could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martins76&quot; /&gt; While this may have been hyperbole, either one was much more powerful than any single vessel in the Argentinian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, &quot;Argentina,&quot; 400.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Argentines quickly responded to the dreadnoughts with an order to the United States for two of their own, the {{sclass-|Rivadavia|battleship|4}}, while Chile ordered two of the {{sclass-|Almirante Latorre|battleship|4}} from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joao Candido.jpg|thumb|240px|[[João Cândido Felisberto]] with reporters, officers and sailors on board ''Minas Geraes'' on 26 November 1910, the last day of the Revolt of the Lash]]
{{Main|Revolt of the Lash}}
Soon after ''São Paulo''{{'}}s arrival, a major rebellion known as the Revolt of the Lash, or ''Revolta da Chibata'', broke out on four of the newest ships in the Brazilian Navy. The initial spark was provided on 16 November 1910 when [[Afro-Brazilian]] sailor [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]] was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination.{{efn-ua|The sailor's back was later described by [[José Carlos de Carvalho]], a retired navy captain assigned by the Brazilian government as their representative to the mutineers, as &quot;a mullet sliced open for salting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Morgan, &quot;The Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 41.&lt;/ref&gt; }} Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the ''[[Lei Áurea]]'' (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of ''Minas Geraes'', ''São Paulo'', the twelve-year-old {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Deodoro||2}}, and the new {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on ''Minas Geraes'' and one each on ''São Paulo'' and ''Bahia'' were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;The Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 32–38, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers—led by [[João Cândido Felisberto]]—was the abolition of &quot;slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy&quot;. They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including ''bôlo'' (being struck on the hand with a [[ferrule]]) and the use of whips or lashes (''chibata''), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general [[amnesty]] for the sailors. Senator [[Ruy Barbosa]], long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the [[Federal Senate]] on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;The Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, ''Bahia''{{'}}s sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns. They planned to attack on the morning of the 25th, when the government expected the mutineers would return to [[Guanabara Bay]]. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125–23 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on the 26th.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;The Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the revolt, the ships were noted by many observers to be well-handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch were not, which led to a suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} guns were fully operational, and while ''São Paulo''{{'}}s could not be turned after salt water contaminated the [[hydraulic]] system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;The Revolt of the Lash,&quot; 39–40, 48–49, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina73&quot;&gt;Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later career ===
Three years after the mutiny, ''Minas Geraes'' was used to transport Brazilian [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Lauro Müller]] to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D02EEDE163DE633A25751C1A9619C946296D6CF Brazilian Envoy Host on Warship],&quot; ''The New York Times'', 12 July 1913, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9406E4DF153FE633A2575BC1A9609C946296D6CF Tell Brazil's Envoy of Trade Problems],&quot; ''The New York Times'', 18 June 1913, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minas Poder&quot;&gt;&quot;E Minas Geraes,&quot; ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship returned on 16 July and arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 16 August. In September both ''Minas Geraes'' and ''São Paulo'' participated in a major exercise with most of the Brazilian Navy. The need for more modern fire control system was identified as early as late 1913, but no action was taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minas Poder&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paulo Poder&quot;&gt;&quot;E São Paulo,&quot; ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt; When Brazil entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917, they were offered to the United Kingdom for service in the [[Grand Fleet]], but the British declined due to the condition the ships were in. They had not been modernized since entering service, and maintenance had been neglected; to illustrate the problem, when Brazil sent ''São Paulo'' to the United States for a modernization in June 1918, fourteen of the eighteen [[boiler]]s that powered the ship failed. The ship only finished the voyage to New York with the assistance of the American battleship {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|2}} and cruiser {{USS|Raleigh|C-8|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 26, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Minas Geraes'' followed after its sister's return, and the modernization was done between 1 September 1920 and 1 October 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minas Poder&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley26&quot;&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minas Geraes MdB II.jpg|thumb|left|''Minas Geraes'' after its 1930s modernization, possibly during the Second World War]]
''São Paulo'' made two trips to Europe in 1920. The first conveyed King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]] and Queen [[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium|Elisabeth]] of [[Belgium]] to Brazil for the centennial celebrations. After ''São Paulo'' brought them home, the ship traveled to Portugal to take the bodies of the formerly-exiled Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] and his wife, [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies|Teresa Cristina]], back to Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paulo Poder&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|''cf.''

''São Paulo'' shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; ''Minas Geraes'' did not fire its guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialMinas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialPaulo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poder&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poggio&quot;&gt;Poggio, &quot;Um encouraçado.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Scheina asserts that ''Minas Geraes'' shelled the fort,&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 195.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by multiple other sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialMinas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialPaulo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poder&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poggio&quot; /&gt; }} In 1924, three lieutenants, including [[Hercolino Cascardo]], took over ''São Paulo'' with other crewmen. They were unsuccessful in swaying any other ships to their cause, except for an old torpedo boat, and soon sailed out of the harbor after firing a six-pounder gun at ''Minas Geraes''. Short of food and with [[Surface condenser|condensers]] in poor condition, the rebels sailed to [[Montevideo]], where they received asylum. ''Minas Geraes'' followed ''São Paulo'', arriving on 11 November and taking back possession of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Minas Geraes'' was modernized at the [[Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard]] from June 1931 to 1938,&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss289&quot;&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,&quot; 289.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The 1938 date is somewhat variable; Topliss states &quot;A ... modernization was undertaken in Brazil during the 1930s.

''Minas Geraes'' and ''São Paulo'' were originally armed with twelve [[EOC 12 inch/45 naval gun|12-inch/45]] [[caliber#Caliber as unit of measurement|caliber]], twenty-two 4.7-inch/50 caliber, and eight [[Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers|3-pounder]] naval guns. The [[main battery]] was arranged with four [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets, two each fore and aft, and two placed ''[[en echelon]]''. The 4.7-inch secondary guns were placed in [[casemate]]s along the side of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways404&quot; /&gt;

The propulsion of the two ships was provided by Vickers [[vertical triple expansion]] engines instead of the [[steam turbine]]s being used to power most contemporary dreadnoughts. Eighteen boilers provided power to the engines, which in turn rotated the two three-bladed [[propeller]]s with 23,500 [[shaft horsepower]]. Their designed top speed was {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}, though this was frequently unattainable in their later careers owing to substandard maintenance and neglect. The ships could carry {{convert|2350|t|LT}} of coal and {{convert|400|t|LT}} of oil, and their original endurance was {{convert|10000|nmi|mi km}} when traveling at {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways404&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss250&quot;&gt;Topliss, &quot;The Brazilian Battleship,&quot; 250.&lt;/ref&gt; During its trials, ''Minas Geraes'' was able to steam at {{convert|22.29|kn|mph km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;Earle, &quot;Professional Notes,&quot; 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main armor belt was [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented]] and nine&amp;nbsp;inches (230&amp;nbsp;mm) thick, but narrowed to six and three inches (150 and 76&amp;nbsp;mm) closer to each end of the ships. The [[barbette]]s were protected by nine-inch armor, while the turret had a twelve-inch (300&amp;nbsp;mm) front, eight-inch (200&amp;nbsp;mm) sides, and a two- to three-inch (51&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;76&amp;nbsp;mm) top, and the [[conning tower]] had twelve-inch armor. The deck armor had multiple decks of one-and-a-half to two&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;51&amp;nbsp;mm), one&amp;nbsp;inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm), and one&amp;nbsp;inch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Topliss250&quot; /&gt;

| File:Minas Geraes-class battleships.jpg|The {{sclass-|Minas Geraes|battleship|4}} was designed, constructed, and completed before the other South American dreadnoughts, but they were also smaller and not as well-armed. Two later dreadnoughts, [[Brazilian battleship Rio de Janeiro (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']] and [[#Riachuelo|''Riachuelo'']], were planned, but the former was sold to the Ottoman Empire amid falling government revenues, and the other was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 82; Vanterpool, &quot;The 'Riachuelo',&quot; 140.&lt;/ref&gt;
| File:Rivadavia-class battleships.jpg|The {{sclass-|Rivadavia|battleship|4}} was the second dreadnought class purchased by a South American country and the only ones to not be built by a British company. Ordered in response to the ''Minas Geraes'' class, they mounted the same-size [[main battery]] as the Brazilian ships (12-inch), but the Argentine ships were much larger and significantly better-armored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conways404&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheina82&quot;&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, &quot;Argentina,&quot; 401.&lt;/ref&gt;
| File:Brassey's HMS Canada Plan (1915).jpg|{{ship|Chilean battleship|Almirante Latorre||2}} was the last South American dreadnought built, and was larger and better armed than its counterparts. The more efficient arrangement of the five 14-inch turrets, with all mounted on the centerline rather than ''[[en echelon]]'', allowed the main battery to fire on a single [[broadside]] without damaging the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwaysGB&quot;&gt;Preston, &quot;Great Britain,&quot; 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
