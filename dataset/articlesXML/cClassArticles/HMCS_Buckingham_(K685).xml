'''HMCS ''Buckingham''''' was a {{sclass2-|River|frigate|1}} that served with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]] and as a {{sclass-|Prestonian|frigate|1}} from 1954–1965. She was named for [[Buckingham, Quebec]]. She is considered a significant part of Canadian naval history as used for some early trials of helicopter landings on smaller escort vessels. This led to the development of the future helicopter carrying destroyers.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalreview.ca/wp-content/uploads/public/vol6num1/vol6num1art9.pdf |title=Significant Canadian Warships |last=Thomas |first=Doug |work=Canadian Naval Review |page=43 |date=Spring 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buckingham'' was ordered 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943–1944 River-class building program.&lt;ref name=Macpherson&gt;{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910–1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages= |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/205.html|work=uboat.net |title=HMCS Buckingham (K 685) |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid down as ''Royal Mount''&lt;ref name=Lenton&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenton |first=H.T. |last2=Colledge |first2=J.J. |title=British and Dominion Warships of World War II |publisher=Doubleday and Company Inc. |year=1968 |place=New York |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 November 1943 by [[Davie Shipbuilding|Davie Shipbuilding &amp; Repairing Co. Ltd.]] at [[Lauzon, Quebec|Lauzon]] and launched 28 April 1944. Her name was changed to ''Buckingham'' and she was commissioned on 2 November 1944 at [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|River-class frigate}}

The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the [[Royal Navy]] at the time, including the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette|1}}. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the [[United Kingdom]], giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.friends-amis.org/index.php/en/document-repository/english/fact-sheets/44-canadian-river-class-frigate-1/file |title=Fact Sheet No. 21 – Canadian River Class Frigates |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral [[Percy Nelles]] of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2&gt;{{cite book|title=Frigates of the Royal Canadian Navy 1943–1974 |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |publisher=Vanwell Publishing |year=1989 |place=Lewiston, New York |pages=6–7, 15 |isbn=0920277225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at {{convert|7200|nmi|km}} at 12 knots.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat [[U-boats]] including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt; 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of {{HMCS|Valleyfield|K329|2}}, they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount.&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941.&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; The design was too big for the shipyards on the [[Great Lakes]] so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson2/&gt; In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=WarMuseum/&gt;

==Service history==
''Buckingham'' returned to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] after working up at [[Bermuda]] in January 1945 and was assigned to the convoy escort group EG 28. She remained with this unit until the end of hostilities in [[Europe]] performing local escort duties for coastal convoys along the eastern coast of [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;

On 10 May, {{GS|U-889||2}} was spotted south of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] by a [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] airplane, steaming at {{convert|10|kn}} and flying a [[List of black flags|black flag]] of surrender. The RCAF plane radioed to nearby [[Western Escort Force W-6]] who intercepted the [[submarine]] an hour later.  ''U-889'' was ordered to head to [[Bay Bulls, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bay Bulls, Newfoundland]]. 24 hours later ''U-889'' was turned over to the frigates ''Buckingham'' and {{HMCS|Inch Arran|K667|2}} who escorted her to [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne Harbour]] where she was boarded.&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite book|title=Through a Canadian Periscope: The Story of the Canadian Submarine Service |last=Ferguson |first=Julie H. |publisher=Dundurn |year=1995 |page=250 |isbn=1550022172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1945, ''Buckingham'' began a tropicalization refit at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]] in preparation for service in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. She moved to Shelburne to complete it however it was suspended before the work was done due to the [[Surrender of Japan]]. She was paid off 16 November 1945 at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] and placed in reserve.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;&lt;ref name=uboat/&gt;

===Postwar service===
''Buckingham'' was sold to Marine Industries Ltd. in 1946. She was reacquired by the RCN to undergo conversion to a ''Prestonian''-class ocean escort from 1953–1954.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] anti-submarine mortars.&lt;ref name=Jane&gt;{{cite book|title=Jane's Fighting Ships 1958–59 |editor=Raymond V.B. Blackman |publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc. |place=New York |year=1958 |isbn= |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Buckingham'' recommissioned at Montreal on 25 June 1954 with the pennant number 314.&lt;ref name=crowaug54&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Buckingham to Train New Entries |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=August 1954 |volume=6 |number=10 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon return to service, ''Buckingham'' was used for training purposes and assigned to {{HMCS|Cornwallis}}.&lt;ref name=crowaug54/&gt; In the summer of 1956, the Royal Canadian Navy believed that flying a helicopter equipped for anti-submarine warfare could be &quot;married&quot; to an existing anti-submarine platform such as a destroyer or frigate. To prove this, the RCN attached a small landing pad aft to ''Buckingham'' in October–December 1956 and attempted to land a [[Sikorsky H-19|Sikorsky HO4S-3]] on it. The attempts were successful and the pad was removed and tested again on the larger {{HMCS|Ottawa|DDH 229|2}}.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;{{cite book|title=Canada's Navy: The First Century |last=Milner |first=Marc |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0802096042 |page=212 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trials demonstrated that a helicopter could be landed and would lead to the development of the [[Beartrap (hauldown device)|Beartrap]], a mechanism designed by the RCN to keep the helicopter attached to the deck once it had landed.&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalreview.ca/wp-content/uploads/public/vol9num2/vol9num2art3.pdf |title=Perseverance: Some Reﬂections on 50 Years of the Canadian Sea King |last=Orr |first=John |work=Canadian Naval Review |date=Summer 2013 |pages=11–12 |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the frigate was a member of the [[Ninth Canadian Escort Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Ninth Escort Squadron |magazine=The Crowsnest |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=April 1961 |volume=13 |number=6 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1961, ''Buckingham'' toured the [[Great Lakes]], making several port visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Eight Ships Will Tour Great Lakes |magazine=The Crowsnest |volume=13 |number=7 |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=May 1961 |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buckingham'' served until [[paid off]] on 23 March 1965. She was sold for scrap and [[Ship breaking|broken up]] at [[La Spezia]], Italy in 1966.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt;
