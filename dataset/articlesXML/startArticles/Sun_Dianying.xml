'''Sun Dianying''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 孫殿英; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 孙殿英; [[pinyin]]: Sūn Diànyīng; [[Wade-Giles]]: '''Sun Tienying'''; 1889–1948) was one of the minor warlords during the [[Warlord Era]].

==Biography==
Born in 1889 in [[Yongcheng]], [[Henan]], Sun was originally a bandit in the area of [[Henan]] [[Anhui]]. He gradually extended his influence and power through years. In 1925 Sun joined the  [[National Revolutionary Army]]. In 1928, he plotted the notorious [[looting of the Eastern Mausoleum]] of the [[Manchu]] emperors. The tombs desecrated included that of the late [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. Later, with [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]], Sun participated in various anti-[[Chiang Kai-shek]] movements. In Jehol-Chahar Sun Dianying's army included the writer [[Duanmu Hongliang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LauHsia1981&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph S. M. Lau|author2=Chih-tsing Hsia|author3=Leo Ou-fan Lee|title=Modern Chinese Stories and Novellas, 1919-1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nngkptK9WoC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;dq=chahars+1919&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZpIjooInKAhXEbSYKHa6VBUoQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=chahars%201919&amp;f=false|date=January 1981|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-04203-1|pages=484–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932-33, when the Japanese forces of the IJA 4th Cavalry and 6th Division in [[Operation Nekka]] invaded [[Jehol Province|Jehol]]/[[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] he commanded the 41st Army in effective opposition to the Japanese in the [[Battle of Rehe]]. This slightly rehabilitated his reputation, but he also seized the chance to expand his strength. At the time of the [[Tanggu Truce]], Sun's troops garrisoned the strategic Peiking Suiyuan railroad.

In May 1933, with [[Feng Yuxiang]] in [[Chahar (province)|Chahar]] province organizing the [[Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army]], Sun too advocated opposition to Japan and criticised Chiang Kai-shek's Central government, yet protested his loyalty to Chiang. The national government feared Sun Dianying would cooperate with Feng's Anti-Japanese Army, allowing them to use the railroad to support their forces. However Sun was also not willing to be involved in a conflict with Chiang.  He hoped to be involved in northwest development and control a territory of his own there. In mid June, when Chiang ordered Sun's army to leave the railroad garrison and open up wasteland in [[Qinghai]] he was willing to go. Chiang's troops replaced them in July, cutting off the Anti-Japanese Army from communication with the rest of China.

Chiang intended the allied northwest [[Ma clique]] would have the strength to cope with Sun Dianying and be weakened themselves. Additionally Chiang sent Zhu Shaoliang to the northwest as [[Gansu]] Pacification Director, who for his own benefit, secretly encouraged the three Ma Sultanates to block and prevent Sun from entering his new post. Strong protests from the region, and Chiang's weakness in the area eventually persuaded him to halt Sun's advance through [[Suiyuan]] province in November 1933. However his forces became short of food and restive from their inactivity.

In January 1934 with his army threatened with starvation and mutiny, Sun Dianying was forced to march his 60,000 man army west from Suiyuan province into [[Ningxia]], governed by [[Ma Hongbin]].  Supported by his fellow Ma Clique warlords [[Ma Hongkui]] in [[Gansu]],  and [[Ma Bufang]] with his younger brother [[Ma Buqing]] in Qinghai, Ma Hungpin refused and with the united Ma forces began the Four Ma Jusun Campaign. Both sides battled for three months, with heavy loss to both sides.  At last in March Yan Xishan dispatched troops into the battle cutting Sun's avenue of retreat, while Chiang Kai-Shek seized the chance to publicly abolish Sun's various duties.  Sun Dianying was compelled to retreat back to [[Baotou]] in the beginning of April, and then went to Taiyuan to live in seclusion, the remnants of his defeated troops were incorporated by Yan Xishan into his provincial forces.

In 1937, when the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] erupted, Sun resurfaced once again commanding troops against the Japanese, taking command of the Hebei-Chahar Guerillas in 1938. In 1943 he became the General commanding 5th Army. However he surrendered to the Japanese soon after and joined [[Wang Jingwei]]'s collaborationist [[Nanjing Nationalist Government]], given command of 24th Army Group and the 6th Front Army, also a member of its National Military Council. In August 1943 his command was defeated by [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] forces in the [[Linnan Campaign]].

When the Second Sino-Japanese War was over, Sun participated in the [[Chinese Civil War]] on Nationalist's side. In 1947, he was defeated by [[People's Liberation Army]] and was taken prisoner. In October 1948, he died in the POW camp of [[Wu'an]].
