'''SMS ''Victoria Louise''''' was the [[lead ship]] of [[Victoria Louise-class cruiser|her class]] of [[protected cruiser]]s, built for the German [[Imperial German Navy|Imperial Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine'') in the late 1890s. She was laid down at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in 1895, launched in March 1897, and commissioned into the German fleet in February 1899. She was named after [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Princess Victoria Louise]], the daughter of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]. The ship was armed with a battery of two 21&amp;nbsp;cm guns and eight 15&amp;nbsp;cm guns and had a top speed of {{convert|19.2|kn|lk=in}}.

''Victoria Louise'' served with the fleet for the first seven years of her career. During this time, she represented Germany during the funeral of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1901. In 1906, she was modernized and after 1908, used as a training ship for naval cadets. In 1909, she visited the United States, and at the outbreak of [[World War I]], was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group. She was attacked unsuccessfully by the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|E1}} in October 1914, and at the end of the year she was withdrawn from service. She was used as a [[minelayer]] and [[barracks ship]] based in [[Danzig]] for the rest of the war. ''Victoria Louise'' was sold in 1919 and converted into a freighter the following year, though she served in this capacity until 1923, when she was broken up for scrap.

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Victoria Luise LOC det.4a19530.jpg|thumb|left| ''Victoria Louise'' during visit to US in 1909]]

[[File:Victoria louise Gac12.jpg|thumb|Postcard of ''Victoria Louise'']]
''Victoria Louise'' joined the squadron, commanded by [[Prince Heinrich]], that went to Britain to participate in the funeral of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1901. Along with ''Victoria Louise'', {{SMS|Baden|1880|2}}, {{SMS|Hagen||2}}, and {{SMS|Nymphe||2}} represented Germany at [[Spithead]].&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Notes'', p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, ''Victoria Louise'' was assigned to the Cruiser Division of the I Squadron of the German home fleet. The Division consisted of the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}}, the [[flagship]], {{SMS|Freya||2}}, and the light cruisers {{SMS|Hela||2}}, {{SMS|Amazone|1900|2}}, and {{SMS|Niobe||2}}. The Division participated in the summer fleet maneuvers of August&amp;ndash;September 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the ship went into dock for modernization in the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Kiel]].&lt;ref name=G47/&gt; After emerging from the drydock in 1908, ''Victoria Louise'' served as a [[school ship|training ship]] for naval cadets and cabin boys.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt; In September&amp;ndash;October 1909, ''Victoria Louise'', {{SMS|Hertha||2}} , {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}}, and {{SMS|Bremen||2}} traveled to the United States to represent Germany during the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine &amp; Panetta, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, [[Theodor Krancke]] served aboard the ship as a cadet; he would go on to command the heavy cruiser [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

She served as a school ship until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914.&lt;ref name=G48/&gt; She was briefly mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name=GG142&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after 0900 on 17 October, the British submarine {{HMS|E1}}, commanded by [[Noel Laurence]], attempted to torpedo ''Victoria Louise'' at a range of {{convert|460|m|abbr=on}}. The torpedo ran too deep, however, and missed.&lt;ref&gt;Compton-Hall, pp. 137&amp;ndash;138&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service.&lt;ref name=GG142/&gt; She was put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a [[minelayer]] and [[barracks ship]] in [[Danzig]].&lt;ref name=G48/&gt; In 1916, ''Victoria Louise'' was disarmed. She remained in service in Danzig until 1 October 1919, when she was stricken from the [[naval register]]. She was sold to the [[Norddeutscher Tiefbau]] company and rebuilt in 1920 into a freighter. She was renamed ''Flora Sommerfeld'' and operated by [[Danziger Hoch- und Tiefbau GmbH]]. She served in this capacity only briefly; she was broken up for scrap in 1923 in Danzig.&lt;ref name=G478/&gt;
