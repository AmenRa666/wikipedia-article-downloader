The '''3rd Light Horse Regiment''' was a [[mounted infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[Australian Army]] during the [[First World War]]. The regiment was raised in September 1914, and by December as part of the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]] had moved overseas. The regiment only fought against the forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]], in Egypt, at [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli]], on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded nineteen [[battle honours]].

During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the state of [[South Australia]]. It was later converted to a reconnaissance squadron during the [[Second World War]] but was disbanded in early 1943 without having been deployed overseas. In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised as an amalgamated unit, designated the [[3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles)]], which is currently part of the [[Australian Army Reserve]].

==Formation==
On 17 August 1914, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was raised in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] and in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt; It had an establishment of twenty-five officers and 497 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] serving in three [[squadron (army)|squadrons]], each of six [[troop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gullett 1941, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Each troop was divided into eight [[Section (military unit)|section]]s, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse&lt;/ref&gt;
Once formed the regiment was assigned to the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]] serving alongside the [[1st Light Horse Regiment (Australia)|1st]] and [[2nd Light Horse Regiment (Australia)|2nd Light Horse Regiments]].&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt;

All [[Australian Light Horse]] regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were [[mounted infantry]] armed with rifles, not swords or lances,&lt;ref&gt;Gullett 1941, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and mounted exclusively on the Australian [[Waler horse]].&lt;ref&gt;Gullett 1941, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:3rd Light Horse Palestine.jpg|thumb|3rd Light Horse Regiment in front of Bethlehem]]

===Gallipoli===
In October 1914, the regiment left Australia, bound for the Middle East. After arriving in Egypt in December, they took part in the [[North African theatre (World War I)|North African campaign]] defending the [[Suez Canal]]. They remained there until May 1915, when they left for the [[Gallipoli campaign]] with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC).&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt; The regiment left their horses in Egypt, and arrived at the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula on 12 May 1915.&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt; Here regiment fought in the [[Landing at Anzac Cove]], and the [[Battle of Sari Bair]], but spent most of the campaign in a defensive posture. The regiment left Gallipoli for Egypt in December 1915, by which time they had earned four [[battle honours]].&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt;

===Sinai and Palestine Campaign===

After its return to Egypt, the regiment&amp;nbsp;– along with the rest of the 1st Light Horse Brigade&amp;nbsp;– became part of the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]], and was given responsibility for the defence of the [[Suez Canal]] from raiding [[Senussi]] Arabs. On 4 August 1916, they fought in the [[Battle of Romani]], before being withdrawn to rest and refit.&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt; The regiment rejoined the brigade in November and took part in the  battles of [[Battle of Magdhaba|Maghaba]] and [[Battle of Rafa|Rafa]] in December 1916 and January 1917. This was followed by defeat in the [[Second Battle of Gaza]] in April 1917, and then the successful [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] and the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] in October and November.&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt;

The regiment followed up the retreating Ottoman forces and fought in the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)#21–24 November: Battle of Nebi Samwil|Battle of Nebi Samwill]], the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Battle of Jerusalam]], the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Battle of Jaffa]], the [[Capture of Jericho (1918)|capture of Jericho]], the [[First Transjordan attack on Amman (1918)|attack on Amman]], the [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918)|attack on Es Salt]] and finally, in September and October 1918, the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battles and Megiddo]] and [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Nablus]].&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt;

The Ottoman Empire signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]] on 30 October 1918, bring the war to an end. No longer required, the regiment sailed for Australia in March 1919 and subsequently disbanded. Their campaigns in the First World War cost them 158 men killed and 653 men wounded.&lt;ref name=3rdlhr/&gt;

==Perpetuation==
In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the honours and traditions of the AIF by reorganising the units of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Force]] to replicate the numerical designations of their related AIF units.&lt;ref&gt;Grey 2008, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the 3rd Light Horse was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the [[4th Military District (Australia)|4th Military District]],&lt;ref name=Finlayson190&gt;Finlayson 2012, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; which encompassed the state of South Australia and part of New South Wales. Adopting the designation of the &quot;South Australian Mounted Rifles&quot;, it assumed the lineage of several previously existing militia units, including the 22nd Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles) that had been formed in 1912. This unit traced its lineage back to the 16th Australian Light Horse Regiment (South Australian Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of [[Colonial forces of Australia|Australia's colonial forces]] into the Australian Army after [[Federation of Australia|Federation]].&lt;ref name=Festberg40&gt;Festberg 1972, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of the Second World War, the 3rd Light Horse was assigned to the [[4th Cavalry Brigade (Australia)|4th Cavalry Brigade]], which was part of the [[1st Cavalry Division (Australia)|1st Cavalry Division]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson190/&gt; In December 1941, the regiment was re-organised as a reconnaissance company, adopting the designation of the 3rd Reconnaissance Company (South Austraolian Mounted Rifles), although this was changed in May 1942 to the 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron.&lt;ref name=Festberg41&gt;Festberg 1972, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1943, as the Australian Army undertook a partial demobilisation, the unit was deemed surplus to requirements and was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war.&lt;ref name=Festberg41/&gt;

In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised in 1948 equipped with armoured cars.&lt;ref name=Finlayson313&gt;Finlayson 2012, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially designated the 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment (South Australian Mounted Rifles), but the following year it was amalgamated with the 9th Light Horse and re-designated the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles).&lt;ref&gt;Festberg 1972, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd/9th remains part of the [[Australian Army Reserve]] and is currently part of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson313/&gt;
