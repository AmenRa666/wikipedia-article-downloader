[[Air marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] '''Sir Colin Thomas Hannah''', {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|KCMG|KCVO|KBE|CB}} (22 December 1914 – 22 May 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and a [[Governor of Queensland]]. Born in [[Western Australia]], he was a member of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] before joining the RAAF in 1935. After graduating as a pilot, Hannah served in [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;22]] and [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|23 Squadrons]] from 1936 to 1939. During the early years of World War&amp;nbsp;II, he was the RAAF's Deputy Director of Armament. He then saw action in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] as commander of [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron]] and, later, [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]], operating [[Bristol Beaufort]] bombers. By 1944, he had risen to the rank of [[group captain]], and at the end of the war was in charge of [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Area Command]] in [[Perth]].

Hannah commanded [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland, in 1949–50, and saw service during the [[Malayan Emergency]] as senior air staff officer at {{nowrap|[[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Air Force Headquarters]]}}, Singapore, from 1956 to 1959. His other post-war appointments included [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1961 to 1965, [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]] from 1965 to 1967, and AOC [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]] from 1968 to 1969. In January 1970, he was promoted to air marshal and became [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1971, Hannah concluded his three-year appointment as CAS a year early, in March 1972, to become Governor of Queensland. He attracted controversy in this role after making comments critical of the [[Government of Australia|Federal government]] of the day, and the British government refused to agree to his term being extended. Hannah retired in March 1977, and died the following year.

==Early career==

Born on 22 December 1914 in [[Menzies, Western Australia|Menzies]], Western Australia, Hannah was the son of Thomas Howard Hannah, a [[Civil service|public servant]] who later became a [[magistrate]] in [[Perth]], and his wife Johanna. Hannah attended the [[Hale School]], leaving with a Junior Certificate in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Coulthard-Clark | first=Chris|year=1996|id=A140427b|title=Hannah, Colin Thomas (1914–1978)|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with an [[Australian Army Reserve|Australian Militia]] unit, the 8th Field Artillery Brigade, from February 1933, and became a clerk in the Crown Law Department of the State Public Service later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] on 15&amp;nbsp;January 1935 as an air cadet at [[RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria. After graduating from [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS), he obtained his commission as a [[pilot officer]] in July 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; His first posting was to [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales. Promoted to [[flying officer]], he was appointed [[adjutant]] with the newly formed [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;23 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria, in May 1937. Hannah accompanied the squadron, which operated [[Hawker Demon]]s and [[Avro Anson]]s, to its new location at the recently opened [[RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, in March 1938. On 5&amp;nbsp;January 1939, he married Patricia Gordon at [[Claremont, Western Australia|Claremont]]; the couple had a daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Having specialised as an [[flight instructor|instructor]], he then served on the staff of No.&amp;nbsp;1 FTS, Point Cook.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 150–152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/134/Air-Marshals.aspx |title=Air Marshals|publisher= [[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate= 1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[Image:OG0343Beaufort6Sqn.jpg|thumb|left|Beauforts of Nos. 6 and 8 Squadron at Goodenough Island, November 1943|alt=Twin-engined military aircraft on runway]]
Promoted to [[flight lieutenant]], Hannah was posted to Britain in July 1939 to undertake a [[Royal Air Force]] armaments training course, which he had barely begun when war was declared on 3&amp;nbsp;September. He completed the course, and returned to Australia in March 1940. After brief postings to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Armament School, Point Cook, and Station Headquarters Laverton, he was assigned to Air Force Headquarters, [[Melbourne]], in May. He was made an acting [[squadron leader]] in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the next year. In April 1942, Hannah was promoted to temporary [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He undertook a general reconnaissance course the following May.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;

In November 1943, Hannah was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron]] at [[Milne Bay]], Papua, flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] light bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070555--1-.PDF ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 99–103]&lt;/ref&gt; During a familiarisation flight he came under [[friendly fire]] from [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] on [[Kiriwina|Kiriwina Island]], but avoided serious injury. He was raised to temporary [[group captain]] in December, and assumed command of [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The Beauforts of No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron and No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing took part in a series of [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|major attacks on Rabaul]], bombing and strafing airfields, infrastructure and shipping; this continued until February 1944, when the Japanese withdrew their aircraft from Rabaul.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070555--1-.PDF ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 93–96]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070557--1-.PDF ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 125–133]&lt;/ref&gt;  The same month, Hannah fell ill and had to be repatriated to Australia. After six weeks recuperation at Laverton, he returned to No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron, based on [[Goodenough Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; From March to August, the squadron was mainly involved in convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070567--1-.PDF ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 330]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1944, Hannah was appointed senior air staff officer (SASO) at [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Headquarters Western Area Command]], Perth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He took over control of the formation from Air Commodore [[Raymond Brownell]] in July 1945, following Brownell's departure to command [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Edmonds|first=Leigh|year=1993|id=A130318b|title=Brownell, Raymond James (1894–1974)|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah handed over command of Western Area in October 1946, and was posted to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46179547 |title=For staff school |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=25 October 1946 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, he undertook study at [[RAF Staff College, Andover]], and served as SASO at [[RAAF Overseas Headquarters]] in London. Returning to Australia, in May 1949 he assumed command of [[RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland. From August 1950, he also held temporary command of the base's [[Avro Lincoln]] heavy bomber formation, [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;82 Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50239546 |title=On-the-job training |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=28 August 1951 |accessdate=1 May 2011 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to substantive group captain in October 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50045561 |title=Air promotion |newspaper=The Courier-Mail |location=Brisbane |date=20 October 1950 |accessdate=1 May 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 1951 [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Year Honours]], in particular for his &quot;exceptional ability&quot; as SASO at RAAF Overseas Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39105|supp=yes|startpage=36|date=29 December 1950|accessdate=on 22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19510101&amp;id=DhBVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JpMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5317,22057 |title=All walks of life in New Year's Honours|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 January 1951 |accessdate=16 May 2012 |page=3 |publisher=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September that year, he was made Director of Personnel Services; his position became Director-General of Personnel in July 1952. As [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]], Hannah was heavily involved in planning the RAAF's part in the [[1954 Royal Tour of Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] that June.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40189|supp=yes|startpage=3296|date=1 June 1954|accessdate= 22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Hannah attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in London, and was promoted to [[air commodore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was posted to Singapore as SASO, [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Air Force Headquarters]], in January 1956, handling [[counter-insurgency]] operations during the [[Malayan Emergency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Hannah's &quot;distinguished service&quot; during the conflict was recognised with his appointment as a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in June 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41739|supp=yes|startpage=3905|date=12 June 1959|accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Director-General of Plans and Policy from March 1959, he was responsible for commencing the Department of Air's relocation from Melbourne to [[Canberra]]. In December 1961, Hannah was appointed [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], receiving promotion to acting [[air vice marshal]] in May 1962; the rank was made substantive in January 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was later described by his staff officer in this role as &quot;brusque&quot; and &quot;impersonal&quot; though not unsympathetic, his &quot;uncommunicative&quot; manner stemming from a preference to &quot;do his own research, think out the substance of his project submissions, dictate to his stenographer, then amend to his own satisfaction&quot;, rather than delegate.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, ''Up and Away'', pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah served as [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Operational Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]) from February 1965 to December 1967, during which time the RAAF's fighter squadrons completed their conversion from the [[CAC Sabre]] to the supersonic [[Dassault Mirage&amp;nbsp;III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A3.htm |title=Dassault Mirage III|publisher= [[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate= 30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure also saw the deployment of the first Australian helicopters to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], eight [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]] of [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Squadron]] that departed Sydney in May 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 264–268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://vietnam-war.commemoration.gov.au/royal-australian-air-force/images/rc07157.pdf|title=Iroquois fly in farewell|newspaper=RAAF News|location=Canberra |date=June 1966 |accessdate=16 May 2012 |page=1 |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah's next appointment was as AOC [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]], responsible for training and maintenance in the Air Force.

Hannah was promoted to [[air marshal]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1970, and succeeded Air Marshal [[Alister Murdoch|Sir Alister Murdoch]] as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Murdoch had earlier recommended Hannah, known to be a strong advocate for [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australian participation in the Vietnam War]], for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for rotation at the end of 1969; the post went to an [[Australian Army|Army]] officer, and the Federal government ordered the withdrawal of the RAAF presence in Vietnam during Hannah's tour as CAS.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1970, the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], [[Malcolm Fraser]], commissioned a review of naval air power. Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the [[Royal Australian Navy]] should operate land-based aircraft, claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia's limited defence resources were not spread across three services. Confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to &quot;avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land-based air force&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee]], Admiral [[Victor Smith|Sir Victor Smith]], to use the soon-to-be-delivered [[General Dynamics F-111C|F-111 bomber]] for maritime support, among other roles.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1971 New Year Honours, Hannah was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=45263|supp=yes|startpage=34|date=31 December 1970|accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF's [[Golden Jubilee]], celebrated in March and April that year. He personally organised a fly-past of two [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] F-111s at [[air show]]s marking the occasion, generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type's long-delayed entry into Australian service.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year. Firstly, he was a member of the committee to choose an [[Royal Australian Air Force Memorial|Air Force memorial]] to be located on [[Anzac Parade, Canberra|Anzac Parade]], Canberra. The selected design was an abstract sculpture that, according to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens, reflected &quot;the selection panel's comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo, pp. 452-453&quot;/&gt; Secondly, Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force's winter uniform, traditionally a shade &quot;somewhere between royal and navy blue&quot; that had been personally chosen by the RAAF's first CAS, Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo, pp. 452-453&quot;/&gt; Hannah publicly debuted the uniform that he approved, an all-purpose middle-blue suit, at a Point Cook graduation parade on 8&amp;nbsp;December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Parnell; Boughton, ''Flypast'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; It was the object of much adverse comment in the ensuing years; personnel complained of being mistaken for bus, train and postal employees. One of Hannah's successors as CAS, Air Marshal [[Errol McCormack]], ordered that the uniform revert to Williams' original colour and style commencing in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF&quot;/&gt;

Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was cut short by some ten months when he accepted an offer to serve as [[Governor of Queensland]], becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] appointment. The announcement was made in January 1972, and he took office on 21&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=45638|startpage=4071|date=6 April 1972|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded [[Alan Mansfield|Sir Alan Mansfield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Governors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govhouse.qld.gov.au/the-governor-of-queensland/governors-of-queensland.aspx?page=2|title=Governors of Queensland|publisher= The Office of the Governor, Queensland|accessdate= 10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah did not have a strong connection with Queensland at the time of his appointment, and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Soldiers in Politics'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship, and was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Chiefs&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'', pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Described when he took office as &quot;a man with the flexibility of mind and ability to mix with people, so necessary for a Governor&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Hannah was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG) and a [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Knight and Deputy Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John]] in September 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=45776|startpage=10843|date=12 September 1972|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=45777|startpage=10924|date=14 September 1972|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His term as Governor was relatively uneventful until 1975. In October that year, he created controversy at a [[Brisbane]] Chamber of Commerce luncheon by criticising the &quot;fumbling ineptitude&quot; of Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]]'s Federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government for placing Australia in &quot;its present economic state&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Chiefs&quot;/&gt; Vice-regal appointees in Australia were expected to remain above politics, but Hannah declared that he would be &quot;guilty of sheltering behind convention, of denying my heritage and failing in my regard for the people of Queensland&quot; if he did not speak his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 16 October 1975| title = Queensland Governor backs move for election | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19751016&amp;id=Jv1jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3796,4659811 | journal = The Sydney Morning Herald | publisher=Google News| page = 1 | accessdate = 22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident occurred in the midst of a [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] and, according to military historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, was &quot;widely seen as a blatant intervention in the national political arena&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soldiers_politics_62&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Soldiers in Politics'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal government responded by advising the Queen to revoke Hannah's [[dormant commission]] to serve in place of the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] if required; at the time Hannah was the second in line to serve as Governor-General, after the [[Governor of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=Soldiers_politics_62 /&gt; Following his succession in November 1975, [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser attempted to have the dormant commission reinstated, but the British government refused to recommend this to the Queen, citing lack of impartiality on Hannah's part. Queensland Premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] made it known that he planned to extend the Governor's term, but the British government also refused to agree to this. Bjelke-Petersen was prepared to pursue the matter, but Hannah declined to let his name be put forward again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Chiefs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date = 10 February 2007 | title = The hidden hand of her majesty | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-hidden-hand-of-her-majesty/2007/02/09/1170524304007.html?page=fullpage | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate = 22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9&amp;nbsp;October 1976, Hannah dedicated a memorial at [[Cairns]] to commemorate the crews of RAAF [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina flying boats]] who lost their lives in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific during World War&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandell, ''Dicing With Death'', pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;  His vice-regal appointment lapsed on 20&amp;nbsp;March 1977, and he was succeeded the next month by Commodore [[James Ramsay (Australian governor)|Sir James Ramsay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Governors&quot;/&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Hannah retired following completion of his term as Governor of Queensland.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (KCVO) in August 1977 (backdated to March) as part of [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II's Silver Jubilee]] visit to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=47292|startpage=10154|date=5 August 1977|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 22&amp;nbsp;May 1978 at his home in [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]], Queensland. He was given a state funeral and cremated; his wife and daughter survived him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Hannah Community Park, straddling the suburbs of [[Fadden, Australian Capital Territory|Fadden]] and [[Gowrie, Australian Capital Territory|Gowrie]] in Canberra, was established in his honour in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 26 September 2002 | title = Legislative Assembly for the ACT: 2002 Week 11 | work= [[Hansard]] | publisher=ACT Legislative Assembly  |url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/Hansard/2002/week11/3326.htm | accessdate = 23 November 2008 | page=3326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
