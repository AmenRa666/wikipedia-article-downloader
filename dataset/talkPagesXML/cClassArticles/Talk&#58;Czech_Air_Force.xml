==Untitled==
I know there are big &quot;gaps&quot; in this page, but I do intend to fill them in before the end of April 2006.  -[[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] 17:11, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

:I did the last corrections (but not logged-in), next step is updating of the historical periods after WWII.&lt;br&gt;
Be aware that the official pages of Czech Air Force are outdated and e.g. its list of aircraft types is as it was few years ago(sic!). [[User:Balooo(cz)|Balooo(cz)]] 10:15, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

== The only country to help Israel - wrong ==

&quot;The Czech Republic was the only country to help Israel in its beginning.&quot;
The cited source does not state it. It is true, that Czechoslovakia supported Me-109 to Israel, but it is untrue, that it was the sole country supporting it. It is hard to imagine Prague going in such an activity without an order from Kremlin.

[[User:Balooo(cz)|Balooo(cz)]] ([[User talk:Balooo(cz)|talk]]) 15:22, 11 July 2011 (UTC) It was not Me-109 or Bf-109 but S-199, Czechoslovak made 109 body with He-111 engines which both were built in Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (Czech lands) during the WWII. Plus there was a supplement of Czechoslovak Spitfires purchased from UK shortly after the war. One of the reasons was that the new Communists goverment was forced to use Soviet aircraft and was motivated to sell the Western. Anyway, there should be only a note that the aircraft was sold if any

== Czech vs Czechoslovak AF ==

Should the Czech and Czechoslovak Air Forces not be on separate pages? Yes, the history of the Czech Air Force is the history of the Czechoslovak AF, but that is also the history of the Slovak AF. I would suggest that the Czech AF post-Velvet Revolution be put on a separate page - or put the Slovak AF on this page, too! [[User:2Q|2Q]] ([[User talk:2Q|talk]]) 17:51, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I agree to split the page on Czechoslovak Air Force 1918-1992 and move the historic content from [[Czech Air Force]] and [[Slovak Air Force]] to this new one. [[User:Balooo(cz)|Balooo(cz)]] ([[User talk:Balooo(cz)|talk]]) 09:55, 20 July 2011 (UTC)

:Concur that we need a separate page on the [[Czechoslovak Air Force]] to cover the years 1918-1992. I could do the split uising the info already in the articles, but I don't have any other info to draw from. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 06:43, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

:Done! - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 18:29, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

== Future ==

What happens after the Gripen lease ends? Does the CzAF join the increasing number of eastern european nations that have given up a fixed wing combat capability altogether? Or will there be a purchase of new fighters?&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.244.239.169|71.244.239.169]] ([[User talk:71.244.239.169|talk]]) 23:04, 8 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Updated with 2011 White Book of Czech Army information plus CZ Government (Foreign Affairs Dpt) resources. The future is however unclear, It seems that delaying the discussion leads to having only one option left - keep JAS-39.

== missing Yak-40 ==

[[User:Balooo(cz)|Balooo(cz)]] ([[User talk:Balooo(cz)|talk]]) 15:09, 11 July 2011 (UTC) Corrected. There are still Yak-40 and Yak-40K (k stands for convertible) in operation 1016 and 0260 on the Kbely AFB as of July 2011 flying over my head.

== Airbus ==

A minor point, I know, but Airbus is just German now?--[[Special:Contributions/172.163.121.212|172.163.121.212]] ([[User talk:172.163.121.212|talk]]) 03:31, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

== World Air Forces 2015 ==

This source is outdated and inaccurate despite the year of publication. Czech sources are more accurate. See [[cs:Vzdušné síly AČR]]. --[[User:CS92|CS92]] ([[User talk:CS92|talk]]) 08:44, 5 April 2015 (UTC)
:&quot;is outdated and inaccurate&quot;? Your going have to disapprove their [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliability]] as a source - cheers [[User:FOX 52|FOX 52]] ([[User talk:FOX 52|talk]]) 14:39, 5 April 2015 (UTC)
:: Yes, it is. For example, they include Mi-2s which were passed to Flight Training Center Pardubice in 2004 and 2005. On the other hand, one CL-601 Challenger is missing in their list and there are even more issues. So, I have added a link to the [[List of active Czech military aircraft]] and a table with two different figures inspired by the [[Israeli Air Force#Aircraft]].--[[User:CS92|CS92]] ([[User talk:CS92|talk]]) 11:56, 6 April 2015 (UTC)

== Iceland ==

Somebody experienced should expand &quot;Foreign deployments&quot; with a chapter about Icelandic air policing in which the air force took part in 2014. There is a part about it in the Czech version of this article.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.226.245.52|213.226.245.52]] ([[User talk:213.226.245.52|talk]]) 15:08, 31 July 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
