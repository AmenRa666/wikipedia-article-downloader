==Early life and education==
Kincheloe was born July 2, 1928, in [[Detroit, Michigan]] but grew up in [[Cassopolis, Michigan]]. He was the only child of Iven C. Kincheloe Sr. (1894–1966) and Frances Wilder Kincheloe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=2722 Kincheloe's parents],&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested in aircraft from a very young age. Following his high school graduation in 1945, he attended [[Purdue University]]. He joined the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]], was a member of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]-Indiana Alpha fraternity, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] in 1949. In the summer of 1948, the ROTC cadet was able to meet [[Chuck Yeager]] and sit in the cockpit of the [[Bell X-1]].

==Korean War==
After graduating in 1949, Kincheloe received his [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. After receiving his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|pilot wings]] in August 1950, he spent a year as a test pilot flying the [[F-86 Sabre|F-86E]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]] before being promoted to [[first lieutenant]] and transferred to [[Korea]] in September 1951. During the war, he flew [[P-80 Shooting Star|F-80s]] on 30 [[Aerial warfare|combat missions]] and [[F-86 Sabre|F-86s]] on 101 combat missions, downing five [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15s]] (becoming an [[Flying ace|ace]] and earning the [[Silver Star]]) before returning to the U.S. in May 1952. At this time, he had reached the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].

==Post-war career==
After the war, first he worked as a gunnery instructor at the [[Nellis Air Force Base]], [[Nevada]]. Then, he again became a test pilot, graduating in December 1954 from the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]] at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough, England]]. He participated in the testing of the [[Century Series]] of [[fighter aircraft]] ([[F-100 Super Sabre]], [[F-101 Voodoo]], [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], [[F-104 Starfighter]], [[F-105 Thunderchief]], and [[F-106 Delta Dart]]). In the mid-1950s, Kincheloe joined the [[Bell X-2]] program and on September 7, 1956,&lt;ref name=&quot;Twga&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Michael J.H. |coauthors=Christopher Chant (other chapters) |title=The world's greatest aircraft |year=1999 |publisher=Regency House Publishing Ltd. |location=Hertfordshire |isbn=1-85605-523-X |chapter=The chronology of flight 1940 to &amp;#91;1999-03-25&amp;#93; |quote=The Bell X-2 research aircraft is flown by Capt. Iven C. Kincheloe to an altitude of 126,200 ft (38,466m). |page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; flew at more than {{convert|2000|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and to a height of {{convert|126200|ft|m}}&lt;ref name=&quot;wpafb.m&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Twga&quot; /&gt; (some sources list 126,500&lt;ref name=&quot;afbio&quot; /&gt;), the first flight ever above 100,000 feet. For this he was nicknamed &quot;America's No. 1 Spaceman&quot;. The [[Bell X-2|X-2]] program was halted just three weeks later after a fatal crash resulted in the death of [[Mel Apt]] in a flight in which Apt became the first person to exceed Mach 3. Three years later, Kincheloe was selected as one of the first three pilots in the next rocket-powered aircraft program, the [[North American X-15|X-15]], and would have been part of the [[Man In Space Soonest]] project.

He was killed in the crash of an [[F-104 Starfighter|F-104]]A at [[Edwards Air Force Base|Edwards AFB]], and was buried with full military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=pres7276&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dgIqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iCYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7467%2C4383188 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Eisenhower asks favor of the 1972-'76 president |agency=Associated Press |date=November 18, 1958 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was only 30 years old and was survived by wife, Dorothy, their young son, Iven, III, and a daughter who would be born two months later, Jeannine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalaviation.org/kincheloe-jr-iven-carl/ Kincheloe's family],&lt;/ref&gt;
