==History==
[[File:Samurai with tachi.png|thumb|Japanese [[Edo period]] wood block print of a samurai with a ''[[tachi]]''.]]
The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:

* Jōkotō (ancient swords, until around 900 A.D.)
* Kotō (old swords from around 900–1596)
* Shintō (new swords 1596–1780)
* Shinshintō (newer swords 1781–1876)
* Gendaitō (modern swords 1876–1945)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive Sinclaire |title=Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ3FAZG94ZsC&amp;pg=PA40|date=1 November 2004 |publisher=Lyons Press |isbn=978-1-59228-720-8 |pages=40–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shinsakutō (newly made swords 1953–present)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=トム岸田 |title=靖国刀 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z6oB6eFRjZkC&amp;pg=PA42|date=24 September 2004 |publisher=Kodansha International |isbn=978-4-7700-2754-2 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of &quot;katana&quot; (gatana) as a word to describe a long sword that was different from a [[tachi]] occurs as early as the Kamakura Period (1185–1333).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato&quot;/&gt; These references to &quot;''[[uchigatana]]''&quot; and &quot;''tsubagatana''&quot; seem to indicate a different style of sword, possibly a less costly sword for lower-ranking warriors. The evolution of the tachi into the katana seems to have started during the early [[Muromachi period]] (1337 to 1573). Starting around the year 1400, long swords signed with the &quot;katana&quot; signature were made. This was in response to samurai wearing their tachi in what is now called &quot;katana style&quot; (cutting edge up). Japanese swords are traditionally worn with the signature facing away from the wearer. When a tachi was worn in the style of a katana, with the cutting edge up, the tachi's signature would be facing the wrong way. The fact that swordsmiths started signing swords with a katana signature shows that some samurai of that time period had started wearing their swords in a different manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull |title=Katana: The Samurai Sword |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFTe6JUEkQC&amp;pg=PA22|date=8 February 2011 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-84908-658-5 |pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kōkan Nagayama |title=The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPyswmGDBFkC&amp;pg=PA28|year=1997 |publisher=Kodansha International |isbn=978-4-7700-2071-0 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in popularity of katana amongst samurai came about due to the changing nature of close-combat warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on fast response times. The katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (obi) with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved tachi had been worn with the edge of the blade facing down and suspended from a belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapp 1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leon Kapp |author2=Hiroko Kapp |author3=Yoshindo Yoshihara | title = The Craft of the Japanese Sword| publisher = Kodansha International| year = 1987| location = Japan| page = 167| isbn = 978-0-87011-798-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of the katana blade varied considerably during the course of its history. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries, katana blades tended to have lengths between 70 and 73&amp;nbsp;cm (27½ and 28½ in). During the early 16th century, the average length approached closer to 60&amp;nbsp;cm (23½&amp;nbsp;in). By the late 16th century, the average length returned to approximately 73&amp;nbsp;cm (28½&amp;nbsp;in).

The katana was often paired with a similar smaller companion sword, such as a ''[[wakizashi]]'' or it could also be worn with the ''[[tantō]]'', a smaller, similarly shaped dagger.  The pairing of a katana with a smaller sword is called the ''[[daishō]]''.  Only samurai could wear the daisho: it represented the social power and personal [[honor]] of the [[samurai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapp 1987&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WBAR&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern katana (''gendaitō'')==
During the [[Meiji period]], the [[samurai]] class was gradually disbanded, and the special privileges granted to them were taken away including the right to carry swords in public. The [[Haitōrei Edict]] in 1876 forbade the carrying of swords in public except for certain individuals, such as former samurai lords ([[daimyo]]), the military, and police.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kōkan Nagayama|title=The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPyswmGDBFkC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1997|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-2071-0 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled swordsmiths had trouble making a living during this period as Japan modernized its military, and many swordsmiths started making other items, such as farm equipment, tools, and cutlery. Military action by Japan in China and Russia during the Meiji period helped revive interest in swords, but it was not until the [[Shōwa period]] that swords were produced on a large scale again.&lt;ref name=&quot;IQ3FAZG94ZsC 2004, P.58-59&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive Sinclaire|title=Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ3FAZG94ZsC&amp;pg=PA58|date=1 November 2004|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-1-59228-720-8|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese military swords produced between 1875 and 1945 are referred to as ''[[guntō]]'' (military swords).&lt;ref name=&quot;Yumoto2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Yumoto|title=The Samurai Sword: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|date=13 December 2013|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1-4629-0706-9|pages=6, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the pre-[[World War II]] military buildup and throughout the war, all Japanese officers were required to wear a sword. Traditionally made swords were produced during this period, but in order to supply such large numbers of swords, blacksmiths with little or no knowledge of traditional Japanese sword manufacture were recruited. In addition, supplies of the Japanese steel ([[tamahagane]]) used for swordmaking were limited, so several other types of steel were also used. Quicker methods of forging were also used, such as the use of power-hammers, and quenching the blade in oil, rather than hand forging and water quenching. The non-traditionally made swords from this period are called ''shōwatō'', after the [[regnal name]] of the Emperor [[Hirohito]], and in 1937, the Japanese government started requiring the use of special stamps on the tang (nakago) to distinguish these swords from traditionally made swords. During this period of war, older antique swords were remounted for use in military mounts. Presently, in Japan, showato are not considered to be &quot;true&quot; Japanese swords, and they can be confiscated. Outside Japan, however, they are collected as historical artifacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IQ3FAZG94ZsC 2004, P.58-59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leon Kapp|author2=Hiroko Kapp |author3=Yoshindo Yoshihara|title=Modern Japanese Swords and Swordsmiths: From 1868 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7YeN0F5tn4C|date=January 2002|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-1962-2|pages=58–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-World War II==
[[File:Sayuri Iaido.JPG|thumb|Japanese girl practicing [[iaido]] with a modern training katana or [[iaitō]].  This sword was custom made in Japan according to the weight and size of the student. The blade is made of aluminum alloy and it lacks a sharp edge for the student's safety.]]

In Japan, from 1945 to 1953, sword manufacture and sword-related martial arts were banned. Many swords were confiscated and destroyed, and swordsmiths were not able to make a living. Since 1953, Japanese swordsmiths have been allowed to work, but with severe restrictions: swordsmiths must be licensed and serve a five-year apprenticeship, and only licensed swordsmiths are allowed to produce Japanese swords (nihonto), only two longswords per month are allowed to be produced by each swordsmith, and all swords must be registered with the Japanese Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive Sinclaire|title=Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ3FAZG94ZsC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 November 2004|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-1-59228-720-8|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Japan, some of the modern katanas being produced by western swordsmiths use modern steel alloys, such as [[Tool steel|L6 and A2]]. These modern swords replicate the size and shape of the Japanese katana, and are used by martial artists for [[Iaido]] and even for cutting practice, called ([[tameshigiri]]). The use of modern steel and technology can create strong blades without the risk of damaging or destroying the artisan's hard work.

Mass-produced swords including [[iaitō]] and [[shinken]] in the shape of katana are available from many countries, though China dominates the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shackleford2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Shackleford|title=Spirit Of The Sword: A Celebration of Artistry and Craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkLaMKl09L8C&amp;pg=PT423|date=7 September 2010|publisher=Adams Media|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1638-X|page=23|chapter=Sword Capitol of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of swords are typically mass-produced and made with a wide variety of steels and methods.

== Description ==
[[File:Daisho katana and wakizashi 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Antique Japanese (samurai) ''[[daishō]]'', the traditional pairing of two Japanese swords which were the symbol of the samurai, showing the traditional Japanese sword cases (''[[koshirae]]'') and the difference in size between the ''katana'' (top) and the smaller ''[[wakizashi]]'' (bottom).]]
The ''katana'' is generally defined as the standard sized, moderately curved (as opposed to the older &quot;[[tachi]]&quot; style featuring more curvature) Japanese [[sword]] with a blade length greater than 60&amp;nbsp;cm ({{frac|23|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Kanzan Sato| title = The Japanese Sword: A Comprehensive Guide (Japanese arts Library)| publisher = Kodansha International| year = 1983| location = Japan| page = 220| isbn =978-0-87011-562-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single-edged blade with a circular or squared guard (tsuba) and long grip to accommodate two hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato&quot;/&gt; It has historically been associated with the [[samurai]] of [[feudal Japan]].

With a few exceptions, ''katana'' and [[tachi]] can be distinguished from each other, if signed, by the location of the signature [[Commons:Category:Mei|(''mei'')]] on the tang [[Commons:Category:Nakago|(''nakago'')]]. In general, the ''mei'' should be carved into the side of the tang  which would face outward when the sword was worn. Since a ''tachi'' was worn with the cutting edge down, and the ''katana'' was worn with the cutting edge up, the ''mei'' would be in opposite locations on the tang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=土子民夫 |title=日本刀21世紀への挑戦 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWy3gx-0PR8C&amp;pg=PA30|date=May 2002 |publisher=Kodansha International |isbn=978-4-7700-2854-9 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western historians have said that katana were among the finest cutting weapons in world military history.&lt;ref name=Turnbull2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephen Turnbull |title=Katana: The Samurai Sword |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFTe6JUEkQC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |year=2012 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=9781849086585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ford2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Roger Ford |title=Weapon: A Visual History of Arms and Armor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WdYAAAAYAAJ |pages=66, 120 |year=2006 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn= 9780756622107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J.

== Etymology and loanwords ==
&quot;Katana&quot; is the term now used to describe ''[[nihontō]]'' that are 2 shaku (606&amp;nbsp;mm / 23.9&amp;nbsp;in) and longer, also known as &quot;dai&quot; or &quot;[[Daitō (long sword)|daitō]]&quot; among Western sword enthusiasts although daito is a generic name for any long sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sun-Jin Kim |title=Tuttle Dictionary Martial Arts Korea, China &amp; Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpPrkaGF-9sC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1996 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=978-0-8048-2016-5 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Japanese language|Japanese]] does not have separate plural and singular forms, both &quot;katanas&quot; and &quot;katana&quot; are considered acceptable forms in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linguistics&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A.

Pronounced {{IPA-ja|katana|}}, the ''[[kun'yomi]]'' (Japanese reading) of the [[kanji]] 刀, originally meaning [[dao (sword)|dao]] or knife/saber in Chinese, the word has been adopted as a [[loanword]] by the [[Portuguese language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vocab&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado |author2=Anthony X.

==Forging and construction==
{{Main|Japanese swordsmithing}}
[[File:Katana brique.png|thumb|Cross sections of Japanese sword blade lamination methods]]
Katanas are traditionally made from a specialized Japanese steel called ''[[tamahagane]]'',&lt;ref name = &quot;鉄の本&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=鉄と生活研究会|title=トコトンやさしい鉄の本|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykkROwAACAAJ|year= 2008|publisher=日刊工業新聞社|isbn=978-4-526-06012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is created from a traditional smelting process that results in several, layered steels with different carbon concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/samurai/swor-nf.html Secrets of the Samurai Sword]. Pbs.org. Retrieved 2013-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; This process helps remove impurities and even out the carbon content of the steel. The age of the steel plays a role in the ability to remove impurities, with older steel, having a higher oxygen concentration, being more easily stretched and rid of impurities during hammering, resulting in a stronger blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Step 1: Types of Katana Swords |url=http://katanaswordreviews.com/types-of-katana-swords/ |website=Katana Sword Reviews |access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smith begins by folding and welding pieces of high and low carbon steel several times to work out most of the impurities. The resulting block of steel is then drawn out to form a billet.

At this stage, it is only slightly curved or may have no curve at all. The gentle curvature of a katana is attained by a process of [[Differential hardening|differential hardening or differential quenching]]: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (some sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapp 1987&quot;/&gt; When steel with a carbon content of 0.7 percent is heated beyond 750&amp;nbsp;°C, it enters the [[austenite]] phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into [[martensite]], which is a very hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and [[pearlite]] which is softer than martensite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Cohen |title=By the Sword: A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=inND87EFFF4C&amp;pg=PA124|date=18 December 2007 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-43074-8 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Drewe |title=Tàijí Jiàn 32-Posture Sword Form |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6UdWcIx95YC&amp;pg=PT10|date=15 February 2009 |publisher=Singing Dragon |isbn=978-1-84642-869-2 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process also creates the distinct line down the sides of the blade called the [[Hamon (swordsmithing)|hamon]], which is made distinct by polishing. Each hamon and each smith's style of hamon is distinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapp 1987&quot;/&gt;

After the blade is forged, it is then sent to be polished. The polishing takes between one and three weeks. The polisher uses finer and finer grains of polishing stones in a process called glazing, until the blade has a mirror finish. However, the blunt edge of the katana is often given a matte finish to emphasize the hamon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapp 1987&quot;/&gt;

==Usage in martial arts==
Katana were used by samurai in practicing several martial arts and modern martial artists still use a variety of katana. Martial arts in which training with katana is used include [[Iaijutsu]], [[battōjutsu]], [[iaidō]], [[kenjutsu]], [[kendo]], [[aikido]], [[ninjutsu]], and [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mason1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mason Smith|title=Stand and Deliver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|date=December 1997|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|journal=Black Belt|volume=35|issue=12|page=66|issn=0277-3066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PriestYoung2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|author2=Damon Young|title=Martial Arts and Philosophy: Beating and Nothingness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_LZby0xOhQC&amp;pg=PT209|date=21 August 2013|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9723-0|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GreenSvinth2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas A.

== Storage and maintenance ==
If mishandled in its storage or maintenance, the katana may become irreparably damaged. The blade should be stored horizontally in its sheath, curve down and edge facing upward to maintain the edge. It is extremely important that the blade remain well-oiled, powdered and polished, as the natural moisture residue from the hands of the user will rapidly cause the blade to rust if not cleaned off. The traditional oil used is choji oil (99% mineral oil and 1% clove oil for fragrance).  Similarly, when stored for longer periods, it is important that the katana be inspected frequently and aired out if necessary in order to prevent rust or [[mold]] from forming (mold may feed off the salts in the oil used to polish the katana).&lt;ref name=&quot;Draeger-swordsmanship&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gordon Warner |author2=Donn F.

== Ownership and trade restrictions ==

===Republic of Ireland===
Under the [[Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990]] (Offensive Weapons) (Amendment) Order 2009, katanas made post-1953 are illegal unless made by hand according to traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0338.html |title=S.I. No. 338/2009 — Firearms and offensive Weapons Act 1990 (offensive Weapons) (Amendment) Order 2009|date=2009-08-28|publisher=Irish Statute Book, Government of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
As of April 2008, the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] added swords with a curved blade of 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20&amp;nbsp;in) or over in length (&quot;the length of the blade shall be the straight line distance from the top of the handle to the tip of the blade&quot;) to the Offensive Weapons Order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ban&quot;&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110810324_en_1 The Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons)(Amendment) Order 2008]. Opsi.gov.uk (2010-11-19). Retrieved 2013-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  This ban was a response to reports that samurai swords were used in more than 80 attacks and 4 killings over the preceding four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7139724.stm |title=Ban on imitation Samurai swords |date=2007-12-12 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2011-12-29 |quote=Calls for a ban came after a number of high-profile incidents in which cheap Samurai-style swords had been used as a weapon. The Home Office estimates there have been some 80 attacks in recent years involving Samurai-style blades, leading to at least five deaths.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who violate the ban would be jailed up to six months and charged a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] of [[Pound sterling|£]]5,000. [[Martial arts]] practitioners, [[historical re-enactors]] and others may still own such swords. The sword can also be legal provided it was made in Japan before 1954, or was made using traditional sword making methods. It is also legal to buy if it can be classed as a &quot;martial artist's weapon&quot;. This ban applies to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This ban was amended in August 2008 to allow sale and ownership without licence of 'traditional' hand-forged katana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Government legislation&quot;&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/em/ukdsiem_9780110817774_en.pdf EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 1988 (OFFENSIVE WEAPONS) (AMENDMENT No. 2): ORDER 2008]. opsi.gov.uk.
