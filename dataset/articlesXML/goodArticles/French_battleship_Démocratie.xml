'''''Démocratie''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] of the [[Liberté-class battleship|''Liberté'' class]] built by the [[French Navy]]. She had three [[sister ship]]s: [[French battleship Liberté|''Liberté'']], [[French battleship Justice|''Justice'']], and [[French battleship Vérité|''Vérité'']]. ''Démocratie'' was laid down in May 1903, launched in April 1904, and completed in January 1908, over a year after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} made ships like ''Démocratie'' obsolete. She was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns, compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on ''Dreadnought''.

Despite her out-dated design, ''Démocratie'' served with the French Mediterranean Fleet throughout her career, including during [[World War I]]. She participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]] in late August 1914, and spent the majority of the war based on the coast of Greece, in [[Corfu]] and [[Mudros]], to keep the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman navies bottled up in port, though she saw no further action. After the end of the war, she went into the [[Black Sea]] to assist in the enforcement of the terms of the [[Armistice with Germany]]. ''Démocratie'' was stricken in 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

''Démocratie'' was laid down at the [[Arsenal de Brest]] shipyard on 1 May 1903, launched on 30 April 1904, and completed in January 1908,&lt;ref name=G297&gt;Gardiner, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; over a year after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, which rendered the [[pre-dreadnought]]s like ''Démocratie'' outdated before they were completed.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was {{convert|133.81|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.26|m|abbr=on|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.41|m|abbr=on|ftin}}. She displaced up to {{convert|14489|MT|sp=us}} at full load. ''Démocratie'' had a crew of between 739 and 769 officers and enlisted men. The ship's propulsion system consisted of three vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s with twenty-two [[Belleville boiler]]s. They were rated at {{convert|18500|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|1800|MT|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

''Démocratie''{{'}}s main battery consisted of four [[Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of ten [[Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1902]] guns; six were mounted in single turrets, and four in [[casemate]]s in the hull. She also carried thirteen 9-pounder guns and ten 3-pounders, and had two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. The ship's [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;

== Service history ==
In August 1910, the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean fleet conducted a gunnery practice using the old [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[French ironclad Fulminant|''Fulminant'']] as a target; ''Démocratie'' scored 22.7&amp;nbsp;percent hits, the second best performance in the squadron and surpassed only by her sister [[French battleship Justice|''Justice'']].&lt;ref&gt;Alger, p. 1177&lt;/ref&gt; During a fleet exercise on 28 May 1914, ''Démocratie'' collided with the  battleship {{ship|French battleship|Suffren||2}} when the latter vessel lost power. ''Suffren'' was only lightly damaged, with her port anchor and [[hawsepipe]] carried away.&lt;ref&gt;Caresse, pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battleship Democracie Bougault.jpg|thumb|Colorized photo of ''Démocratie'']]
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Démocratie'' was assigned to the 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron in the [[Mediterranean]], along with ''Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The French fleet was initially used to cover the movement of French troops—the [[19th Army Corps (France)|XIX Corps]]—from Algeria to metropolitan France. As a result, the fleet was far out of position to catch the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}}.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (1995), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority of the war, the French used their main fleet to keep the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian fleet]] bottled up in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In 1914 she participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]], where the [[Line of battle|battle line]] caught the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Zenta}} by surprise and sank her. The French battleships then bombarded Austrian fortifications at [[Kotor|Cattaro]] in an attempt to draw out the Austro-Hungarian fleet, which refused to take the bait.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2004), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The French operations in the area were hampered by a lack of a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to [[Malta]], but that was hundreds of miles away. The Austrians also possessed several [[submarine]]s, [[SM U-12 (Austria-Hungary)|one of which]] torpedoed the [[dreadnought]] [[French battleship Jean Bart (1911)|''Jean Bart'']] in December 1914. This threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2004), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on [[Corfu]] as their primary naval base in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2004), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, ''Démocratie'' was sent to [[Mudros]] along with her sister ships to reinforce the blockade of the [[Dardanelles]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the end of the war, ''Démocratie'', ''Justice'', and a [[destroyer]] joined an Allied fleet (including the British [[dreadnought]]s {{HMS|Superb|1907|6}} and {{HMS|Temeraire|1907|2}} and the Italian battleship [[Italian battleship Roma (1907)|''Roma'']]) that was sent to the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Sevastopol]]. They oversaw the enforcement of the terms of the [[Armistice with Germany]]; the Germans had previously seized Russian naval units and stationed occupation forces there under the terms of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2011), pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; The French contingent provided crews for a pair of Russian destroyers and two German [[U-boat]]s, and the other Allied ships similarly activated Russian and German vessels to secure the area.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern (2011), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Démocratie'' ultimately was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1921 and sold to ship-breakers.&lt;ref name=G297/&gt;
