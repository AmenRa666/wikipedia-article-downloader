After 20 months he made peace with [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofberg (1906), pp. 176-177&quot;/&gt; In 1808 he took command of a squadron, which had the task of protecting the Swedish coast against a feared French-Danish landing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linder (1880), pp. 130-131&quot;/&gt; Also in 1808, [[Russian occupation of Gotland 1808|Russia occupied the island of Gotland]] and a Swedish relief expedition under the command of Cederström was dispatched from Karlskrona to repel the Russians invadors from the island, which was executed within three days. The Russian occupation accelerated, however, the establishment of the [[Gotland National Conscription]] and Cederström was commissioned as vice governor of the island to implement this arming of the people and to set the island in a state of defense against a feared attack by the English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofberg (1906), pp. 176-177&quot;/&gt;
