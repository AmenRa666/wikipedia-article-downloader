'''Elliot McKay See Jr.''' (July 23, 1927{{spaced ndash}} February 28, 1966) was an [[United States|American]] [[engineer]], [[United States naval aviator|naval aviator]], [[test pilot]], and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]], selected in the [[Astronaut Group 2|second group of astronauts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/see-em.html|title=Astronaut Bio:  Elliot M.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
See was born in [[Dallas, Texas]] on July 23, 1927, and attended [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]], from which he graduated in 1945. See was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and earned the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/FILESTORE/pdf/02-558.pdf|title=Astronauts and the BSA|access-date=June 25, 2016|website=Boy Scouts of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After initially attending [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]] where he was a member of [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity. He then attended the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1949. He later obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Engineering]] from [[UCLA]] in 1962.

He was married to Marilyn Denahy See, and had three children: Sally, born in 1956; Carolyn, born in 1957; and David, born in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMF&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautsmemorial.org/elliot-m-see-jr-honored.html |title=Elliot M.

He worked for [[GE Aviation|General Electric]] before and after serving as a [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] from 1953 to 1956. He served as a project pilot for the J79-8 engine development program used in the [[F4H]] aircraft. See conducted [[Aircraft engine|powerplant]] flight tests on the [[General Electric J47|J-47]], [[General Electric J73|J-73]], [[J-79]], [[General Electric CJ805|CJ805]], and CJ805 [[turbofan|aft-fan]] engines. This work involved flying in [[F-86]], [[Douglas F4D Skyray|XF4D]], [[F-104]], [[Grumman F11F-1F Super Tiger|F11F-1F]], [[RB-66]], F4H, and [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA Bio&quot; /&gt;

He has logged more than 3,900 hours flying time, including more than 3,300 hours in [[jet aircraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA Bio&quot; /&gt;

In 1962, See was selected to be one of the new nine NASA astronauts. He served as backup pilot for [[Gemini 5]] and was a [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] in [[Houston]] during the [[Gemini 7]]/[[Gemini 6A|6A]] [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] mission in December 1965. He was in line to fly as prime crew Pilot (second seat) for [[Gemini 8]], but was promoted to be the Command Pilot (first seat) of [[Gemini 9]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA Bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deke 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Deke!

Slayton further stated that he assigned See to Gemini 9 because he had become &quot;sentimental&quot; about getting him a flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deke 1&quot; /&gt;{{rp|167,168}}

===Death===
{{main|1966 NASA T-38 crash}}
[[File:The Original Gemini 9 Prime Crew - GPN-2000-001352.jpg|thumb|left|Elliot See and [[Charles Bassett]]]]
See and fellow astronaut [[Charles Bassett]], assigned as Pilot for [[Gemini 9]], were killed before their mission on February 28, 1966, when their [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] trainer jet crashed into [[McDonnell Aircraft]] Building 101, known as the McDonnell Space Center, located 1,000 feet (300 m) from [[Lambert Field]] airport in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  Building 101 was where the Gemini spacecraft was built, and they were going there to do [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] training for two weeks in a simulator, along with their backup crew. See and Bassett died within 500 feet (150 m) of their spacecraft. Both were buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;arlington&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/cabasset.htm|title=Charles Arthur Bassett II |access-date=October 9, 2016|website=Arlington National Cemetery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;losingtm&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=W. Pate |last=McMichael |work=[[St. Louis Magazine]] |location=[[St. Louis, MO]] |title=Losing The Moon |url=http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/May-2006/Losing-The-Moon/ |date=May 2006 |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[NASA]] investigative panel later concluded that [[pilot error]] caused by poor visibility due to bad weather had been the principal cause of the accident. The panel concluded that See was flying too low to the ground during his second approach, probably as a result of the poor visibility. Slayton would later express doubts about See's flying ability, claiming that See flew too slowly and &quot;wasn't aggressive enough.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deke 1&quot;/&gt;

The mission was launched three months later, in early June, as [[Gemini 9A]]. The shuffling of the Gemini prime and backup crew assignments that occurred after the deaths of See and Bassett impacted the crew selections for some of the early Apollo manned missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deke 1&quot;/&gt;

==Organizations==
See was a member of the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]], and an associate [[fellow]] of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA Bio&quot; /&gt;
