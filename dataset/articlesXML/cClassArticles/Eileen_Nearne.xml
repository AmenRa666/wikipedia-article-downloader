'''Eileen Mary &quot;Didi&quot; Nearne''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], [[Croix de Guerre]] (15 March 1921&lt;ref name=Times&gt;Obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' 15 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian |title=Eileen Nearne's war heroism revealed in National Archives|date=29 October 2010|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/29/eileen-nearne-war-heroism-national-archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 2 September 2010 (date body found))&lt;!-- impossible to determine exactly when she died as &quot;her body is thought to have remained undiscovered for some time&quot; (body found on 2 September 2010) --&gt; was a member of the [[UK]]'s [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/31/a2659331.shtml &quot;People's War&quot;, BBC]. Retrieved 10 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She served in [[Vichy France|occupied France]] as a radio operator under the codename &quot;Rose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=[[John Fisher Burns]]|title=Eileen Nearne, wartime spy, dies at 89|date=21 September 2010|work=[[New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/world/europe/22nearne.html|accessdate=2010-09-22|quote=After she died earlier this month, a frail 89-year-old alone in a flat in the British seaside town of Torquay, Eileen Nearne, her body undiscovered for several days, was listed by local officials as a candidate for what is known in Britain as a council burial, or what in the past was called a pauper's grave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[French Resistance]] operative [[Andree Peel]] is also known as ''Agent Rose''.)

==Early life and career==
Born in 1921 in [[London]] to an English father, John Nearne, and Spanish mother, Marie de Plazoala, she was the youngest of four children. Her elder sister, [[Jacqueline Nearne]], and one of her two brothers, Francis, would also become [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] operatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;joint1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9135000/9135198.stm|work=BBC News|first=Laura|last=Joint|title=Eileen Nearne not &quot;suitable&quot; spy|date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the family moved to [[France]], where Nearne became fluent in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/8009812/Eileen-Nearne.html |title=Eileen Nearne |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two young women made their way to London via Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, Gibraltar and Glasgow, while the rest of the family remained in [[Grenoble]], despite the German invasion of the country. On her arrival in England she was offered service in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]] working on [[barrage balloons]], but turned this down and was recruited by the SOE. Initially Nearne worked as a home-based signals operator, receiving messages from agents in the field. Her sister Jacqueline was sent to France to work as a courier.  The sisters were supposed to keep their roles secret from one another, but were unsuccessful.

She was flown by a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] aircraft to a field near Les Lagnys, [[Saint-Valentin]] in [[Indre]], France, in the late hours of 2 March and the early hours of 3 March 1944 with [[Jean Savy]] to work as a wireless operator for the Wizard network as part of [[Jean Savy#Operation Mitchel|Operation Mitchel]]. Her cover story was that she was ''Mademoiselle du Tort'' (also using the aliases ''Jacqueline Duterte'' and ''Alice Wood'').&lt;ref name=&quot;joint1&quot;/&gt; Using the code name &quot;Rose&quot;, she was given the mission of helping Savy set up a network in Paris called &quot;Wizard&quot;; its aim, unlike the networks dedicated to sabotage, was to organise sources of finance for the Resistance. Nearne's role was to maintain a wireless link to London, and in the course of the next five months she transmitted 105 messages.

Savy had returned to London with important information about German V1 rockets, leaving Nearne on her own. Although she did not know it at the time, the same aircraft which took Savy home also carried her sister, Jacqueline, who had just completed 15 months in the field. Nearne then worked for the &quot;Spiritualist&quot; network.
 
In July 1944 her transmitter was detected and she was arrested. Nearne &quot;survived, in silence, the full revolting treatment of the [[Water torture|baignoire]]&quot; in the torture chamber of the [[Paris]] headquarters of the [[Gestapo]] on the Rue des Saussaies.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCDevon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-11297230|title=War heroine found dead in Devon to have council funeral |publisher=BBC News |date=14 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She reportedly managed to convince her captors, under torture, that she had been sending messages for a businessman, unaware that he was British. On 15 August 1944, she was sent to [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] where she refused to do prison work. Her head was shaved and she was told she would be shot if she continued to refuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Files&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9019000/9019821.stm|title=Files reveal bravery of WWII spy Eileen Nearne|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=21 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-21|first=Laura|last=Joint}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then transferred to a forced labour camp in [[Silesia]]. While in one of these prisons she was reportedly tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secrets of British spy 'Agent Rose' revealed in death|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/23/secrets-of-british-spy-agent-rose-revealed-in-death|publisher=CNN|date=23 September 2010|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/8009812/Eileen-Nearne.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Eileen Nearne|date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 1945 she escaped with two French girls from a work gang by hiding in the forest, later travelling through [[Markkleeberg]], where they were arrested by [[Schutzstaffel|the S.S.]] but released after fooling their captors and reportedly hidden by a priest in [[Leipzig]] until the arrival of United States troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCDevon&quot;/&gt;

==Awards and honours==
After World War II, she was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]] by the French government.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Terri|last=Judd|title=Eileen Nearne: The 'scatterbrained' spy who helped win the war|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/eileen-nearne-the-scatterbrained-spy-who-helped-win-the-war-2119533.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-30|quote=She was later awarded the French Croix de Guerre and the MBE for her “cool efficiency, perseverance and willingness to undergo any risk”.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 February 1946 she was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) by  [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] for ''services in France during the enemy occupation''.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette37473&quot;/&gt;

==Later years and death==
After the war Nearne lived in London with her sister, Jacqueline, where, ''The New York Times'' reported, she suffered from &quot;psychological problems brought on by her wartime service&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; After her sister's death in 1982, she moved to [[Torquay]] and lived there quietly until her death. She died alone from a heart attack in her seaside flat. Her body is thought to have remained undiscovered for some time until found on 2 September 2010. She was 89 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven Morris|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/sep/13/wartime-spy-eileen-nearne-dies|title=Lonely death of a wartime heroine|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-21|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearne talked about her wartime activities on a ''[[Timewatch]]'' television documentary in 1997, but she wore a wig, and spoke in French under her codename &quot;Rose&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reluctant heroine|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9136000/9136107.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her wartime activities were not generally known about. It was only when her flat was being searched by council workers to try to establish her next-of-kin that medals and other papers related to her war career were found.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-11379629|title=Funeral of WWII spy Eileen Nearne takes place in Devon|publisher=BBC News |date=21 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her next of kin, a niece, was located living in Italy and has said she was upset that Nearne had been portrayed as being &quot;alone or unloved&quot;, adding, &quot;Although I don't live in the UK, I was very close to Aunt Eileen and visited her often. I only saw her six months ago. She was always cherished by the family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven |last=Morris|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/14/wartime-spy-eileen-nearne|title=The spy who we loved: Eileen Nearne was cherished says niece |publisher=The Guardian|date=14 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-21|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearne's funeral, which was provided free of charge by the Torbay &amp; District Funeral Service of Torquay, was held on 21 September 2010 at Our Lady Help of Christians and St Denis Roman Catholic Church, Torquay.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The [[eulogy]] was made by Adrian Stones, Chairman of the [[Special Forces Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfclub.org/eileennearne.htm Eileen Nearne]; Special Forces Club&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was cremated, and her ashes scattered at sea, according to her wishes. 
Nearne died intestate and her estate of around £13,000 went to her niece in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]], according to BBC One's program ''[[Heir Hunters]]''; series 6, episode 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01gkkzg ''Heir Hunters''; series 6, episode 1: Cornish/Nearne]&lt;/ref&gt;
