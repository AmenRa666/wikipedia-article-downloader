The '''Battle of Byczyna''' or '''Battle of Pitschen''' ({{lang-de|Pitschen}}; {{lang-pl|Byczyna}}) was the deciding battle of the 1587–1588 [[War of the Polish Succession (1587–1588)|War of the Polish Succession]], which erupted after two rival candidates were elected to the [[Polish throne]]. Both sides had rough parity in forces, with armies about 6,000 strong, divided roughly into half infantry and half cavalry. The battle was an overwhelming victory of the Polish-Swedish faction, led by the Swedish-born king-elect [[Sigismund III Vasa]], over the army of his rival to the throne, [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria]]. Taking place near the Silesian town of Pitschen (modern [[Byczyna]]), then just a few kilometres outside the territory of Poland-Lithuania, on 24 January 1588, Sigismund's supporters were commanded by [[kanclerz|Chancellor]] and [[Great Crown Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]]. Besides the commanders, notable participants included [[Stanisław Stadnicki]] on the Maximilian's side, and [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]] on Sigismund's. The army of the Polish-Austrian (or [[Habsburg]]) faction was largely annihilated, the Archduke was captured and his cause came to an abrupt end. He subsequently renounced his claim to the Polish throne.

==Background==
In 1586, following the death of previous [[Polish king]], [[Stefan Batory]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]] duke [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria]] took part in the [[Royal elections in Poland|election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt; Each of the two candidates had supporters in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund [[kanclerz|Chancellor]] and [[Great Crown Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]] and the [[Primate of Poland]], [[Stanisław Karnkowski]] on one side and the pro-Maximilain [[Zborowski family]] on the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt; The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past and tensions during the elections ran high.&lt;ref name=&quot;les&quot;/&gt;

Sigismund, supported by Zamoyski and the former king's wife, [[Anna Jagiellon]], was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the ''[[Interrex (Poland)|interrex]]'', the Primate Karnkowski.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt; The election was disputed, however, by Maximilian and opponents of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later on 22 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone2001&quot;/&gt; The Zborowski family called for the [[rokosz]] (legitimate right to rebel) and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; For both Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, losing was not an option, as they knew the losing side would likely pay a severe price, from confiscations and a loss of prestige to a possible death sentence for treason.&lt;ref name=les/&gt;

Neither Sigismund nor Maximilian were present in the Commonwealth at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt; After receiving news of the election, both Sigismund and Maximilan made haste for Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt; Sigismund arrived at [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk) on 28 September and, after approximately two weeks, he had departed to [[Kraków]], where he arrived on 9 December and was crowned on 27 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt;

Maximilian attempted to resolve the dispute by bringing a military force to Poland, thereby starting the [[War of the Polish Succession (1587-1588)|War of the Polish Succession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone2001&quot;/&gt; After a failed attempt to [[Siege of Kraków (1587)|take Kraków]] in late 1587, successfully defended by Zamoyski, he retreated to gather more reinforcements but was pursued by the forces loyal to Sigismund.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaleckiReddaway&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone2001&quot;/&gt; Zamoyski at first wanted to avoid a large battle, as he hoped for more reinforcements and supplies, but, when it became apparent that Maximilian would be reinforced first, he decided to press an attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-121&quot;/&gt; He also received the king's and royal permission to cross the borders and attack Maximilian in [[Silesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-121&quot;/&gt; Zamoyski divided his army into several regiments that were able to march quickly, at approximately 24 kilometers a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-121&quot;/&gt; He reformed his army after a week near [[Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-121&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, on 22 January 1588, Maximilian crossed the border into his own territory, towards [[Byczyna]] (Pitschen).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikulski2005&quot;/&gt;

==Opposing forces==
Each side had comparable forces:&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt; Maximilan had about 6,500 men, about half of which (3,290) were infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=eduseek/&gt; His forces consisted primarily of [[Silesians]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]].,&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt; with artillery consisting of four heavy and a dozen or so lighter pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt; Zamoyski's forces numbered about 6,000, including 3,700 cavalry, 2,300 infantry, and several cannon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=eduseek/&gt; Maximilian's Polish supporters included 600 cavalry under the command of the &quot;devil of [[Łańcut]]&quot; [[Stanisław Stadnicki]].&lt;ref name=les/&gt; Another of Maximilan's notable Polish supporters at the battle was the poet [[Adam Czahrowski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikulski2005&quot;/&gt; Overall Maximilan's forces held the advantage in infantry, while Zamoyski's was in cavalry.&lt;ref name=eduseek/&gt; The Poles favored the cavalry, which had supreme mobility and used the effective charging tactics, but also meant that their infantry was geared too much towards cavalry support.&lt;ref name=eduseek/&gt;

==The battle==
On the night of 24 January the Archduke's army took positions east of the small town of Byczyna on the royal road leading into Poland. They felt secure in their camp, on the Habsburg side of the border, and did not expect the Poles to cross.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; Zamoyski marshaled his forces into three lines and was able to position them at an angle to the opponent's line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt;

The exact position of the Polish Army is unknown, but part of the Polish right flank, moving quietly in the dense mist, encircled Maximilian's left flank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt; After the mist began to clear the Archduke realized his force was being flanked and his retreat to Byczyna was threatened. He ordered an attack, but a miscommunication of his orders confused part of his army and the Hungarian regiment began to retreat. The Polish left wing, under command of future Hetman [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]], dispersed the opposing units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krasiński1846&quot;/&gt; The battle saw more infantry action than many others of the Commonwealth but, even so, the [[Polish cavalry]] ([[Polish winged hussars]]) played a major part.&lt;ref name=les/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FedorowiczBogucka1982&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BrzezinskiVukšić2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Brzezinski|author2=Velimir Vukšić|title=Polish Winged Hussar 1576-1775|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCW2VIgJ5o0C&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=25 July 2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-650-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle began with some duels between [[elear]]s (cavalry champions), soon followed by Polish cavalry charges, on the left flank and in the center, which did not result in any significant breakthroughs for either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;eduseek&quot;/&gt; Zamoyski is said to have commanded the battle very well, turning it at several points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt; Eventually a Polish hussar counterattack on the left flank mauled Maximilan's Hungarian cavalry and forced his army to start giving ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plew1995-122&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=eduseek/&gt; The bloody retreat quickly turned into a general rout during which the Archduke's army suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref name=les/&gt;

The entire battle lasted approximately one to two hours.&lt;ref name=les/&gt;&lt;ref name=eduseek/&gt; Maximilian took refuge in Byczyna, but the Poles took control of his artillery and turned the guns on the town.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; Before the Polish forces began their assault, Maximilian surrendered and was taken prisoner.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; The battle, therefore, ended up being the decisive victory for the Polish-Swedish faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wankowicz1974&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Exact casualties are unknown, but the Archduke's army suffered heavier losses, estimated at about 2,000, whereas the Poles lost about 1,000 men.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; Żółkiewski captured an enemy [[War flag|standard]], but received a knee wound which lamed him for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krasiński1846&quot;/&gt; After the intervention of a papal envoy Maximilian was released, but only after spending thirteen months as a &quot;guest&quot; of Zamoyski.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; In the [[Treaty of Bytom and Będzin]] (signed on 9 March 1589) Maximilian was to renounce the Polish crown and [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] had to pledge not to make any alliances against Poland with the [[Muscovy]] or Sweden.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; The town of [[Stará Ľubovňa|Lubowla]], taken early in the conflict by Maximilian, was returned to Poland.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; Upon his return to [[Vienna]] he failed to honor his pledge and renounce his claim to the Polish crown and would not do so until 1598.&lt;ref name=les/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone2001&quot;/&gt;
