'''OB 318''' was a [[North Atlantic]] [[convoy]] which ran during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] in [[World War II]]. During '''Operation Primrose''' [[Royal Navy]] convoy escorts {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|6}}, [[USS Hunt (DD-194)|''Broadway'']] and {{HMS|Aubretia|K96|2}} captured {{GS|U-110|1940|2}} with an intact [[Enigma machine]] and a wealth of signals intelligence, which led to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|breakthrough]] into cracking the German naval Enigma code.&lt;ref&gt;Blair pp.278-285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
By the Spring of 1941 the battle of the Atlantic was starting to have an increase in German U-boat losses. This forced ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' [[Karl Dönitz]] to change his strategy and he now moved his wolf packs further west, in order to catch the convoys without their anti-submarine escort.  OB 318 was a west-bound convoy of 38 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from [[Liverpool]] on 2 May 1941 bound for ports in [[North America]]. The convoy commodore was R.Adm. WB MacKenzie in SS ''Colonial''.&lt;ref&gt;Hague&lt;/ref&gt;  It was escorted by 7 EG, an escort group led by {{HMS|Westcott|D47|6}} (Cdr. Bockett-Pugh) and comprising ten warships; these were joined in mid-ocean by 3 EG, a force of eight warships led by HMS ''Bulldog'' (Cdr J Baker-Cresswell). Opposing them was a force of nineteen U-boats, though in the event only six were in a position to pose a threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair p278&quot;&gt;Blair p278&lt;/ref&gt;  One of those was ''U-110'' under the command of ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' [[Fritz-Julius Lemp]].  Lemp notoriously had been in command of {{GS|U-30|1936|2}} in 1939 which had controversially sunk the 13,581 ton [[passenger ship]] {{SS|Athenia||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Blair pp.66-69&amp;248-260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
OB 318 was sighted on 7 May 1941 by {{GS|U-94|1940|2}}, which reported its position and commenced shadowing while U-boat Command ([[BdU]]) alerted other U-boats in the area.
There were six U-boats within striking distance, and these were ordered to close with ''U-94''{{'}}s position.
Meanwhile, during 7 May the escort force was joined by five ships from [[Iceland]] and the destroyers of 3 EG, which were to take over escort duties from the [[Western Approaches]] to a dispersal point at 34 West, a location south of [[Greenland]]. Three ships and the destroyers of 7 EG left for Iceland during 7 May, leaving the escort force still at ten warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair p278&quot;/&gt;

===''U-94''===
At nightfall on 7 May ''U-94'' attacked the convoy, sinking two ships. Her skipper, [[Herbert Kuppisch]], was able to enter the convoy by submerging ahead of the convoy and letting the lead escorts pass. he was then able to fire at close range on the ships in the centre of the convoy, hitting ''Ixion'' and ''Eastern Star''. However ''U-94'' was found by the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Rochester|L50|2}} and counter-attacked by her, {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|2}} and {{HMS|Amazon|D39|2}} for four hours. ''U-94'' was damaged and forced to retire, though she was able to effect repairs later and continue her patrol.

On 8 May the remaining vessels of 3 EG, three [[corvette]]s and two [[Naval Trawler|trawlers]], with the [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Ranpura'' in company, joined the convoy, and the remaining ships of 7 EG departed.

===''U-110''===
On the evening of 8 May ''U-110'' and {{GS|U-201||2}} also made contact, tracking the convoy until morning. In an unusual move, the two skippers made rendezvous in order to co-ordinate their attack; Lemp in ''U-110'' would make a submerged attack from ahead, while [[Adalbert Schnee]] in ''U-201'' would do the same from the rear. It was expected that the escort would have departed by this time, leaving the convoy vulnerable to their assault.  During the morning of 9 May ''U-110'' moved into position and commenced her attack. Lemp was surprised to encounter the escort still in place, but succeeded in penetrating the convoy, sinking two ships. Lemp was targeting a [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] with his fourth torpedo tube when ''Aubretia'' spotted the periscope and then located ''U-110'' with [[ASDIC]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair pp.278&amp;279&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Aubretia'' gave the alert to other ships while she unloaded and dropped a pattern of depth charges. ''U-110'' performed a deep dive and managed to survive the initial onslaught. ''Aubretia'' was joined by the destroyers ''Bulldog'' and ''Broadway'', and the attack was delivered with such force that Lemp was forced to surface. As he came up a dozen men on ''U-110'' rushed to man the guns but were shot by the waiting British ships. Lemp also saw that ''Bulldog'' was preparing to ram so Lemp gave the hurried order to abandon ship. Commander Joe Baker-Cresswell decided to try to capture the U-boat instead and hove to.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/65205 ''Addison Joe Baker-Cresswell (1901–1997), naval officer''] by John Winton in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' online (orig. published by Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors went over the side including Lemp. It turned out that Lemp realising that ''Bulldog'' was not going to ram had decided to go back and try to destroy the equipment along with the code books but he failed and died in the attempt. ''U-110'' itself survived the attack, but was seriously damaged and was taking on water.&lt;ref name=&quot;naval-history.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web

''Bulldog'' soon had pulled alongside and Sub-Lieutenant [[David Balme]] led a boarding party, and began stripping her of what they could find. Balme's team soon began to take off the valuables and these turned out to be codebooks, charts, ciphers and most significantly, a complete and undamaged Enigma machine. The crew hadn't any idea what it was they had captured. Before they transferred the equipment ''Bulldog'' had to depart, leaving the U-boat with the prize crew as it had received a message of another submarine in the area. Balme and his men were left onboard U-110 for over an hour before ''Bulldog'' returned.&lt;ref name=&quot;naval-history.net&quot;/&gt;

===''U-201''===
Meanwhile, Schnee in ''U-201'' made his attack, sinking one ship and damaging another. He was also counter-attacked, by ''Amazon'', ''Nigella'' and ''St Apollo'', and forced to retire. He was left damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p281&lt;/ref&gt;

===''U-556''===
In the early hours of 10 May OB 318 was found by {{GS|U-556||2}} which attacked immediately, resulting in one ship damaged. As OB 318 was at its dispersal point, the convoy separated during the night, while the escorts departed to meet their next charge. However ''U-556'' was able to keep in touch with a group of ships heading south-west, and during the day sank two more.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and significance==
U-boats sank five ships from convoy OB 318; and three, including the convoy commodore's ship ''Colonial'', were sunk before arriving by U-boats patrolling near their destinations. Thirty-three ships arrived safely at their destinations over the next two weeks.

Baker-Cresswell took ''U-110'' in tow, but she sank within hours due to the damage she had sustained. Lemp was lost with 14 members of his crew but a war correspondent, 4 officers and 28 men were rescued and sent to [[Scapa Flow]] as [[prisoners of war]]. At Scapa Flow experts from [[Bletchley Park]] were waiting and were exceptionally surprised with what they collected and took back with them.&lt;ref&gt;Roskill ''The Secret Capture'' pg 107&lt;/ref&gt; 
The capture of the Enigma machine was highly secret at the time and none of the crew knew of the significance. The machine itself significantly assisted the work in hand at Bletchley Park in breaking German naval codes. This was the first fully functioning machine and the first one used to break the naval codes along with the capture of codes from a number of German [[weather ship]]s during the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;sebag&quot;&gt;Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, ''Enigma: Battle for the Code'', 2000, pp. 213&amp;ndash;214.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to this Enigma machine though; Bletchley were able to inform the Royal Navy and thus steered convoys away from where most groups of U-boat packs were present. The difference made was substantial; from when the information began to pour through in June 1941 Allied shipping losses were around 432,000 tons but by August it had dropped to less than 80,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rapidttp.co.za/milhist/vol093db.html ''OPERATION PRIMROSE: The Story of the Capture of the Enigma Cypher Machine from U11O'' Balme ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important find as well being the ''[[Reservehandverfahren]]'' cipher which was first solved at Bletchley Park in June 1941 by means of documents captured from ''U-110'' and then later on with the important capture of code-books and other important documents from {{GS|U-559||2}} on 30 October 1942. Thereafter it was solved using [[cryptanalysis]] led by [[Alan Turing]] for over three years. Some 1,400 signals were read during that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;sebag&quot;/&gt; Baker-Cresswell was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and promoted captain. [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] told him the capture of the ''U-110'' cipher material had been &quot;the most important single event in the whole war at sea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;/&gt;

==U-571 (film)==
{{further|U-571 (film)}}
The film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' was partially inspired by the capture of ''U-110''. The film however caused irritation and anger in Britain whereby the film's plot was Americanised. The anger came to such a point that at [[Prime Minister's Questions]], [[Tony Blair]] agreed with questioner [[Brian Jenkins (politician)|Brian Jenkins MP]] that the film was &quot;an affront&quot; to British sailors.&lt;ref name=&quot;blair&quot;&gt;
{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/781858.stm
 |title = U-boat film an 'affront', says Blair
 |publisher = [[BBC News]]
 |date = 7 June 2000
 |accessdate = 2006-08-18

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to a letter from [[Paul Truswell]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for the [[Pudsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Pudsey]] constituency (which includes [[Horsforth]], a town proud of its connection with HMS ''Aubretia''), U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]] wrote assuring that the film's plot was only a work of fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-storm&quot;&gt;
{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/773913.stm
 |title = Storm over U-boat film
 |publisher = [[BBC News]]
 |date = 2 June 2000
 |accessdate = 2006-08-18 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the criticisms however David Balme was interviewed by the director of the film, [[Jonathan Mostow]] in which he described the capture of ''U-110'' and the capture itself was mentioned at the start of the end credits as recognition and response to the criticisms.
