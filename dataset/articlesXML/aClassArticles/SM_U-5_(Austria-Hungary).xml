'''SM ''U-5''''' or '''''U-V''''' was the [[lead ship|lead boat]] of the [[U-5 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'' class]] of [[submarine]]s or [[U-boat]]s built for and operated by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) before and during the [[First World War]]. The submarine was built as part of a plan to evaluate foreign submarine designs, and was the first of three boats of the class built by [[Whitehead &amp; Co.]] of [[Fiume]] after a design by American [[John Philip Holland]].

''U-5'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in April 1907 and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in February 1909. The double-[[submarine hull|hull]]ed submarine was just over {{convert|105|ft|m}} long and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] between {{convert|240|and|273|MT|ST}}, depending on whether surfaced or submerged. ''U-5''{{'}}s design had inadequate ventilation and exhaust from her twin [[gasoline engine]]s often intoxicated the crew. The boat was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in April 1910, and served as a training boat—sometimes making as many as ten cruises a month—through the beginning of the First World War in 1914.

The submarine scored most of her wartime successes during the first year of the war while under the command of [[Georg Ritter von Trapp]]. The French armoured cruiser [[French armoured cruiser Léon Gambetta|''Léon Gambetta'']], sunk in April 1915, was the largest ship sunk by ''U-5''. The sinking of Italian Troop Transport ship {{SS|Principe Umberto}} in June 1916 with the loss of 1,926 men, was the worst naval disaster of World War I in terms of human lives lost. In May 1917, ''U-5'' hit a [[mine (naval)|mine]] and sank with the loss of six men. She was raised, rebuilt, and recommissioned, but sank no more ships. At the end of the war, ''U-5'' was ceded to Italy as a [[war reparation]], and scrapped in 1920. In all, ''U-5'' sank four ships totaling {{GRT|21,604|disp=long}}.

== Design and construction ==
''U-5'' was built as part of a plan by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] to competitively evaluate foreign submarine designs from [[Simon Lake]], [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], and [[John Philip Holland]].&lt;ref name=Con-340&gt;Gardiner, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The Austro-Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of ''U-5'' (and sister ship, ''U-6'') in 1906 by [[Whitehead &amp; Co.]] of [[Fiume]].&lt;ref name=Gib-384 /&gt; The boat was designed by American [[John Philip Holland]] and licensed by Holland and his company, [[Electric Boat]].&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt; ''U-5'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 9 April 1907 in the United States, partially assembled, and shipped to Whitehead's for final assembly, a process which, author Edwin Sieche notes, &quot;caused a lot of trouble&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt; She was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed at Fiume on 10 February 1909 by Agathe Whitehead,&lt;!-- date --&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berk-82 /&gt;&lt;!-- Whitehead --&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Agathe Whitehead, the granddaughter of [[Robert Whitehead]], first met her future husband, [[Georg Ritter von Trapp]], at the launching ceremony; von Trapp later became ''U-5''{{'}}s most successful commander. See: Berkowitz, p. 82, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and towed to [[Pula|Pola]] on 17 August.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt;

''U-5''{{'}}s design featured a [[submarine hull|single-hull]] with a [[teardrop hull|teardrop-shaped body]] that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt; She was {{convert|105|ft|4|in|m}} long by {{convert|13|ft|9|in|m}} [[beam (ship)|abeam]] and had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|10|in|m}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|240|MT|ST}} surfaced, and {{convert|273|MT|ST}} submerged.&lt;ref name=Sieche-17 /&gt; Her two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} bow [[torpedo tube]]s featured unique, cloverleaf-shaped design [[hatch (nautical)|hatch]]es that rotated on a central axis,&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt; and the boat was designed to carry up to four [[torpedo]]es.&lt;ref name=Sieche-17 /&gt; For surface running, ''U-5'' was outfitted with 2 [[gasoline engine]]s, but suffered from inadequate ventilation, which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew;&lt;ref name=Con-340 /&gt; her underwater propulsion was by two [[electric motor]]s.&lt;ref name=Sieche-17 /&gt;

== Service career ==
''U-5'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] on 1 April 1910,&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt; with ''[[Linienschiffsleutnant]]'' Urban Passerar in command.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-5 /&gt; Over the next three years she served primarily as a training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month. On 1 May 1911, she hosted a delegation of [[Peruvian Navy]] officers that inspected her. In June 1912, she towed a balloon as part of efforts to assess the underwater visibility of hull paint schemes.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21 /&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''U-5'' was one of only four fully operational U-boats in the Austro-Hungarian Navy fleet.&lt;ref name=Con-341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; She was initially stationed at the submarine base on [[Brioni Island|Brioni]], but was moved to [[Cattaro]] by late 1914.&lt;ref name=Sieche-21_22&gt;Sieche, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-5'' made an unsuccessful attack on a French battleship squadron off [[Punta Stilo]] on 3 November. In December, the ship's armament was augmented by a 3.7&amp;nbsp;cm/23 (1.5&amp;nbsp;in) [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] (QF) [[deck gun]], and had her first radio receiver installed.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt;
In April 1915, [[Georg Ritter von Trapp]] assumed command of ''U-5'',&lt;ref name=KUK-U-5 /&gt; and the following month, led the boat in sinking the French armored cruiser {{ship|French armoured cruiser|Léon Gambetta||2}} off [[Santa Maria di Leuca]].&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; On the night of 26 April, ''Léon Gambetta'' was patrolling the [[Straits of Otranto]] at a leisurely {{convert|6.5|knots|km/h}} without the benefit of a [[destroyer]] screen. ''U-5'' launched two torpedoes at the French cruiser, hitting with both. The ship was rocked by the explosions of the two torpedoes and went down in ten minutes, taking down with her the entire complement of officers, including Rear Admiral [[Victor Baptistin Sénès]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Vienna confirms disaster.

In June, ''U-5'' helped search for the lost Austro-Hungarian seaplane ''L 41'', and in July, received an upgrade of her deck gun to a {{convert|4.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} QF gun.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; In early August, ''U-5'' was sent out from [[Lissa (island)|Lissa]] when the Austro-Hungarian Navy received word from a reconnaissance aircraft that an Italian submarine had been sighted at [[Pelagosa]].&lt;ref&gt;von Trapp, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 5 August, the Italian submarine [[Italian submarine Nereide|''Nereide'']] was on the surface, moored under a cliff in the island's harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''U-5'' surfaced just offshore, ''Nereide''{{'}}s commanding officer, ''Capitano di Corvetta'' Carlo del Greco, cast off the lines and maneuvered to get a shot at von Trapp's boat. ''Nereide'' launched a single torpedo at ''U-5'' that missed, after which del Greco ordered his boat submerged. ''U-5'' lined up a shot and launched a single torpedo at the slowly submerging target, striking her, and sending her to the bottom with all hands.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Stern (p. 40) reports 20 men were killed when ''Nereide'' went down; Sieche (p. 22) reports a loss of 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian captain received the ''[[Gold Medal of Military Valor|Medaglia d'Oro al Valore Militare]]'' for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August, ''U-5'' captured the {{GRT|1,034}} Greek steamer ''Cefalonia'' as a [[prize (law)|prize]] off [[Durazzo]].&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; In late November, Friedrich Schlosser succeeded von Trapp as ''U-5''{{'}}s commanding officer.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-5 /&gt;

Schlosser and ''U-5'' made an unsuccessful attack on an Italian {{sclass|Indomito|destroyer|1}} on 7 June 1916, but the boat managed to torpedo the Italian [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{SS|Principe Umberto||2}} off [[Cape Linguetta]] on the next day.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; According to a contemporary account, ''Principe Umberto'' and two other ships were transporting troops and [[materiel]] under escort of two destroyers.&lt;ref name=Rider-459&gt;Rider, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; After the torpedo hit, ''Principe Umberto'' went down quickly with the loss 1,750 men.&lt;!-- casualties --&gt;&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rider-459 /&gt;&lt;!-- quick sinking --&gt; ''Principe Umberto'' was the last ship hit by ''U-5''.&lt;ref name=U5-ships /&gt;

On 16 May 1917, ''U-5'' was conducting a training cruise in the [[Fasana|Fasana Channel]] near [[Pula]] when her stern struck a [[mine (naval)|mine]]&lt;!--source does not say whether friendly or not --&gt;. The boat sank at a depth of {{convert|36|m|ft|sp=us}} with a loss of 6 of the 19 men on board. From 20 to 24 May the submarine was raised, and through November underwent a refit. During this reconditioning, a new [[conning tower]] was added and the deck gun was upgraded again, this time to a 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm/30 (3.0&amp;nbsp;in) gun.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; Upon completion, ''U-5'' was recommissioned,&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; but had no more war successes.&lt;ref name=U5-ships /&gt; In her career, ''U-5'' sank a total of four ships totaling {{GRT|21,604}}.&lt;ref name=U5-ships /&gt; After the war's end, ''U-5'' was transferred to [[Venice]] where she was inspected by British military commissions.&lt;ref name=Sieche-22 /&gt; ''U-5'' was later ceded to [[Italy]] as a [[war reparation]] in 1920 and was scrapped.&lt;ref name=Con-343 /&gt;
