Group Captain '''Norman William Reginald Mawle''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|DFC|JP|sep=yes}}  (27 February 1897&amp;ndash;28 December 1971) was a British World War I [[flying ace]]. He was credited with 12 official aerial victories during the First World War. During World War II, he returned to his country's service, not retiring until 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaerodrome&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/mawle.php |title=Norman William Reginald Mawle |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=3 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
Cadet Norman Mawle of the [[Inns of Court Regiment|Inns of Court]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] on 5 September 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=9 September 1916 |issue=29741 |supp=yes |startpage=8883}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seconded as a [[flying officer]] to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] on 27 December 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=21 January 1918 |issue=30486 |supp=yes |startpage=1060 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mawle was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 5 March 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=1 November 1918 |issue=30988 |supp=yes |startpage=12954 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 1918, Mawle was assigned to No. 84 Squadron as a [[Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5]] pilot. His original assigned aircraft was substandard, and he would not have success until it was wrecked by another pilot, and replaced. Using SE.5 serial number D6917, he destroyed a German [[observation balloon]] at [[Proyart]] for his first victory, on 17 July 1918. Three days later, he [[balloon buster|busted another balloon]] and destroyed a [[Fokker D.VII]]. A broken connecting rod in the engine moved Mawle out of his customary plane into SE.5 serial number C1868; on 24 July, he used it to team with Captain [[John Steele Ralston|John Ralston]] to destroy a Fokker D.VII over [[Lamotte-Warfusée|Warfusée]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theaerodrome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/mawle_log.php |title=Entries from Lt. Mawle's Flight Log |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once back in his familiar machine, he helped destroy an [[LVG]] reconnaissance plane on 29 July 1918 for his fifth win.  The following day, he destroyed two more Fokker D.VIIs, and drove one down out of control. On 4 August, he destroyed another balloon. Three days later, Mawle destroyed a Fokker D.VII and drove another down out of control. The following day, he burned a German balloon for his twelfth and final victory. While strafing two horse-drawn German balloons, Mawle was severely wounded in the stomach and arm. He managed to return to base, but was removed from combat duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaerodrome&quot;/&gt;

On 2 November 1918, Mawle received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his exploits. His citation read:
:Lieutenant Norman William Reginald Mawle (London Regiment)
::&quot;A courageous and skillful leader, who has destroyed nine enemy machines and four kite balloons. While leading his patrol of five scouts, he observed a hostile formation of fifteen scouts. Nothing daunted by the disparity in numbers, he at once engaged them, driving down three himself. During a recent patrol he engaged two kite balloons, one of which he shot down in flames at 25 feet altitude. Later, he attacked an anti-tank gun, stampeding the horses and causing the gun to overturn in a ditch. In this patrol he was seriously wounded, but flew his machine back to his aerodrome.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=2 November 1918 |issue=30989 |supp=yes |startpage=12970 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
In November 1934, Mawle was executor on an estate in [[Hounslow]]; his address was given as [[Oadby]], Leicestershire.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=20 November 1934 |issue=34106 |startpage=7492 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and beyond==
Mawle was promoted from [[flight lieutenant]] to [[squadron leader]] and simultaneously transferred from [[No. 913 (County of Warwick) Balloon Squadron AAF]] to command of [[No. 911 (County of Warwick) Balloon Squadron AAF]] on 6 June 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=21 November 1939 |issue=34738 |startpage=7807 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 1941, Mawle was promoted to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the Balloon Branch of the Auxiliary Air Force of the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=9 September 1941 |issue=35270 |startpage=5224 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 July 1942, he dropped the &quot;temporary&quot; designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=25 September 1942 |issue=35717 |supp=yes |startpage=4170 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 1944, Mawle transferred to administrative duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=9 May 1944 |issue=36503 |supp=yes |startpage=2118 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mawle retired from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 10 February 1954, as a wing commander retaining the rank of [[group captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=17 August 1954 |issue=40255 |supp=yes |startpage=4749 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mawle was serving as a [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]] and as Chairman of the West Bromwich Savings Committee, when he was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1962 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=25 May 1962 |issue=42683 |supp=yes |startpage=4319 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
