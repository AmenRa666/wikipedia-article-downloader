== Propaganda ... reflected the will of the political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. ==

The statement is obvious. Whose will could have the propaganda reflected?[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 12:08, 26 January 2015 (UTC)
:Try and source it. Try and source that what happened in East Prussia happened under Stalin's orders. Of course it did, but it is hard to find a source that will say so. [[User:Gunbirddriver|Gunbirddriver]] ([[User talk:Gunbirddriver|talk]]) 19:43, 26 January 2015 (UTC)
::Was the Holocaust ordered by Hitler? As far as I know no such document exists. 
::Some crimes were punished, I don't know if there existed any logic of the punishments. 
::Stalin was able to limit the crimes, but he didn't.[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 07:49, 27 January 2015 (UTC)
:::I do not understand what point you are trying to make here. &quot;Was the Holocaust ordered by Hitler?&quot; Certainly, and if this article was about the Holocaust then the editors involved would be obliged to attempt to cite the assertion.  This article is about the evacuation of East Prussia and what happened during the course of those events. Though it is obvious that the events occurred as a result of Stalin's intention, we are still obligated to place a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag if we cannot source the statement. If you believe you can source the statement than by all means provide the missing supporting citation.
:::A number of editors have just spent the last four months discussing this issue, starting [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Evacuation_of_East_Prussia#Argument_for_tighter_editing here]. We recently arrived at a tenuous consensus on the wording of the section [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia#Crimes &quot;Crimes&quot;]. It may be helpful to review the discussion in the talk page above to see where the discussion has gone. The discussion is primarily over how we as editors write a truthful article that is supported independent of our own opinions, no matter how well founded those opinions are. As editors we are admonished to avoid what is termed &quot;[[Wikipedia:No original research|Original Research]]&quot;.  [[User:Gunbirddriver|Gunbirddriver]] ([[User talk:Gunbirddriver|talk]]) 09:16, 27 January 2015 (UTC)
:::::I have just added some text in a collapse box above called &quot;''The Storm of War'' by Andrew Roberts: Red Army and rape&quot; in it is a sentence that covers your concern and can be cited  as a reliable secondary source if needed: 
{{quotation|
:::::The documentary and anecdotal evidence is overwhelming and indisputable; the Red Army, which had behaved so heroically on the battlefield, raped the women of Germany as part of their reward, with the active collusion of their officers up to and including Stalin. ...}}
:::::The paragraph goes on with quotes of some of what Stalin said on the issue -- [[User:PBS|PBS]] ([[User talk:PBS|talk]]) 09:18, 16 June 2015 (UTC)
::::There is an article [[Rape during the occupation of Germany]] (I have linked it as ''see also'') and a long discussion. Wouldn't it be the best to discuss problems in one place or to inform about the discussion?[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 10:20, 27 January 2015 (UTC)
:::::The [[Evacuation of East Prussia]] and the [[Occupation of Germany]] are different events, though they both pertain to the last phase of the Second World War and the destruction of Nazi Germany. The discussion on a given talk page should be directed upon the article the talk page supports.[[User:Gunbirddriver|Gunbirddriver]] ([[User talk:Gunbirddriver|talk]]) 11:25, 27 January 2015 (UTC)
::::::The both subjects have obviously a common part. If you don't like separate them.[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 12:57, 27 January 2015 (UTC)
:::::::They are separate articles, so they ''are'' separated.[[User:Gunbirddriver|Gunbirddriver]] ([[User talk:Gunbirddriver|talk]]) 19:43, 27 January 2015 (UTC)
:This article should be about the ''Evacuation of East Prussia''. However the description of other subjects (''Crimes'', ''Aftermath'', ''Germany's territorial losses after World War II'' map) are of comparable size as the text related to the subject. So nothing is ''separated''. Either the name is corrected or the article.[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 07:26, 28 January 2015 (UTC)
::The subheadings are objectionable?  The map used?  I am sorry to say I do not follow you. You could always edit the page and see if other editors agree with your changes. I did find this map available: File:Attack of the Red Army 1-4 1945.jpg. Best of luck. [[User:Gunbirddriver|Gunbirddriver]] ([[User talk:Gunbirddriver|talk]]) 09:35, 28 January 2015 (UTC)
:::The article has several issues - the name, the lead, geography, the ethnic and social/political description of the population, Nazi crimes. The article should be rewritten, which is above my poor language knowledge and I may be also biased.[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 08:20, 29 January 2015 (UTC)

== My summary - non-neutral ==

The article starts with a POV definition, ignores Nazi social structure (see [[Organization of the Third Reich]] - there existed a whole spectrum between civilians and army) and crimes. Summarizing - non-neutral.[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 12:51, 27 January 2015 (UTC)

== Geography ==

What is ''East Prussia''?
#Weimar Germany Province of East Prussia - Neutral
#EP+Memel - German POV
#EP+Memel+occupied Ciechan√≥w region - Nazi POV
#[[Operation Hannibal]] area - a much bigger area than EP, which included Free City of Danzig and small part of West Prussia. [[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 08:16, 29 January 2015 (UTC)
The map [[:File:East prussia weimar and 3rd reich.jpg]] shows one version (of 1,2,3), I'm not sure which one and this should be explained.[[User:Xx234~enwiki|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234~enwiki|talk]]) 08:45, 29 January 2015 (UTC)
