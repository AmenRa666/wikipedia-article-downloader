'''USS Beltrami (AK-162)''' was an {{sclass-|Alamosa|cargo ship}} commissioned by the [[U.S. Navy]] for service in [[World War II]]. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. 

==Construction==
''Beltrami'' was laid down under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract, MC hull 2107, on 18 July 1944 by [[Kaiser Cargo]], at [[Richmond, California]]; launched on 26 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Marvin A. Thrash; and acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 4 January 1945, [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Gerald W. Rahill, [[USNR]], in command.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

==Service history==
===World War II Pacific Theatre operations===
After fitting out at [[San Francisco, California]], ''Beltrami'' got underway on 21 January for [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] operations out of [[San Pedro, California]]. There, her crew members practiced loading and unloading cargo and familiarized themselves with ''Beltrami''{{'}}s [[diesel engines]]. On 8 February, she loaded frozen food and steamed north to [[Longview, Washington]]. There, the cargo ship received a load of lumber from the [[Weyerhauser]] Co. before sailing west to [[Hawaii]], arriving in [[Pearl Harbor]] on 1 March. Over the next two weeks, the crew unloaded lumber at [[Port Allen, Hawaii|Port Allen]], [[Kauai]], and [[Nawiliwili Bay]], [[Kauai]], before returning to Pearl Harbor.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

====Supplying South Pacific bases====
Assigned to the [[Service Force, Pacific Fleet]], ''Beltrami'' sailed for the [[Solomon Islands]] on 21 March. Arriving at [[Guadalcanal]] on 3 April, the cargo ship discharged her supplies and immediately began loading for a supply run to the [[Admiralty Islands]]. Underway from the Solomons on the 8th, she arrived at [[Manus Island]] on 12 April. After unloading her cargo—Manus was a support base for the ongoing operations in the [[Philippines]] and the [[Ryukyus]] -- ''Beltrami'' sailed to [[Ulithi]], [[Caroline Islands]], on the 25th, anchoring there four days later.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

====Supporting troops in the Philippines====
Tasked with supporting the [[Okinawa campaign]], ''Beltrami'' proceeded to the Philippines on 20 May, arriving in [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], [[Leyte]], on 25 May. She then spent the next month discharging and loading fleet freight before sailing for the [[Mariana Islands]] on 22 June. ''Beltrami'' operated at [[Apra Harbor]], [[Guam]], for the next four weeks before heading to [[Ulithi]] on 21 July. She remained in reserve at that [[atoll]] through the end of the war on 15 August.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

====End-of-war activity====
''Beltrami'' sailed to the Philippines late in August and spent nine weeks operating in the [[Leyte]] area, providing passenger and cargo service to the forces ashore. On 8 November, tasked with supporting American occupation forces in [[China]], the cargo ship departed [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] for [[Shanghai]], arriving there on 16 November. She remained there until leaving for [[California]] on 27 January 1946, mooring in [[San Francisco harbor]] on 23 February.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

===Assigned to the East Coast===

Ordered to the [[US East Coast]], ''Beltrami'' got underway on 15 March, passed through the [[Panama Canal]] on the 28th, and arrived in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 8 April.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

====Preparations for Operation ''Nanook''====
{{main|Operation Nanook (1946)}}
While at that base, the ship received orders to prepare for [[Operation Nanook (1946)|Operation Nanook]]—a project to set up a system of weather stations in the [[Arctic]] regions of the [[Western Hemisphere]]. She first made brief stops at [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in mid-April, both to obtain cold weather gear and to receive equipment modifications for extended sub-zero operations. ''Beltrami'' then sailed to [[New York City|New York]], embarking [[LCVP (United States)|LCVP]]s and picket boats in early May, before moving on to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], to load a detachment of [[US Marines]]. ''Beltrami'' sailed independently on 15 July, heading north toward the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

On 25 July, after passing through the [[Labrador Sea]] and the [[Davis Strait]], ''Beltrami'' rendezvoused with the [[icebreaker]] {{USCGC|Northwind|WAG-282|2}} in [[Lancaster Sound]], well above the [[Arctic Circle]]. Two days later, the ships entered [[Dundas Harbor]], [[Devon Island]], to disembark the marine detachment. Upon entering the harbor, ''Northwind'' grounded on an uncharted pinnacle but was refloated about ten hours later without serious damage. Meanwhile, the marine detachment went ashore and set up a temporary camp at the base of an inactive [[glacier]].{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

''Beltrami'' then proceeded to [[Thule, Greenland]], where she joined the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Norton Sound|AV-11|2}}, net-laying ship {{USS|Whitewood|AN-63|2}} and [[sister ship]] {{USS|Alcona|AK-157|2}} in [[Task Force]] (TF) 68. Her crew unloaded the cargo and heavy equipment needed to construct a weather station and an emergency [[airstrip]], before the ship returned to Dundas Harbor on 20 August and reembarked the marines after their three-week field expedition. Returning to [[Thule]] on the 22d, she sailed for home two days later and arrived in Boston on 3 September.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

====Cargo operations along the East Coast====
Over the next two years, ''Beltrami'' plied the Atlantic coastal waters of [[North America]], delivering general cargo from [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], and Norfolk to naval stations as far south as the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and as far north as [[Argentia, Newfoundland]]. She also made regular visits to [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]]; [[St. George, Bermuda]]; and [[Roosevelt Roads]], [[Puerto Rico]].{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

====Service with the Sixth Fleet====
On 11 February 1949, following the permanent establishment of the [[U.S. 6th Fleet]] the previous year, ''Beltrami'' began the first of three voyages to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. She visited [[Casablanca]], Morocco; [[Athens, Greece]]; and [[Haifa, Israel]]; before coming back to Norfolk on 15 April. ''Beltrami'' returned to the Mediterranean between 8 October and 2 December of that year and again between 15 June and 7 August 1951. In between these cruises, she also made one voyage to [[United Kingdom|British]] ports, visiting [[Gibraltar]], [[Plymouth, England|Plymouth]], and [[Londonderry Port|Londonderry]] between 20 July and 8 September 1950.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

====Final operations====
For the remainder of her service, ''Beltrami'' operated out of [[Earle, New Jersey]], and Norfolk, primarily servicing ports and installations in the [[West Indies]]. Her most common duty was the shuttling of passengers and cargo between Guantánamo Bay, Roosevelt Roads, and [[Trinidad]]. Made obsolete by larger and faster cargo ships, ''Beltrami'' sailed from Norfolk to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in late July 1955, arriving at the navy yard there on the 29th.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

===Final decommissioning===
Placed in commission, in reserve, on 1 August 1955, she was towed to [[Savannah, Georgia]], on 28 August, and was decommissioned on 10 November 1955. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 April 1960, and she was transferred to the [[Maritime Administration]] on 21 June 1960. She was sold for scrap to Hugo Neu Steel Products on 29 August 1960.{{sfn|DANFS|2015}}

* [[China Service Medal]] (extended)
* [[American Campaign Medal]]
* [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]]
