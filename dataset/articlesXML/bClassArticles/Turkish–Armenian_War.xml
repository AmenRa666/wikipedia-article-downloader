The '''Turkish-Armenian war''', known in Turkish sources as the '''Eastern Operation'''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The liberation of Sarikamis and Kars formed a part of our Eastern Operation, and as is known this operation was against Armenians&quot; - D. Akbulut, The liberation of Sarikamis and Kars According to the Albayrak Newspaper, in &quot;Kars and Eastern Anatolia in the Recent History Symposium&quot;, Ankara 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''[[Eastern Front (Turkey)|Eastern Front]]''' ({{lang-tr|Doğu Cephesi}}), refers to a conflict in the autumn of 1920 between the [[First Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Turkish national movement|Turkish nationalists]], following the signing of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The Turkish army under [[Kâzım Karabekir]] invaded and defeated Armenia, capturing territory which the Ottoman Empire had lost to the [[Russian Empire]] in 1855 and 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas&quot;&gt;[http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Armenia/turkarwar.htm Dr. Andrew Andersen, Ph.D., ''Atlas of Conflicts: Turkish-Armenian War'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish military victory was followed by Soviet Russia's occupation and [[Democratic Republic of Armenia#Turkish–Armenian War and Sovietization|sovietization]] of Armenia. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] (March 1921) between Soviet Russia and the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] and the related [[Treaty of Kars]] (October 1921) confirmed the territorial gains made by Karabekir and established the modern [[Turkey|Turkish]]–[[Armenia]]n border.

== Background ==

With the dissolution of the [[Russian Empire]] in the wake of the [[February Revolution|Feb 1917 revolution]] and of the [[Transcaucasian Federation]] in May 1918, the Armenians of the South Caucasus declared their independence and formally established the [[First Republic of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;For the period leading up to independence see [[Richard G. Hovannisian]] (1967). ''Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918''. Berkeley: University of California Press. ISBN 0-520-00574-0.&lt;/ref&gt; In its two years of existence, the tiny republic, with its capital in [[Yerevan]], was beset with a number of debilitating problems, ranging from fierce territorial disputes with its neighbors and an appalling refugee crisis.&lt;ref&gt;The full history of the Armenian republic is covered by Richard G. Hovannisian, ''Republic of Armenia''. 4 Vols. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971–1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia's most crippling problem was its dispute with its neighbor to the west, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans had killed as many as 1.5 million Armenians during the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Although the armies of the [[Ottoman Empire]] eventually occupied the South Caucasus in the summer of 1918 and stood poised to crush the republic, Armenia resisted until the end of October, when the Ottoman Empire [[Armistice of Mudros|capitulated]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]]. Though the Ottoman Empire was partially occupied by the Allies, they did not withdraw their forces from the pre-war Russo-Turkish boundary until February 1919 and maintained many troops mobilized along this frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Hovannisian|first =Richard G.|title =The Republic of Armenia: The First Year, 1918–1919, Vol. I|publisher = University of California Press|year =1971|location =Berkeley|isbn =0-520-01984-9|pages =416ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolshevik and Turkish nationalist movements==
During the First World War and in the ensuing [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace negotiations in Paris]], the Allies had vowed to punish the Turks and reward some, if not all, the [[Six vilayets|eastern provinces]] of the empire to the nascent Armenian republic.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian, Richard G. &quot;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/259971?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=Hovannisian&amp;term=G.&amp;term=Richard&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DRichard%2BG.%2BHovannisian%26wc%3Don%26acc%3Don&amp;item=6&amp;ttl=424&amp;returnArticleService=showFullText The Allies and Armenia, 1915–18].&quot; ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]''. Vol. 3, No. 1 (Jan., 1968), pp. 145–168.&lt;/ref&gt; But the Allies were more concerned with concluding the peace treaties with Germany and the other European members of the Central Powers. In matters related to the Near East, the principal powers, [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]], had conflicting interests over the spheres of influence they were to assume. While there were crippling internal disputes between the Allies, and the United States was reluctant to accept a [[League of Nations mandates|mandate]] over Armenia, disaffected elements in the Ottoman Empire in 1920 began to disavow the decisions made by the Ottoman government in Constantinople, coalesced and formed the [[Turkish National Movement]], under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Hovannisian

Their avowed goal was to &quot;guarantee the safety and unity of the country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutturkey.com/kurtulus.htm Goal of the Turkish National Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bolshevik]]s sympathized with the Turkish Movement due to their mutual opposition to &quot;Western Imperialism,&quot; as the Bolsheviks referred to it.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian, Richard G. &quot;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/162238?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=Hovannisian&amp;term=G.&amp;term=Richard&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DRichard%2BG.%2BHovannisian%26wc%3Don%26acc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=424&amp;returnArticleService=showFullText Armenia and the Caucasus in the Genesis of the Soviet-Turkish Entente].&quot; ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'', Vol. 4, No. 2 (April, 1973), pp. 129–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his message to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the leader of the [[Bolshevik]]s, dated 26 April 1920, Kemal promised to coordinate his military operations with the Bolsheviks' &quot;fight against imperialist governments&quot; and requested five million [[Turkish lira|lira]] in gold as well as armaments &quot;as first aid&quot; to his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;LetterLenin&quot;&gt;{{ru icon}} ''Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn'', 1963, № 11, pp. 147–148.

''La république d'Arménie. 1918–1920 La mémoire du siècle'', Brussels: Éditions complexe, ISBN 2-87027-280-4, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until August 1920 that the Allies drafted the peace settlement of the Near East, in the form of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The United States had refused to assume the Armenian mandate in May of that year, but the Allies delegated the US to draw the western boundaries of the republic. The US allotted four of the six eastern provinces to the Ottoman Empire, including an outlet to the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty of Sèvres served to confirm Kemal's suspicions about Allied plans to partition the empire. According to the historian [[Richard G. Hovannisian]], his decision to order the invasion of Armenia was intended to show the Allies that &quot;the treaty would not be accepted and that there would be no peace until the West was ready to offer new terms in keeping with the principles of the Turkish National Pact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Turkish and Soviet sources, Turkish plans to take back formerly Ottoman-controlled lands in the east were already in place as early as June 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian.

ISBN 978-975-343-349-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Skirmishes between Turkish forces and the Armenian military in the border of Kars were frequent during that summer, although full-scale hostilities did not break out until September. Convinced that the Allies would not come to the defense of Armenia and aware that the ADR's leaders had failed to gain recognition of its independence by Soviet Russia, Kemal gave the order to commanding general Kâzım Karabekir to advance into Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt; At 2:30 in the morning of September 13, five battalions from the Turkish [[XV Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XV Army Corps]] crossed the Turkish-Armenian border and surprised the thinly spread and unprepared Armenian armies at [[Olti]] and Peniak (now Penek village in [[Şenkaya]] district). By dawn, Karabekir's forces had occupied Peniak, and the Armenians had suffered at least 200 casualties and been forced to retreat east towards [[Sarıkamış]].&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 184–190.&lt;/ref&gt; As neither the Allied powers nor Soviet Russia reacted to Turkish operations, on September 20 Kemal authorized Karabekir to push onwards and take [[Kars]] and [[Kağızman]].

By this time, Karabekir's XV Corps had grown to the size of four divisions. At 3:00 in the morning of September 28, the four divisions of the XV Army Corps advanced towards Sarıkamış, creating such panic that Armenian residents had abandoned the town by the time the Turks entered the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 191–197.&lt;/ref&gt; The armed forces started toward Kars but were delayed by Armenian resistance. In early October, the Armenian government pleaded that the Allies intervene and put a halt to the Turkish advance, to no avail. Most of Britain's available forces in the Near East were concentrated on crushing the tribal uprisings in the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Iraq]], while France and Italy were also fighting the Turkish revolutionaries near Syria and Italian controlled [[Antalya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewsen-237&quot;&gt;[[Robert H.

On October 11, Soviet plenipotentiary [[Boris Legran]] arrived in [[Yerevan]] with a text to negotiate a new Soviet-Armenian agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;havan&quot;/&gt; The agreement signed at October 24 secured Soviet support.&lt;ref name=&quot;havan&quot;/&gt; The most important part of this agreement dealt with Kars, which Armenia agreed to secure.&lt;ref name=&quot;havan&quot;&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish national movement was not happy with possible agreement between the Soviets and Armenia. Karabekir was informed by the [[Government of the Grand National Assembly]] regarding the Boris Legran agreement and ordered to resolve the Kars issue. The same day the agreement between Armenia and Soviet Russia was signed, Karabekir moved his forces toward Kars.

=== Capture of Kars ===
On October 24, Karabekir's forces launched a new, massive campaign against Kars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewsen-237&quot; /&gt; The Armenians abandoned the city, which by October 30 came under full Turkish occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 253–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish forces continued to advance, and a week after the capture of Kars, they took control of Alexandropol (present-day [[Gyumri]], [[Armenia]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas&quot; /&gt; On November 12, the Turks also captured the strategic village of [[Agin (Armenia)|Agin]], northeast of the ruins of the former Armenian capital of [[Ani (Turkey)|Ani]], and planned to move toward [[Yerevan]]. On November 13, Georgia broke its neutrality. It had concluded an agreement with Armenia to invade the disputed region of [[Lori (province)|Lori]], which was established as a Neutral Zone (the Shulavera Condominium) between the two nations in early 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 222–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treaty of Alexandropol ===
[[File:Armenia December 1920.png|thumb|295px|An article from the ''[[New York Times]]'', December 10, 1920]]
The Turks, headquartered in Alexandropol, presented the Armenians with an ultimatum which they were forced to accept. They followed it with a more radical demand which threatened the existence of Armenia as a viable entity. The Armenians at first rejected this demand, but when Karabekir's forces continued to advance, they had little choice but to capitulate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewsen-237&quot; /&gt; On November 18, 1920, they concluded a cease-fire agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas&quot; /&gt; During the invasion the Turkish Army carried out mass atrocities against Armenian civilians. These include mass rape and massacres with tens of thousands of civilians executed. Atrocities occurred in [[Kars]] and [[Alexandropol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dad360-361&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia 1980&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Akçam 2007 327&quot;/&gt;

As the terms of defeat were being negotiated between Karabekir and Armenian Foreign Minister [[Alexander Khatisyan]], [[Joseph Stalin]], on the command of [[Vladimir Lenin]], ordered [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze]] to enter Armenia from [[Azerbaijan]] in order to establish a new pro-[[Bolshevik]] government in the country. On November 29, the [[Eleventh Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet Eleventh Army]] invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (present-day [[Ijevan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewsen-237&quot; /&gt;

After the capture of [[Yerevan]] and [[Echmiadzin]] by Bolshevik forces on 2 December 1920, the Armenian government signed the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on 3 December 1920, though no longer existed as a legal entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas&quot; /&gt; The treaty required Armenia to disarm most of its military forces, and cede all Ottoman territory that had been granted to Armenia by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The Armenian Parliament never ratified the treaty, as the Soviet invasion took place at the same time and the communists took over the country.

== Aftermath ==
[[File:TreatyofKarsMap.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Soviet-Turkish frontier established in the [[Treaty of Kars]].]]
In late November 1920, there was a Soviet-backed communist uprising in Armenia. On November 28, 1920, blaming Armenia for the invasions of [[Şərur]] (20 November) and [[Karabakh]] (21 November), the 11th Red Army under the command of [[Anatoli Gekker]] crossed the demarcation line between Armenia and Soviet Azerbaijan. The second Soviet-Armenian war lasted a week. Exhausted by the six years of wars and conflicts, the Armenian army and population were incapable of active resistance.

When the Red Army entered Yerevan on December 4, 1920, the government of Armenian Republic effectively surrendered. On December 5, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom, consisting mostly of Armenians from [[Azerbaijan]]) also entered the city. Finally, on December 6, the [[Cheka]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s dreaded secret police, entered Yerevan. The Soviets took control and Armenia ceased to exist as an independent state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewsen-237&quot; /&gt; Soon afterward, the communists declared the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

===Settlement===
{{Main|Treaty of Kars}}
The warfare in [[Transcaucasia]] was settled in a friendship treaty between the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (GNAT) (which proclaimed the Turkish Republic in 1923), and Soviet Russia ([[RSFSR]]). The &quot;Treaty on Friendship and Brotherhood,&quot; called the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]], was signed on March 16, 1921.  The succeeding [[Treaty of Kars]], signed by the representatives of [[Azerbaijan SSR]], [[Armenian SSR]], [[Georgian SSR]], and the GNAT, ceded [[Adjara]] to Soviet Georgia in exchange for the Kars territory (today the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Iğdır Province|Iğdır]], and [[Ardahan Province|Ardahan]]). Under the treaties, an autonomous [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Nakhchivan oblast]] was established under [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]]'s protectorate.
