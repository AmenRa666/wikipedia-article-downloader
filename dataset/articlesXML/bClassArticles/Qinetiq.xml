'''Qinetiq''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|ɪ|k}} as in ''[[kinetic energy|kinetic]]''; styled as '''QinetiQ''') is a British [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Defense contractor|defence technology company]] headquartered in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Hampshire]]. It is the world's 52nd-largest [[Defense contractor|defence contractor]] measured by 2011 defence revenues, and the sixth-largest based in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://special.defensenews.com/top-100/charts/rank_2011.php|title=Defense News Top 100 for 2011| publisher=Defense News| accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the part of the former UK government agency, [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA), privatised  in June 2001, with the remainder of DERA renamed [[Dstl]]. It has major sites at Farnborough, Hampshire, [[MoD Boscombe Down]], [[Wiltshire]], and [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], former DERA sites. It has made numerous acquisitions, primarily of United States-based companies.

It is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]].

==Name==
&quot;Qinetiq&quot; is an invented name.&lt;ref name=bbc231107&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7108248.stm|title=Qinetiq: from cold war to hard cash|publisher=BBC News| date=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Qi]]&quot; is supposed to reflect the company's energy, &quot;net&quot; its networking ability, and &quot;iq&quot; its intellectual resources.&lt;ref name=bbc231107/&gt;

==History==

===Early years===

In 2001, when defence minister [[Lewis Moonie]] announced the creation of QinetiQ, on privatisation of the [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]], he said that it would remain a British business based in the UK. The Ministry of Defence would keep a 'special share' in the company, and safeguards would be in place to prevent conflicts of interest. In February 2003, the U.S. [[private equity]] firm the [[Carlyle Group]] acquired a 33.8% share for £42m. Prior to stock market flotation, ownership was split between the MoD (56%), Carlyle Group (31%) and staff (13%). The Carlyle Group was expected to invest for three to five years, after which a stock exchange float would take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2002/sep/15/businessofresearch.arms|title=For sale to the highest bidder: Britain's secret weapons labs|author=Jamie Doward|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early expansion===
In September 2004 Qinetiq acquired the U.S. defence companies Westar Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109512515682217013|title=QinetiQ Acquires Westar Aerospace In $130 Million Deal|author=Jonathan Karp Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal|date=14 September 2004|work=WSJ|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Foster-Miller]], maker of the [[Foster-Miller TALON|Talon]] robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2004/11/08/daily21.html|title=QinetiQ caps $163M buy of Foster-Miller|work=Boston Business Journal|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004 it acquired ''HVR Consulting Services'' a leading UK-based engineering consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.dailyecho.co.uk/2004/8/11/24214.html|title=Newsquest - Home|work=dailyecho.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early August 2005, the company announced it would acquire ''Apogen Technologies, Inc.'', pending regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/196151/britains_qinetiq_to_buy_apogen/index.html Britain's QinetiQ to buy Apogen]&lt;/ref&gt; The Qinetiq website lists this merger as costing $288.0m (£162.7m). In September 2005, it acquired a 90% share of ''Verhaert Design and Development NV'' (VDD), a [[Belgium|Belgian]] space systems integrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive05/Briefs_090605.html QinetiQ agrees to buy Belgian space company]&lt;/ref&gt; In October that year, it acquired Broadreach Networks Limited, a supplier of [[Wi-Fi]] internet to the European rail industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.eu/uk/172300114;jsessionid=TNBJKGMVT3JEWQSNDLRSKHSCJUNN2JVN|title=Electronic Engineering Times  Europe : Industry News, Learning center, electronic design center  - Electronics Eetimes|work=eetimes.eu|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2006 it bought Graphics Research Corporation Ltd, developer of the Paramarine software suite of ship and submarine design tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/293667/QinetiQ+buys+software+company.htm QinetiQ buys software company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock exchange listing===

The flotation of the company has been dogged with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article338291.ece|title=The Independent - 404|work=The Independent|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.co.uk/articles/articledisplay.jsp?article_id=4385908&amp;section=ShareDealing|title=News|work=Interactive Investor|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,1686487,00.html|title=Frank Kane: Qinetiq arrogance has sunk this flotation to new depths|author=Frank Kane|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4653722.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - Reid defends Qinetiq's sale price|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ennobled in 2005, [[Lewis Moonie|Lord Moonie]], who handled the initial sale, said in 2006 that the government's 31 per cent stake should not have been sold when equity markets were languishing in 2002. He said that he had argued for the sale to be delayed but was overruled by the Treasury, which had convinced the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] to go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ft.com/ftArticle?sortBy=gadatearticle&amp;queryText=qinetiq+controversy&amp;page=2&amp;y=0&amp;aje=false&amp;x=0&amp;id=060113000988&amp;ct=0|title=FT.com / Search|work=ft.com|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qinetiq was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in February 2006. The company had been valued at between £1.1bn and £1.3bn, with the MoD holding estimated to be worth £616m – £728m, the Carlyle Group's holding £341m – £403m, and staff/management's holding worth £143m – £169m. Controversy was generated by the very large returns for the [[Carlyle Group]] and senior managers, with figures of over £20m suggested in the media for [[Sir John Chisholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/jan/29/arms.theobserver A swift killing in the defence sector] The Oberserver, 29 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial press speculation concerning a stock exchange float increased in January 2006. On 12 January 2006 an announcement was made in parliament by [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|Dr John Reid]], Secretary of State for Defence. He said that the Carlyle Group 'will continue to retain a significant stake in the company', and that the government would continue to hold a '[[Golden Share]]' to protect the UK's security and defence interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060112/wmstext/60112m01.htm QinetiQ Shareholder Team] Hansard, 12 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy also arose around the fact that retail investors were excluded from the [[initial public offering]] (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for [[British Gas plc]] in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some [[brokerage firm]]s to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an [[institutional investor]] but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/23fb0f1e-9a06-11da-8b63-0000779e2340.html#axzz2OwvwsCKJ ''Qinetiq IPO raises £290m''] • ''Financial Times'', 10 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation that a consortium including Qinetiq was about to win a £10bn MoD training contract helped push their share price back above 190p in early November 2006. It was announced on 17 January 2007 that the Qinetiq-led [[Metrix UK|Metrix consortium]] was the preferred bidder for package one of the MoD's Defence Training Rationalisation programme, worth approx £16bn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nds.coi.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=257220&amp;NewsAreaID=2 South Wales home for defence training hub]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAO inquiry===
In 2007, the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] conducted an inquiry into the privatisation to determine whether UK taxpayers got good value for money. The inquiry looked at the following issues:
* choice of privatisation strategy;
* management of the process (the split of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency into two, the sale to Carlyle and the flotation);
* costs incurred and the proceeds achieved; and
* whether the deal met its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/report/the-privatisation-of-qinetiq/|title=The privatisation of QinetiQ|work=National Audit Office|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2007, the NAO reported that taxpayers could have gained &quot;tens of millions&quot; more and was critical of the incentive scheme given to Qinetiq managers, the 10 most senior of whom gained £107.5m on an investment of £540,000 in the company's shares. The return of 19,990% was described as &quot;excessive&quot; by the NAO. The role of Qinetiq's management in negotiating terms with the [[Carlyle Group]] while the private equity company was bidding for the business was also criticised by the NAO. Carlyle bought a third of the business for £42m, which grew in value to £372m in less than four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7108444.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - Qinetiq deal 'cost UK taxpayers'|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] defended the sale:
:&quot;It has delivered excellent value for money, generating more than £800m for the taxpayer, while protecting UK defence and security interests,&quot; said [[Ann Taylor, Baroness Taylor of Bolton|Baroness Taylor]], Minister for Defence Equipment and Support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7108444.stm Qinetiq deal 'cost UK taxpayers'], BBC, 23 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===

In January 2007 the company bought Analex, a [[United States|U.S.]] corporation providing high technology professional services and solutions, principally to the [[United States Government|US government]] and its agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/qinetiq-buys-analex-corp-extends-us-footprint-02974/|title=QinetiQ Buys Analex Corp., Extends US Footprint|publisher=Defense Industry Daily|date=22 January 2007|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated in 1964 under the name Biorad and evolved into Hadron, a U.S. government systems consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February 2007, the Carlyle Group sold its remaining 10.3% stake at 205p per share, giving it a £290m return on its original investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/industrials/article1357830.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007 the acquisition of ITS Corporation, a provider of [[Information Technology|IT]] services to the [[United States|US]] government and its agencies, was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSWLB575320070301|title=QinetiQ says to buy ITS Corp for up to $90 million|work=Reuters|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disposal of Aerospace Filtration Systems (formerly part of Westar) was announced at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastbay.bizjournals.com/eastbay/othercities/stlouis/stories/2007/03/05/story6.html?b=1173070800%5E1425072|title=Westar sells filtration unit to Donaldson for $39 million|work=St. Louis Business Journal|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Qinetiq announced that its US subsidiary Apogen Technologies Inc. had completed the acquisition of 3H Technology LLC, a specialist IT company with US government and commercial clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontechnology.com/online/1_1/30942-1.html Apogen buys 3H Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the company completed the acquisition of [[Boldon James|Boldon James Holdings Limited]], a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based provider of software solutions for high end secure messaging, primarily for military, government and security customers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/25/qinetiq_buys_boldon_james_mi5_secure_messaging/|title=QinetiQ buys spooks' secure-messaging provider|work=theregister.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 Qinetiq spun off a new company, [[Omni-ID|Omni-ID, Ltd]], for commercialising passive UHF radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfid-ready.com/20080211170/asset-tracking/omni-id-launches-breakthrough-rfid-technology-solution-for-asset-tracking-a.-supply-chain-management.html Omni-ID Launches Breakthrough Solution for Asset Tracking and Supply Chain Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MoD sold its remaining 18.9% holding in September 2008 at 206p per share, raising £254m. The government retained its 'special share', giving it control over any potential takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/4676372/Taxpayers-net-254m-from-final-QinetiQ-sale.html|title=Taxpayers net £254m from final QinetiQ sale|author=Russell Hotten, Industry Editor|date=10 September 2008|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyber security ===

[[China|Chinese]] hackers are understood to have compromised research at QinetiQ in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-05-01/china-cyberspies-outwitting-u-dot-s-dot-stealing-vital-military-secrets |title=China Cyberspies Outwit U.S. Stealing Military Secrets |last1=Riley |first1=Michael |last2=Elgin |first2=Ben |date=1 May 2013 |work=Business Week |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pentagon still entrusts QinetiQ with sensitive defense technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/blog/2013/05/20130510-company-hit-by-chinese-hackers-still-a-trusted-fed-supplier.html|title=Company Hit By Chinese Hackers Still a Trusted Fed Supplier|work=Project On Government Oversight|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that between 2007 and 2010, QinetiQ’s North American business was the subject of a [[cyber-attack]]. At the time of the incidents, the company said it disclosed all of its breaches to the responsible government agencies and these were resolved to their satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elgin |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-07/pentagon-retracts-statement-on-probe-of-qinetiq-hacking.html |title=Pentagon Retracts Statement on Probe of QinetiQ Hacking |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber security continues to be an issue with a recent Pentagon report saying that government agencies had been victims of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Marcus |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-22430224 |title=BBC News - US accuses China government and military of cyber-spying |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
