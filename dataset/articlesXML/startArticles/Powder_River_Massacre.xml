The '''Powder River Massacre''', part of the [[Powder River Expedition]], occurred on August 16, 1865, and was carried out by United States soldiers and Pawnee scouts against 24 [[Cheyenne]] people. The incident occurred near the [[Powder River (Montana)|Powder River]] in [[Dakota Territory]], in present-day [[Johnson County, Wyoming]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/research/manuscripts/family/northfrank.htm ''Frank Joshua North, 1840-1885''], Nebraska State Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

== The massacre ==
In August, 1865, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Frank North]], along with about 45 of his [[Pawnee Scouts]] and several other soldiers were keeping up a vigilant search for &quot;Hostile Indians&quot; in Dakota Territory. For two days, the group trailed a band of Cheyenne who were heading north. The trail showed that the Cheyenne had about 35-40 horses and mules, along with one [[travois]]. At 2:00 a.m. on August 16, the Captain and his Scouts caught up with the group on the Powder River, about 60 miles north of [[Fort Reno (Wyoming)|Fort Connor]]. The small group of 24 Cheyennes had made their camp for the night, and were asleep. North decided to wait until dawn to attack. In the morning, Captain North's party closed on the camp. Spotting the scouts, the [[Cheyenne]] thought the approaching Indians were not Pawnee but friendly Cheyenne, and made no hostile moves. However, the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] suddenly charged in on the [[Cheyenne]], surprising them and killing all 24, including Yellow Woman, who was the stepmother of [[George Bent]]. In the fighting, North's scouts lost 4 horses killed, but captured two stolen government saddles, a quantity of women's and children's clothing, two U.S. Infantry coats issued by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Thomas Moonlight to the Indians in the spring of 1865, 18 horses, and 17 mules, making a total of 35 animals. Four of these animals had U.S. government brands showing they had recently been captured in the Battles of Red Buttes and [[Battle of Platte Bridge Station|Platte Bridge Station]] that had both occurred on July 26, 1865 near present-day [[Casper, Wyoming]]. One captured horse also belonged to the [[Overland Trail|Overland Stage company]].

== Aftermath ==
There is no Cheyenne narrative history for the massacre because every Cheyenne present was killed by Captain North's men. In his 1915 book, The Fighting Cheyennes, [[George Bird Grinnell]] remarked that &quot;The Southern Cheyennes do not appear to know of any fight in which twenty-four or twenty-seven Cheyennes were killed. It seems, probable, therefore, that this whole party of twenty-four was killed and that the Southern Cheyenne knew nothing of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grinnell|first1=George Bird|title=The Fighting Cheyennes|date=1915|publisher=Norman and London University of Oklahoma Press|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the skirmish, Brigadier General [[Patrick E. Connor]] issued an official report on the action dated August 19, 1865. It read as follows:
&lt;small&gt;{{quotation|Headquarters, Powder River, August 19th, 1865. 
Major-General G. M. Dodge:

A detachment of my Pawnee scouts on the 16th inst. discovered and pursued a party of 24 Cheyennes returning from the mail road with scalps and plunder. They overtook them about sixty miles northeast of here on Powder River, and after a short en-gagement killed the whole party. Loss on our side, 4 horses killed. We captured 29 animals, among which were 4 Government and one overland stage line horse, besides two Government saddles and a quantity of women's and children clothing, and two of the infantry coats issued by Col. Moonlight last Spring to the Indians, who subsequently killed Capt. Fouts and four soldiers of the Seventh Iowa.|[[Patrick E. Connor|P. Edw. Connor]], 
''Brigadier-General''.}}&lt;/small&gt;
