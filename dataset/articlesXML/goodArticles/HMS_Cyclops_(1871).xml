'''HMS ''Cyclops''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass|Cyclops|monitor|0}} [[breastwork monitor]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the 1870s. The ships were ordered to satisfy demands for local defence during the war scare of 1870, but the pace of construction slowed down tremendously as the perceived threat of war declined. The ship spent most of her career in [[Wikt:mothball|reserve]]; her only sustained period in commission was four months in [[Portland Harbour]], during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1878 when the British were trying to force the Russians to end the war without allowing them to seize [[Constantinople]]. ''Cyclops'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1903.

==Design and description== 
The ''Cyclops''-class ships were modified versions of the ''Cerberus'' class.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;Parkes, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The ships had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|225|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|45|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|16|ft|3|in|m}} at [[deep load]]. They displaced {{convert|3480|LT|t}}. Their crew consisted of 156 officers and men.&lt;ref name=p8&gt;Parkes, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The ships had two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Compound|inverted compound steam engines]], each driving a single [[propeller shaft]]. The engines produced a total of {{convert|1528|ihp|lk=in}} on 30 December 1871 during the ship's [[sea trial]]s which gave her a maximum speed of {{convert|10.79|kn|lk=in}}. ''Cyclops'' carried {{convert|250|LT|t}} of coal,&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 246–49&lt;/ref&gt; enough to steam {{convert|3000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships mounted four [[RML 10 inch 18 ton gun|10-inch]] [[rifled muzzle loader|rifled muzzle-loading guns]] in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. The guns could fire both [[Round shot|solid shot]] and [[Shell (projectile)|explosive shells]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; They were mounted on carriages that used [[Jack (device)|hydraulic jacks]] to elevate and depress the guns.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Cyclops'' class had a complete waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|8|in|mm|0}} thick amidships and thinned to {{convert|6|in|mm|0}} at the ends. The superstructure and [[conning tower]] was fully armoured, the reason it was called a [[breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]], with {{convert|8|-|9|in|mm|0}} of wrought iron. The [[gun turret]]s had 10&amp;nbsp;inches on their faces and 9&amp;nbsp;inches on the sides and rear. All of the vertical armour was backed by {{convert|9|-|11|in|0}} of [[teak]]. The [[Deck (ship)|decks]] were {{convert|1.5|in|1}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, pp. 213–14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
HMS ''Cyclops'' was laid down on 10 September 1870 by the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] in [[London]]. She was launched on 18 July 1871 and commissioned in January 1872. The ship was towed to [[HMNB Devonport|Devenport]] that same month for what proved to be a very lengthy [[fitting out]] period that was not completed until 4 May 1877.&lt;ref name=p15&gt;Parkes, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cyclops'' cost £156,782 to build.&lt;ref name=p8/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Adjusted for inflation, the ship cost £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|156782|1887}}}} in current pounds.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refit===
Although a recommendation had been made while the ships were still under construction to extend the superstructure out to the sides of the ship to improve their stability and habitability, this was not acted upon until they were refitted during the 1880s. This refit also strengthened the breastwork and upper decks, added another watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] as well as a [[false keel]]. Four [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder Hotchkiss guns]] were added on the breastwork for [[torpedo boat]] defence as well as five [[machine gun]]s and several searchlights.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, pp. 212, 214&lt;/ref&gt; This increased their crew to approximately 191 men&lt;ref name=p8/&gt; and added {{convert|80|LT|t}} to their displacement.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
HMS ''Cyclops'' was the third ship to be completed, although she was the [[lead ship]] of the [[ship class|class]]. She was placed in 1st Class [[Wikt:mothball|Reserve]] after her completion. The ship, along with her [[sister ship|sisters]], was commissioned between April and August 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War for service with [[Admiral]] Sir [[Astley Cooper Key|Cooper Key]]'s Particular Service Squadron in Portland Harbour. ''Cyclops'' was paid off at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] in August 1878 and refitted in 1887–89. All four ships of the class participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers in 1887, 1889–90 and 1892; in between times they were in Fleet Reserve. HMS ''Cyclops'', like all of her sisters, was placed on the non-effective list in January 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=6 January 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36657| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p15/&gt; transferred to the E Division of the Dockyard Reserve at [[Sheerness]] in May 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=19 May 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36771| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold on 7 July 1903&lt;ref&gt;Silverstone, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; for £8,400.&lt;ref name=p15/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Adjusted for inflation, the ship sold for {{formatnum:£{{Inflation|UK|8400|1903}}}} in current pounds.&lt;/ref&gt;
