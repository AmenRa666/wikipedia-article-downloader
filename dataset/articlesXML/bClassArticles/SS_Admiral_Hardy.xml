''Michael Ferdinand'' was built at a cost of approximately [[Reichsmark|ℛℳ1,700,000]] by [[Stettiner Oderwerke]], [[Stettin]], Germany. She was launched on 26 May 1944 and completed in July 1944. She was built for Hugo Ferdinand Dampschiffs Reederei, [[Rostock]].&lt;ref name=Hansa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skipet/&gt;

Following her participation in the [[Flight and evacuation of German civilians during the end of World War II|evacuation of east Germany]] at the end of [[World War II]], ''Michael Ferdinand'' was at [[Sønderborg]], Denmark in May 1945.&lt;ref name=Skipet/&gt; She was seized by the Allies as a [[prize (law)|war prize]],&lt;ref name=Times051146&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=PRIZE COURTS |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=5 November 1946 |page_number=1 |issue=50600 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; passed to the MOWT and renamed ''Empire Farrar''.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; She was placed under the management of the Indo-China Steam Navigation Co Ltd. The United Kingdom Official Number 180644 and [[Code Letters]] GDQG were allocated. Her port of registry was [[London]].&lt;ref name=Farrar45/&gt; In 1947, management passed to the Stratton Steamship Co Ltd.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt;

In 1949, ''Empire Farrar'' was sold to the Stanley Steamship Co Ltd, [[Hong Kong]] and was named ''Admiral Hardy''.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; On 29 July 1953, ''Admiral Hardy'' was fired on by a [[Chinese Navy]] warship whilst leaving [[Foochow]]. She was subsequently boarded by a party from the ship.&lt;ref name=Times300753&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=BRITISH SHIP FIRED ON AND BOARDED |day_of_week=Thursday |date=30 July 1955 |page_number=6 |issue=52687 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her cargo of timber was seized by [[Chinese Nationalist]]s.&lt;ref name=Times050853&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=BRITISH SHIP RELEASED |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=5 August 1953 |page_number=5 |issue=52692 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, her captain fell overboard and was drowned whilst the ship was off [[Wenchow]], [[China]] during a voyage from Foochow to [[Tsingtao]], China.&lt;ref name=Times011053&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=(untitled) |day_of_week=Thursday |date=1 October 1953 |page_number=5 |issue=52741 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October, she was stopped in the [[Straits of Formosa]] by an unidentified [[gunboat]] but was allowed to continue her voyage.&lt;ref name=Times091053&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=BRITISH SHIP STOPPED |day_of_week=Friday |date=9 October 1953 |page_number=8 |issue=52748 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 13, 1954, four Chinese crew members were detained and interrogated by police whilst the ship was at [[Shanghai]] over a missing Chinese crew member. Her captain was told by the [[Chinese police]] that as captain of the ship he was held responsible for the death of the crew member. He considered this as intimidation by the Chinese authorities. He and his four officers resigned their posts upon the ship returning to [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref name=Times091254&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=CREW 'INTIMIDATED' BY COMMUNISTS |day_of_week=Thursday |date=9 December 1954 |page_number=6 |issue=53110 |column=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1955, ''Admiral Hardy'' was sold to Sig S Årstads Rederi, [[Bergen]], Norway for [[Pound Sterling|£115,000]]. She was placed under the management of Victor Müller Rederi AS. The Code Letters LAJQ were allocated. On 9 August 1964, ''Admiral Hardy'' ran aground on Arena Island ({{coord|9|14|00|N|12|0|45|E}}) whilst on a voyage from [[North Borneo]] to [[Shanghai]], China. She had been refloated by 15 August.&lt;ref name=Skipet/&gt;
