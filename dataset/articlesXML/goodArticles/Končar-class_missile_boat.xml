The '''''Končar''-class''' is a class of six [[missile boat]]s built for the [[Yugoslav Navy]] during the late 1970s at [[Kraljevica Shipyard|Tito's Shipyard Kraljevica]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]. The boats featured a mixture of Western and Eastern equipment, including Soviet anti-ship missiles and [[Sweden|Swedish]] guns.

During the [[Croatian War of Independence]] one ship, ''Vlado Ćetković'', was captured by Croatian forces while being overhauled. It was eventually commissioned with the [[Croatian Navy]] as ''Šibenik'' and is still in use. The remaining five ships were relocated to Montenegro, entering service with the new FR Yugoslav Navy, with three of them being decommissioned in the early 2000s. The last two ships of the class are planned to be modified as patrol boats for service with the [[Montenegrin Navy]].

== Description ==
The ''Končar'' class was developed by the Brodarski institut (BI) from Zagreb. The six-strong class was built at the Tito's Kraljevica Shipyard from 1977 to 1979 with all six ships being named after [[Order of the People's Hero|People's Heroes of Yugoslavia]]. The ships measure {{convert|44.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in length, with a {{convert|8.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} beam and {{convert|2.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} draught. The hull, similar to the Swedish [[Spica-class torpedo boat|''Spica'' class]], is made of steel with an aluminium superstructure. Fully loaded they displace {{convert|271|t|LT|lk=in|abbr=on}} and are manned by a crew of 30.{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=652}}{{sfn|Shipyard Kraljevica – List of delivered vessels 1946. – 2007.}}

The class utilizes a [[CODAG]] engine configuration for propulsion. Mounted on four shafts, two MTU 16V 538 TB91 [[diesel engine]]s are used for economical cruising while two [[Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations|RR Marine]] Proteus 52 M [[gas turbine]]s are used for achieving high speeds. Cruising speed is {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}} while the maximum achievable speed is {{convert|38|-|40|kn}}. Travelling at a near maximum speed of 38 knots, the ships have a maximum range of {{convert|380|-|490|nmi|lk=in}}. Powered by diesel engines only and travelling at a speed of {{convert|22|-|23|kn}} they have a range of {{convert|780|-|870|nmi}}, with exact numbers varying from source to source.{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=652}}{{sfn|Brodovi Flote HRM u vježbi &quot;Phiblex&quot;}}{{sfn|Flotila HRM}} Endurance is between five and seven days.{{sfn|Brodovi Flote HRM u vježbi &quot;Phiblex&quot;}}{{sfn|Wertheim|2007|p=146}}

Gun armament of the class consists of two [[Bofors 57 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on|in}}/70 Mk1 gun]] mounted on the bow and towards the stern. During the development phase, the designers planned on using French [[Exocet]] anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for the missile, possibly because of political reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet [[P-15 Termit|P-20]] (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] launchers.{{sfn|Jelavić|2003}}{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=652}}

== Service ==

=== Yugoslav Navy service ===
[[File:RTOP-21 krma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aft section of ''Šibenik''. Two RBS-15 launchers and the AK-630 CIWS are visible.]]
During the late 1980s and early 1990s ''Rade Končar'' and ''Vlado Ćetković'' underwent a modernization program which included removing the stern 57&amp;nbsp;mm Bofors and installing a Soviet [[AK-630]] [[CIWS]]. At the start of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], ''Vlado Ćetković'' was captured by Croatian forces in [[Šibenik]] while being overhauled. It was commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 28 September 1991 as ''Šibenik'' (RTOP-21). Sometime between 1991 and 1994 ''Šibenik'' underwent a refit that included removing the P-20 launchers and installing two mounts for up to four Swedish built [[RBS-15]] anti-ship missiles. As of 2014 ''Šibenik'' is in active service with the Croatian Navy.{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=652}}{{sfn|Šoštarić|7 August 2008}}{{sfn|Wertheim|2007|p=146}}

The rest of the class remained in hands of the Yugoslav Navy. On 6 October, ''Hasan Zahirović-Laca'' along with the [[Koni-class frigate|''Koni''-class]] frigate ''Koper'' (VPBR-32) took part in the [[Battle of Zadar]]. Croatian coastal batteries in the area operated two captured [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on|in}}]] guns with only one of them being in position to open fire on the ships. The initial five to six rounds fired at ''Hasan Zahirović-Laca'' missed their target, after which the gun malfunctioned. After a quick repair, the missile boat was targeted again, with three rounds hitting the stern section and causing no damage because the gun crew didn't have [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing ammunition]] at their disposal.{{sfn|Klarica|5 October 2010}} Two ''Končar''-class missile boats also took part in the [[Battle of the Dalmatian Channels]]. ''Jordan Nikolov-Orce'', operating under the codename &quot;Parak&quot;, and ''Ante Banina'', under the codename &quot;Pakra&quot;, were members of the tactical group &quot;Vis&quot; which was tasked with enforcing a naval blocade of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and the surrounding islands.{{sfn|Bernadić|2013}} With the Yugoslav Peoples Army endings its [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|campaign in Croatia]], all ships of the class, excluding ''Vlado Ćetković'', were relocated to Montenegro where they were commissioned with the new FR Yugoslav Navy of [[Serbia and Montenegro]].{{sfn|Šoštarić|7 August 2008}}

Three boats of the class took part in the [[Operation_Sharp_Guard#Lido_II_incident|Lido II incident]].

=== Post-war service ===
[[File:RTOP-21, 12 i 11.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Šibenik'' (left) photographed in the Lora Naval Base alongside two [[Kralj-class missile boat|''Kralj''-class]] missile boats, [[Croatian missile boat Kralj Dmitar Zvonimir (RTOP-12)|''Kralj Dmitar Zvonimir'' (RTOP-12)]] (center) and [[Croatian missile boat Kralj Petar Krešimir IV (RTOP-11)|''Kralj Petar Krešimir IV'' (RTOP-11)]] (right)]]
During the mid 1990s, ''Ramiz Sadiku'' was docked for a major overhaul and reconstruction. However, due to the lack of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap.{{sfn|Šoštarić|7 August 2008}}{{sfn|Luković|17 November 2014}} The boat's [[superstructure]], propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the [[Luštica]] peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.{{sfn|Luković|11 December 2014}}

In June 2006, ''Hasan Zahirović-Laca'' sailed from Boka Kotorska to [[Italy]] to participate in the international naval exercise &quot;Adrion Livex 06&quot;. The boat left port under the flag of the Navy of Serbia and Montenegro, but because Montenegro declared its independence on 6 June while the boat was still out on exercise, ''Hasan Zahirović-Laca'' became the first ship outside of Montenegrin waters to display the flag of the new country.{{sfn|Luković|17 November 2014}} The boat was decommissioned later that year, along with the first boat of the class, ''Rade Končar''.{{sfn|Šoštarić|7 August 2008}} The latter was sold to [[Kenya]] in 2014 for an undisclosed price. The [[Kenyan Navy]] plans on stripping the boat of its guns and fire-control systems which would then be overhauled and installed on the offshore patrol vessel KNS ''Jasiri''. ''Rade Končar'' itself is then expected to be rebuilt and used by the Navy as a patrol boat. The fate of ''Hasan Zahirović-Laca'' remains unknown.{{sfn|Luković|17 November 2014}}
[[File:Rtop 405.jpg|thumb|right|250px|RTOP-405 in service with the Montenegrin Navy photographed in 2015.]]
In 2013, the [[Ministry of Defense (Montenegro)|Ministry of Defense]] of Montenegro issued the ''Strategic Overview of the Defense of Montenegro'' (''Strategijski pregled odbrane Crne Gore'') in which it was stated that until sufficient funds to acquire new patrol boats were made available, the [[Montenegrin Navy]] would modify two ''Končar''-class missile boats, RTOP-405 and RTOP-406, for use as patrol boats.{{sfn|Strategijski pregled odbrane Crne Gore}} In February 2014 it was revealed that the Montenegrin Ministry of Defense chose the Brodarski institut from Zagreb to create the project documentation for the modification of the missile boats. As planned, the boats would be stripped of their missile launchers and the aft Bofors gun to allow a [[rigid-hulled inflatable boat]]{{sfn|Krnić|14 February 2014}} to be carried.
