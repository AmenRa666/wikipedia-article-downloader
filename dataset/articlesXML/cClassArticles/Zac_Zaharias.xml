==Everest==

Zaharias became the second [[Australian Army]] representative and the oldest Australian to summit Everest on his third attempt in 2010.&lt;ref name=DefenceNews&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His first attempt was in 1988 as part of the Australian Bicentennial expedition. Zaharias got to within 300m of the Summit. RAAF Sergeant Brian Laursen and Paul Bain made it to the top. His second attempt was in 2001 when he was the leader of the Army Alpine Association team. In that attempt Lieutenant-Colonel Pat Cullinan made the summit on 25 May 2010. Major Zaharias got to within 100m from the summit.&lt;ref name=DefenceNews&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NMA2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defence Newspaper said that &quot;It was third time lucky for Major Zac Zaharias when he eventually made it to the top of the world – conquering Mount Everest – after falling agonisingly short on two earlier attempts. When he got there, though, there was no hooting and hollering, no singing, no dancing – just relief and a deep sense of accomplishment, and a brief moment to take in the breath-taking view before focusing on a safe descent.&quot;&lt;ref name=DefenceNews&gt;{{cite news
