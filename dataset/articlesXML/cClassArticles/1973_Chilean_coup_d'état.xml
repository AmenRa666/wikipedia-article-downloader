The '''1973 Chilean coup d'état''' was a watershed event in both the [[history of Chile]] and the [[Cold War]]. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the right-dominated  [[Congress of Chile]] and the elected [[Socialist Party (Chile)|socialist]] [[President of Chile|President]] [[Salvador Allende]], as well as [[economic warfare]] ordered by [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Richard Nixon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8i.htm|title=Chile and the United States: Declassified Documents Relating to the Military Coup, September 11, 1973|author=Peter Kornbluh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1211/p00s01-woam.html &quot;Controversial legacy of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet ...Gen.

His had been the first democratically elected Marxist government in Latin America...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The military deposed Allende's [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] government and later established a ''junta'' that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially the communist and socialist parties and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] (MIR). Allende's appointed army chief, [[Augusto Pinochet]], rose to supreme power within a year of the coup, formally assuming power in late 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7F8VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=general+leigh+pinochet |title=Genaro Arriagada Herrera, '&amp;#39;Pinochet: The Politics of Power'&amp;#39; |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=19 November 2011|isbn=9780044970613 |date=1988-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] government, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup,&lt;ref name=&quot;Winn 2010 239–275&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Winn|first=Peter|editor-first=Greg &amp; Gilbert|editor-last=Grandin &amp; Joseph|editor-link=|encyclopedia=|title=A Century of Revolution|language=|edition=|date=|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=|location=|isbn=|pages=239–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; promptly recognized the ''junta'' government and supported it in consolidating power.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSA-2000-9-19&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Kornbluh|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20000919/|title=CIA Acknowledges Ties to Pinochet's Repression: Report to Congress Reveals U.S. Accountability in Chile|work=Chile Documentation Project|publisher=National Security Archive|date=19 September 2000|access-date=26 November 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061128142216/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20000919/| archivedate= 28 November 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the coup, Chile had for decades been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability while the rest of [[South America]] had been plagued by military juntas and [[Caudillismo]]. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|last=Weimer|first=Tim|publisher=Doubleday|year=2007|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Peter Winn]] characterized the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in Chile's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winn 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Winn|first=Peter|authorlink=|editor-first=Greg &amp; Gilbert|editor-last=Grandin &amp; Joseph|editor-link=|encyclopedia=A Century of Revolution|title=Furies of the Andes|url=http://read.dukeupress.edu/content/a-century-of-revolution|accessdate=17 September 2015|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=|doi=|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YJ7ZBGy0wsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=a%20century%20of%20revolution&amp;pg=PA259#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 259]|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weak insurgent movement against the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet regime]] was maintained inside Chile by elements sympathetic to the former Allende government.

==Political background==
{{History of Chile}}
{{Main article|Presidency of Salvador Allende}}
Allende contested the [[1970 Chilean presidential election]] with [[Jorge Alessandri|Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez]] of the National Party and [[Radomiro Tomic]] of the Christian Democratic Party. Allende received 36.6% of the vote. Alessandri was a very close second with 35.3%, and Tomic third with 28.1%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=El Partido Socialista de Chile Tomo II|work=Julio César Jobet|language=Spanish|url=http://es.geocities.com/omerocl/partidosoc2.pdf|page=120|accessdate=2009-06-05|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://es.geocities.com/omerocl/partidosoc2.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-25+03:25:06|archivedate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Allende received the highest number of votes, according to the Chilean constitution and since none of the candidates won by an absolute majority, the National Congress had to decide among the candidates.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II'', p259 ISBN 978-0-19-928358-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean constitution did not allow a person to sit as president for two consecutive terms so the incumbent president, [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], was thus ineligible as a candidate. The [[CIA]]'s &quot;Track I&quot; operation was a plan to influence the Congress to choose Alessandri, who would resign after a short time in office, forcing a second election. Frei would then be eligible to run.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/chile/index.html|title=CIA Activities in Chile|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|quote=The political action program under consideration called for the Embassy and Station to influence the Chilean Congress as it took up the matter. This involved encouraging Congress to vote for Alessandri for President in spite of the fact Allende received a slightly higher popular vote. (Allende won 36.3 percent of the vote on 4 September—a plurality, not the majority required by the Constitution to avoid Congressional reaffirmation of the victory.) The Station and the Embassy, working through intermediaries, urged Frei to use his influence with Congress to convince non-leftist forces to vote for Alessandri. The scenario was to have Congress elect Alessandri as President; he would then resign, thereby allowing Frei to run as a candidate against Allende in a new election.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandri announced on 9 September that if Congress chose him, he would resign. Congress then decided on Allende. Soon after hearing news of his win, Allende signed a Statute of Constitutional Guarantees, which stated that he would follow the constitution during his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Régis Debray |title=The Chilean Revolution: Conversations with Allende |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. feared the example of a &quot;a well-functioning socialist experiment&quot; on the region and exerted diplomatic, economic, and covert pressure upon Chile's elected socialist government.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ie/books?id=fRdTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=us+fear+allende+example&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gdfk3DAy2X&amp;sig=YjBjspxjaE0VwutioDyQaaFJrb0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4667ypsnPAhVJUBQKHYsNCjcQ6AEINjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20fear%20allende%20example&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://santiagotimes.cl/2014/05/26/new-declassified-files-shed-light-us-role-ousting-allende/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA_website&gt;Kristian C.

In 1972, economics minister [[Pedro Vuskovic]] adopted [[monetary]] policies that increased the amount of circulating currency and devalued the [[Chilean escudo|escudo]], which increased inflation to 140 percent in 1972 and engendered a [[black market]] economy.&lt;ref name=Tercera_Problemas&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.latercera.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840537,00.html |title=Comienzan los problemas |dead-url=yes }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, part of series &quot;Icarito &gt; Enciclopedia Virtual &gt; Historia &gt; Historia de Chile &gt; Del gobierno militar a la democracia&quot; on LaTercera.cl.

In October 1972, Chile suffered the first of many strikes. Among the participants were small-scale businessmen, some professional unions, and student groups. Its leaders – Vilarín, [[Jaime Guzmán]], Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton, Eduardo Arriagada – expected to depose the elected government. Other than damaging the national economy, the principal effect of the 24-day strike was drawing Army head, Gen. [[Carlos Prats]], into the government as Interior Minister, an appeasement to the right wing.&lt;ref name=Tercera_Problemas/&gt; (Gen. Prats had succeeded Army head Gen. [[René Schneider]] after his assassination on 24 October 1970 by a group led by Gen. [[Roberto Viaux]], whom the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] had not attempted to discourage.) Gen. Prats supported the legalist [[Schneider Doctrine]] and refused military involvement in a ''coup d'état'' against President Allende.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/05/22/mun6.html |title=mun6 |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the declining economy, President Allende's [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition increased its vote to 43.2% in the March 1973 parliamentary elections; but, by then, the informal alliance between Popular Unity and the Christian Democrats ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830–1973], United States [[Library of Congress Country Studies]]: Chile.

The success and influence of the [[Cuban Revolution]] not only worried the United States and its allies, but inspired leftist movements in many Latin American countries, particularly in Chile. Chilean socialists identified with the Cuban experience on multiple levels, including culture, geography, history, and economically. The future president Salvador Allende, while serving as a senator for the Chilean Socialist Party, visited post-revolution [[Cuba]] and was awestruck.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Following his inauguration, Allende renewed Chile's relationship with Cuba. Allende nationalised three private manufacturing companies, including two US-owned companies, turning them over to government control. At this time, citizens feared the viability of their financial institutions and began heavily withdrawing savings, creating a [[Bank run|run on the banks]]. In order to strengthen the Chilean economy, Allende guaranteed bank deposits.

Allende began to fear his opponents, convinced they were plotting his assassination. Using his daughter as a messenger, he explained the situation to [[Fidel Castro]]. Castro gave four pieces of advice: convince technicians to stay in Chile, only sell copper for US dollars, avoid extreme revolutionary acts which would give opponents an excuse to wreck or control the economy, and maintain a proper relationship with the Chilean military until local militias could be established and consolidated. Allende attempted to follow Castro's advice, but the latter two recommendations proved difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Jerome R.|title=Liberators, patriots, and leaders of Latin America 32 biographies|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=9780786455522|pages=213–214|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 1973, Colonel [[Roberto Souper]] surrounded the La Moneda presidential palace with his tank regiment and failed to depose the Allende Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literature.rebelyouth.ca/educhile_1970s/tanquetazo.html |title=Second coup attempt: ''El Tanquetazo'' (the tank attack) |accessdate=2004-10-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013002715/http://literature.rebelyouth.ca/educhile_1970s/tanquetazo.html |archivedate=13 October 2004 |df=dmy }}, originally on RebelYouth.ca.

In August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred; the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]] publicly complained about the government's inability to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats united with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Se desata la crisis&quot;/&gt;

For months, the government had feared calling upon the ''[[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]]'' national police, suspecting them of disloyalty. On 9 August, Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. He was forced to resign both as defence minister and as the Army commander-in-chief on 24 August 1973, embarrassed by the [[Alejandrina Cox incident]] and a public protest of the wives of his generals at his house. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Se desata la crisis&quot;/&gt; In late August 1973, 100,000{{disputed inline|date=September 2013}} Chilean women congregated at Plaza de la Constitución to protest against the government for the rising cost and increasing shortages of food and fuels, but they were dispersed with tear gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dream&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/C%20Disk/CIA%20Chile/Item%20030.pdf |title=The Bloody End of a Marxist Dream|work=Time |date=24 September 1973 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court's resolution===
On 26 May 1973, Chile’s Supreme Court unanimously denounced the Allende régime’s ''disruption of the legality of the nation'' in its failure to uphold judicial decisions.

On 22 August 1973, with the support of the Christian Democrats and National Party members, the Chamber of Deputies passed 81–47 a resolution that asked &quot;the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;el Presidente de la República y a los señores Ministros de Estado y miembros de las Fuerzas Armadas y del Cuerpo de Carabineros&quot; [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Acuerdo_de_la_C%C3%A1mara_de_Diputados_sobre_el_grave_quebrantamiento_del_orden_constitucional_y_legal_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica Acuerdo de la Cámara de Diputados]).&lt;/ref&gt; to &quot;put an immediate end&quot; to &quot;breach[es of] the Constitution . . . with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans.&quot;

The resolution declared that the Allende Government sought &quot;. . . to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State . . . [with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system&quot;, claiming it had made &quot;violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct.&quot; Essentially, most of the accusations were about the Socialist Government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the ''creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces''. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as ''notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks''.

It can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow Allende if he did not reform, as follows &quot;...To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|English translation]] on Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

===President Allende's response===
Two days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the Congress's declaration as &quot;destined to damage the country’s prestige abroad and create internal confusion&quot;, predicting &quot;It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors&quot;. He noted that the declaration had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority &quot;constitutionally required&quot; to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress were &quot;invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government&quot; and &quot;subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;La respuesta del Presidente Allende&quot;&gt;{{es icon}} [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifiesto_al_pa%C3%ADs_de_Salvador_Allende,_respondiendo_al_acuerdo_de_la_camara_de_diputados La respuesta del Presidente Allende] on Wikisource. {{en icon}} [[wikisource:Salvador Allende's Last Speech|English translation]] on Wikisource. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet &quot;at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism&quot;. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a ''coup d’état'' or a civil war with a declaration &quot;full of affirmations that had already been refuted before-hand&quot; and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.

President Allende wrote: &quot;Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives&quot;.

Adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress were obstructing said means—having already &quot;paralyzed&quot; the State—they sought to &quot;destroy&quot; it. He concluded by calling upon &quot;the workers, all democrats and patriots&quot; to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the &quot;revolutionary process&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;La respuesta del Presidente Allende&quot;/&gt;

In one particular conversation about the news of Allende's overthrow, Kissinger complains about the lack of recognition of the American role in the overthrow of a &quot;communist&quot; government, upon which Nixon remarked &quot;Well, we didn't – as you know – our hand doesn't show on this one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Peter Winn]] found &quot;extensive evidence&quot; of United States complicity in the coup. He states that its covert support was crucial to engineering the coup, as well as for the consolidation of power by the Pinochet regime following the takeover. Winn documents an extensive CIA operation to fabricate reports of a coup against Allende, as justification for the imposition of military rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winn 2010 239–275&quot;/&gt; Peter Kornbluh asserts that the CIA destabilized Chile and helped create the conditions for the coup, citing documents declassified by the Clinton administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pinochet File&quot; /&gt; Other authors point to the involvement of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], agents of which allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard the [[La Moneda Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sun Axelsson|Axelsson, Sun]] ''Chili, le Dossier Noir. (Chile: The Black File)'' [[Paris]], [[France]]: [[Éditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], 1974, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Mark Falcoff by contrast credits the CIA with preserving democratic opposition to Allende and preventing the &quot;consolidation&quot; of his supposed &quot;totalitarian project&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kissinger and Chile&quot;&gt;Falcoff, Mark, [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/Printable.aspx?ArtId=15648 Kissinger and Chile], ''Commentary,'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Government's hostility to the election of Allende in Chile was substantiated in documents declassified during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], which show that CIA covert operatives were inserted in Chile, in order to prevent a Marxist government from arising and for the purpose of spreading anti-Allende propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Memorandum for Mr. Henry Kissinger| publisher=United States Department of State| author=Ad Hoc Interagency Working Group on Chile| date=4 December 1970| url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch20-01.htm| accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the [[Church Committee]] report, the CIA was involved in multiple plots designed to remove Allende and then let the Chileans vote in a new election where he would not be a candidate. The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]] approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the [[40 Committee]], attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm [[Jorge Alessandri]] as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections.

The other approach of the CIA, also known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]] approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup, by creating a climate of crisis across the country. [[False flag]] operatives contacted senior Chilean military officers, and informed them that the U.S. would actively support a coup, but would revoke all military aid if such a coup did not happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pinochet File&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-936-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the CIA gave extensive support for [[black propaganda]] against Allende, channeled mostly through ''El Mercurio''. Financial assistance was also given to Allende's political opponents, and for organizing strikes and unrest to destabilize the government. By 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company [[ITT Corporation]] owned of 70% of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company, and also funded ''El Mercurio''. The CIA used ITT as a means of disguising the source of the illegitimate funding Allende's opponents received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp#17 |title=U.S. Dept. of State FOIA Electronic Reading Room – Hinchey Report (CIA Activities in Chile) |publisher=Foia.state.gov |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/world/edward-korry-81-is-dead-falsely-tied-to-chile-coup.html?pagewanted=1|work=The New York Times|title=Edward Korry, 81, Is Dead; Falsely Tied to Chile Coup|first= David|last=Stout|date=30 January 2003|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2013/9/10/the_pinochet_file_how_us_politicians_banks_corporations_aided_chilean_coup_dictatorship The Pinochet File: How U.S. Politicians, Banks and Corporations Aided Chilean Coup, Dictatorship].

==Australian involvement==

An [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS) station was established in Chile out of the Australian embassy in July 1971 at the request of the CIA and authorised by then Liberal Party Foreign Minister [[William McMahon]]. New Labor Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] was informed of the operation in February 1973 and signed a document ordering the closure of the operation several weeks later. It appears, however, the last ASIS agent did not leave Chile until October 1973, one month after the CIA-backed coup d'état had brought down the Allende Government. There were also two officers of [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), Australia's internal security service, who were based in Santiago working as migration officers during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forty years after the military coup which brought down Chilean President Salvador Allende, refugees in Australia are still raising questions about the country's involvement in the affair.|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/09/11/questions-over-australian-involvement-chile-coup|publisher=SBS|date=11 September 2013|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASIS and ASIO in Chile|url=https://www.academia.edu/23060812/ASIS_and_ASIO_in_Chile_Transparency_and_Double_Standards_Four_Decades_after_the_Coup_in_40_Years_Are_Nothing_History_and_Memory_of_the_1973_Coups_Dètat_in_Uruguay_and_Chile._2014-15|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|author=Florencia Melgar and Pablo Leighton|accessdate=30 October 2016}} pp78-92, 2015 in ''40 Years are Nothing: History and memory of the 1973 coups d’état in Uruguay and Chile'' Edited by Pablo Leighton and Fernando López, ISBN 1443876429&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of timely closure of Australia's covert operations was one of the reasons for the sacking of the Director of ASIS on 21 October 1975, to take effect on 7 November just 4 days before Prime Minister's Whitlam's own dismissal in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] with allegations of CIA political interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suich|first=Max|title=Spymaster stirs spectre of covert foreign activities|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/spymaster-stirs-spectre-of-covert-foreign-activities/story-e6frg6z6-1225842681065|publisher=The Australian|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military action==
By 7:00&amp;nbsp;am on 11 September 1973, the Navy captured [[Valparaíso]], strategically stationing ships and marine infantry in the central coast and closed radio and television networks. The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy's actions; immediately, the president went to the [[La Moneda|presidential palace]] with his bodyguards, the &quot;Group of Personal Friends&quot; (GAP). By 8:00&amp;nbsp;am, the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city; the Air Force bombed the remaining active stations; the President received incomplete information, and was convinced that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.

President Allende and Defence minister [[Orlando Letelier]] were unable to communicate with military leaders. Admiral Montero, the Navy's commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut and his cars were sabotaged before the ''coup d’état'', to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to [[José Toribio Merino]], planner of the ''coup d’état'' and executive officer to Adm. Montero. [[Augusto Pinochet]], General of the Army, and [[Gustavo Leigh]], General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende's telephone calls to them. The General Director of the ''Carabineros'' (uniformed police), [[José María Sepúlveda]], and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), [[Alfredo Joignant]] answered Allende's calls and immediately went to the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace. When Defence minister Letelier arrived at the Ministry of Defense, controlled by Adm. [[Patricio Carvajal]], he was arrested as the first prisoner of the ''coup d’état''.

Despite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet's loyalty, telling a reporter that the ''coup d’état'' leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30&amp;nbsp;am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military's rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.

At approx. 9:00 the [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineros of the La Moneda]] left the building.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 9:00&amp;nbsp;am, the armed forces controlled Chile, except for the city centre of the capital, Santiago. Allende refused to surrender, despite the military's declaring they would bomb the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace if he resisted being deposed. The Socialist Party proposed to Allende that he escape to the San Joaquín industrial zone in southern Santiago, to later re-group and lead a counter-''coup d’état''; the president rejected the proposition. The military attempted negotiations with Allende, but the President refused to resign, citing his constitutional duty to remain in office. Finally, Allende gave a [[wikisource:Salvador Allende's Last Speech|farewell speech]], telling the nation of the ''coup d’état'' and his refusal to resign his elected office under threat.

Leigh ordered the presidential palace bombed, but was told the Air Force's [[Hawker Hunter]] jet aircraft would take forty minutes to arrive. Pinochet ordered an armoured and infantry force under General Sergio Arellano to advance upon the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace. When the troops moved forward, they were forced to retreat after coming under fire from GAP snipers perched on rooftops. General Arellano called for helicopter gunship support from the commander of the Chilean Army Puma helicopter squadron and the troops were able to advance again.&lt;ref&gt;La misión era matar: el juicio a la caravana Pinochet-Arellano, By Jorge Escalante Hidalgo, Page 43, [[LOM Ediciones]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean Air Force aircraft soon arrived to provide close air support for the assault (by bombing the Palace), but the defenders did not surrender until nearly 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FewtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IDMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7165,1410181&amp;dq |title=ROME NEWS TRIBUNE Sep 11, 1973 |publisher=Google |date=11 September 1973 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; First reports said the 65-year-old president had died fighting troops, but later police sources reported he had committed suicide.

After Gen. Pinochet lost the election in the 1988 plebiscite, the [[Rettig Commission]], a multi-partisan truth commission, in 1991 reported the location of [[torture]] and [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] centers, among others, [[Colonia Dignidad]], [[Esmeralda (BE-43)|Esmeralda ship]] and Víctor Jara Stadium. Later, in November 2004, the [[Valech Report]] confirmed the number as less than 3,000 killed, and reduced the number of cases of forced disappearance; but some 28,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, and tortured.

==Casualties==
Fewer than 60 individuals died as a direct result of fighting on 11 September although the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] and GAP continued to fight the following day. In all, 46 of Allende's guard (the GAP, ''Grupo de Amigos Personales'') were killed, some of them in combat with the soldiers that took the Moneda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/165/29585.html |title=Pinochet Stripped of Legal Immunity |agency=Associated Press |date=11 January 2006 |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allende's Cuban-trained guard would have had about 300 elite commando-trained GAP fighters at the time of the coup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBcDJ34AJGMC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq= |title=The Nixon Administration and the Death of Allende's Chile: A Case of Assisted Suicide, Jonathan Haslam, page 64, Verso Press 2005 |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2011|isbn=9781844670307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the use of brute military force, especially the use of Hawker Hunters, may have handicapped many GAP fighters from further action.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrada-noli.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferrada |first=Marcello |url=http://ferrada-noli.blogspot.com/2008_09_13_archive.html |title=Marcello Ferrada-Noli.

According to official reports prepared after the return of democracy, at La Moneda only two people died: President Allende and the journalist Augusto Olivares (both by suicide). Two more were injured, Antonio Aguirre and Osvaldo Ramos, both members of President Allende's entourage; they would later be allegedly kidnapped from the hospital and disappeared. In November 2006, the Associated Press noted that more than 15 [[bodyguard]]s and aides were taken from the palace during the coup and are still unaccounted for; in 2006 Augusto Pinochet was indicted for two of their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://news.bostonherald.com/international/view.bg?articleid=169298 Pinochet indicted for deaths of Allende bodyguards, put under house arrest], 27 November 2006. Retrieved 11 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the military side, there were 34 deaths: two army [[sergeant]]s, three army [[corporal]]s, four [[Private (rank)|army privates]], 2 navy lieutenants, 1 navy corporal, 4 naval cadets, 3 navy conscripts and 15 carabineros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martires y Victimas de la Unidad Popular |first=Juan Alvaro |last=Arce |url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/1687/History_Chile_1970-73/martires.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5khC56EoN?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.com%2FCapitolHill%2FSenate%2F1687%2FHistory_Chile_1970-73%2Fmartires.html |archivedate=21 October 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September, the Chilean military junta claimed its troops suffered another 16 dead and 100 injured by gunfire in mopping-up operations against Allende supporters, and Pinochet said: ''&quot;sadly there are still some armed groups who insist on attacking, which means that the military rules of wartime apply to them.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.co.nz/newspapers?id=nRMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=96EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2709,16507&amp;dq |title=Chile wars armed civilians. |work=The Montreal Gazette. |date=17 September 1973 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A press photographer also died in the crossfire while attempting to cover the event. On 23 October 1973, 23-year-old army corporal Benjamín Alfredo Jaramillo Ruz, who was serving with the ''Cazadores'', became the first fatal casualty of the counterinsurgency operations in the mountainous area of Alquihue in Valdivia after being shot by a sniper.&lt;ref&gt;Informe de la Comisión Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliación&quot;, Volume I, Page 441, Santiago, Chile, 1991.

While fatalities in the battle during the coup might have been relatively small, the Chilean security forces sustained 162 dead in the three following months as a result of continued resistance,&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8aWQ_7oKJfkC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326&amp;dq=the+military+sustained+162+dead+as+a+result+of+the+coup#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Latin America's Wars: The age of the professional soldier, 1900–2001, Robert L.

Retrieved 11 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the plans for the coup called for the arrest of every man, woman and child on the streets the morning of 11 September. Of these approximately 40,000 to 50,000 perfunctory arrests, several hundred individuals would later be detained, questioned, tortured, and in some cases murdered.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} While these deaths did not occur before the surrender of Allende's forces, they occurred as a direct result of arrests and round-ups during the coup's military action.

==Allende's death==
{{Main article|Death of Salvador Allende}}
President Allende died in La Moneda during the coup. The junta officially declared that he committed suicide with a rifle given to him by Fidel Castro, two doctors from the infirmary of La Moneda stated that they witnessed the suicide,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hilton, [http://wais.stanford.edu/Chile/chile_conflict.html Chile: The Continuing Historical Conflict], World Association of International Studies, 22 December 1997. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and an autopsy labelled Allende's death a suicide. Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, one of the primary instigators of the coup, claimed that &quot;Allende committed suicide and is dead now.&quot;{{citequote|date = September 2013}}

At the time, few of Allende's supporters believed the explanation that Allende had killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Róbinson Rojas, [http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/murder.htm ''The murder of Allende and the end of the Chilean way to socialism''], originally published by Harper and Row, New York, 1975,1976-Fitzhenry&amp;Whiteside Ltd., Toronto, Canada, 1975. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Allende's body was exhumed in May 2011. A scientific autopsy was performed and the autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding on 19 July 2011 that Allende committed suicide using an AK-47 rifle.&lt;ref name=&quot;ak-47&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/20/salvador-allende-committed-suicide-autopsy Chilean president Salvador Allende committed suicide, autopsy confirms] ''The Guardian'', 2011-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 31 May 2011, Chile's state television station reported that a top-secret military account of Allende's death had been discovered in the home of a former military justice official. The 300-page document was only found when the house was destroyed in the 2010 Chilean earthquake. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told TVN &quot;that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated.&quot;[21]

Allende's widow and family escaped the military government and were accepted for exile in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BZGggv0hN9sC&amp;dat=19730914&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|title=Mexico dio asilo a la viuda de Allende|last=|first=|date=14 September 1973|work=La Nacion|access-date=|via=Google Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main article|Government Junta of Chile (1973)}}
[[File:Chile Junta001.jpg|thumb|left|Original members of the [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)]]]]
On 13 September, the Junta dissolved Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/chile/story/0,,1033575,00.html Junta general names himself as new President of Chile]. ''The Guardian,'' Friday, 14 September 1973&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it outlawed the parties that had been part of the Popular Unity coalition, and all political activity was declared &quot;in recess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080702045239/http://www.economist.com/countries/Chile/profile.cfm?folder=History%20in%20brief History in brief]&lt;/ref&gt;

The military government took control of all media including the radio broadcasting that Allende attempted to use to give his final speech to the nation. It is not known how many Chileans actually heard the last words of their president, Salvador Allende, as he spoke them but a transcript and audio of the speech survived the military government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/allende/1973/september/11.htm|title=Salvador Allende: Last speech|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Prensa Chilena En La Encrucijada: Entre La Voz Monocorde Y La Revolución Digital|last=M Baltra|first=Lidia|publisher=LOM Ediciones|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean scholar Lidia M Baltra details how the military took control of the media platforms and turned them into their own &quot;propaganda machine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The only two newspapers that were allowed to continue publishing after the military takeover were ''El Mercurio'' and ''La Tercera de la Hora'', both of which were anti-Allende under his leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The dictatorship's silencing of the leftist point of view extended past the media and into &quot;every discourse that expressed any resistance to the regime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cucurella|first=Paula|date=2014|title=A Weak Force: On the Chilean Dictatorship and Visual Arts|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/539218|journal=The New Centennial Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the torturing and death of folksinger [[Victor Jara]]. The military government detained Jara in the days following the coup. He, along with many other leftists, was held in Estadio Nacional, or the National Stadium of Chile in the capital of Santiago. Initially the Junta tried to silence him by crushing his hands but ultimately he was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Murder of Chile: Eyewitness Accounts of the Coup, the Terror, and the Resistance Today|last=Chavkin|first=Samuel|publisher=Everest House Publishers,|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=208–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, there were four leaders of the junta: In addition to General Augusto Pinochet, from the Army, there were General Gustavo Leigh Guzmán, of the Air Force; Admiral José Toribio Merino Castro, of the Navy (who replaced Constitutionalist Admiral [[Raúl Montero]]); and General Director [[César Mendoza|César Mendoza Durán]], of the National Police (''Carabineros de Chile'') (who replaced Constitutionalist General Director José María Sepúlveda). Coup leaders soon decided against a rotating presidency and named General Pinochet permanent head of the junta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp#18 Hinchey Report on CIA Activities in Chile] 18 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months that followed the coup, the ''junta'', with authoring work by historian [[Gonzalo Vial Correa|Gonzalo Vial]] and admiral Patricio Carvajal, published a book titled ''El Libro Blanco del cambio de gobierno en Chile'' (commonly known as ''El Libro Blanco'', &quot;The White Book of the Change of Government in Chile&quot;), where they attempted to justify the coup by claiming that they were in fact anticipating a self-coup (the alleged ''[[Plan Zeta]]'', or Plan Z) that Allende's government or its associates were purportedly preparing. Historian [[Peter Winn]] states that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] had an extensive part to play in fabricating the conspiracy and in selling it to the press, both in Chile and internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winn 2010 239–275&quot;/&gt; Although later discredited and officially recognized as the product of political propaganda,&lt;ref name=&quot;Valech1&quot;&gt;[http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/comision_valech/pdf/Capitulo3.pdf Comisión Nacional sobre Prisión Política y Tortura CAPÍTULO III Contexto].&lt;/ref&gt; some Chilean historians pointed to the similarities between the alleged Plan Z and other existing paramilitary plans of the Popular Unity parties in support of its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Vial Correa|first=Gonzalo|title=Carlos Altamirano, el Plan Z y la &quot;Operación Blanqueo&quot; |publisher=La Segunda|date=23 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' published on its front page a photograph showing prisoners at the [[Quiriquina Island]] Camp who had been captured during the fighting in [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The photograph's caption stated that some of the detained were local leaders of the &quot;[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Unidad Popular]]&quot; while others were &quot;extremists who had attacked the armed forces with firearms&quot;. The photo is reproduced in Docuscanner.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docscanner.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/prisoner-of-pinochet-at-quiriquina-island-2/ |accessdate=14 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718092552/http://docscanner.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/prisoner-of-pinochet-at-quiriquina-island-2/ |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with reports in newspapers and broadcasts in Concepción about the activities of the Armed Forces, which mentioned clashes with &quot;extremists&quot; on several occasions from 11 to 14 September. Nocturnal skirmishes took place around the Hotel Alonso De Ercilla in Colo Colo and San Martino Street, one block away from the Army and military police administrative headquarters. A recent published testimony about the clashes in Concepcion offers several plausible explanations for the reticence of witnesses to these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Ferrada-Noli. &quot;That morning of 11 September 1972. A personal testimony&quot;. Stockholm (2008) [http://ferrada-noli.blogspot.com/2008_09_13_archive.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides political leaders and participants, the coup also affected many everyday Chilean citizens.  Thousands were killed, went missing, and were injured.  Because of the political instability in their country, many relocated elsewhere.  Canada, among other countries, became a main point of refuge for many Chilean citizens.  Through an operation known as “Special Movement Chile”, more than 7,000 Chileans were relocated to Canada in the months following September 11, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=John|last2=Carty|first2=Bob|title=Chile's 1972 Coup, 40 Years Later: Observances, Part 2|url=http://opencanada.org/branch-news/chiles-1973-coup-40-years-later-observances-part-two/|website=Opencanada.org|publisher=Canadian International Council|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These refugees are now known as [[Chilean Canadian]] people and have a population of over 38,000.

The U.S. view of the coup continues to spark controversy. Beginning in late 2014 in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin,  [[United States Southern Command]] (USSOUTHCOM) [[William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies]] (CHDS), located at the [[National Defense University]] in Washington, D.C., has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints included that the Center knowingly protected a CHDS professor from Chile who was a former top advisor to Pinochet after belonging to the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional]] / [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] state terrorist organization (whose attack against a former Chilean foreign minister in 1976 in Washington, D.C. resulted in two deaths, including that of an American). “Reports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extra-judicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive,” said [[Sen. Patrick Leahy,]] D-Vermont, the author of the “Leahy Law” prohibiting U.S. assistance to military units and members of foreign security forces that violate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Edwin Andersen [https://www.academia.edu/25856284/Unpunished_U.S._Southern_Command_role_in_09_Honduran_military_coup Unpunished U.S. Southern Command role in '09 Honduran military coup] May 24, 2016, Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marisa Taylor and Kevin G.

===Commemoration===
The coup was commemorated by various means. On September 11 of 1975 Pinochet lit the [[Llama de la Libertad]] (lit. Flame of Liberty) to commemorate the coup. This flame was extinguished in 2004.&lt;ref name=EMOLbachelet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2003/10/08/125557/ministerio-de-defensa-pagara-el-gas-de-la-llama-de-la-libertad.html |title=Ministerio de Defensa pagará el gas de la llama de la libertad |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Emol |publisher=[[El Mercurio]] |access-date=February 3, 2016|quote=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archivo.abc.com.py/2004-10-19/articulos/140158/apagan-la-llama-eterna-de-la-libertad-encendida-por-pinochet | website=[[ABC Color]] | title=Apagan la &quot;Llama Eterna de la Libertad&quot; encendida por Pinochet |date=19 October 2004 |access-date=22 February 2013 |language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avenida Nueva Providencia]] in [[Providencia, Chile|Providencia]], Santiago, was renamed Avenida 11 de Septiembre in 1980.
