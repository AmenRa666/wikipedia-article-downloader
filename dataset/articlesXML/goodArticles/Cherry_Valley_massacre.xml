The '''Cherry Valley massacre''' was an attack by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and [[Iroquois]] forces on a fort and the village of [[Cherry Valley (town), New York|Cherry Valley]] in eastern New York on November 11, 1778, during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  It has been described as one of the most horrific frontier massacres of the war.&lt;ref name = &quot;Murray 64&quot;&gt;Murray, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  A mixed force of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s, British soldiers, [[Seneca people|Seneca]] and [[Mohawk nation|Mohawks]] descended on Cherry Valley, whose defenders, despite warnings, were unprepared for the attack.  During the raid, the Seneca in particular targeted non-combatants, and reports state that 30 such individuals were slain, in addition to a number of armed defenders.

The raiders were under the overall command of [[Walter Butler (Loyalist)|Walter Butler]], who exercised little authority over the Indians on the expedition.  Historian Barbara Graymont describes Butler's command of the expedition as &quot;criminally incompetent&quot;.&lt;ref name=Graymont186/&gt;  The Seneca were angered by accusations that they had committed atrocities at the [[Battle of Wyoming]], and the colonists' [[Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga|recent destruction]] of their forward bases of operation at [[Unadilla (village), New York|Unadilla]], [[Onaquaga]], and [[Tioga, New York|Tioga]].  Butler's authority with the Indians was undermined by his poor treatment of [[Joseph Brant]], the leader of the Mohawks.  Butler repeatedly maintained, against accusations that he permitted the atrocities to take place, that he was powerless to restrain the Seneca.

During the campaigns of 1778, Brant achieved an undeserved reputation for brutality.  He was not present at Wyoming, although many thought he was, and actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley.  The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]] which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.

==Background==
{{main|Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga}}

With the failure of British General [[John Burgoyne]]'s [[Saratoga campaign|campaign to the Hudson]] after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the [[American Revolutionary War]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] became a frontier war.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mohawk Valley was especially targeted for its fertile soil and large supply of crops farmers were supplying Patriot troops. British leaders in the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] supported [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;  During the winter of 1777–78, [[Joseph Brant]] and other British-allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at [[Onaquaga]] (present-day [[Windsor, New York]]).  He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G165&gt;Graymont, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of [[John Butler (pioneer)|John Butler]], who was planning operations in the [[Susquehanna River]] valley.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Brant began his campaign in late May with a [[Battle of Cobleskill|raid on Cobleskill]], and raided other frontier communities throughout the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt;  The local militia and [[Continental Army]] units defending the area were ineffective against the raiders, who typically escaped from the scene of a raid before defenders arrived in force.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, pp. 212–220&lt;/ref&gt;  After Brant and some of [[Butler's Rangers]] [[Attack on German Flatts (1778)|attacked German Flatts]] in September, the Americans organized a [[Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga|punitive expedition]] that destroyed the villages of [[Unadilla (village), New York|Unadilla]] and [[Onaquaga]] in early October.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cornplanter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Seneca people|Seneca]] war chief [[Cornplanter]]]]
While Brant was active in the Mohawk valley, Butler descended with a large mixed force and [[Battle of Wyoming|raided the Wyoming Valley]] of northern Pennsylvania in early July.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, pp. 167–172&lt;/ref&gt;  This action complicated affairs, for the [[Seneca people|Seneca]]s in Butler's force were accused of massacring noncombatants, and a number of Patriot militia violated their parole not long afterward, participating in a reprisal expedition against [[Tioga, New York|Tioga]].  The lurid propaganda associated with the accusations against the Seneca in particular angered them, as did the destruction of Unadilla, Onaquaga, and Tioga.&lt;ref name=Barr154&gt;Barr, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wyoming Valley attack, even though Brant was not present, fueled among his opponents the view of him as a particularly brutal opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Brant then joined forces with [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Walter Butler (Loyalist)|Walter Butler]] (the son of John Butler),leading two companies of Butler's Rangers commanded by Captains [[John McDonell]] and [[William Caldwell (ranger)|William Caldwell]] for an attack on the major [[Schoharie Creek]] settlement of [[Cherry Valley (village), New York|Cherry Valley]].  Butler's forces also included 300 Senecas, probably led by either [[Cornplanter]] or [[Sayenqueraghta]], and 50 [[British Army]] soldiers from the [[8th Regiment of Foot]].&lt;ref name=Graymont184&gt;Graymont, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  As the force moved toward Cherry Valley, Butler and Brant quarreled over Brant's recruitment of Loyalists.  Butler was unhappy at Brant's successes in this sphere, and threatened to withhold provisions from Brant's Loyalist volunteers.  Ninety of them ended up leaving the expedition, and Brant himself was on the verge of doing so when his Indian supporters convinced him to stay.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, pp. 229–239&lt;/ref&gt;  The dispute did not sit well with the Indian forces, and may have undermined Butler's tenuous authority over them.&lt;ref name=Graymont184/&gt;

==Massacre==
[[File:CherryValleyMassacreMap.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Cherry Valley at the time of the massacre]]
Cherry Valley had a [[palisade]]d fort (constructed after Brant's raid on Cobleskill) that surrounded the village meeting house.  It was garrisoned by 300 soldiers of the [[7th Massachusetts Regiment]] of the Continental Army commanded by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Ichabod Alden]].  Alden and his command staff were alerted by November 8 through [[Oneida people|Oneida]] spies that the Butler–Brant force was moving against Cherry Valley.  However, he failed to take elementary precautions, continuing to occupy a headquarters (the house of a settler named Wells) some {{convert|400|yd|m}} from the fort.&lt;ref name=Barr153&gt;Barr, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler's force arrived near Cherry Valley late on November 10, and established a cold camp to avoid detection.  Reconnaissance of the town identified the weaknesses of Alden's arrangements, and the raiders decided to send one force against Alden's headquarters and another against the fort.  Butler extracted promises from the Indians in the party that they would not harm noncombatants in a council held that night.&lt;ref name=Graymont186&gt;Graymont, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack began early on the morning of November 11. Some overeager Indians spoiled the surprise by firing on settlers cutting wood nearby.  One of them escaped, raising the alarm.  [[Little Beard]] led some of the Senecas to surround the Wells house, while the main body surrounded the fort.&lt;ref name=Barr153/&gt;  The attackers killed at least sixteen officers and troops of the quarters guards, including Alden, who was cut down while he was running from the Wells house to the fort.&lt;ref name = &quot;Goodnough 6-9&quot;&gt;Goodnough, pp. 6–9&lt;/ref&gt; Most accounts say Alden was within reach of the gates, only to stop and try to shoot his pursuer, who may have been Joseph Brant.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sawyer and Little 13&quot;&gt;Sawyer and Little, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; His wet pistol repeatedly misfired and he was killed by a thrown tomahawk hitting him in the forehead.&lt;ref name = &quot;Campbell 110-11&quot;&gt;Campbell, pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;  Lt. Col. [[William Stacy]], second in command, also quartered at the Wells house, was taken prisoner.&lt;ref name = &quot;Goodnough 6-9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Campbell 110-11&quot;/&gt; Stacy's son Benjamin and cousin Rufus Stacy ran through a hail of bullets to reach the fort from the house; Stacy's brother-in-law Gideon Day was killed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lemonds 21&quot;&gt;Lemonds, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Those attacking the Wells house eventually gained entry, leading to hand-to-hand combat inside.  After killing most of the soldiers stationed there, the Senecas slaughtered the entire Wells household, twelve in all.&lt;ref name=Barr154/&gt;

The raiders' attack on the fort was unsuccessful&amp;mdash;lacking heavy weapons, they were unable to make any significant impressions on its stockade walls.  The fort was then guarded by the Loyalists while the Indians rampaged through the rest of the settlement.  Not a single house was left standing, and the Senecas, seeking revenge, were reported to have slaughtered anyone they encountered.  Butler and Brant attempted to restrain their actions but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Barr154/&gt;  Brant in particular was dismayed to learn that a number of families who were well known to him and whom he had counted as friends had borne the brunt of the Seneca rampage, including the Wells, Campbell, Dunlop, and Clyde families.&lt;ref name = &quot;Swinnerton24&quot;&gt;Swinnerton, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Unadilla is southwest, near where the Unadilla River joins the Susquehanna. Onaquaga lies a short way further southwest, on the Susquehanna.|Map detail showing the western frontier of New York. Cobleskill and Cherry Valley are marked in red, Unadilla and Onaquaga (spelled &quot;Oghwaga&quot; on the map) are marked in blue.]]
Lt. William McKendry, a [[quartermaster]] in Colonel Alden's regiment, described the attack in his journal: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Immediately came on 442 Indians from the Five Nations, 200 Tories under the command of one Col. Butler and Capt. Brant; attacked headquarters; killed Col. Alden; took Col. Stacy prisoner; attacked Fort Alden; after three hours retreated without success of taking the fort.&lt;ref name = &quot;Young 449 450&quot;&gt;Young, pp. 449–450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ketchum 322&quot;&gt;Ketchum, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
McKendry identified the fatalities of the massacre as Colonel Alden, thirteen other soldiers, and thirty civilian inhabitants.  Most of the slain soldiers had been at the Wells house.&lt;ref name=Barr154/&gt;

Accounts surrounding the capture of Lt. Col. Stacy report that he was about to be killed, but Brant intervened. &quot;[Brant] saved the life of Lieut. Col Stacy, who [...] was made prisoner when Col. Alden was killed. It is said Stacy was a [[Freemasonry|freemason]], and as such made an appeal to Brant, and was spared.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Beardsley 463&quot;&gt;Beardsley, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The next morning Butler sent Brant and some rangers back into the village to complete its destruction.  The raiders took 70 captives, many of them women and children.  About 40 of these Butler managed to have released, but the rest were distributed among their captors' villages until they were exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Graymont, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;  Lt. Col. Stacy was taken to [[Fort Niagara]] as a prisoner of the British.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 110–111, 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;

He wears Indian garb, including a wide headband decorated with feathers and beads, a metal gorget, and a dark cape with a silver fringe.|[[Joseph Brant]], portrait by [[Gilbert Stuart]]]]
A Mohawk chief, in justifying the action at Cherry Valley, wrote to an American officer that &quot;you Burned our Houses, which makes us and our Brothers, the Seneca Indians angrey, so that we destroyed, men, women and Children at Chervalle.&quot;&lt;ref name=Graymont190&gt;Graymont, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;  The Seneca &quot;declared they would no more be falsely accused, or fight the Enemy twice&quot; (the latter being an indication that they would [[no quarter|refuse quarter]] in the future).&lt;ref name=Graymont190/&gt;  Butler reported that &quot;notwithstanding my utmost Precaution and Endeavours to save the Women and Children, I could not prevent some of them falling unhappy Victims to the Fury of the Savages,&quot; but also that he spent most of his time guarding the fort during the raid.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay, pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt;  Quebec's Governor [[Frederick Haldimand]] was so upset at Butler's inability to control his forces that he refused to see him, writing &quot;such indiscriminate vengeance taken even upon the treacherous and cruel enemy they are engaged against is useless and disreputable to themselves, as it is contrary to the dispositions and maxims of the King whose cause they are fighting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wrong, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;  Butler continued to insist in later writings that he was not at fault for the events of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The violent frontier war of 1778 brought calls for the Continental Army to take action.  Cherry Valley, along with the accusations of murder of non-combatants at Wyoming, helped pave the way for the launch of the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]], commissioned by commander-in-chief Major General [[George Washington]] and led by  Major General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]].  The expedition destroyed over 40 Iroquois villages in their homelands of central and western [[History of New York|New York]] and drove the women and children into refugee camps at Fort Niagara.  It failed, however, to stop the frontier war, which continued with renewed severity in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, pp. 155–161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:CherryValleyMonument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to the victims of the Cherry Valley massacre]]
A monument was dedicated at Cherry Valley on August 15, 1878, at the centennial anniversary of the massacre. Former New York Governor [[Horatio Seymour]] delivered a dedication address at the monument to an audience of about 10,000 persons, saying:

{{quote|I am here today not only to show reverence for those dead patriots, but to offer my respects and heartfelt gratitude to the living descendants of those illustrious persons of the early settlements, who have erected this memorial stone. It is to be hoped that their example will be copied; that the report of these commemorative exercises will move others to like acts of pious duty. Let every son of this soil uncover reverently as this monument is unveiled, and do reverence to their sturdy patriotism, made strong by their grand faith, their trials, and their sufferings, and show that the blood of innocent children, of wives, of sisters, of mothers, and of brave men, was not shed in vain. Let us show the world that 100 years have added to the value of that noble sacrifice. Thus we shall leave this sacred spot better men and women, with a higher and nobler purpose of life than that which animated us when we entered this domain of the dead.&lt;ref name = &quot;New York Times &quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Cherry Valley Massacre, Unveiling of the Monument to Those Who Fell on Nov. 11, 1778|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Years after the massacre, Benjamin Stacy's home village of [[New Salem, Massachusetts]] celebrated the annual Old Home Day holiday with a Benjamin Stacy footrace, honoring his escape at Cherry Valley.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lemonds 21&quot;/&gt;
