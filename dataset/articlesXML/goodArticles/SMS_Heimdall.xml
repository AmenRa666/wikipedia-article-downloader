'''SMS ''Heimdall''''' was the fourth vessel of the six-member [[Siegfried-class coastal defense ship|''Siegfried'' class]] of [[coastal defense ship]]s (''Küstenpanzerschiffe'') built for the [[German Imperial Navy]]. Her [[sister ship]]s were {{SMS|Siegfried||2}}, {{SMS|Beowulf||2}}, {{SMS|Frithjof||2}}, {{SMS|Hildebrand||2}}, and {{SMS|Hagen||2}}. ''Heimdall'' was built by the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven]] shipyard between 1891 and 1894, and was armed with a main battery of three {{convert|24|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. She served in the German fleet throughout the 1890s and was rebuilt in 1900&amp;ndash;1902. She served in the VI Battle Squadron after the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, but saw no action. ''Heimdall'' was demobilized in 1915 and used as a [[barracks ship]] thereafter. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921.

{{main|Siegfried-class coastal defense ship}}

''Heimdall'' was {{convert|79|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.9|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.74|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|3741|LT}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3-cylinder [[triple expansion engine]]s. Steam for the engines was provided by four coal-fired boilers. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of {{convert|14.6|kn|abbr=on}} and a range of approximately {{convert|1490|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}. ''Heimdall'' had a crew of 20&amp;nbsp;officers and 256&amp;nbsp;enlisted men.{{sfn|Gröner|p=10-11}}

The ship was armed with three [[24 cm K L/35]] guns mounted in three single [[gun turret]]s. Two were placed side by side forward, and the third was located aft of the main [[superstructure]]. They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition. The ship was also equipped with eight [[8.8 cm SK L/30 naval gun|8.8&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/30]] guns in single mounts. ''Heimdall'' also carried four {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, all in swivel mounts on the deck. One was at the bow, another at the stern, and two amidships. The ship was protected by an [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|240|mm|abbr=on}} [[amidships]], and an armored deck that was {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gröner|p=11}} ''Heimdall''{{'}}s armor consisted of new [[Krupp armor|Krupp steel]], a more effective type of armor than the [[compound armor|compound steel]] the other members of the class received.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=187}}

==Service history==
''Heimdall'' was laid down in 1891 at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Kaiserliche Werft]] shipyard in [[Wilhelmshaven]]. She was launched on 27 July 1892, and completed on 7 April 1894.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=246}} In 1897, ''Heimdall'' participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the IV Division, along with {{SMS|Frithjof||2}} and {{SMS|Hagen||2}}. Her other three sisters were assigned to the III Division.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on Naval Progress'' (1898), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heimdall'' participated in the 1900 summer maneuvers, where she and {{SMS|Siegfried||2}}, {{SMS|Hildebrand||2}}, and {{SMS|Ägir||2}} simulated the hostile fleet.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes of Naval Progress'' (1900), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; She served on active duty with the fleet until 1901, when she was taken into drydock at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Kaiserliche Werft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]] for an extensive reconstruction. The ship was lengthened to {{convert|86.13|m|abbr=on}}, which increased displacement to {{convert|4436|MT|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|p=10}} Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers, and a second funnel was added. Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8.8&amp;nbsp;cm guns, and the 35&amp;nbsp;cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} tubes. Work was completed by 1902.{{sfn|Gröner|p=10-11}}

After emerging from her modernization, she returned to service with the fleet, assigned to the II Squadron, alongside ''Hildebrand'', ''Hagen'', and {{SMS|Beowulf||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;''The United Service'', p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in the fleet until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her [[sister ship]]s. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and ''Heimdall''{{'}}s crew was transferred to other warships.{{sfn|Gardiner &amp; Gray|p=142}} She was then used as a [[barracks ship]] in for [[U-boat]] crews, along with crews for the coastal defense flotillas stationed on the [[Ems river]]. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the [[naval register]]. The navy planned to convert ''Heimdall'' into a salvage ship, but the plan fell through and she was instead sold and broken up for scrap in 1921 in [[Rönnebeck]].{{sfn|Gröner|p=11}}
