Major-General '''Frederick Drummond Vincent Wing''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]] (29 November 1860 – 2 October 1915) was a senior officer of the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and was one of three British divisional commanders killed in action in the space of a week in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Loos]]. Wing had served in the army for over thirty years at the time of his death, having been commissioned into the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1880. He had served with distinction in the [[Second Boer War]] and been an [[aide de camp]] to [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] in 1903.

==Military service==
Frederick Wing was born in 1860, the son of Major Vincent Wing and Gertrude Elizabeth Wing (née Vane). In 1880 aged twenty, Wing joined the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] after graduating from the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. Wing rose in prominence in the regiment, and was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] on 12 September 1888, and [[Major (British Army)|Major]] on 31 March 1898.

He served in [[South Africa]] for the [[Second Boer War]] between 1899 and 1902, where he took part in operations in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in late 1899, including engagements at [[Talana, KwaZulu-Natal|Talana]]. The following year, he took part in the [[defence of Ladysmith]] and was present at the Battle of Lombard´s Kop, where he was slightly wounded, and for which he was [[mentioned in despatches]] and received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion as [[Lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|lieutenant-colonel]] on 29 November 1900. He was appointed a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1901. In early 1902 he was again wounded, but discharged to duty shortly before the end of hostilities, in May 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The War - Officers discharged to duty |day_of_week=Saturday |date=10 May 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36764| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left [[Cape Town]] on board the ''SS Dunvegan Castle'' in late June 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - Troops returning home |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=10 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived at [[Southampton]] the next month. Following the war, he was seconded to the staff of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], whom he served as aide-de-camp in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRT&quot;/&gt;

In 1905, Wing married Mary FitzClarence, a granddaughter of the [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|Earl of Munster]] and [[John Henry Scott, 3rd Earl of Clonmell|Earl of Clonmell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;peerage&quot;&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p4619.htm Maj.-Gen Frederick Drummond Vincent Wing], ''peerage.com'', Daryl Lundy, Retrieved 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Wing was given command of the artillery corps of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]] and accompanied them to France in 1914 at the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Wing served at all the major battles of 1914 and was wounded on 22 September 1915 by a shrapnel bullet in the calf, but returned to duty the next day. Wing also had a close escape early in 1915, when a German shell burst directly over his car during a tour of his artillery positions. Wing was unhurt in the blast, but his chauffeur was wounded in the arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRT&quot;&gt;P.107-108, ''Bloody Red Tabs'', Davies &amp; Maddocks&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1915, Wing took overall command of the newly raised [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] [[12th (Eastern) Division]]. In the September 1915 [[Battle of Loos]], generals [[George Thesiger]] and [[Thompson Capper]] were killed, and less than a week later, on 2 October 1915, a shell exploded in the road outside the 12th Division's forward report centre at [[Mazingarbe]] and killed Wing and his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Tower outright at 3:45pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRT&quot;/&gt; Both were buried in the nearby [[Noeux-les-Mines Communal Cemetery]] which is now maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGC&quot;&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=466353 Wing, Frederick Drummond Vincent], ''Commonwealth War Graves Commission'', Retrieved 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time for his men==
In the diaries of Lieut A A de Jongh of the 7th Battalion, Suffolks who fought at Loos under Major General Wing, he described meeting him on 5 June 1915 while marching to Campagne. &quot;On the way we passed Major General Wing our Divisional Commander, a simply topping man. He stopped his car and I had quite a long chat with him.&quot; On 8 July 1915 he inspected the trenches just outside Plugstreet (Ploegsteert) where Lieut. de Jongh was based. &quot;He was please with everything and spent a long time with me.&quot;{{cn|date=March 2016}}
