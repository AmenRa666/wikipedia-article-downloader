'''Gustav Julius Werner Hartenstein''' (27 February 1908&amp;nbsp;– 8 March 1943) commanded the [[U-boat]] {{GS|U-156|1941|2}} in [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]], a decoration awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or outstanding military leadership. ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' (corvette captain) Hartenstein is credited with sinking 20 ships totalling {{GRT|97504|disp=long}}, and with damaging three ships and a [[destroyer]].

Born in [[Plauen]], Hartenstein joined the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (navy of the [[Weimar Republic]]) in 1928. After training on surface vessels and serving on  [[torpedo boat]]s during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the first year of World War II, he transferred to the U-boat service in 1941. In September 1942, Hartenstein torpedoed and sank the {{RMS|Laconia|1921|6}}, then attempted to rescue the survivors. He was forced to abort the rescue when his U-boat came under attack by a [[B-24 Liberator]] bomber of the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. The event became known as the &quot;[[Laconia incident|''Laconia'' incident]]&quot; and resulted in the &quot;[[Laconia Order]]&quot;, an order from the ''[[Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote]]'' to the entire German U-boat force that forbade rescuing the survivors of sunken ships. Hartenstein and the entire crew of ''U-156'' were [[killed in action]] by depth charges from a US [[PBY Catalina]] aircraft on 8 March 1943.

==Early life and pre-war service==
Hartenstein was born in Plauen in the [[Vogtland]] of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], then a [[federated state]] of the [[German Empire]], on 27 February 1908. He was the second child of William Karl Adolf Hartenstein, an export merchant, and Selma Emma Hartenstein, née Schlingensiepen.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartenstein had one older sister, Thea Irena, and a younger sister, Charlotte. He celebrated his [[confirmation]] in 1923 and graduated from a humanities-oriented secondary school in Plauen with his diploma (''[[Abitur]]'') in 1926.&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;humanities-oriented secondary school—[[Gymnasium (Germany)|''humanistische Staatsgymnasium'']]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation in 1926 he applied for a naval officer cadetship but was rejected at first, and instead studied two semesters of [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1999, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Freiburg]] (''Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg'') in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] on 29 April 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 51–53, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged 20, Hartenstein re-applied for the cadetship, was accepted and began his naval career with the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' on 1 April 1928 as a member of &quot;Crew 28&quot; (the incoming class of 1928). He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stralsund]] (1 April 1928&amp;nbsp;– 30 June 1928).&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;2nd department —II. ''Abteilung''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;standing ship division —''Schiffsstammdivision''&lt;/ref&gt; Hartenstein was then transferred to the [[training ship]] [[Niobe (schooner)|''Niobe'']] (1 July 1928&amp;nbsp;– 15 October 1928), attaining the rank of ''[[Midshipman|Seekadett]]'' (midshipman) on 11 October 1928. Following a 14-month stay on board the [[German cruiser Emden|cruiser ''Emden'']] (16 October 1928&amp;nbsp;– 3 January 1930) he advanced in rank to ''[[Fähnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 January 1930. ''Emden'' at the time was under the command of [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière]], a U-boat commander during [[World War I]]. Hartenstein then underwent a number of officer training courses at the [[Naval Academy at Mürwik]], including navigational training cruises on the survey vessel [[Meteor (1915)|''Meteor'']], before transferring to the [[light cruiser]] [[German cruiser Köln|''Köln'']] (1 October 1931&amp;nbsp;– 23 September 1934). His stay on ''Köln'' was occasionally interrupted to attend further training courses at [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel]]-Wik. During this assignment on 30 January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]], under the leadership of [[Adolf Hitler]], came to power in Germany, and began to [[German re-armament|rearm the navy]]. In 1935, the ''Reichsmarine'' was renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''.&lt;ref name=BR257&gt;Busch &amp; Röll 2003, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartenstein served as first watch officer on the torpedo boat ''Greif'' from 30 September 1936 to 13 November 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busch &amp; Röll p258&quot;&gt;Busch &amp; Röll 2003, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;1st watch officer—I. ''Wachoffizier''&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' (captain lieutenant) on 1 June 1937. Hartenstein participated in several patrols in 1937 and 1938 on board ''Greif'' in Spanish waters during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. For these services he was awarded the [[Spanish Cross]] in Bronze on 6 June 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-36, Torpedoboot &quot;Jaguar&quot;.jpg|thumb|right|torpedo boat ''Jaguar'']]
At the outbreak of World War II, Hartenstein continued to serve on [[German torpedoboats of World War II|torpedo boats]]. In this position, he completed 65 patrols in the [[North Sea]], Norwegian waters, the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[English Channel]] in the first one and a half years of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Röll p34&quot;&gt;Röll 2011, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartenstein took command of torpedo boat ''Seeadler'' on 20 November 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz 1993, volume 7 p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1939 Hartenstein transferred and switched command of torpedo boat ''Jaguar'' with ''Kapitänleutnant'' [[Franz Kohlauf]] who took over command of ''Seeadler''.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Röhr &amp; Steinmetz 1993, volume 4 p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 1941, command of ''Jaguar'' was given to ''Kapitänleutnant'' [[Friedrich-Karl Paul]] and Hartenstein transferred to the U-boat force, and on 4 September 1941 was given command of ''U-156'', a [[German Type IX submarine|Type IXC]] U-boat. For his service on torpedo boats, Hartenstein was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold on 2 February 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busch &amp; Röll p258&quot;/&gt; [[Karl Dönitz]] personally pinned the award on Harteinstein's leather jacket on 17 March 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Röll p34&quot;/&gt; ''U-156'' was first assigned to the [[4th U-boat Flotilla]] at [[Stettin]] as a training boat, then was transferred to the [[2nd U-boat Flotilla]] at [[Lorient]], France, on 31 December 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busch &amp; Röll p258&quot;/&gt;

===First patrol===
Hartenstein's first patrol (24 December 1941 – 10 January 1942) was an uneventful transfer patrol taking ''U-156'' from Kiel to Lorient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busch &amp; Röll p258&quot;/&gt; ''U-156'', together with {{GS|U-87|1941|2}} and {{GS|U-753||2}}, transited through the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]], passing [[Brunsbüttel]] where they joined up with a pathfinder and {{GS|U-135|1941|2}}.&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;pathfinder—[[Sperrbrecher]]&lt;/ref&gt; The convoy received aerial protection from [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter aircraft and split up once they reached [[Cuxhaven]]. Passing south of the [[Shetland Islands]], bypassing the [[Hebrides]], ''U-156'' slowly approached [[Rockall]], where two [[weather buoy]]s were released: &quot;WFB 33&quot; on 7 January 1942 at {{coord|51|04.3|N|11|04|W|type:event|name=WFB 33 (weather buoy)}},&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;{{Lang|de|''Wetterfunkgeräte/Boje''}} abbreviated WFB—weather radio buoy&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;WFB 32&quot; on 8 January 1942 at 02:44 at {{coord|53|24|N|13|32|W|type:event|name=WFB 32 (weather buoy)}} in the [[Porcupine Bank]]. ''U-156'' received a radio message on the evening of 8 January ordering Hartenstein to proceed at high speed to Lorient, where it arrived on 10 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second patrol===
On his second patrol (19 January 1942&amp;nbsp;– 17 March 1942) Hartenstein commanded a [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] of U-boats (''[[Operation Neuland|Gruppe Neuland]]''—Group New Land) during the [[Attack on Aruba]] in February 1942, attacking an [[oil refinery]]. ''U-156'' along with {{GS|U-67|1940|2}} under the command of [[Günther Müller-Stöckheim]] and {{GS|U-502||2}} under the command of [[Jürgen von Rosenstiel]] departed from Lorient under the protection of a pathfinder in the early morning of 19 January 1942. Hartenstein's orders were to conduct a simultaneous surprise attack of the ''Gruppe Neuland'' against the shipping traffic off [[Aruba]] and [[Curaçao]]. Besides ''U-156'', ''U-67'' and ''U-502'', ''Gruppe Neuland'' also included the submarines {{GS|U-129|1941|2}} under the command of [[Nicolai Clausen]] and {{GS|U-161|1941|2}} under the command of [[Albrecht Achilles (Korvettenkapitän)|Albrecht Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pedernales sinking.jpg|thumb|left|''Pedernales'', heavily damaged after being struck by a German torpedo|alt=Three-quarter front view of a lake tanker, damaged in the middle section appearing to be breaking in two, at sea]]

On 16 February, after observing the area for a few days, ''U-156'' came around to the refineries. There in front of her target were two Lago Company flat-bottom steamers, {{SS|Pedernales||6}} and {{SS|Oranjestad||2}}, both British-owned oilers. At 01:31, ''U-156'' surfaced in [[San Nicolas, Aruba|San Nicolaas Harbour]] some {{convert|1.5|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} offshore and attacked the two British tankers at anchor. Hartenstein fired one torpedo from his bow tubes at ''Pedernales''. The torpedo attack was successful and ''Pedernales'' was hit [[amidships]]. Loaded with [[crude oil]], the steamer immediately burst into flames, killing eight of her 26 crewmen and wounding her captain Herbert McCall. ''Oranjestad'' then began to lift anchor and steam away but she was too late and was hit by a second torpedo fired from ''U-156''. She too burst into flames and sunk an hour later in about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} of water. Fifteen of her 22 crewmen were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 03:13, ''U-156'' attacked the [[Texaco]]-owned tanker SS ''Arkansas'' which was [[Berth (moorings)|berthed]] at [[Eagle Beach]] next to the Arend/Eagle Refinery. Just one of the torpedoes struck ''Arkansas'' and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties. Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men to take to the deck guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large oil tank of the [[Lago Oil and Transport Company]] The crew of the [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun]] forgot to remove the [[tampion]] from the barrel, so when Hartenstein ordered them to fire, the gun blew up. Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly, one foot having been severed. His comrade and trigger man Heinrich Büssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack. Hartenstein ordered the [[3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43|3.7&amp;nbsp;cm flak gun]] to continue the attack, causing only superficial damage.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 22–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third patrol===
[[File:USS Blakeley ohne Bug.jpg|thumb|right|The heavily damaged USS ''Blakeley''|alt=Three-quarter overhead view of destroyer with four funnels and damaged bow, at sea]]
On Hartenstein's third patrol (22 April 1942&amp;nbsp;– 7 July 1942), ''U-156'' sank 12 ships and damaged a further two, including the {{USS|Blakeley|DD-150|6}} on 25 May 1942. This achievement earned Hartenstein a reference on 6 June 1942 in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'' (armed forces report), an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in this way was an honour (equivalent to &quot;[[Mentioned in Despatches]]&quot; in the United Kingdom military) and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of a soldier's Service Record Book.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

''U-156'' along with ''U-502'' again departed from Lorient under the protection of a pathfinder on 22 April 1942 destined for the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Prior to the departure Dietrich von dem Borne, who had been severely wounded on the second patrol, was replaced by ''Oberleutnant zur See'' of the [[Military reserve|Reserve]] Gert Mannesmann.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief engineer Wilhelm Polchau reported to Hartenstein on 6 May that the diesel compressor had malfunctioned.&lt;ref group=Tr&gt;chief engineer—{{Lang|de|''Leitender Ingenieur''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartenstein radioed {{GS|U-66|1940|2}} under the command of [[Robert-Richard Zapp]] to assist. On 10 May ''U-156'' and ''U-66'' rendezvoused and exchanged {{Convert|5|m3|cuyd}} of fuel oil for the necessary spare parts, and the fuel compressor was repaired. ''U-156'' sighted the first steamer in the early afternoon on 12 May, the first of twelve ships—eleven merchantmen and one warship—attacked on this patrol, ten of which were sunk.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 35–36, 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

''U-156'', positioned near [[Fort-de-France]], was ordered to observe the traffic to and from [[Martinique]]. At roughly {{Convert|11|nmi|km mi}} offshore, the hydrophones detected a ship. Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position firing two torpedoes. One torpedo struck the bow of the ''Blakeley'' after a 25-second run-time. Hartenstein observed that the bow was completely blown away, but its engines kept running. The waters around Martinique were extremely shallow and Hartenstein decided not to pursue the destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 June 1942, Hartenstein was promoted to ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' (corvette captain).&lt;ref name=&quot;Röll p152&quot;&gt;Röll 2011, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The first watch officer, Paul Just, left ''U-156'' after returning from the third patrol. Just was replaced by ''Oberleutnant zur See'' Leopold Schumacher as new first watch officer. Just later became commander of {{GS|U-6|1935|2}}, {{GS|U-151|1940|2}} and {{GS|U-546||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartenstein and the entire crew of U-156 received a hero's welcome by the people of Plauen on 20 July 1942. The people lined the streets as the whole crew marched from the railway station to the City Hall for the official welcome reception.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1999, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth patrol and ''Laconia'' incident===
On ''U-156's'' fourth patrol (20 August 1942&amp;nbsp;– 16 November 1942), Hartenstein sank and then organised the rescue of the survivors of [[RMS Laconia (1921)|RMS ''Laconia'']], resulting in the &quot;[[Laconia incident|''Laconia'' incident]]&quot; and &quot;[[Laconia Order|''Laconia'' order]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;R83&quot;/&gt;

''U-156'' together with {{GS|U-68|1940|2}} under the command of [[Karl-Friedrich Merten]] departed from Lorient on 20 August 1942 heading for the [[Bay of Biscay]]. Hartenstein received the order to operate against Convoy SL-119 on 25 August. After a two-day pursuit, ''U-156'' found a straggler, the [[SS Clan Macwhirter (1918)|SS ''Clan Macwhirter'']], west of [[Casablanca]]. Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position to avoid detection under the bright moonlight. ''Clan Macwhirter'' was hit by two torpedoes and sank, killing nine members of the crew and two gunners; 79 sailors survived the sinking. Two later sightings on 2 and 6 September did not lead to favourable attack positions.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 1942 ''U-156'' was patrolling off the coast of [[West Africa]] midway between [[Liberia]] and [[Ascension Island]] roughly {{Convert|600|nmi}} south of [[Cape Palmas]]. At 11:37 the [[aft]] [[Port and starboard|port]] lookout sighted a smoke stack at 230 degrees. Hartenstein followed the target, which was zigzagging at {{Convert|14|kn}}, until the general direction of the large [[ocean liner]] became evident. ''U-156'' was running at {{Convert|17|kn}} into a favourable attack position, and Hartenstein ordered the attack at 21:07. He slowed speed at 22:00 and ordered surfaced [[Deflection (military)|deflection]] shots from torpedo tubes I and III. After three minutes and six seconds the first torpedo detonated, then the second.&lt;ref name=&quot;R83&quot;&gt;Röll 2011, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; He had hoped to capture the ship's senior officers, but to his surprise, Hartenstein saw over two thousand people struggling in the water. Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations. ''Laconia'' sank at 23:23.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 01:25 on 13 September 1942 Hartenstein radioed the ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (BdU—commander of U-boats) requesting guidance and confirmation on how to proceed. The BdU responded at 03:45 ordering [[Wolf pack Eisbär]], consisting of {{GS|U-507||2}} under the command of [[Harro Schacht]], {{GS|U-506||2}} under the command of [[Erich Würdemann]] and {{GS|U-459||2}} under the command of [[Georg von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf]], to assist Hartenstein immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; At 06:00 Hartenstein ordered that the following message be sent on the 25m wavelength:&lt;ref name=&quot;Röll p89&quot;&gt;Röll 2011, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;If any ship will assist the ship-wrecked ''Laconia'' crew, I will not attack providing I am not being attacked by ship or air forces. I picked up 193 men. 4°53 South/11°26 West&amp;nbsp;– German submarine&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Röll p89&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:U-156 37-35 Laconia 1942 09 15.jpg|right|thumb|''U-156'' (foreground) and {{GS|U-507||2}} (background) on 15 September 1942|alt=Three-quarter front view over the bow from a submarine conning tower of another submarine with numerous people standing on both submarines, at sea.]]
The message was repeated twice on the international 600m wavelength.&lt;ref name=&quot;Röll p89&quot;/&gt; The BdU later changed the order slightly and ''U-506'', ''U-507'' and the [[Italian submarine Comandante Cappellini|Italian submarine ''Capellini'']] were dispatched. In parallel ''U-156'' was assisting and supplying the survivors in the numerous [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] that kept arriving or were picked up. ''U-506'' arrived at 11:32 on 14 September 1942, followed by ''U-507'' in the afternoon of 15 September.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 92–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Heading to a rendezvous with [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] ships under [[Red Cross]] banners, the U-boats were attacked by a [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army]] [[B-24 Liberator]] [[bomber]] ([[343d Bomb Squadron]]; Lieutenant James D. Harden) at 12:32 on 16 September 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack ordered by Captain [[Robert C. Richardson III]], which killed a number of people in the lifeboats and damaged ''U-156'', forced Hartenstein to abandon the rescue operations.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of survivors were later rescued by British merchant ships and two Vichy French warships, the cruiser [[French cruiser Gloire (1935)|''Gloire'']] and the sloop ''Annamite'', out of [[Dakar]], Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

This event later became known as the &quot;''Laconia'' incident&quot; and led BdU Admiral Karl Dönitz to issue the &quot;''Laconia'' order&quot; to his U-boat commanders that stated in part &quot;No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members of ships sunk ...&quot; At the end of the war, the Laconia Order was unsuccessfully used against Admiral Dönitz in his [[Karl Dönitz#Nuremberg war crimes trials|war crime trial]]. The prosecution failed when Fleet [[Admiral Nimitz]] testified that in the war with Japan the [[United States Navy]] had followed the same general policy as was set forth in the German admiral's directive.&lt;ref name=&quot;NT&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Judgement : Doenitz |work=[[Avalon Project]] at the [[Yale Law School]] |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/juddoeni.asp |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''U-156'' received a radio message on 17 September 1942 indicating that Werner Hartenstein had become the 63rd member of the U-boat service and the 125th of the ''Kriegsmarine'' to be awarded Germany's highest military honour, the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].&lt;ref name=BR257/&gt; Hartenstein issued a bottle of beer to each member of the crew and held a speech honouring the achievements of everyone on board, and telling them that he would wear the decoration in their name.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 1942, ''U-156'' was roughly {{Convert|800|nmi|km mi}} south of [[Freetown]] and the crew was still repairing minor damage, when the lookout spotted a ship at 04:30. The target was the British ship ''Quebec City'', en route from [[Cape Town]] to Freetown. Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position and hit ''Quebec City'' with one torpedo fired from tube VI. Hartenstein surfaced and approached the lifeboats and asked the survivors for the ship's name. ''Quebec City'' did not sink easily and ''U-156'' fired 58 rounds from the 37&amp;nbsp;mm (1.46&amp;nbsp;in) flak gun and seven further shots from the 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm gun before Hartenstein ordered a cease fire. After a direct hit in the ship's stern ammunition magazine and an explosion, ''Quebec City'' slowly sank.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1999, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Clark, a member of ''Quebec City''{{'}}s crew, Hartenstein made sure that the survivors had enough water and provisions and that Captain William Thomas had the exact coordinates. This account of that attack and the impression that the humanitarian actions of Hartenstein made is documented in the book by David Cledlyn Jones, ''The Enemy We Killed, My Friend''.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 119–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones himself disagrees, stating that Hartenstein was concerned about the survivors’ well-being but did not inquire about provisions, nor did he offer additional food or water. Hartenstein did express that it would have been his wish to tow them at least some distance to the African coast, but explained that he was not able to do so as he recently had been attacked while attempting to aid survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1999, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his fifth patrol (16 January 1943 – 8 March 1943), on 8 March 1943, Hartenstein and the entire crew of ''U-156'' were [[killed in action]] by depth charges from a US [[PBY Catalina]] aircraft (VP-53/P-1; Lieutenant E. Dryden), east of [[Barbados]]. The Catalina dropped four Mark 44 Torpex water-bombs at 13:15 from an altitude of {{Convert|75|ft|m}} to {{Convert|100|ft|m}} which straddled ''U-156''. Two bombs were observed to hit the water {{Convert|10|ft|m}} to {{Convert|15|ft|m}} starboard and just aft of ''U-156'', lifting it and breaking it in two, followed by an explosion. At least eleven survivors were seen swimming in the water. The Americans dropped two rubber rafts and rations, and five men were seen to reach one of the rafts. The [[USS Barney (DD-149)|USS ''Barney'']] was dispatched from [[Trinidad]] to rescue the survivors. The search was abandoned on 12 March 1943. ''Korvettenkapitän'' [[Ernst Kals]], chief of the [[2nd U-boat Flotilla]] at [[Lorient]], sent a letter to Hartenstein's parents on 23 April 1943 indicating that their son had been posted as missing in action as of 12 March 1943.{{refn|''U-156'' had sent the last radio message to the BdU on 7 March 1943. This message informed the BdU of heavy air surveillance in the area of operations. The message also informed the BdU of the uselessness of the [[Metox]] radar warning receiver. It also reported of high precision aerial attacks made at night without the aid of search lights. The BdU for the first time requested ''U-156'' to report back on 12 March 1943. The request was repeated again on 16, 17, 18, 19 and for the last time on 24 March 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} US officials announced the destruction of the U-boat on 10 May 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Röll 2011, pp. 135–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten months after his death a service of remembrance was held in Plauen on 15 January 1944. The service was attended by his parents, his sisters and other members of the family, the mayor of Plauen, Eugen Wörner, senior officials and councillors. The local press reported that &quot;His parents have accepted that their loving son will not return home but is resting in peace with his Lord.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1999, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner Hartenstein was portrayed by German actor [[Ken Duken]] in the 2011 TV mini-series ''[[The Sinking of the Laconia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1504261|title=Laconia}}.
