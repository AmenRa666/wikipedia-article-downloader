The '''Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal''' is a military and civil commemorative medal which was awarded to commemorate the opening of the first Union Parliament by the [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] in 1910. It may be considered as the first of many independence medals which were instituted throughout the Commonwealth during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCreery&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher McCreery|title=Commemorative medals of the Queen's reign in Canada, 1952-2012|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781459707566|pages=31, 40, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SACA&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=South African Civil Awards | publisher=South African National Museum of Military History | author=Monick, S | year=1990 | pages=75â€“76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnionCivil&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/militaf/civ10.htm South African Medal Website - Civil - Union of South Africa] (Accessed 1 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institution==
The Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal was instituted by [[George V|King George V]] in terms of Royal Warrant of 3 October 1910, published in Government Gazette no. 59 dated 29 November 1910. The medal was struck to commemorate the opening of the first Parliament of the [[Union of South Africa]] by the Duke of Connaught and it was awarded to military and civilian leaders who took part in the ceremonies to establish the Union of South Africa from the unification of the former Colonies of the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange River Colony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SACA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medal Collector|year=1921|publisher=Dodd Mead and Company|location=New York|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Award criteria==
The medal was awarded to members of the military and naval forces as well as certain civilian leaders who took a prominent part in the proceedings, and only on the recommendation of the Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies. A roll was to be kept and was to be closed six months after the date of the warrant, after which no award could be made except with Royal Approval in very special circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;SACA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnionCivil&quot;/&gt;

==Order of wear==
In the order of wear prescribed by the British [[Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood]], the Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal takes precedence after the [[Northern Ireland Prison Service Medal]] and before the [[Indian Independence Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette&quot;&gt;{{londongazette|issue=56878|supp=y|startpage=3353|date=17 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{main|South African military decorations order of wear#Order of wear}}
With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals which were applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the [[Victoria Cross]], took precedence after all South African decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal takes precedence as shown.&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Notice1982&quot;&gt;Government Notice no. 1982 of 1 October 1954 - ''Order of Precedence of Orders, Decorations and Medals'', published in the Government Gazette of 1 October 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette 27376&quot;&gt;Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, {{OCLC|72827981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
