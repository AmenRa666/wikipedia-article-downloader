'''Mahee Castle''', also known as '''Nendrum Castle''', is a small ruined [[tower house]] near [[Nendrum Monastery]] on [[Mahee Island]] in [[Strangford Lough]], [[County Down]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=Castle&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/CentreforArchaeologicalFieldworkCAF/PDFFileStore/Filetoupload,180970,en.pdf|format=pdf|title=Data Structure Report: Mahee Castle, Mahee Island, County Down|author=Philip Macdonald|accessdate=20 May 2013|publisher= Queen's University Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 1570 by Captain Thomas Browne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strangfordlough.org/strangfordLoughSite/files/f9/f926df3b-a7ab-4e15-8b6c-e25e4bb82a52.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2013|title=Archaeology Strangford|publisher=Strangfordlough.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=excavation&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.excavations.ie/Pages/Details.php?Year=&amp;County=Down&amp;id=6267|accessdate=28 April 2013|title=Mahee Castle, Mahee Island|publisher=Environment and Heritage Service|location=Belfast|last=Ó Baoill|first=Ruairí}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abandoned by the early 17th century, and fell into disrepair.&lt;ref name=excavation2/&gt; In 1923, H.C. Lawlor and the [[Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society]] partly renovated the tower house to avoid further erosion and built a buttress wall to support the northwest corner of the tower.

==Location==
Mahee Castle is in the west of Mahee Island. It is beside a causeway; the only land crossing to the island. Today this causeway is crossed by a narrow road. Mahee Island is near the western shore of Strangford Lough, southeast of the town of [[Comber]]. The tower house sits on a [[drumlin]]. Nearby is a car park.&lt;ref name=Late&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=28 March 2013|page=2|title=Late Medieval Monuments|publisher=Northern Ireland Environment Agency|url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/06_late_medieval_monuments_co_down.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The rectangular tower house guards the bridge onto the island,&lt;ref name=&quot;Planet2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Counties Down &amp; Armagh: Chapter from Ireland Travel Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G7m4MJ6eyZsC|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=1 June 2012|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74321-145-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the southwest there are the remains of a walled enclosure, known as a [[bawn]]. Mahee Castle encloses a boatbay, lying on the shore of the lake, and is quite small, with only two rooms on the ground floor.&lt;ref name=Late/&gt; The main part, the tower-house, is three stories tall, although little remains of the upper floors. The entrance passes under a [[murder-hole]].&lt;ref name=Late/&gt;

==History==
The tower house was built in 1570 by an [[Kingdom of England|English]] soldier, Captain Thomas Browne, after petition to the [[Bishop of Down]]. It was abandoned by the early 17th century. The corner stones may have been taken for local building projects, and stones from the northeastern wall were used to make the causeway to the island.&lt;ref name=excavation2/&gt; During the 15th and 16th centuries, Mahee Castle was near the border of two territories: [[Clandeboye]] to the north and [[Dufferin (barony)|Dufferin]] to the south. At this time the area would have been subject to border conflicts, and Mahee Castle may have changed hands many times.&lt;ref name=Castle/&gt; 

In 1923, under the direction of H.C. Lawlor, restoration works were undertaken by the [[Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society]]. As part of this work, ivy was removed from the wall, cracks were grouted with cement, the top was waterproofed and a buttress wall was built to support the northeast corner of the tower.&lt;ref name=Castle/&gt;

===Excavations===
Under a program sponsored by the [[Environment and Heritage Service of Ireland]], archaeological excavations were carried out at Mahee Castle during 2001 and 2002. This included detailed stratigraphic sequencing, which revealed animal remains and remnants dated to the [[Late Medieval]] period, meaning that the building could have existed before 1570. The goal of the excavations was to evolve a restoration program.&lt;ref name=Castle/&gt;

The archaeological finds consisted of shells and animal bones, knives and an array of pottery ranging over several centuries.&lt;ref name=excavation/&gt; Large quantities of modern glass were found, in addition to flint and pot shards.&lt;ref name=excavation2&gt;{{Cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Phillip|title=Data Structure Report: Mahee Castle, Mahee Island, County Down|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/CentreforArchaeologicalFieldworkCAF/PDFFileStore/Filetoupload,180970,en.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations revealed that the foundation of the tower was on an artificial terrace which was created for the purpose on the northeastern end of a drumlin. The rear end of this terrace had been stabilised by a [[buttress]] retaining wall built in 1923, {{Convert|4|m}} from the tower's southwestern end.&lt;ref name=Castle/&gt;
