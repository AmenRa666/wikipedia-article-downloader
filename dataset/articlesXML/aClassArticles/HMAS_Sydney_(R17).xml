'''HMAS ''Sydney'' (R17/A214/P214/L134)''' was a [[Majestic class aircraft carrier|''Majestic''-class]] light aircraft carrier operated by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). She was built for the [[Royal Navy]] and launched as '''HMS ''Terrible'' (R93)''' in 1944, but was not completed before the end of World War II. The carrier was sold to Australia in 1947, completed, and commissioned into the RAN as ''Sydney'' in 1948.

''Sydney'' was the first of three conventional aircraft carriers{{efn|For the purpose of this article, a conventional aircraft carrier is defined as a ship designed primarily to launch and recover multiple fixed-wing aircraft from a flight deck, and operated as such. This definition does not include seaplane tender {{HMAS|Albatross|seaplane tender|6}}, or the [[Canberra class landing helicopter dock|''Canberra''-class]] amphibious warfare ships.}} to serve in the RAN, and operated as the navy's [[flagship]] during the early part of her career. From late 1951 to early 1952, she operated off the coast of Korea during the [[Korean War]], making her the first carrier owned by a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[Dominion]], and the only carrier in the RAN, to see wartime service. Retasked as a training vessel following the 1955 arrival of her modernised sister ship, {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}, ''Sydney'' remained in service until 1958, when she was placed in reserve as surplus to requirements.

The need for a [[sealift]] capability saw the ship modified for service as a fast troop transport, and recommissioned in 1962. ''Sydney'' was initially used for training and a single supply run in support of [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Malaysia's defence policy against Indonesia]], but in 1965, she sailed on the first voyage to [[Vũng Tàu]], transporting soldiers and equipment to serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. 25 voyages to Vietnam were made between 1965 and 1972, earning the ship the nickname '''&quot;Vung Tau Ferry&quot;'''.

''Sydney'' was decommissioned in 1973, and was not replaced. Despite several plans to preserve all or part of the ship as a [[maritime museum]], tourist attraction, or car park, the carrier was sold to a South Korean steel mill for [[Ship breaking|scrapping]] in 1975.

==Design==
{{main|1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier}}
''Sydney'' was one of six [[Majestic class aircraft carrier|''Majestic''-class]] light fleet carriers; a modified version of the [[Colossus class aircraft carrier|''Colossus''-class]] carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability.&lt;ref name=Hobbs5/&gt; These two classes of carriers were intended to be 'disposable warships': they were to be operated during World War II and scrapped at the end of hostilities or within three years of entering service.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, in ''The Navy and the Nation'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sydney'' was the second ship of the class to enter service, following Canadian aircraft carrier {{HMCS|Magnificent|CVL 21|6}}.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;

The carrier had a standard displacement of 15,740 tons, and a deep displacement of 19,550 tons.&lt;ref name=Cassells164.5&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt; Her length was {{convert|630|ft|m}} [[between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|698|ft|m}} at her longest point, with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|80|ft|m}} and a [[Draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|25|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Cassells164.5/&gt; ''Sydney'' was fitted with four [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s, which provided steam to Parsons single reduction geared turbines; these supplied {{convert|40000|shp|abbr=on|lk=in}} to the two propeller shafts, and allowed the ship to reach {{convert|24.8|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Cassells164.5/&gt; The average size of the ship's company in peacetime was 1,100, but could be increased to 1,300 for wartime deployments.&lt;ref name=Cassells164.5/&gt; Refitting the ship to serve as a transport reduced the standard displacement to 14,380 tons and the ship's company to a core of 544, which was supplemented by trainees and personnel from the [[Royal Australian Navy Reserve]] when required.&lt;ref name=Janes68&gt;Blackman (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships (1968–69)'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassells164.5/&gt;

{{anchor|planned upgrade}}
The Admiralty predicted that all ''Majestic''-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear in the early 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development.&lt;ref name=wright151/&gt; Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade ''Sydney'' to the same or similar standard as sister ship {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|2}}, after the second carrier was delivered.&lt;ref name=ANAM105/&gt; The installation of an [[angled flight deck]] and [[mirror landing aid]], would have allowed ''Sydney'' to operate modern jet aircraft.&lt;ref name=ANAM105&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.&lt;ref name=wright160&gt;Wright, ''Australian Carrier Decisions'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament, sensors, and aircraft===
''Sydney'' was initially armed with thirty [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns]]: eighteen single mountings and six twin mountings.&lt;ref name=Cassells164.5/&gt; During her refit as a troop transport, the carrier's armament was reduced to four single Bofors.&lt;ref name=Janes68/&gt;

The radar suite included two [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 277|Type 277Q]] height-finding sets, one [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 293|Type 293M]] surface search set, one Type 960/281BQ long-range air warning set, and one Type 961 air search set.&lt;ref name=Cassells164.5/&gt;

[[File:HMAS Sydney flight trials 1949.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The deck of an aircraft carrier with a propeller aircraft towards the front of the ship. Some of the ship's superstructure is at right, including a board displaying the wind conditions|A Sea Fury preparing to take off from ''Sydney'' during her flight trials in January 1949]]
As an aircraft carrier, ''Sydney'' operated with the RAN [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm's]] 20th and 21st Carrier Air Groups (CAGs), which were assigned alternately to the carrier.&lt;ref name=Cooper.opp160/&gt; The former was made up of [[805 Squadron RAN|805]] and [[816 Squadron RAN|816]] Squadrons, while the latter was made up of [[808 Squadron RAN|808]] and [[817 Squadron RAN|817]] Squadrons.&lt;ref name=Cooper.opp160/&gt; Twenty-four aircraft, split evenly between [[Hawker Sea Fury]] fighters and [[Fairey Firefly]] attack aircraft, were normally carried.&lt;ref name=Cooper.opp160/&gt; Two [[Supermarine Sea Otter]] amphibious aircraft were carried for rescue duties (but were never required for this purpose); they were not attached to any squadron, but operated as the 'Ship's Flight'.&lt;ref&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The amphibians were removed from the ship at the start of her Korean War deployment, and were replaced by a helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; During the carrier's Korean War deployment, 805 Squadron was added to the 21st CAG to form a 38-strong wartime air group.&lt;ref name=ANAM81/&gt;

While undergoing conversion into a troop transport, the ability to operate aircraft was removed from ''Sydney''.&lt;ref name=Cooper.opp160/&gt; However, on seven of the [[troopship]]'s twenty-five voyages to Vietnam, she carried a flight of four [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters, sourced from either [[725 Squadron RAN|725]] or [[817 Squadron RAN|817 Squadron]], for anti-submarine surveillance.&lt;ref name=Coop204&gt;Cooper, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NottPayne33&gt;Nott &amp; Payne, ''The Vung Tau Ferry'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and acquisition==
The ship was laid down by [[HM Dockyard Devonport]] in England as HMS ''Terrible'' on 19 April 1943, with the [[Viscountess Astor]] presiding over the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Cassells165&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only aircraft carrier of the [[Colossus class aircraft carrier|''Colossus'']] or ''Majestic'' classes to be constructed in a '[[royal dockyard]]': a dockyard owned and operated by the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, in ''The Navy and the Nation'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 30 September 1944 by the wife of British politician [[Duncan Sandys]].&lt;ref name=Cassells165/&gt; Work on the ship continued until the end of World War II, when the Admiralty ordered the suspension of all warship construction.&lt;ref name=Hobbs5&gt;Hobbs, ''HMAS Melbourne II – 25 Years On'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aircraft carrier Terrible launch.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of the bow of an aircraft carrier as it slides backwards down a slipway. Crowds are gathered around the slipway, underneath several cranes|Launch of HMS ''Terrible'', which would later become HMAS ''Sydney'']]

A post-war review by the Australian government's Defence Committee recommended that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, ''From Empire Defence to the Long Haul'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; ''Terrible'' and sister ship ''Majestic'', for the combined cost of [[Australian pound|AU£]]2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition.&lt;ref name=Hobbs5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, ''From Empire Defence to the Long Haul'', pgs. 38, 45–47&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Terrible'' was fitted out as a flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification.&lt;ref name=Hobbs5/&gt;&lt;ref name=wright151&gt;Wright, ''Australian Carrier Decisions'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Terrible'' was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected the installation of the ship's boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the delivery date to October 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Australian Carrier Decisions'', p 155&lt;/ref&gt;

A commissioning crew for the aircraft carrier was raised in Australia from the ship's company of the decommissioned cruiser {{HMAS|Hobart|1934|2}}, which departed from Sydney aboard {{HMAS|Kanimbla|1936|6}} in June 1948.&lt;ref name=ANAM57&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Royal Navy sailors were used to fill out the carrier's complement.&lt;ref name=ANAM57/&gt; ''Terrible'' was handed over to the RAN on 16 December 1948, and was commissioned at noon as HMAS ''Sydney''.&lt;ref name=ANAM60&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons behind the choice in name was so AU£426,000 raised by the HMAS ''Sydney'' Replacement Fund after the loss of the [[HMAS Sydney (D48)|light cruiser HMAS ''Sydney'']] in 1941 could be accessed.&lt;ref name=ANAM60/&gt; ''Sydney'' was the last vessel to be commissioned into the RAN as [[HMAS|'His' Majesty's Australian Ship]]: as after the death of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] on 6 February 1952 and the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], all RAN ships became 'Her' Majesty's.&lt;ref name=Cooper.opp160&gt;Cooper, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', opp. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===1949–1951===
[[File:Fireflies and Sea Furies over HMAS Sydney (R17) c1949.jpg|thumb|Fireflies and Sea Furies overfly ''Sydney'']]
Although commissioned in mid-December 1948, ''Sydney'' did not enter service until 5 February 1949, as work was still being completed.&lt;ref name=Cassells165/&gt; On 25 December 1948, while still fitting out in Devonport, a helicopter from {{USS|Columbus|CA-74|6}} carrying [[Santa Claus]] became the first aircraft to land on ''Sydney''{{'}}s flight deck.&lt;ref&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's sea trials and post-commissioning workup were not without event: in early December 1948, a [[771 Naval Air Squadron]] [[de Havilland Mosquito]] crashed while helping ''Sydney'' calibrate her radar suite, killing both British aircrew, and a RAN pilot undergoing landing qualifications aboard {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|6}} on 17 March 1949 crashed while attempting to land: none were killed, but the pilot's [[Fairey Firefly]] and four others in the deck park were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMAS Sydney arrival 1949.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Grainy photograph of an aircraft carrier manoeuveing around a cliff-faced headland with a lighthouse on top. More landmasses are visible in the background.|''Sydney'' passing through the [[Sydney Heads]] for the first time on 28 May 1949]]
The carrier sailed from Devonport on 12 April 1949, carrying the 20th CAG.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrie, in ''Sea power ashore and in the air'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sydney'' arrived at Jervis Bay on 25 May, where the aircraft of the 20th CAG and training equipment were offloaded for transport to the new naval air station, {{HMAS|Albatross|air station|6}}, before the carrier proceeded to her namesake city.&lt;ref&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sydney'' arrived in Sydney on 2 June, and took over as Flagship of the Australian Fleet from {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} on 25 August.&lt;ref name=ANAM73&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bastock304&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p, 304&lt;/ref&gt; 20th CAG was reembarked during August, and ''Sydney'' exercised in Australian and New Guinea waters until late November.&lt;ref name=ANAM73/&gt; From January to April 1950, the carrier continued training exercises and visited ports in south-east Australia and New Zealand, and on 7 June, she departed for England to collect the 21st CAG .&lt;ref name=ANAM74.5&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', pp. 74–5&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st CAG embarked in October, and the carrier returned to Australia in December.&lt;ref name=ANAM74.5/&gt; Before ''Sydney'' departed in late October, the British Admiralty suggested that she be deployed to the [[Korean War]] as relief for {{HMS|Theseus|R64|6}} and her worn-out catapult, but this was withdrawn because of the plan's drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January 1951, ''Sydney'' was part of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of [[Federation of Australia|Australia's Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training exercise in south-east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the [[Royal Hobart Regatta]].&lt;ref name=ANAM80&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; During the exercise, a Sea Fury accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, {{HMNZS|Bellona||6}}: although an inquiry concluded that the pilot had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by ''Sydney''{{'}}s radio aerials could trigger a Fury's firing circuits.&lt;ref name=ANAM80/&gt; ''Sydney'' was presented with the [[Gloucester Cup]] in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950.&lt;ref name=column8&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pfgQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3436,6856700 |title=Column 8 |date=19 April 1951 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Need to find a source that is more authoritative than [[The Sydney Morning Herald#Column 8|Column 8]], a newspaper readers' observations column --&gt; The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, a Sea Fury crashed during a [[rocket-assisted take off]]; the pilot became the carrier's first fatality.&lt;ref name=ANAM81&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean War (1951–1952)===

{{See also|Military history of Australia during the Korean War}}
In March 1951, the [[First Sea Lord]] requested that ''Sydney'' be deployed to Korea while {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} was refitted in Australia, to maintain a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] carrier presence.&lt;ref name=McCaffrie174&gt;McCaffrie, in ''Sea power ashore and in the air'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hobbs66&gt;Hobbs, ''British Commonwealth Carrier Operations of the Korean War'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; This was agreed to, and a 38-strong wartime CAG was formed on 14 May by incorporating the Sea Furies of 805 Squadron into the 21st CAG.&lt;ref name=ANAM81/&gt; Because RAN Fireflies were optimised for anti-submarine warfare, and consequently not fitted with cannon, cannon-equipped RN aircraft were loaned for the duration of ''Sydney''‘s deployment.&lt;ref&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; After completing pre-departure exercises, during which several aircraft were destroyed in non-fatal, weather-induced deck crashes, ''Sydney'' and the destroyer {{HMAS|Tobruk|D37|6}} sailed for Korea on 31 August.&lt;ref name=McCaffrie174/&gt; While en route, the carrier's aircraft were used for a fly-past demonstration over [[Rabaul]] on 6 September, following civil unrest.&lt;ref&gt;ANAM, ''Flying Stations'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; On her arrival, ''Sydney'' became the first aircraft carrier owned by a Commonwealth dominion to see wartime service.&lt;ref name=Hobbs66/&gt;{{efn|Two aircraft carriers (HM Ships {{HMS|Puncher|D79|2}} and {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}}) were crewed by Canadians during World War II.

On 20 July 1973, the Australian government decided that ''Sydney'' was to be decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; A refit planned to start late in the year was cancelled, and on 12 November 1973, ''Sydney'' was paid off and marked for disposal.&lt;ref name=Gillett78/&gt; The ship had sailed {{convert|711549|nmi}} since she was first commissioned: {{convert|315958|nmi}} as an aircraft carrier, and {{convert|395591|nmi}} as a fast troop transport.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; Several suggestions for disposal were made by various companies and agencies.&lt;ref name=Cassells175/&gt; The [[Geelong]] Regional Tourist Authority wanted the ship moored in [[Corio Bay]] for use as a maritime museum, convention centre, and floating casino.&lt;ref name=Cassells175/&gt; The Naval History Society of Australia suggested that the island superstructure be removed and located in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] as a maritime museum, while the owners of the [[Sydney Opera House]] planned to use the ship as a floating car park.&lt;ref name=Cassells175/&gt; [[Request for tender|Tenders]] closed on 7 October 1975, and the ship was sold on 30 October for breaking up as scrap metal to the Dongkuk Steel Mill in Seoul, South Korea for A$673,516.&lt;ref name=GillettWOA131/&gt; ''Sydney'' was towed from her namesake city by a Japanese tugboat on 23 December 1975, leaving at 1300 hours.&lt;ref name=GillettWOA131/&gt;

''Sydney'' had been originally slated for replacement in the 1960s, with rumours circulating that the new ship would either be an [[amphibious assault ship]] of the United States [[Iwo Jima class amphibious assault ship|''Iwo Jima'' class]], or the British carrier {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}}.&lt;ref name=andrews8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind260&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; The assault ship rumour was proven false by the early 1970s, while the acquisition of ''Hermes'' was still under discussion in the 1980s as a possible [[HMAS Melbourne (R21)#Replacement|replacement for sister ship HMAS ''Melbourne'']].&lt;ref name=andrews8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind260/&gt; Following the decommissioning of ''Sydney'', the Australian Defence Force did not possess a long-range troop transportation capability until the modified [[Round Table class landing ship logistics|Round Table-class]] landing ship {{HMAS|Tobruk|L 50|6}} was commissioned in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', pp. 260–1&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's service, along with the [[HMAS Sydney|previous two ships of the name]], is commemorated by a stained-glass window at the [[Naval Chapel, Garden Island NSW|Garden Island Naval Chapel]]. The carrier's chapel and bell were removed and installed at the naval base {{HMAS|Moreton||6}} in 1974, then were relocated to the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]]'s collection in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Cassells178&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; One of ''Sydney''{{'}}s anchors is displayed at the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum (Australia)|Fleet Air Arm Museum]] at {{HMAS|Albatross|air station|6}}.&lt;ref name=Cassells178/&gt;
