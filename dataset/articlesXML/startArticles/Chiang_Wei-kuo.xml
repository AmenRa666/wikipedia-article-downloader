'''Chiang Wei-kuo''' ({{zh|t=蔣緯國|s=蒋纬国|p=Jiǎng Wěiguó}}, or '''Wego Chiang'''; October 6, 1916 &amp;ndash; September 22, 1997) was an adopted son of [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], adoptive brother of [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], retired [[Republic of China Army]] (ROCA) [[general]], and an important figure in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT).  His [[courtesy name]]s were '''Jian'gao''' (建鎬) and '''Niantang''' (念堂).

==Early life==
[[File:Former Residence of Jiang Weiguo in Nanjing 01 2012-11.JPG|thumb|Former residence of Chiang Wei-kuo in [[Nanjing]].]]

As one of two sons of Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Wei-kuo's name has a particular meaning as intended by his father. &quot;Wei&quot; literally means &quot;parallel (of latitude)&quot; while &quot;kuo&quot; means &quot;nation&quot;; in his brother's name, &quot;Ching&quot; literally means &quot;longitude&quot;. The names are inspired by the references in Chinese classics such as the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'', in which &quot;to draw the longitudes and latitudes of the world&quot; is used as a metaphor for a person with great abilities, especially in managing a country.

Born in [[Tokyo]] when Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT were exiled to [[Japan]] by the [[Beiyang Government]], Chiang Wei-kuo has long been speculated to be an offspring of [[Tai Chi-tao]] and a Japanese woman, {{nihongo|Shigematsu Kaneko|重松金子}}.&lt;ref name=xhbig5&gt;2009年08月02日, 人民網, [http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2009-08/02/content_11811296_4.htm 蔣介石、宋美齡的感情危機與蔣緯國的身世之謎], 新華網(港澳臺)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://big5.ifeng.com/gate/big5/book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2010_08/17/1969064_15.shtml 蔣緯國的親媽——重松金子] {{wayback|url=http://big5.ifeng.com/gate/big5/book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2010_08/17/1969064_15.shtml |date=20110720015002 }}, 鳳凰網&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mag.udn.com/mag/people/storypage.jsp?f_ART_ID=392445|title=戴季陶之子？蔣緯國是坦然談身世|publisher=聯合 報|author=寇維勇|date=1989-01-12|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mag.udn.com/mag/people/storypage.jsp?f_ART_ID=392443|title=李敖：據蔣介石日記考證 蔣緯國不是蔣公之子|publisher=聯合報|author=李玉玲|date=1995-01-02|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang Wei-kuo previously discredited any such claims and insisted he was a biological son of Chiang Kai-shek until his later years (1988), when he admitted that he was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Sep 23, 1997, [http://www.chinainformed.com/Archive/x9709/970923.html Last son of Chiang Kai-shek dies], China Informed&lt;/ref&gt;

According to popular gossip, Tai believed knowledge of his Japanese tryst would destroy his marriage and his career, so he entrusted Wei-kuo to Chiang Kai-shek, after the Japanese {{nihongo|Yamada Juntaro|山田純太郎}} brought the infant to [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=xhbig5/&gt; [[Yao Yecheng]] (姚冶誠), a concubine of Chiang Kai-shek at the time, raised Wei-kuo as his foster mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT1/7123058.shtml|title=蔣緯國生父是誰？ 戴傳賢銅像勾起大公案|publisher=聯合報|author=楊湘鈞|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy called Tai his &quot;'''Dear Uncle'''&quot; (親伯).

Chiang moved to the Chiang ancestral home in Xikou Town of [[Fenghua]] in 1910. Wei-kuo later studied Economics at [[Soochow University (Suzhou)|Soochow University]].

==In the Wehrmacht==
With his sibling Chiang Ching-kuo being held as a virtual political hostage in the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Joseph Stalin]] having previously been a student studying in [[Moscow]], Chiang sent Wei-kuo to Germany for a military education at the [[Kriegsschule (Wehrmacht)|Kriegsschule]] in [[Munich]]. Here, he would learn the most up to date German military tactical doctrines, organization, and use of weaponry on the modern battlefield such as the German-inspired theory of the Maschinengewehr (Medium machine gun, at this time, the [[MG-34]]) led squad, incorporation of Air and Armored branches into infantry attack, etc. After completing this training, Wei-kuo completed specialized Alpine warfare training, thus earning him the coveted [[Gebirgsjäger]] (The elite [[Wehrmacht]] Mountain Troop) [[Edelweiss]] sleeve insignia. This was not an easy accomplishment, as part of the training selection included carrying 30 kilos of ruck sack through the Bavarian Alps. Wei-kuo was promoted to [[Fahnenjunker]], or Officer Candidate, and was evidently a fine marksman, as his pictures depict him wearing the [[German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship|Schützenschnur]] lanyard.

Wei-kuo commanded a [[Panzer]] unit during the 1938 [[Austria]]n [[Anschluss]] as a [[Fähnrich]], or sergeant officer-candidate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRY0v7AH2ngC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=h+h+kung+hitler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4_9e6yO6vT&amp;sig=_2IqNEAzXn8_eXdVgadVZzUuLWI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OBbYTZO9GqLx0gGs2Mn8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=wego%20ambassador%20anschluss&amp;f=false|title=Madame Chiang Kai-Shek: China's Eternal First Lady|author=Laura Tyson Li|year=2007|edition=reprint, illustrated|publisher=Grove Press|location=|page=148|isbn=0-8021-4322-9|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading a tank into that country; subsequently, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] of a Panzer unit awaiting to be [[Invasion of Poland|sent]] into [[Poland]]. Before he was given the mobilization order, he was recalled to China.

==Service during the Second Sino-Japanese War==
{{expand section|date=May 2011}}
Upon being recalled from Germany, Chiang Wei-kuo visited the United States as a distinguished guest of the US Army. He gave lectures detailing on German army organizations and tactics. Whilst in the northwest, Chiang Wei-kuo became acquainted with the local generals and organized an armor mechanized battalion to formally take part in the [[National Revolutionary Army]]. In addition, he spent some time in India studying tanks. There, Wei-kuo became a [[Major]] at 28, a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] at 29, a [[Colonel]] at 32 whilst in charge of a tank battalion, and later in Taiwan, a [[Major General]]. Chiang Wei-kuo was stationed at a garrison in [[Xi'an]] in 1941.

==Service during the Chinese Civil War==
{{expand section|date=May 2011}}
During the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Wei-kuo employed tactics he had learned whilst studying in the German Wehrmacht. He was in charge of a [[M4 Sherman]] tank battalion during the [[Huaihai Campaign]] against Mao Zedong's troops, scoring some early victories.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Gary J. Bjorge, (2004). ''[http://cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/bjorge_huai.pdf Moving the Enemy: Operational Art in the Chinese PLA’s Huai Hai Campaign]''. Leavenworth Paper, No.22. Combat Studies Institute Press, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was not enough to win the campaign, he was able to pull back without significant problems. Like many troops and refugees of the Kuomintang, he retreated from Shanghai to Taiwan and moved his tank regiment to [[Taiwan]], becoming a divisional strength regiment commander of the armor corps stationed outside of Taipei.

==Taiwan==
Chiang Wei-kuo continued to hold senior positions in the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] following the ROC retreat to Taiwan. In 1964, following the [[Hukou Incident]] and his subordinate Chao Chih-hwa's attempted [[coup d'état]], Chiang Wei-kuo was punished and never held any real authority in the military again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = 薛化元 | script-title=zh:湖口兵變 | location = 台灣 | publisher = 國家文化資料庫 | date = | pages = |ISBN = | accessdate = 2011-01-22引用 | url = http://nrch.cca.gov.tw/ccahome/website/site20/PDFFiles/0891.pdf | language= zh| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

From 1964 onwards, Chiang Wei-kuo made preparations in establishing a school dedicated in teaching warfare strategy; such a school was established in 1969. In 1975, Chiang Wei-kuo was further promoted to the position of general, and served as president of the Armed Forces University. In 1980, Chiang served as joint logistics commander in chief; then in 1986, he retired from the army, and became National Security Council Secretary-General.

In 1993, Chiang Wei-kuo was employed as the advisor of the president of the Republic of China.

After Chiang Ching-kuo's death, Chiang was a political rival of native Taiwanese [[Lee Teng-hui]], and he strongly opposed Lee's [[Taiwan localization movement]].  Chiang ran as vice-president with Taiwan Governor [[Lin Yang-kang]] in the [[:zh:1990年中華民國總統選舉|1990 ROC indirect presidential election]]. Lee ran as the KMT presidential candidate and defeated the Lin-Chiang ticket.&lt;ref&gt;張昆山, 1990/03/10, [http://issue.udn.com/FOCUSNEWS/LEE/b4.htm 林洋港：婉辭國代連署提名] {{wayback|url=http://issue.udn.com/FOCUSNEWS/LEE/b4.htm |date=20110726002058 }}, 台北報導&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2010年08月25日, [http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2010-08/25/c_12482093_4.htm 李登輝如何搞垮了國民黨], 新華網(港澳臺)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;07/22/2003, [http://big5.huaxia.com/zk/jpwk/zplz/ldhzmm029.html 四、利用“三月政爭”打破聯合掌權], 華夏經緯網&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://big5.ifeng.com/gate/big5/book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2008_08/19/290410_40.shtml &quot;總統&quot;的弟弟] {{wayback|url=http://big5.ifeng.com/gate/big5/book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2008_08/19/290410_40.shtml |date=20110720014914 }}, 鳳凰網&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Chiang's housemaid, Li Hung-mei (李洪美, or 李嫂) was found dead in Chiang's estate in the [[Taipei City]].  The following police investigation discovered a stockpile of sixty guns on Chiang's estate. Chiang himself admitted the possibility of a link between the guns and his maid's death, which was later ruled a suicide by the police.&lt;ref name=peoplebig5&gt;{{Cite book | author = 王利南 | script-title=zh:蔣緯國的回歸夢(連載七) | location = | publisher = 人民日報 | date = 2000年 第十五期 | pages = |ISBN = | accessdate = | url = http://www.people.com.cn/BIG5/paper81/1324/205784.html | language= zh| quote = 第二場風波是蔣緯國藏槍事件，1991年7月6日蔣緯國第二次競選失敗時，台中市警署公布了所謂蔣緯國家中藏有60只靶槍的事情，同時發生了蔣緯國家中一個叫李洪美的女佣神秘死去的案件。蔣緯國公開發表講話認為女佣人神秘死去可能和槍支告發者有關，可能受到威脅后自殺。其實這批靶槍放在家里已經20多年了，也早已成了廢鐵，他早就忘了。所謂李嫂告發事件，因為李嫂神秘死去無法對証，所以很可能是個設計好的陰謀。 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident permanently tarnished Chiang Wei-kuo's name, at a time when the Chiang family was increasingly unpopular on Taiwan and even within the Nationalist Party.

==Personal life==
In 1944, he married Shih Chin-i (石靜宜), the daughter of Shih Feng-hsiang (石鳳翔), a textile tycoon from North West China. Shih died in 1953 during child birth.  Wei-kuo later established the Jinsin Elementary School (靜心小學) in Taipei to commemorate his late wife.

In 1957, Chiang remarried, to Chiu Ju-hsüeh (丘如雪), also known as Chiu Ai-lun (邱愛倫), a daughter of Chinese and German parents.  Chiu gave birth to Chiang's only son, Chiang Hsiao-kang, (蔣孝剛) in 1962.  Chiang Hsiao-kang is the youngest of the [[generation name|Hsiao generation]] of the Chiang family.

Chiang Wei-kuo was also quite active in civil society, where he was the founder of the Chinese Institute of Strategy and Sino-German Cultural and Economic Association, as well as the Chairman of the Republic of China Football Association. He was the first chairman of Jingxin Primary School (靜心小學), and served as the president of the United States Students Association of China.

== Final years ==
In the early 1990s, Chiang Wei-kuo established an unofficial Spirit Relocation Committee (奉安移靈小組) to petition the Communist government to allow his adopted father Chiang Kai-shek and brother Chiang Ching-kuo to be interred in [[mainland China]].&lt;ref name=peoplebig5/&gt; His request was largely ignored by both the Nationalist and Communist governments, and he was persuaded to abandon the petition by his father's widow [[Soong Mei-ling]] in November 1996.

In 1994, a hospital was supposed to be named after him (蔣緯國醫療中心) in Sanchih, [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City), after an unnamed politician donated to Ruentex Financial Group (潤泰企業集團), whose founder was from Sanchih. Politicians questioned the motivation.&lt;ref name=peoplebig5/&gt;

In 1996, the Chiang home on military land was finally demolished by the order of the Taipei municipal government under [[Chen Shui-bian]]. The estate had been constructed in 1971. After Chiang moved elsewhere in 1981, he deeded it to his son. The justification was that his son was not in military service and thus was not entitled to live there.&lt;ref&gt;2005-04-20, [http://big5.cri.cn/gate/big5/gb.cri.cn/3821/2005/04/20/1385@521432.htm 蔣緯國批評“台獨”的親筆信在重慶露面(組圖)], 重慶晨報&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Wei-kuo died at the age of 80, on September 22, 1997, from kidney failure.  He had been experiencing falling blood pressure complicated by diabetes after a 10-month stay at Veteran's General Hospital, [[Taipei]]. He had wished to be buried in [[Suzhou]] on the mainland, but was instead buried at [[Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery]].
