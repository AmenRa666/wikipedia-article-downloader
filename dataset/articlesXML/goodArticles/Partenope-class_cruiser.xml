The '''''Partenope'' class''' was a group of eight [[torpedo cruiser]]s built for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) in the 1880s and 1890s. The class comprised {{ship|Italian cruiser|Partenope||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Minerva||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Euridice||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Urania||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Iride||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Aretusa||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Caprera||2}}, and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Calatafimi||2}}. Based on the earlier cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Tripoli||2}}, the ''Partenope'' class represented a temporary embrace of the ''[[Jeune École]]'', which emphasized the use of cheap torpedo-armed vessels as a means to defeat the much more expensive [[ironclad battleship]]s of the day. To fulfill their intended role, the vessels were armed with five or six {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s.

The ships of the class primarily served in the main Italian fleet throughout their careers. Their time with the fleet was spent conducting training exercises, along with occasional travels to foreign countries. In late 1900s, ''Partenope'' and ''Minerva'' were converted into [[minelayer]]s and ''Euridice'' and ''Calatafimi'' were sold for scrap. Several of the vessels saw action during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911&amp;ndash;12, primarily conducting [[naval gunfire support|shore bombardments]] in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Three more vessels&amp;mdash;''Urania'', ''Aretusa'', and ''Caprera''&amp;mdash;were sold in the later stages of the war or shortly thereafter. ''Partenope'' laid minefields in the [[Adriatic Sea]] after Italy entered [[World War I]] in 1915, and was later sunk by a German [[U-boat]] in March 1918. ''Minerva'' and ''Iride'' survived the war and were sold for scrap in 1921 and 1920, respectively.

==Design==
The design for the ''Partenope'' class was prepared by Engineering Inspector [[Carlo Vigna]], and was based on the earlier torpedo cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Tripoli||2}}, the first modern vessel of the type built by Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 346&amp;nbsp;347&lt;/ref&gt; The development of torpedo cruisers in Italy in the mid-1880s represented a shift away from the emphasis on large [[capital ship]]s that had been built for the previous decade and toward the ideas of the ''[[Jeune École]]'', which emphasized small, fast, torpedo-armed vessels that could damage or destroy the much larger battleships at a fraction of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Partenope'' class were followed by the {{sclass-|Agordat|cruiser|4}}, the last class of torpedo cruisers built by Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 347&amp;ndash;348&lt;/ref&gt;

===General characteristics and machinery===
[[File:Italian cruiser Urania.jpg|thumb|left|''Urania'' shortly after entering service]]
The ships of the ''Partenope'' class were {{convert|70|m|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|73.1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.22|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|3.48|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] from {{convert|821|to|931|MT|sp=us}} normally. Their [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] were steel-built. The ships had a crew of between 96&amp;ndash;121. They were initially fitted with a [[fore-and-aft rig|fore and aft sailing rig]] with two [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]s, but the rigging was later removed. The ships were protected by an armored deck that was up to {{convert|1.6|in|abbr=on}} thick; their [[conning tower]] was armored with the same thickness of steel plate.&lt;ref name=G347&gt;Gardiner, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

Their propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s, each driving a single [[screw propeller]]. Steam was supplied by four coal-fired [[locomotive boiler]]s that were trunked into two widely spaced [[funnel (ship)|funnels]]. Specific figures for each ship's engine performance have not survived, but the ships of the class had top speeds of {{convert|18.1|to|20.8|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|3884|to|4422|ihp|lk=in}}. The ships had a cruising radius of about {{convert|1800|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;

''Partenope'' and ''Minerva'' were reboilered in 1906&amp;ndash;08 and 1909&amp;ndash;10, respectively, with new oil-fired models. ''Partenope''{{'}}s performance after the refit was {{convert|17.05|kn}} from {{convert|2481|ihp|abbr=on}}, while ''Minerva'' was faster, at {{convert|18.28|kn}} from {{convert|3524|ihp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;

===Armament===
The ''Partenope''-class cruisers, with the exception of ''Caprera'', were armed with a [[main battery]] of one {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] (cal.) gun and six {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} 43-cal. guns mounted singly. They were also equipped with three {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on|1}} 20-cal. guns in single mounts. ''Caprera'' instead had two 120&amp;nbsp;mm guns, four 57&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and two of the 37&amp;nbsp;mm weapons. The ships' primary offensive weapon was their {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s; ''Partenope'' and ''Caprera'' had five tubes, while the rest of the class had six.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;

During their refits in the late 1900s, ''Partenope'' and ''Minerva'' were converted into [[minelayer]]s. Their armament was revised significantly, and now consisted of a pair of {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} guns, four 57&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and two 37&amp;nbsp;mm guns.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt; ''Partenope'' was equipped to carry sixty [[naval mine]]s, with a bank of thirty mines on a platform on each side of the ship;&lt;ref&gt;Alger, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; the details of ''Minerva''{{'}}s mine handling equipment and storage are unknown.

==Service history==
[[File:NH 88659 cruiser Iride.tiff|thumb|''Iride'', probably in the late 1890s]]

For much of the ships' careers, they were assigned to the main Italian fleet, where they were frequently occupied with conducting training exercises. These exercises frequently [[Military simulation|gamed]] attacks by the French fleet, such as the maneuvers conducted in 1893, which simulated a French attack on [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Naval and Military Notes – Italy&quot;, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Thursfield, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, ''Partenope'' joined a squadron that visited Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Neal, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year took part in an international naval demonstration off [[Crete]] in an attempt to defuse tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; ''Euridice'' took part in a similar demonstration, again off Crete, in 1897; this was a reaction to the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] that had broken out that year.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1908, ''Partenope'' was converted into a minelayer, and ''Minerva'' underwent a similar conversion in 1909&amp;ndash;1910.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt; Two ships, ''Calatafimi'' and ''Euridice'', were discarded in early 1907.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;

During the [[Italo-Turkish War]], ''Partenope'' operated off Libya, bombarding Ottoman troops and supporting Italian forces.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, pp. 35, 47&amp;ndash;48&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iride'' escorted a [[troopship]] convoy to North Africa and then conducted shore bombardments.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, pp. 65–66, 84&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aretusa'' was stationed in the [[Red Sea]] at the outbreak of the war,&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and she briefly engaged the Ottoman cruiser {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aretusa'', joined by ''Caprera'' in early 1912, thereafter participated in bombardment and blockade operations against Ottoman ports in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 51, 90&lt;/ref&gt; ''Minerva'' was assigned to the 4th Division at the time, but did not see action during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Three more members of the class were sold for scrap after the end of the war, with ''Urania'' and ''Aretusa'' being stricken in 1912 and ''Caprera'' being discarded in early 1913.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;

''Partenope'' and ''Minerva'' laid a series of defensive minefields in the [[Adriatic Sea]] after Italy entered [[World War I]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, Dickson, &amp; Worth, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; They did not see action for much of the rest of the war, owing to the cautious strategies adopted by Italy and its enemy across the Adriatic, Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1918, the German [[U-boat]] {{ship|SM|UC-67||2}} torpedoed and sank ''Partenope'' north of [[Bizerte]], Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iride'' and ''Minerva'' survived the war and were discarded in December 1920 and May 1921, respectively.&lt;ref name=G347/&gt;
