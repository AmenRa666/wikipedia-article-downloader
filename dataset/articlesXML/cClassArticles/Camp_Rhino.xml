[[Forward operating base]] (FOB) Rhino, also known as '''Camp Rhino''', was the first US land base established in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].  It was located in the [[Registan Desert]], {{convert|100|nmi|km|-1}} southwest of [[Kandahar]].

==History==
The site was observed by [[United States Navy SEALs]] for four days prior to [[Operation Rhino]] led by the United States Army's [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] ([[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Ranger Battalion]]). The raid included both [[Airborne forces|Airborne]] and [[Air Assault]] insertions. Objective Rhino was then handed off to U.S. Marines from the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] (15th MEU) and Charlie Company BLT 1/1 (Battalion Landing Team) and used to build up a coalition footprint to conduct leading combat operations in [[Helmand]] and [[Kandahar]] provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/Afghanistan/Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom.htm#p14a|title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Raid on Kandahar, October 2001 – March 2002|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Rangers' capture of Objective Rhino, it is believed that the small desert outpost was being built for use as a drug distribution hub. The facility was surrounded by a {{convert|10|ft|m|0|sing=on}} wall and four hardened guard towers.  Within the facility there were numerous new warehouses, offices, and even a small mosque which was declared off limits to all personnel as a sign of respect.  The paint on some of the buildings was barely dry.  Sealed roads ran throughout the camp, and it was also bisected by a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} cement moat.

Camp Rhino was in use from 26 November 2001 to 1 January 2002. At its peak, the camp contained about 1100 U.S. Marines, under command of [[James Mattis|Brigadier General James Mattis]], as well as U.S. soldiers and U.S. Navy [[Seabee]]s, Australia [[Special Air Service Regiment]] (SASR), and dozens of embedded reporters.

==Strategic importance==
Camp Rhino was the US-led coalition's first strategic foothold in [[Afghanistan]] and made the ground war in Afghanistan possible.  While Rhino was being established, fierce battles between [[Taliban]] and [[Northern Alliance]] troops were still underway near [[Kandahar]].  But then the Taliban, realizing that US forces were now very close and were willing to operate at night, capitulated and retreated north to the mountains of [[Tora Bora]].

A Light Armored Reconnaissance Element of the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] and coalition forces, supported by [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU]], deployed forward to capture the Taliban stronghold of [[Kandahar International Airport]] in mid-December 2001, following a three-week period of consolidation at Rhino. [[Kandahar International Airport]] then became the main coalition base in southern Afghanistan, while [[Bagram Air Base]] was established further to the north near [[Kabul]].  The majority of forces who had initially based out of Rhino had re-located to Kandahar by Christmas Day, mostly transported by fixed-wing transport aircraft.
