The '''Confederate Memorial''' is a [[memorial]] in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], in the United States, that commemorates members of the armed forces of the [[Confederate States of America]] who died during the [[American Civil War]]. Authorized in March 1906, former [[Confederate States Army]] [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]] and sculptor [[Moses Jacob Ezekiel]] was commissioned by the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] in November 1910 to design the memorial. It was unveiled by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on June 4, 1914 (the 106th anniversary of the birth of [[Jefferson Davis]], president of the Confederacy).

The memorial grounds have changed slightly due to burials and alterations since 1914. Some major changes to the memorial were proposed over the years, but none has been implemented. Since the memorial's unveiling, the [[President of the United States]] has almost always sent a [[Wreath#Funeral and memorial wreaths|funeral wreath]] to be laid at the memorial every [[Memorial Day]]. Some presidents have declined to do so, and the tradition is controversial.

==Creating a Confederate space at Arlington==
[[File:New-Meigs.jpg|thumb|Brigadier General Montgomery C. Meigs instituted a ban on the decoration of Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery.]]
Arlington National Cemetery was established in June 1864 as a cemetery for Union ([[United States of America]]) Civil War dead. The first military burial at Arlington (a white soldier, [[William Henry Christman]]) was made on May 13, 1864,&lt;ref name=&quot;CLP&quot;&gt;Cultural Landscape Program. Arlington House: The Robert E. Lee Memorial Cultural Landscape Report. National Capital Region. National Park Service. U.S. Department of the Interior. Washington, D.C.: 2001. Accessed 2012-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennee4&quot;&gt;[http://www.freedmenscemetery.org/resources/documents/arlington-section27.pdf Dennee, p. 4.] Accessed 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; However, formal authorization for burials was not given by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] ([[Quartermaster General of the United States Army]]) until June 15, 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLP&quot; /&gt;

Confederate military personnel were among those initially buried at Arlington. Some were [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who died while in custody or who were executed as [[spy|spies]] by the Union,&lt;ref name=&quot;Parzych43&quot;&gt;Parzych, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but some were battlefield dead. For example, in 1865, General Meigs decided to build [[Civil War Unknowns Monument|a monument to Civil War dead]] in a grove of trees near the flower garden south of the [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Robert E. Lee mansion]] at Arlington.&lt;ref name=CLP /&gt; The bodies of 2,111 Union and Confederate dead within a {{convert|35|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of the city of Washington, D.C., were collected. Some of the dead had been interred on the battlefield, but most were full or partial remains discovered unburied where they died in combat. None was identifiable. Although Meigs had not intended to collect the remains of Confederate war dead, the inability to identify remains meant that both Union and Confederate dead were interred below the [[cenotaph]] he built.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler, Heidler, and Coles, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The vault was sealed in September 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLP&quot; /&gt; Other Confederate battlefield dead were also buried at Arlington, and by the end of the war in April 1865 several hundred of the more than 16,000 graves at Arlington contained Confederate dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parzych43&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacob157&quot;&gt;Jacob, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government did not permit the decoration of Confederate graves at the cemetery, however. As Quartermaster General, Meigs had charge of the Arlington cemetery (he did not retire until February 6, 1882),&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Bushong, p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt; and he refused to give families of Confederates buried there permission to lay flowers on their loved ones' graves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacob157&quot; /&gt; In 1868, when families asked to lay flowers on Confederate graves on Decoration Day (now known as [[Memorial Day]]), Meigs ordered that the families be barred from the cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacob157&quot; /&gt; Union veterans' organizations such as the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR; whose membership was open only to Union soldiers) also felt that rebel graves should not be decorated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trout126&quot;&gt;Trout, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, GAR members stood watch over Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery to ensure they were not visibly honored on Decoration Day.&lt;ref&gt;Marling, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Cemetery officials also refused to allow the erection of any monument to Confederate dead&lt;ref name=&quot;Trout126&quot; /&gt; and declined to permit new Confederate burials (either by reburial or through the death of veterans).&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martinez177&quot;&gt;Martinez and Harris, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1898 McKinley speech===
The federal government's policy toward Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery changed radically at the end of the 19th century.

The 10-week [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 marked the first time since the Civil War that Americans from the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and the [[Deep South|South]] fought a common enemy. The war marked the end of strong sectional feeling and the &quot;healing&quot; of the wounds of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Spanish–American War ended in August, a series of celebrations (&quot;peace jubilees&quot;) were held in major cities in the United States from October through December. However, many Southerners were lukewarm in their support for the war and for President [[William McKinley]]'s territorial expansion in [[Cuba]] and the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not clear that the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] (the agreement ending the Spanish–American War) would win the approval of the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 624; Nickeson, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1898, [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] affiliated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] led an [[Rebellion|insurrection]] against a coalition of white and [[African American]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] who won the [[mayor]]alty and all [[City council|council]] seats in the city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. The [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]] lasted several days, led to many black deaths, and caused the mass exodus of 2,000 blacks from the city (turning Wilmington from a black-majority city into a white-majority city).&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p. 158-172&lt;/ref&gt; McKinley refused to intervene in the insurrection, and was strongly criticized by African Americans for his inaction. President McKinley made a {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip across the Deep South by [[train]] in December 1898 to promote Senate ratification of the Treaty of Paris and racial harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt; McKinley had seen untended Confederate graves in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], during his campaign for the presidency in 1896, and the sight bothered him.&lt;ref name=&quot;B181&quot;&gt;Blair, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason for his Southern train tour was to show black Southerners that he still supported them and wanted improved race relations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; So in his speech at the Atlanta Peace Jubilee on December 14, 1898, McKinley not only celebrated the end of sectionalism but also announced that the federal government would now begin tending Confederate graves since these dead represented &quot;a tribute to American valor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;B181&quot; /&gt; The speech impressed many Southerners, who saw it as a grand gesture of reconciliation and a symbol of national unification.

==The Confederate section at Arlington==
[[File:Dr Samuel E Lewis - former surgeon Confederate States Army - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dr. Samuel E. Lewis, 1904]]
The McKinley speech encouraged Dr. Samuel E. Lewis to seek additional improvements to the care and treatment of Confederate graves. Lewis, a former [[Confederate States Army]] (CSA) surgeon who then practiced medicine in [[Washington, D.C.]], was the leader (&quot;commander&quot;) of the Charles Broadway Rouss Camp No. 1191 of the [[United Confederate Veterans]] (UCV), a veterans organization for those who fought for the Confederacy.{{efn|Camp No. 171 was the original UCV chapter in Washington, D.C. Camp No. 1191 split off in May 1899 in protest against the way Camp 171 was being operated. See: &quot;Organized a New Camp.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' May 4, 1899.}} Lewis had inventoried all Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery in early fall 1898 as part of the local group's historic documentation efforts. He discovered 136 identifiable Confederate graves, far more than the six or seven cemetery officials assumed existed. The graves were scattered all over the existing burial grounds, and the headstones were similar to those of civilian employees and African American &quot;[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]]&quot; (runaway slaves). The similarity to the headstones of black people especially angered Lewis. In early 1899, his group discovered another 189 graves in the [[Armed Forces Retirement Home|Soldiers' Home]] [[United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery|National Cemetery]] in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair188&quot;&gt;Blair, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 1899, Lewis and other Confederate veterans sent a petition to President McKinley asking that the Confederate dead at Arlington be disinterred and reburied in a &quot;Confederate section&quot;. McKinley approved of the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair188&quot; /&gt; Former Confederate [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Brigadier general|Brigadier General]] [[Marcus Joseph Wright]] (by 1898 an agent of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] collecting Confederate war records) drafted legislation to approve the reinterments, and Senator [[Joseph Roswell Hawley]] (a former [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of volunteers for the Union) introduced it in Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole132&quot;&gt;Poole, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress approved the bill in 1900 and authorized $2,500 for the plan,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair188&quot; /&gt; which specified that the reburials occur near the field where Spanish–American War dead had recently been interred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole132&quot; /&gt; McKinley signed the bill into law on June 6, 1900. A list of the dead at both Arlington and the Soldiers' Home was published so that families who wished to do so might remove their loved ones' remains from Arlington and reinter them closer to home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair188&quot; /&gt;

===Opposition to the section===
After June 1900, however, several women's groups—among them the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] (UDC) and the Ladies of the Hollywood Memorial Association{{efn|The association maintained [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. A large number of Confederate troops and generals as well as Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] were buried there. It is considered the South's premiere cemetery, as former presidents [[James Monroe]] and [[John Tyler]] are also buried there. See: Yalom, p. 260.}}—opposed allowing any Confederate dead to remain at Arlington. The reasons for this resistance were complex and varied. Most of the women's societies argued that Confederate dead should lie in Southern soil, Confederate families should not rely on Union &quot;charity&quot; (e.g., free grave space at Arlington), the GAR would desecrate the graves, and Confederate soldiers should rest among their comrades in Southern cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 188-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the women's societies also saw reburial of Confederate dead in the South as a way of maintaining their relevance and recruiting new members, while others wanted reburial in the South so they could erect pro-Confederate monuments over the graves and keep the Confederate cause alive. Some groups perceived the offer of a Confederate section at Arlington as a sign of Southern accommodationism with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between different women's societies also played a role. For example, the Confederate Southern Memorial Association (CSMA) also opposed the creation of a Confederate section at Arlington. The CSMA was formed in 1900 as an umbrella group for the [[Ladies' Memorial Association|ladies' memorial associations]], which were rapidly losing members. The CSMA feared being absorbed by the UDC, which had formed in 1894 both as a commemorative body and as a benevolent society for Confederate women and patriotic goals.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, &quot;United Daughters of the Confederacy&quot;, p. 559; Gross, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The CSMA sought a way to differentiate itself from the larger body, and so advocated reburial, too—but not in Richmond (as the UDC did) but in local towns and cities throughout the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair191&quot;&gt;Blair, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foster153&quot; /&gt;

To overcome this opposition, Lewis tried to identify support for a &quot;Confederate section&quot; as well as convince the administration to proceed. He secured the endorsement of a Confederate section by a number of former high-ranking Confederate officers. He also polled other chapters of the United Confederate Veterans and found they approved of the legislation as well. Lewis and his supporters argued that only the federal government had the financial resources to adequately maintain the large number of Confederate graves found at Arlington and the Soldiers' Home, and that failing to spend the $2,500 appropriation would discourage Congress from protecting Confederate graves in the future. Critically, Lewis won the support of [[Hilary A. Herbert]], an [[Alabama|Alabaman]] and former [[colonel]] in the [[8th Regiment Alabama Infantry]] who served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1877 to 1893 and as [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[Grover Cleveland]]. Herbert argued that leaving the Confederate graves at Arlington made a greater impression on the public than isolating them in the pro-Confederate South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair190&quot;&gt;Blair, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' efforts convinced most members of Congress and relevant administration officials that the women's groups represented only a small minority of Southerners. He did so in part by winning the support of other key Southern groups. First he won over his own organization, the United Confederate Veterans, which in March 1901 unanimously passed resolutions asking the government to proceed with creation of the Confederate section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair190&quot;&gt;Blair, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foster153&quot;&gt;Foster, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the support of the Ladies Southern Relief Society, an important Confederate women's group in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis also won over Congress and the administration by undermining the UDC and CSMA's opposition to the reburial plan. Once more working through his own veterans' group, the UCV convinced a number of government officials that the CSMA was too new (just a year old) to accurately represent Southern views.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis dampened the outcry by the CSMA and other ladies' memorial associations by convincing them that their importance in the South would be maintained. Lewis realized that these groups continued to thrive in part because they set the dates for and organized Civil War commemorations. Lewis convinced the CSMA and many Southern women's groups that they would be able to do so at Arlington as well, which would enhance their prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; These tactics worked: In the late spring of 1901, a delegation from several Confederate veterans' groups visited [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Elihu Root]] and convinced him to proceed with the reburials at Arlington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair190&quot; /&gt;

===Process of reburial===
[[File:Layout of the Confederate Section - Arlington National Cemetery - 1903.jpg|thumb|The 1903 layout of the burials in the Confederate section.]]
After the process of informing families ended, reburials began in April 1901 and were completed the following October.&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonReclaim&quot; /&gt; It is unclear how many Confederate dead were disinterred and reburied in the new Confederate section. In 1912, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Committee on Appropriations]] observed that legal authority existed for interment of 264 Confederate soldiers—128 of which came from the Soldiers' Home National Cemetery and 136 of which came from Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Subcommittee on Appropriations, p. 702.&lt;/ref&gt; More modern sources provide different numbers, however. One historian says just 128 bodies were reinterred,&lt;ref name=&quot;Foster153&quot; /&gt; although the majority of sources say 264&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair188&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morman, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/docs/factsheets/history.pdf Communications &amp; Outreach Support Division. &quot;History and Development of the National Cemetery Administration.&quot; National Cemetery Administration.

The Confederate dead were reburied on {{convert|3.5|acre|m2}} of ground on the west side of Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonReclaim&quot; /&gt; The graves were laid out in a pattern of concentric circles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair188&quot; /&gt; rather than straight rows as elsewhere at Arlington, to emphasize the South's attempt to find its place in the new united country.&lt;ref&gt;Poole, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscaping of the area was completed in the spring of 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonReclaim&quot; /&gt;

The 1899 legislation required the federal government to provide a standard issue tombstone for the new Confederate graves. These headstones were {{convert|36|in|cm}} tall, {{convert|10|in|cm}} wide, and {{convert|4|in|cm}} thick. They were made of granite or marble, as the others in the cemetery were.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole132&quot; /&gt; The tops of these markers were pointed, to make the Confederate graves stand out from Union ones (not, as legend would have it, so that Northerners would not sit on them and desecrate them).&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole132&quot; /&gt; Each marker was inscribed with a number, the name of the deceased, the regiment in which the individual served, and the inscription &quot;C.S.A.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair188&quot; /&gt;

The first [[Confederate Memorial Day]] observances in the Confederate section were held on June 7, 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honors1903&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, p. 154; &quot;For Confederate Graves.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

==Building a memorial==
War Department officials laid out the circular pattern of the graves in the Confederate section. The circular area contained a cruciform set of walkways whose north-south axis was parallel to the road that is now McPherson Drive. At the intersection of the walkways was a grassy area surrounded by a circular path. Although the 1900 reburial legislation did not mention a memorial, on its maps the Army Corps of Engineers marked this central grassy area with an &quot;M&quot;—indicating that it was reserved for a memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ToHonorDead&quot; /&gt;{{efn|Hilary A. Herbert argued that it was Congress' intent for a memorial to be erected in the Confederate section. See: &quot;Seek Aid for Shaft.&quot; ''The Sunday Star.'' February 2, 1912.}} This did not go unnoticed by Confederate groups, several of which began independently discussing the construction of a memorial as soon as it became clear that the Army would allow one to be built in the Confederate section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox150&quot;&gt;Cox, &quot;The Confederate Monument at Arlington...&quot;, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the groups which sought to build a memorial was the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). Mrs. Mary Taliaferro Thompson of Stonewall Jackson Chapter No. 20{{efn|The UDC is divided into state divisions, with each state containing one or more chapters, or local bodies. Many early local chapters were named for a Confederate general or statesman.}} (located in Washington, D.C.) asked the War Department in 1902 for permission to construct a memorial in the Confederate section. Her request was not granted. She asked again in 1903 and 1905, but was turned down each time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert14&quot; /&gt; Nonetheless, various UDC chapters, convinced they would eventually be successful, began raising money for a memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, ''Dixie's Daughters'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, Robert E. Lee Chapter No. 644, UDC (also located in Washington, D.C.) began raising money for a monument. It had about $111 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|111|1904}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) by the end of February 1904, and later raised $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1000|1905}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars). Stonewall Jackson Chapter No. 20 also raised $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Thompson tried again to win approval for a monument in 1906. This time she was successful, in large part because she worked closely with [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[John Sharp Williams]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Mississippi]]), the influential [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives#Minority Leader|House Minority Leader]]. On March 4, 1906, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[William Howard Taft]] gave the UDC permission to erect a memorial in the center of the Confederate section at Arlington. Taft's letter, however, reserved to the War Department the right to approve the monument's design and inscriptions.{{efn|There is nothing in the record to indicate that the UDC submitted the draft or final design of the memorial or its inscriptions to the War Department for review or approval.}} On March 13, 1906, Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, President-General of the UDC, accepted Taft's terms.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taft's letter was made public by Rep. Williams at Confederate Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery on June 4, 1906. Williams called for a monument to be built, and suggested an inscription (which was not used). He then donated the first $50 toward the memorial's construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConfederatesHonor06&quot; /&gt;

===Forming the ACMA===
[[File:Cornelia Branch Stone - 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Cornelia Branch Stone in 1908. Mrs. Stone conducted most of the fund-raising for the Confederate Memorial, and chaired the design committee.]]
The Arlington Confederate Memorial Association (ACMA) was founded in 1906, although sources differ as to the exact date. On June 7, 1906, John M. Hickey of Camp No. 171, United Confederate Veterans, submitted a resolution to his local chapter authorizing the establishment of a committee on &quot;ways and means&quot; to erect the memorial. According to Hilary A. Herbert, the resolution in its final form established the ACMA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert14&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; But historian Karen Cox puts the organization's founding at a meeting organized by Thompson and sponsored by the UDC on November 6, 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox150&quot; /&gt; Local news media, however, reported that the founding occurred on December 28, 1906, when Confederate organizations in Washington, D.C., met under the auspices of Camp 171.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorConfedDead&quot;&gt;&quot;Honor Confederate Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' December 30, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the list of founding directors is not agreed upon. Herbert says the board consisted of himself as well as Hickey, J.T. Callaghan, James McDowell Carrington, F.M. Hare, the Reverend Doctor Randolph H. McKim, and Judge [[Seth Shepard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert14&quot; /&gt; The ''Washington Post'', however, did not list Callaghan, Carrington, or Hare and instead included former [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Brigadier general|Brigadier General]] [[Frank Crawford Armstrong]] (CSA), former [[Missouri]] [[List of United States Senators from Missouri|Senator]] [[Francis Cockrell|Francis M. Cockrell]], and former [[West Virginia]] [[List of United States Senators from West Virginia|Senator]] [[Charles J. Faulkner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorConfedDead&quot; /&gt;

It quickly became apparent, however, that the scope of work under discussion by the ACMA would overwhelm the small board of directors. Herbert records that the ACMA submitted a petition in November 1906 asking the UDC to support the ACMA organizationally and financially. This resolution was approved by the UDC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert16&quot; /&gt; But still the work overwhelmed the ACMA. By mid-1907, it was clear that the UDC would have to completely take over the memorial's fund-raising, design, and construction.{{efn|Cox argues it was the lack of funds which led the ACMA to turn over its work to the UDC. She points out that only about $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1000|1907}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) had been raised by November 1907. It is difficult to reconcile Cox's claim with numerous other reports, cited elsewhere in this article, that indicate the ACMA had $3,000 to $4,000 on hand, and pledges of $10,000. Furthermore, the ACMA's decision to allow the UDC to support the monument project was made in November 1906, and UDC completely took over the project in June 1907. Citing the November 1907 fund-raising levels seems irrelevant to the June 1907 decision to transfer the ACMA's duties to the UDC. See: Cox, &quot;The Confederate Monument at Arlington...&quot;, p. 151.}} On June 19, 1907, Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, President-General of the UDC, asked the ACMA to delegate its functions to the UDC, with the UDC and [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] (SCV) retaining certain powers to themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert16&quot; /&gt; The ACMA quickly agreed.

The UDC asked Cornelia Branch Stone (a member of Veuve Jefferson Davis Chapter No. 17 in [[Galveston, Texas]], and chair of the UDC committee which awarded the organization's Southern Cross of Honor){{efn|Cornelia Branch Stone was the wife of businessman Henry Clay Stone, a Virginian who took up residence in Galveston, Texas.

(Stone noted that Charles Broadway Rouse Camp No. 1191 declined to participate.) A second meeting on December 21 led to the ACMA's agreement to re-establish itself as a constituent body of the UDC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=RA2-PA281#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Sixteenth Annual Convention...'', p. 281-282.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A committee was appointed by the UDC to revise the ACMA's [[articles of incorporation]]. Under the new articles, the President-General of the UDC became the ''ex officio'' President of the ACMA. The board of directors consisted of a representative from each state in which the UDC had a chapter, with this individual to be appointed by the President-General of the UDC in consultation with the UDC state division president. An Executive Committee was also created. Its membership consisted of representatives from UCV Camp No. 171 and Camp No. 1191; one representative from Camp No. 172 of the SCV; and three representatives to be appointed by the five UDC chapters in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert1617&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive committee was empowered to appoint (with concurrence of the president) a nine-member Advisory Board,&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert1617&quot; /&gt; which was chaired by the association's treasurer.&lt;ref name=&quot;H7&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association's new officers consisted of a president, first and second vice presidents, corresponding and recording secretaries, and a treasurer. An Executive Board oversaw the organization between meetings of the board of directors. The executive board consisted of the first vice president (who served as chairman), treasurer, recording secretary, and corresponding secretary. A representative chosen from the board of directors served as its vice-chairman, and five other members of the board of directors served as members of the executive board.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACMA's first president was Cornelia Branch Stone, who served from 1907 to 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert17&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

For its part, the UDC supervised the work of the ACMA through a committee composed of eight delegates from each of the five chapters of the UDC then extant in the District of Columbia. The ''ex officio'' chairman of the committee was the President of the Division of the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;14UDC24&quot; /&gt; An advisory committee was also established, which consisted of four members from UCV Camp No. 171, four members from UCV Charles Broadway Rouss Camp No. 1191, and four members from each chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;14UDC24&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Fourteenth Annual Convention...'', p. 24.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; These two committees were established to oversee the work of the ACMA. But, in fact, the UDC agreed to accept the work of the ACMA &quot;without conditions&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;14UDC24&quot; /&gt;—which meant the UDC had no real control over the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, &quot;The Confederate Monument at Arlington...&quot;, p. 150, fn. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fund-raising===
During the period between the ACMA's formation and its reconstitution, the UDC contributed $500 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|500|1906}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert16&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post'' reported that the ACMA had $3,000 to $4,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3000|1906}}}} to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4000|1906}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) on hand in December 1906, with a goal of raising $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1906}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars). Furthermore, the UDC agreed to donate $1,500 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1500|1906}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) annually beginning in 1907 until the memorial was finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonorConfedDead&quot; /&gt;

Fund-raising occurred rapidly during Stone's tenure as president,&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert17&quot; /&gt; but there are conflicting accounts of just how much money was raised over the next several years. In July 1907, the press reported that multi-millionaire stockbroker [[Thomas Fortune Ryan]] donated $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|10000|1907}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) to the Confederate monument fund.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ryan Contributes $10,000.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' July 26, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Hilary A. Herbert, the ACMA's First Vice President and the chief executive officer of the association, the ACMA had raised just $3,460 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3460|1907}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) by November 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert16&quot; /&gt; To boost fund-raising, the ACMA sought and won the endorsement of several prominent individuals. Former CSA [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General]] [[Stephen D. Lee]] strongly endorsed the memorial project in September 1907 and asked all UCV camps to contribute to the fund-raising drive.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arlington Shaft to Gray.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' September 24, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1908, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] also endorsed the project in very strong terms.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For Confederate Monument.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 7, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1908, the ACMA reported $8,230 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|8230|1908}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) in funds raised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=RA1-PA279#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Fifteenth Annual Convention...'', p. 279.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; This sum increased to just under $13,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|13000|1909}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=RA2-PA285#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Sixteenth Annual Convention...'', p. 285.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and to just under $20,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|20000|1910}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;17UDC293&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=RA3-PA293#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Seventeenth Annual Convention...'', p. 293.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the UDC sold [[Christmas Seal]]s to raise money for the memorial.

==Designing the memorial==
[[File:Moses Ezekiel - 1914.png|thumb|Moses Ezekiel in 1914.]]
===Choosing an artist===
Stone stepped down as both UDC and ACMA President in October 1909. One of her last acts was to propose the appointment of a memorial design committee. She suggested creating a seven-member committee and offered for the delegates' consideration the names for six people who might serve on the committee. She asked the UDC convention to ratify her choice as well as pick a seventh member to act as chair. The convention approved her resolution, and selected Stone as the seventh member.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert17&quot; /&gt; Sources vary as to who was on the design committee. According to Herbert, the six members included Mrs. Marion Butler, Hilary A. Herbert, Mrs. Thomas W. Keith, the Rev. Dr. McKim, Judge Seth Shepard, and Wallace Streater.&lt;ref name=&quot;H7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Streater was the Commander of the D.C. United Sons of Confederate Veterans, and an Inspector General in the U.S. Armuy.&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelia Branch Stone provides almost the same list, but omits Herbert and includes Mrs. Virginia Faulkner McSherry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=RA2-PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Sixteenth Annual Convention...'', p. 283.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process for selecting an artist to design the memorial was somewhat convoluted. Many artists made inquiries with the UDC about designing the memorial in 1909, and some submitted proposals, but the ACMA declined to consider any design because it was still raising funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=RA2-PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Sixteenth Annual Convention...'', p. 277-278.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The design committee first met on May 16, 1910. Rev. McKim made the motion that the memorial should depict an event in which General [[Robert E. Lee]] attempted to ride into the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] to rally his troops. Lee was stopped by a private who seized the bridle of Lee's horse and prevented him from going, declaring that the troops would rally themselves. His motion was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6wTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20Nelson%20Page%22%20%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22&amp;pg=RA3-PA293#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Seventeenth Annual Convention...'', p. 293-294.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox154&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/confederateveter18conf/confederateveter18conf.pdf Stone, Cornelia Branch. &quot;Design for Confederate Monument.&quot; ''Confederate Veteran.''

See: Herbert, p. 18.}} who was already one of the top sculptors of Confederate images in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. xix; Sutherland, p. 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDC was worried that Ezekiel would turn them down. For one, he was rumored to be highly temperamental. For another, he had lost several competitions for federal Civil War monuments (including the prominent [[Admiral David G. Farragut (Ream statue)|Admiral David G. Farragut]] memorial in Washington, D.C.), and Ezekiel was on public record against art competitions. To placate him, the UDC design committee agreed ahead of time to give Ezekiel complete artistic authority in designing the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meetings with Moses Ezekiel===
Ezekiel had already heard about the planned Confederate Memorial long before being contacted by the design committee,&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert18&quot; /&gt; and had already conceived a design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert18&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sculptor Ezekiel Arrives.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' May 25, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel lived in [[Italy]], but had returned to the United States on May 24, 1910, for the dedication of his life-size bronze statue of [[Thomas Jefferson]] outside the Rotunda at the [[University of Virginia]]. He visited President William Howard Taft at the [[White House]] before traveling to the university, and it was while waiting to see Taft that the idea for the Confederate Memorial came to him.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p. 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert and the author [[Thomas Nelson Page]] (a friend of Ezekiel's) visited with the sculptor in Washington, D.C., on November 5, 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;17UDC294&quot; /&gt;{{efn|Cox says this occurred in spring 1911. See: Cox, &quot;The Confederate Monument at Arlington...&quot;, p. 153. Her claim is contradicted by numerous primary and secondary sources.}} Ezekiel expressed his intense desire to obtain the commission. Herbert, Page, and Ezekiel then visited the Confederate section at Arlington National Cemetery and discussed the size and placement of the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N30VAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Minutes%20convention%20%22United%20Daughters%22%20volume%2018&amp;pg=RA1-PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twenty-First Annual Convention...'', p. 277.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel sketched out his idea on a piece of paper for the two men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacob166&quot;&gt;Jacob, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made it clear that he would work in Italy, and would not accept any design input from the ACMA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacob166&quot; /&gt; The following day, the design committee held an emergency meeting. Dr. McKim could not attend, but advised the committee that he approved of Ezekiel's selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;17UDC294&quot; /&gt; Mrs. Keith also could not attend, but offered no proxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;17UDC294&quot; /&gt; At the emergency meeting, Ezekiel outlined his proposal for the memorial: a heroic female figure symbolic of [[Confederate States of America|the South]] with a wreath in one hand and the other resting on a [[plow]], standing atop a circular base around which figures representing the sacrifices of the South were grouped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert18&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;17UDC294&quot; /&gt;

The design committee was deeply impressed with Ezekiel's proposal and offered the commission to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert17&quot; /&gt; On November 7, Ezekiel signed a contract to design and manufacture the memorial.{{efn|Hilary Herbert says the contract was signed November 5, but this seems unlikely given that the design committee met that same day for the first time in six months. Thomas Nelson Page gives the date of the contract as November 7, which seems more likely. See: Herbert, p. 17; United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention...'', p. 347, accessed 2013-10-30.}} The finished memorial was to be delivered by November 1913&lt;ref name=&quot;ToHonorDead&quot; /&gt; at a cost of $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|10000|1910}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert17&quot; /&gt; Art historian Timothy Sedore says Ezekiel accepted the commission only because he had final control over the design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot;&gt;Sedore, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary Herbert also agrees that Ezekiel was given a free hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert18&quot; /&gt; UDC historian Karen L. Cox, however, says that the ACMA design committee worked with Ezekiel to ensure that the memorial adhered to the theme of &quot;peace for the living and honor to the dead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, ''Dixie's Daughters'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working out the design===
The UDC convention opened in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], just three days after the contract with Ezekiel was signed. Excited by the news that Moses Ezekiel had won the design commission, convention attendees voted to increase the cost of the memorial by $15,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|15000|1910}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) to $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|50000|1910}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) to make it larger and grander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert17&quot; /&gt; Of this amount, $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|10000|1910}}}}) was set aside for shipping the memorial to the United States from Italy and for its erection at Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;ToHonorDead&quot; /&gt;

Upon learning of the funding increase, Ezekiel immediately made a new, larger model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/confederateveter19conf/confederateveter19conf.pdf McSherry, Virginia Faulkner. &quot;Construction of Arlington Monument.&quot; ''Confederate Veteran.'' XIX:4 (April 1911), p. 147.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; He increased the number of figures around the lower portion of the base to 32 from 15, and changed the base from granite to bronze.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Eighteenth%20convention%20United%20Daughters&amp;pg=PA339#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention...'', p. 339-340.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Ezekiel appears to have increased the number of life-size figures to 32 some time after February 1912, as media reports at the time still had the number of figures at 15. But the change to bronze from granite for the base occurred before then. See: &quot;South to Honor Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 4, 1912.}}

Ezekiel felt that the monument was the most important commission he ever worked on, and he refused all other work so that he could devote all his time to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox154&quot;&gt;Cox, &quot;The Confederate Monument at Arlington...&quot;, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; He also discouraged visitors from coming to his Rome studio so that there would be little public discussion of his design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox154&quot; /&gt; Nonetheless, some changes were made in response to comments made by visitors to his workshop. For example, Ezekiel originally intended for the shield against which the fallen woman leans to be inscribed with the words &quot;free trade&quot; and &quot;state's rights&quot;. He changed the words to &quot;Constitution&quot; after a visit to his studio by a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Another change, less well-documented, was recorded by the ''Washington Evening Star'' newspaper, which alleged that one of the allegorical figure groups around the mount was intended to show a wounded soldier being nursed back to health by a Southern woman. This figure group does not appear on the final memorial. See: &quot;Plan for Unveiling.&quot; ''Washington Evening Star.'' November 11, 1912.}}

In time, the ACMA design committee began asking Ezekiel for design details, clearly with a mind toward reviewing his work. He declined to give them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacob166&quot; /&gt; But with work on his design nearly complete in late 1911, Ezekiel began sending occasional photographs of his work to the ACMA design committee. He asked, however, that these be kept private to reduce interference with his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;ToHonorDead&quot;&gt;&quot;South to Honor Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 4, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; A two-thirds size model was finished in early 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;ToHonorDead&quot; /&gt;

===Fund-raising to cover enlarged design===
Additional fundraising occurred after 1910 to raise the money to cover the additional cost. A number of small donations came from Union soldiers,&lt;ref name=&quot;RosesFor&quot;&gt;&quot;Roses For Their Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 10, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert31&quot; /&gt; with the 23rd New Jersey Regiment contributing $100 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|100|1913}}}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert31&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel agreed to donate his services as sculptor, so that all the money set aside for the memorial could go toward the purchase of raw bronze and for the memorial's casting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rites&quot; /&gt; By February 1912, $24,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|24000|1912}}}}) still needed to be raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;ToHonorDead&quot; /&gt; Over the next four months, an additional $4,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4000|1912}}}}) came in.&lt;ref name=&quot;RosesFor&quot; /&gt;

As casting on the memorial neared completion in November 1913, the ACMA announced that it had raised $50,442.59 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|50442|1913}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars), of which $3,517 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3517|1913}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) went to construction of the concrete foundation, fund-raising, and expenses associated with the cornerstone-laying ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;20UDC342&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Eighteenth%20convention%20United%20Daughters&amp;pg=PA342#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention...'', p. 342.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Just over $12,700 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|12700|1913}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) had been raised in 1913 alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Eighteenth%20convention%20United%20Daughters&amp;pg=PA349#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention...'', p. 349.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 1914, a total of $56,262.01 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|56262|1914}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) had been raised for the memorial.&lt;ref name=&quot;21UDC279&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N30VAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Minutes%20convention%20%22United%20Daughters%22%20volume%2018&amp;pg=RA1-PA279#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twenty-First Annual Convention...'', p. 279.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building the memorial==
===Laying the cornerstone===
[[File:Construction of foundations - Confederate Memorial - Arlington National Cemetery - 1912.jpg|thumb|Construction of the foundations for the Confederate Memorial in 1912.]]
Work on the memorial proceeded on schedule. In June 1912, the ACMA announced that it was planning a dedication to occur 12 months later, just before the [[1913 Gettysburg reunion|Blue-and-Gray reunion]] at [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RosesFor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeginShaft&quot; /&gt;

The ACMA set Tuesday, November 12, 1912, at 2:00 P.M. as the date and time for laying the cornerstone for the memorial. The date coincided with the first day of the UDC's annual convention, which that year was to be held in Washington, D.C. The UDC claimed it was the first time the convention had been held outside the boundary of the old Confederacy&lt;ref name=&quot;TafttoWelcome&quot;&gt;&quot;Taft to Welcome Southern Women to Capital of Union Next Week.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' November 3, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; (although that was not true, as the convention was held in [[San Francisco, California]], in 1905.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox155&quot;&gt;Cox, &quot;The Confederate Monument at Arlington...&quot;, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization invited President William Howard Taft to speak to the convention,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Plan Big Convention.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 22, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; and he agreed to do so in mid-October.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;South to Honor Dead.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' October 14, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the date for the cornerstone-laying ceremony approached, more than 10,000 people were expected to attend the event.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;United Daughters of Confederacy Gather Here for Big Convention.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' November 10, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UDCMeet&quot;&gt;&quot;U.D.C. Meet Today.' ''Washington Post.'' November 11, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the cornerstone ceremony appeared to be disrupted when the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 presidential election]] was held just a week before the event and Taft lost the election to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. It was widely expected that Taft would cancel his speech, but Taft reaffirmed his commitment to speak at the cornerstone-laying event. It was considered an important speech, since it was his first speaking engagement since losing the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;UDCMeet&quot; /&gt;

The cornerstone laying occurred as scheduled on November 12. The turnout of about 6,000 people was, however, lighter than expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeginShaft&quot;&gt;&quot;Begin U.C.V.

Herbert.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeginShaft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert28&quot; /&gt; On the spur of the moment, Herbert asked [[Corporal#United States Army|Corporal]] [[James R. Tanner]], former Commander of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (a veterans organization for Union soldiers) to briefly address the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeginShaft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner lost both legs in the war, became a [[stenography|stenographer]], and took eyewitness testimony on behalf of the government in the hours following the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. He had briefly led the [[Bureau of Pensions]] in 1889, and helped organize the [[American Red Cross]]. Nonetheless, there were murmurs of disapproval from the audience when Tanner spoke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox155&quot; /&gt;

When the speeches ended, the cornerstone was laid. The cornerstone contained a [[time capsule]] in which a large number of objects and documents were placed, including a certified copy of the Act of June 6, 1900; the letter from Secretary of War Taft giving the ACMA permission to build the memorial; membership rosters of the UDC and other organizations; flags of the states which joined the Confederacy; and examples of Confederate and modern paper money and coins.{{efn|The complete list of items in the cornerstone time capsule included: A certified copy of the Act of June 6, 1900, establishing the Confederate section at Arlington National Cemetery; a history of the creation of the Confederate section, with a list of dead buried therein compiled by Dr. Samuel E.

===Dedication delays===
[[File:Unveiling Confederate Monument, Arlington.jpg|thumb|Unveiling of the Confederate Monument on June 4, 1914.]]
While work on the monument initially progressed on schedule, delays began to occur. Funding was not the issue: By November 1913, the ACMA had paid $20,000 to Ezekiel to secure raw bronze, and almost $22,725 remained in the organization's coffers to complete the memorial, ship it to America, and assemble and erect it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laud&quot;&gt;&quot;Laud South's Heroes.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 9, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; The first delay was small but significant, and occurred in early 1913 when Ezekiel could not obtain copies of the Confederate state shields in a timely fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;20UDC347&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Eighteenth%20convention%20United%20Daughters&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention...'', p. 347.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced the ACMA and UDC to give up on a June 1913 dedication,&lt;ref name=&quot;Laud&quot; /&gt; and November 5 was informally set as the new date for the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;20UDC340&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Eighteenth%20convention%20United%20Daughters&amp;pg=PA340#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention...'', p. 340.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet more delays occurred. About July, Ezekiel said he needed 10 more days to complete casting, and the UDC changed the dedication date to November 15. But on August 19, an accident occurred in the casting process which delayed delivery of the memorial by yet another three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;20UDC340&quot; /&gt; The Confederate Memorial was finally complete in November 1913, and shipped to the United States via a [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg America]] ocean liner in early 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;20UDC347&quot; /&gt; It was sent by barge up [[Potomac River]] and arrived at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] on January 10, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Confederate Statue Here.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' January 11, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate Memorial consisted of a number of pieces which required assembly. [[Civil engineer]] A. C. Weeks donated his services to help prepare the site for the monument, and oversaw the memorial's erection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=em5LAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Confederate%20Monument%22%20Arlington%20%22civil%20engineer%22&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twenty-First Annual Convention...'', p. 40-41.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial was stored in crates not at the Navy Yard but at the Army Quartermaster's headquarters at [[Fort Myer]], next to Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rites&quot;&gt;&quot;Rites for Dixie Shaft.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' February 17, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACMA decided to uncrate and erect the memorial in early March 1914 (as soon as winter weather permitted), and established a new the dedication ceremony date for April 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rites&quot; /&gt;

But construction problems again forced a delay in the dedication ceremony. With the assistance of Representative [[James Luther Slayden]] of [[San Antonio, Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433069065914?urlappend=%3Bseq=51 &quot;What Texas Offers in Stone.&quot; ''Stone: An Illustrated Magazine.'' 35:1 (January 1914), p. 29.] Accessed 2013-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt; the ACMA had contracted with a [[Texas]] firm to provide the granite for the memorial's base. But the company could not furnish enough granite in time to meet the April 27 dedication deadline. The ACMA canceled its contract, and commissioned a [[Maryland]] firm to provide the granite instead. The Maryland company said the base would be completed by May 22, so the ACMA rescheduled the dedication for Confederate Memorial Day, June 4.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Unveil Shaft in June.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 22, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodrow Wilson speaks at dedication of the Confederate memorial - Arlington National Cemetery - Arlington Count VA USA - 1914-06-12.jpg|thumb|left|President Wilson speaks at the dedication ceremony for the Confederate Memorial.]]
Dedication of the Confederate Memorial was the most prominent project the UDC had ever undertaken, and the organization desired to make it a special occasion. Florence Butler (wife of former [[North Carolina]] Senator [[Marion Butler]]) chaired the dedication program committee. She called it a &quot;disagreeable job&quot;, for it involved declining hundreds of requests from people who wanted to read speeches, sing or play songs, and recite poetry. Butler, however, was convinced that there should be a bare minimum of speeches, and none of them should be lengthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox157&quot; /&gt; President Woodrow Wilson, a native Virginian, was invited to be the keynote speaker, and an invitation he readily accepted. His participation was almost derailed, however, when Wilson decided against attending the Grand Army of the Republic's [[Memorial Day]] ceremonies. An outraged GAR demanded that Wilson withdraw from the Confederate Memorial dedication. But Wilson quickly agreed to attend the GAR's event, and the scandal died down.&lt;ref name=&quot;PeaceDove&quot;&gt;&quot;Peace Dove Returns.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' May 31, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dedicating the memorial===
The dedication ceremony for the Confederate Memorial was held on June 4, 1914. Although numerous dignitaries and Confederate groups were invited to attend, only a single Union veterans' group was asked to do so (because, the UDC said, there was limited seating).&lt;ref name=&quot;ChildBare&quot;&gt;&quot;Child to Bare Memorial.'

Following the speakers, the Confederate Memorial was unveiled by 11-year-old Paul Herbert Micou, grandson of Hilary Herbert.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChildBare&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Join&quot; /&gt; A [[21-gun salute|21-gun artillery salute]] followed,&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt; and then Mrs. Stevens presented the memorial to President Wilson as a gift to the American people.&lt;ref name=&quot;PayTribute&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt;

The dedication program was to have concluded with a major address by President Wilson followed by mass singing, wreath-laying and other floral tributes, a benediction by Reverend Andrew R. Bird of the [[Church of the Pilgrims (Washington DC)|Church of the Pilgrims]] (a [[American Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church located in Washington, D.C.), and a wreath-laying at the Civil War Unknowns Monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChildBare&quot; /&gt; But a [[thunderstorm]] broke over the crowd as the President neared the end of his remarks. With no [[Pole marquee|marquee]] or other shelter nearby for the crowd, most attendees rushed for their automobiles and returned to the city. The President left as well, and the dedication ceremony ended abruptly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Join&quot; /&gt; The floral tributes were quickly deposited at the foot of the memorial, and the wreath hurriedly placed at the Civil War Unknowns memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the ceremony was $2,660.30 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|2660.30|1914}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;CV128129&quot; /&gt;

===Figure of &quot;The South&quot;===
The topmost portion of the memorial consists of a larger-than-life figure of a woman representing the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson193&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PayTribute&quot; /&gt; The orientation of the figure and its face is toward the south, in part to honor the Confederacy&lt;ref name=&quot;ConfederatesHere&quot;&gt;&quot;Confederates Here June 4.&quot; ''Washington Post.''

The figure stands on a round [[pedestal]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert65&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branches]] and four [[Urn#Cremation urns|cinerary urns]]. [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|Low relief]] numbers on the urns refer to the four years of the American Civil War (1861, 1862, 1863, and &quot;1864-5&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt; Beneath the round pedestal is a round plinth in the form of a wreath of [[wheat]]. Below the plinth is a round base on which is inscribed: &quot;And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ConfederatesHere&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PayTribute&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert64&quot; /&gt; It is a partial quotation from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 2:4.

Below the base is a [[frieze]] of 14 inwardly inclined shields, each of which depicts the coat of arms of one of the 13 Confederate states and Maryland (which did not join the Confederacy but supported the South in the war).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===32 figures on the mount===
[[File:Confederate Monument - NE frieze mammy - Arlington National Cemetery - 2011.JPG|thumb|Sculptor Moses Ezekiel included the weeping figure of the loyal black mammy as a correction to what he and the UDC saw as lies about history perpetrated by the North.]]
Below the frieze is a cylindrical mount on which are 32 life-size figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert65&quot; /&gt; In the front (or south-facing side) of the mount is the [[Panoply|panoplied]] figure of Minerva.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Minerva attempts to support the figure of a fallen woman (who also represents the South). The woman is leaning against a shield emblazoned with the words &quot;The Constitution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore114&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PayTribute&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert65&quot; /&gt; Behind Minerva's head, allegorical &quot;Spirits of War&quot; trumpet in every direction, calling the citizens of the South to aid their country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson193&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert65&quot; /&gt; One spirit resembles a [[gorgon]], while another holds a cinerary urn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert65&quot; /&gt;{{efn|Jacob identifies the snake-haired spirit as [[Tisiphone]], one if the [[Erinyes]] or Furies. See: Jacob, p. 168.}} On either side of the fallen woman are figures depicting those who came to the South's aid. They represent each branch of the Confederate armed forces: [[Miner]], sailor, [[sapper]], and soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert65&quot; /&gt; There are four figures (two in high relief, two in low relief) facing Minerva on the southwest corner of the mount. There are six figures (three in [[Relief#high relief|high relief]], three in low relief) facing Minerva on the southeast corner of the mount. A uniformed black slave, following his master to war, is depicted among the six figures on the southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson193&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert66&quot; /&gt; The slave is not a soldier, although the image is often referred to as a &quot;black soldier&quot;. It is, as the UDC pointed out in 1914, &quot;a faithful Negro body-servant following his young master&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen and Sebesta, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular image was inspired by Thomas Nelson Page's 1887 [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] story, ''Marse Chan: A Tale of Old Virginia''.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the east, northeast, north, northwest, and west sides of the cylindrical mount are the remainder of the figures&lt;ref name=&quot;ConfederatesHere&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PayTribute&quot; /&gt; in high relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt; These figures are intended to represent the sacrifices, devotion, and heroism of all social classes of people in the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt; The figures depict:
*A military officer kissing his infant child, who is held in the arms of a weeping [[Mammy archetype|black mammy]] while another child clings to her skirts;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert66&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A shirtless blacksmith leaving his [[anvil]] and tools behind as his sorrowful wife looks on;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert66&quot; /&gt;
*A clergyman and his grieving wife saying goodbye to their teenage son (who has enlisted);&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert66&quot; /&gt; and
*A young lady binding a sword and sash onto her beau.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert67&quot; /&gt;

The inclusion of the &quot;faithful black servants&quot; was purposeful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson193&quot; /&gt; Sculptor Moses Ezekiel included them because he wanted to undermine what he called the &quot;lies&quot; told about the South and slavery in [[Harriett Beecher Stowe]]'s 1852 novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and wished to rewrite history &quot;correctly&quot; (his word) to depict black slaves' support for the Confederate cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert66&quot; /&gt;

An [[oak]] tree spreads its branches behind the couple and their son and the blacksmith's family. It represents the support family lends to the Confederate cause, as well as the strength of Confederate families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert67&quot;&gt;Herbert, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Base===
[[File:Confederate Monument - S frieze detail - Arlington National Cemetery - 2011.JPG|thumb|The fallen figure of a woman, also representing &quot;The South&quot;, leans on a shield emblazoned with the words &quot;The Constitution&quot; as a symbol of what the UDC believed the South fought for.]]
[[File:Confederate Monument - SW shields - Arlington National Cemetery - 2011.JPG|thumb|Cinerary urns and shields bearing the coat of arms of each state support the topmost figure on the memorial.]]
The 32 life-size figures stand on an irregular octagonal base. The front (or south-facing side) of this base depicts the Great Seal of the Confederacy in low relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore114&quot; /&gt; In raised letters below the seal are the following words:&lt;ref name=&quot;PayTribute&quot; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;TO OUR DEAD HEROES&lt;br&gt;
BY&lt;br&gt;
THE UNITED DAUGHTERS&lt;br&gt;
OF THE CONFEDERACY&lt;br&gt;
VICTRIX CAUSA DIIS&lt;br&gt;
PLACUIT SED VICTA CATON
&lt;/blockquote&gt;This [[Latin]] phrase means: &quot;The Victorious Cause was Pleasing to the Gods, But the Lost Cause Pleased Cato.&quot; It is a quotation from the poem ''[[Pharsalia]]'' by the ancient Roman poet [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]]. It refers to the attempt by the Roman Senator [[Pompey]] to prevent [[Julius Caesar]] from becoming dictator of Rome in 49 BC. Although he lost, Pompey's actions pleased the great philosopher and statesman [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] (who was noted for his moral integrity).&lt;ref&gt;Sedore, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the north face of the memorial in raised letters are the following words:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 41-42; Herbert, p. 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

RANDOLPH HARRISON MCKIM&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the northwest face of the octagonal base, in raised letters, are the words:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;M. Ezekiel * Sculptor&lt;br&gt;
Rome MCMXII&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the northeast face of the octagonal base, in raised letters, are the words:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedore115&quot; /&gt;

AKTIEN-GESELLSCHAFT GLADENBECK&lt;br&gt;
BRONZE FOUNDERY&lt;br&gt;

The east and west sides of the octagonal base are flanked by pedestals, on top of which are urn-like lamps topped with &quot;eternal flames&quot; of bronze.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox154&quot; /&gt;

===Critical assessment===
The ''Washington Post'' lauded the memorial when it was unveiled. It was effusive in its praise for the monument's focus on peace and the future, its emphasis on the South's fight for constitutional rights and not slavery, and its repetitive images focusing on the sacrifices made by the heroic common soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArriveUnveiling&quot; /&gt; Unnamed European art critics cited by ''The Sunday Star'' newspaper said it was &quot;a marvel of facial expression and allegorically perfect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Confederate Memorial Sculptor Arrives Here.&quot; ''The Sunday Star.'' May 31, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel William Couper, a faculty member at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), praised it in 1933 as &quot;magnificent and impressive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Couper, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern critics have been somewhat more equivocal. Keith Gibson, executive director of the VMI museum system, says the Confederate Memorial is a &quot;superb example of Ezekiel's style and imagery&quot;, and one of the artist's most significant works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson193&quot; /&gt; Gibson nevertheless faults the memorial for its static posing and &quot;hard contours&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson193&quot; /&gt; Historian Katherine Allamong Jacob, however, notes that while the memorial is &quot;intensely dramatic&quot; it is also &quot;not a little sentimental&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''Washington Post'' reporter Linda Wheeler found the memorial ornate and romantic and praised it as a vivid reflection of Victorian artistic taste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheeler&quot; /&gt; Kirk Savage, associate professor of art history and architecture at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], criticizes the memorial for being &quot;clearly the product of white supremacist thinking and practice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage183&quot;&gt;Savage, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Erika Lee Doss agrees, calling it a &quot;pro-Southern textbook&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Doss, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the memorial==
In August 1915, Secretary of War [[Lindley Miller Garrison]] determined that the Confederate Monument should be cared for by the federal government under the authority granted by the Act of June 8, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To Care for Monuments.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' August 15, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2013, the Confederate Memorial remains one of three sites at Arlington National Cemetery mentioned by name in the ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'' where public memorial services may be conducted. (The others are the Memorial Amphitheater and the [[John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame|John F. Kennedy Grave]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/docs/ANC_Visitors_Rules.pdf Title 32: National Defense. Part 553—Army National Cemeteries. §553.22 (h)(3)(i).

===Final financial issues===
A total of $56,262.01 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|56262|1914}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) was raised by the UDC for the memorial by November 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;21UDC279&quot; /&gt; But the $40,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|40000|1914}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars) budgeted for design and casting of the monument fell short of the actual cost. Ezekiel was forced to spend about $5,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|5000|1914}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars)&lt;ref name=&quot;21UDC271&quot; /&gt; of his own funds casting the piece, as the money paid to him barely covered the cost of materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Eighteenth%20convention%20United%20Daughters&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention...'', p. 345.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many UDC leaders felt fundraising should continue since the Little Rock convention of 1910 had implicitly promised to pay Ezekiel more money. The resolution which enlarged the memorial and increased the amount of money budgeted for it read: &quot;...that the monument in Washington shall cost not less than $50,000, with the hopes of $75,000, and that a contract be made to this effect...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=em5LAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;ots=2lynqWWQDD&amp;dq=%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22%20%2475%2C000&amp;pg=PA272#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Moses%20Ezekiel%22%20$75,000&amp;f=false United Daughters of the Confederacy, ''Minutes of the Twenty-First Annual Convention...'', p. 272.] Accessed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ezekiel declined to press the issue, UDC leaders felt morally bound to try to pay him the additional $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1914}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars). In November 1914, with nearly all the costs of the memorial, its erection, and dedication paid, there remained a memorial fund balance of $1,770.92 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1771|1914}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars).

At the November 1917 UDC convention in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], the ACMA treasurer reported that the Confederate Memorial fund now showed a deficit of $1,325.25 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1325.25|1917}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars).

===Burials at the memorial===
[[File:Confederate Monument - Marcus Wright grave - Arlington National Cemetery - 2011.JPG|thumb|Grave of Brig. Gen. Marcus J. Wright on the south side of the memorial.]]
Burials in the Confederate section continued after the Confederate Memorial was completed. The first of these was Thomas Findley, who was buried on June 11, 1914, just days after the dedication ceremony. His interment, however, proved controversial because the War Department gave him [[Military funerals in the United States|full military honors]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Burial First of Kind.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 12, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; This created widespread anger nationally among GAR members because Findley was not honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States, as required by law.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Burial Rites Illegal.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 14, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four notable burials occurred at the compass points of the Confederate Memorial, and stand out from the rest of the graves nearby for not being part of the concentric circles of burials. These are the graves of Moses Ezekiel, Lieutenant Harry C. Marmaduke, Captain John M. Hickey, and Brigadier General Marcus J. Wright.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArlingtonNatCem&quot; /&gt; The first of these burials was that of Moses Ezekiel, which occurred on March 30, 1921. Ezekiel died in Italy on March 27, 1917. He requested that his body be brought back to the United States for burial, but this was not possible as World War I prevented it. His body was returned to America after the war and a funeral held in [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater]] on March 30, 1921—the first funeral ever to be held in the year-old structure.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Impressive Rites for Moses Ezekiel.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' March 31, 1921; Peters, p. 78-79; Jacob, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; His body was buried on the east side of the memorial, and a small granite pedestal surmounted by a bronze plaque placed at the head of the grave.

The second of the four notable burials was that of Brigadier General Wright, which occurred on December 29, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gen. Wright Funeral Today.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' December 29, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred on the south side of the memorial. The third burial was that of Captain Henry H. Marmaduke, the last known surviving officer of the [[ironclad warship]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] (which famously fought the {{USS|Monitor}} in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] on March 9, 1862). A [[Midshipman#United States Navy from 1845|midshipman]] at the time of the battle, he lived in the District of Columbia after 1883 and was buried on the west side of the memorial on November 17, 1924.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Last Monitor Merrimac Officer, 82, Dies Here.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' November 16, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; The last notable burial was that of Captain John M. Hickey, who was buried on the memorial's north side on October 3, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Capt. John J. Hickey Funeral Tomorrow.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' October 2, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear why these four were buried next to the memorial and not elsewhere in the Confederate section. Ezekiel, Wright, and Hickey all played major roles in creating the Confederate section and bringing the memorial into being, but it is less clear why Marmaduke warranted burial at the foot of the memorial (although his notable war service may have justified it). Also unclear is why no other notable burials occurred next to the memorial.

===Other history of the memorial===
The Confederate Memorial is the focus of Confederate Memorial Day exercises in the Washington, D.C., area. President Woodrow Wilson attended the first four events (1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918) held at the memorial, although he spoke at none of them.{{efn|It is unclear if Wilson was to speak at the 1915 event, as it was rained out. He attended but did not speak at the other three events. Wilson's presence in 1919, 1920, and 1921 was excused by the press of business due to World War I.

Attendance at the Confederate Memorial Day event at the memorial has fluctuated wildly. For example, more than 2,000 attended Confederate Memorial Day ceremonies at the memorial in 1912,&lt;ref name=&quot;RosesFor&quot; /&gt; but just 600 did so in 1925 (the 60th anniversary of the end of the war).&lt;ref name=&quot;Honored600&quot; /&gt; &quot;Several hundred&quot; attended the 1931 event,&lt;ref name=&quot;ArlingtonService&quot; /&gt; while more than 2,000 came in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConfedRites&quot; /&gt; A thousand were there in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Spirit of South Nation's Need, Veterans Told.&quot; ''Washington Post''.

Note the much different landscaping around the memorial compared to photos from the 2000s, the still-extant sidewalks, and the far fewer graves.]]
Another set of memorials was proposed for the Confederate section in 1931. The idea was sparked by a controversy over the burial of LaSalle Corbell Pickett, wife of [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Major general|Major General]] [[George Pickett]] (CSA). Pickett died in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on July 30, 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief interment in a cemetery in Norfolk,&lt;ref&gt;Selcer, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; his remains were reburied in the Confederate military section of [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], on October 24, 1875.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Late Gen. Pickett.&quot; ''New York Times''. October 25, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; LaSalle Corbell Pickett died on March 22, 1931. Her wish was to be buried next to her husband, but Hollywood Cemetery officials refused, citing regulations that only men could be buried in the Confederate section of Hollywood Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Burial of Pickett Widow Is Refused in Richmond.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 25, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Pickett's grandson and eldest surviving male descendant, Lieutenant George E. Pickett III, was outraged by the cemetery's decision. He sought to have his grandmother buried in the Confederate section of Arlington National Cemetery, and have his grandfather's remains disinterred and brought to D.C. for burial beside her. Lieutenant Pickett then conferred with representatives of the War Department and Colonel Robert Lee Longstreet, son of [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General]] [[James Longstreet]]. The three parties devised a plan to erect statues to Generals Pickett, Longstreet, and Robert E. Lee in the Confederate section.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Confederates Plan Arlington Shrine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 29, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The three statues would be grouped together where Jackson Circle and McPherson Drive met, creating what Pickett and Longstreet called a &quot;tri-hero corner&quot;. Additionally, Longstreet conceived of a site adjacent to the Confederate section where Confederates could be buried or reburied, and additional memorials to them erected. He brought his idea to War Department shortly after the tri-hero corner concept was broached.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadLostCause&quot;&gt;&quot;Dead of Lost Cause May Get U.S. Shrine.&quot; ''Washington Post''. March 30, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed not only at the loss of Pickett's remains but at a potential shift in focus from Richmond to Arlington, Hollywood Cemetery officials quickly agreed to inter Mrs. Pickett next to her husband. With this decision, the rationale for a tri-hero corner largely went away, and neither it nor Longstreet's memorial section plan were implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadLostCause&quot; /&gt;

There were also attempts to erect additional Confederate memorials at Arlington National Cemetery in the 1930s. The first if these was a legislative proposal by Representative [[Hamilton Fish III]] in 1935 to erect a statue of Robert E. Lee somewhere in the cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppose&quot;&gt;&quot;Women Oppose Statue of Lee In Arlington.&quot; ''Washington Post''. May 16, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; The UDC had previously sought to erect a statue of Lee near [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] about 1900, but abandoned this plan to pursue the Confederate Memorial. The UDC strongly backed the Fish bill, but the legislation generated widespread opposition and died in Congress in 1936 without being acted on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppose&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;G.A.R. Opposes Lee Memorial At Arlington.&quot; ''Washington Post''. September 25, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; A second Confederate memorial was proposed for Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. It is unclear who or what group made the suggestion (although the ''Washington Post'' implied it was a project of the Sons of Confederate Veterans), but it was proposed to inscribe the names of leading Confederate figures on the columns on either side of the apse in Memorial Amphitheater.&lt;ref name=&quot;EyebrowsLifted&quot; /&gt; These square [[pilasters]] on either side of the apse list the names of famous American generals (left, as one faces the stage) and admirals (right) from the [[American Revolutionary War]] through the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=raVaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Memorial%20Amphitheater%22%20Arlington%20exhibition%20hall&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Memorial%20Amphitheater%22%20Arlington%20exhibition%20hall&amp;f=false &quot;The Arlington Memorial Amphitheater.&quot; ''Architectural Forum''. January 1921, p. 94.] Accessed 2013-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt; When the UDC learned of the proposal, many of its members wanted to add the names of Robert E. Lee and [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] to the columns as well. A resolution to this effect was offered at the UDC convention in 1937. However, delegates amended the resolution on the floor to deny UDC support for the changes unless the name of Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] was added as well. The resolution was then adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;EyebrowsLifted&quot;&gt;&quot;Eyebrows Lifted Over New Names At Amphitheater.&quot; ''Washington Post''. November 13, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; But only Congress had the authority to change the pilasters, and no legislation to add names was ever introduced.

Confederate Memorial Day ceremonies moved to Arlington Memorial Amphitheater from the Confederate Memorial in 1936. Although wreath layings and other brief ceremonies were still conducted at the base of the memorial, most of the event was held in the amphitheater.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Reynolds Says Confederacy's Spirit Lives On.&quot; ''Washington Post''. June 8, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Confederates Honor Dead At Arlington.&quot; ''Washington Post''.

June 7, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonies from the amphitheater (but not the memorial) were first broadcast on radio by [[NBC]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio&quot; /&gt; The ceremonies moved back to the Confederate Memorial in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Scott. &quot;South's Sacrifices Can Teach Lesson Now, Gray Service Told.&quot; ''Washington Post''.

June 8, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent ceremonies in the 1990s and 2000s have been at the Confederate Memorial, although it is unclear when the event moved out of Memorial Amphitheater. Former [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Jim Webb]] spoke at a Confederate Memorial Day exercise at the memorial on June 3, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/24/jim-webb-draws-criticism-for-comments-on-confederate-flag/|last=Rappeport|first=Alan|title=Jim Webb Criticized for Comments on Confederate Flag|work=The New York Times|date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=June 25, 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.jameswebb.com/speeches-by-jim/remarks-at-the-confederate-memorial|last=Webb|first=Jim|title=Remarks at the Confederate Memorial|website=JamesWebb.com|date=June 3, 1990|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Confederate Memorial made its first known appearance in a work of fiction. It was mentioned prominently in author [[Alice Randall]]'s 2010 novel ''Rebel Yell'', in which two African American characters discuss the inclusion of black slaves in the memorial's imagery and the confusion and meaning it has for African Americans today.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Alice. ''Rebel Yell: A Novel''. New York: Bloomsbury, 2010, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 100th anniversary of the dedication of the Confederate Memorial was noted with a ceremony on Confederate Memorial Day hosted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy on June 8, 2014.

===Recent controversies about the memorial===
Beginning with Woodrow Wilson in 1919, almost every President of the United States sent a wreath to the Confederate Memorial Day exercises.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonsofOldSouth&quot; /&gt; This tradition was broken by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1949 and again in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonsofOldSouth&quot;&gt;&quot;Sons of Old South Resent Truman's Wreath Omission.&quot; ''Washington Post.'' June 5, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Truman resumed the tradition in 1951, and a presidential wreath continued to be donated each year for the next four decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;DayMarked&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post_now/post/confederate-memorial-day-marked-at-arlington/2011/06/05/AGo3yZJH_blog.html &quot;Confederate Memorial Day Marked at Arlington.&quot; ''Associated Press .'' June 5, 2011.] Accessed 2013-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, President [[George H. W. Bush]] declined to send a wreath to the ceremony, citing infighting among Confederate groups.&lt;ref&gt;York, Anthony. &quot;Confederates in the Attic.&quot; Salon.com. December 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Bush declined to send a wreath again in 1991 and 1992. But President [[Bill Clinton]] resumed the tradition in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;McCaslin, John. &quot;Wreaths For All.&quot; ''Washington Times.'' May 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was continued by his successor, President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DayMarked&quot; /&gt;

When African American Senator [[Barack Obama]] became President in November 2008, he faced a dilemma about continuing the tradition. As Kirk Savage, art historian, put it, &quot;a black president suddenly became in charge of a tradition steeped in white supremacy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage183&quot; /&gt; In 2009, several dozen university professors and historians asked President Obama to end the tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;DayMarked&quot; /&gt; and the issue received some mass media attention. Confederate heritage groups denounced any attempt to end the presidential wreath tradition, arguing it would be an insult to Southerners. A few days before the 2009 Confederate Memorial Day, Savage argued in a ''Washington Post'' editorial that the Southerners were essentially correct. He concluded that to end the tradition would only reinforce racist attitudes in America and do little to promote an understanding of the role of slavery in American history and society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage183&quot; /&gt; President Obama himself never addressed the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage183&quot; /&gt; Instead, Obama sent a wreath not only to the Confederate Memorial but also instituted a new tradition of sending a presidential wreath to the [[African American Civil War Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;DayMarked&quot; /&gt;
