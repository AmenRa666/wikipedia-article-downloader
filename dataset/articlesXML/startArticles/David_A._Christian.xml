Christian enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1966 at age 17. After being rapidly promoted through the enlisted ranks to sergeant, he was admitted to the U.S. Army [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) and commissioned at 18 years old (making him one of the youngest officers) and making Christian the youngest commissioned officer of the 20 and 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;avery&quot;&gt;&quot;Local Soldier may tie Audie Murphy's record&quot;. Ron Avery. ''Bucks County Courier Times''. August 22, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Officer Candidate School, he completed U.S. [[Army Airborne School]], (Parachute Jump School) and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] (&quot;Green Berets&quot;) training.&lt;ref name=&quot;avery&quot;/&gt;

Frustrated with how Vietnam War veterans were treated upon their return to the United States, both by the general public and the government, Christian became an advocate and veterans leader.&lt;ref name=WGBH&gt;[http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-6891de-interview-with-david-christian-1983 Interview with David Christian, 1983] (Video Interview) WGBH Media Library &amp; Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a founding Vice-President of the [[Vietnam Veterans of America|Council of Vietnam Veterans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gillon&quot;/&gt; He left the organization, founding the splinter group of the United Vietnam Veterans Organization (UVVO),&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Morris. &quot;Kostmayer, Christian find little upon which to agree.&quot; ''Montgomery County Bulletin'' (?).

Christian went on to serve as Regional Director of the US Department of Labor (Region 3) and then as Assistant State Director in Pennsylvania making that State the only State to be in compliance with establishing outreach centers.

==2012 U.S. Senate election==

{{see also|United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2012}}

In mid-2011, Christian formed an [[exploratory committee]] to consider a run for the [[United States Senate]] seat currently held by incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] in the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2012|2012 election]].&lt;ref name=exploratorysenate&gt;{{cite news| last=Schlegal| first=Bradley| title=Bucks County businessman David Christian ponders run for U.S. Senate| url=http://timesherald.com/articles/2011/07/11/news/doc4e1ba2295924c394382678.txt| accessdate=24 September 2011| newspaper=The Times Herald| date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, Christian officially declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate for the seat being held by incumbent Bob Casey, Jr. In his campaign announcement, Christian described himself as a &quot;[[Ronald Reagan]] Republican&quot;.&lt;ref name=senateannouncement&gt;{{cite web| title=David Christian: &quot;We're In&quot; Officially Launches 2012 U.S. Senate Campaign Against Bob Casey, Jr.| url=http://christian2012.org/?page_id=85| publisher=David Christian for U.S. Senate| accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pikecountyrc&gt;{{cite news| title=2012: David Christian Enters U.S. Senate Race| url=http://pike.mygopsite.net/2011/09/15/2012-david-christian-enters-u-s-senate-race/| accessdate=24 September 2011| newspaper=Pike County Republican Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted by the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''/WPXI-TV in early February 2012 showed Christian tied for last in the Republican field, with 1% of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Fontaine| first=Tom| title=GOP lacks name recognition in Casey bid| url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/regional/s_780935.html| accessdate=4 March 2012| newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune Review| date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted in late February by [[PoliticsPA]] of the website's readership, however, placed Christian in second place, trailing only [[Sam Rohrer]]. Christian finished with 21% of respondents (364 votes) to Rohrer's 37% (651 votes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gibson| first=Keegan| title=Rohrer Wins PoliticsPA Reader Poll| url=http://www.politicspa.com/rohrer-wins-politicspa-reader-poll/32185/| accessdate=4 March 2012| newspaper=PoliticsPA| date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
