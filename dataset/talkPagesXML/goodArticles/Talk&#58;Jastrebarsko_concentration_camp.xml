==Untitled==
A short description of the concentration camp should probably be added to the article on [[Jastrebarsko]].

== Merge in material from [[Labour camp Jastrebarsko]]? ==

It appears that the article on [[Labour camp Jastrebarsko]] is covering the same topic as this article.  This one appears to me to be further along, and to have a better formed title.  I'd like to suggest that the other article be merged into this one. [[User:EastTN|EastTN]] ([[User talk:EastTN|talk]]) 15:25, 10 September 2010 (UTC)
:I have completed the merger. --[[User:Diannaa|&lt;span style=&quot;color:teal;&quot;&gt;Diannaa&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Diannaa|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 18:23, 7 January 2011 (UTC)

== Comparing and contrasting conflicting information etc ==

Where a source differs from the information already in the article, the appropriate course of action is to compare and contrast the material, not override one source with another. Fumic clearly states that the head of the camp was Sister Pulherija, and makes no mention of Gaudencija. There are some other poor editing practices, such as combining refs to make it look like all the information in the paragraph comes from both sources, whereas some of it only comes from one. This makes it difficult to break up paras properly if more information is added. Also, you've split a para which was cited to Fumic, then almost unbelievably, stuck a cn tag on the first para which you created by splitting the existing para. Please learn to compare and contrast conflicting information, closely cite information you add, and follow basic wikiquette.

== Relevance of Budak's sentence to article ==

It is not clear what makes Budak's conviction and sentence relevant to this article. Was he tried and sentenced for matters relating to this camp? If so, all that information (with appropriate sourcing) should be added to an Aftermath section. If not, it is really not relevant and shouldn't be included beyond the fact that his sister-in-law was the camp director. I've removed it for now.

==Contradiction (a)==
[[User:Peacemaker67|@Peacemaker67]]:
The following is, for lack of a better word, [[oxymoron]]ic:
* ''&quot;Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children.[12]&quot;''&lt;br&gt;
*''&quot;Gojko Knežević, a camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns had the children re-baptised as Catholics. Any child would be beaten with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar for the slightest infraction. Many children were sent to work as slave labor in Germany or Croatia.[11]&quot;''&lt;br&gt;
* We should try to reword and fix it. [[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;'''''Quis separabit?'''''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:09, 12 September 2016 (UTC)
:*I'm working through the sources adding information as I go. The effect is that the prose will be a bit confusing in places until all the information from all sources has been added. But the information about some of the nuns being kind faithfully reflects the source. It may be that the weight of the sources (once they have all been added) means that this positive aspect isn't given as much weight in the completed version, but for now it needs to remain as it is because it is reliably sourced. I have to say that witness testimonies are pretty unreliable about certain aspects of the camps, such as the numbers of killed etc, but less so for other things. In some cases, relying on a witness statement of a child who was four or five at the time is ridiculous. It would never be accepted as fact in a court, so how could it be accepted in an encyclopaedic article? How would such a child in one part of the camp know how many children were killed in the whole camp, or how children in other parts of the camp were treated? The sub-camp was three kilometres away. Yet some survivors make such statements. There is some witness information that is useable, but I don't propose to reproduce everything said by every witness that was interviewed and whose testimony appears in a book, unless it is corroborated by another source. This applies to the below as well. Cheers, [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67|click to talk to me]]) 00:27, 12 September 2016 (UTC)

==Contradiction? (b)==
* [[User:Peacemaker67|@Peacemaker67]]: ''&quot;In response, the Red Cross ... began to collect and distribute food to the children.&quot;''&lt;br&gt; MY QUESTION IS: &lt;br&gt;Is the reference immediately above to the [[International Red Cross]] or the [[Croatian Red Cross]]? I only ask because I am pretty sure you added it, and given the previous textual reference to the Croatian Red Cross is its setting up a children's concentration camp ''&quot;in haste&quot;'', I am wondering. Thanks. [[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;'''''Quis separabit?'''''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:21, 12 September 2016 (UTC)
