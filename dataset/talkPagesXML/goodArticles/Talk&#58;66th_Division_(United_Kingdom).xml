Did you mean [[Serain]]?  [[User:Hamish59|Hamish59]] ([[User talk:Hamish59|talk]]) 10:11, 11 February 2013 (UTC)

Just realised that I've used {{}} rather than chevrons for various wikilinks and converters and the rest of the article is in &lt;&gt; references. Apologies but I don't know how to convert them.[[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 13:49, 10 January 2015 (UTC)

== ref questions ==

The following references do not correspond to any of the books cited to Edmonds. Are they typos, or are books missing? 

Edmonds, 1935 p. 504&lt;br&gt;
Edmonds, 1945, pp. 552–553, 561

Likewise, the following do not have corresponding books:

Carpenter&lt;br&gt;
Griffith

Is Gibson, the same as Gibbon?

Kincaid-Smith: looking up the isbn, I was able to [http://www.amazon.com/25Th-Division-France-Flanders-Kincaid-Smith/dp/1843421232/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460488206&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=isbn+1843421232 find the following]. To confirm, is this the same version? As it states the publication date as 2009 rather than 2010.

::Where there are two Edmonds 1995 citations, one of low numbers and the other of high, I think one is OH 1918 I and the other OH 1918 II. I added 1918 I as harvid|1995a| but I'm not sure which other cites are from it. [[User:Keith-264|Keith-264]] ([[User talk:Keith-264|talk]]) 08:36, 13 April 2016 (UTC)

== ORBAT WW1 ==

{{ping|EnigmaMcmxc}}  I've checked over the ORBAT against Becke volume 2 and there are some discrepancies depending on the date.
1914 - Becke's earliest orbat is November 1915 so some supposition that troops listed in 1915 were there from the start
* Only mounted troops as 66th Divisional Cyclist Company;  2/1 Bedfordshire Yeomanry are probably a later addition. 
* 2/3 East Lancs Field Company are post November 1915 addition.

1917 - this really depends on the date.  Becke is June and the differences from the article are:
* RFA CCCXXXII (2/III East Lancashire) Brigade broken up June 1917
* RE Add 430 (2/I East Lancashire) Field Company
* RAVC Add 1/1 East Lancs Mobile Veterinary Section

1918
* RA No Trench Mortar batteries - both disbanded April 1918 and not reconstituted.
* RE Add 430 (2/I East Lancashire) Field Company
* MGC - full title was 100th (Warwickshire &amp; South Nottinghamshire Yeomanry) Battalion MGC
* RAVC Add 1/1 East Lancs Mobile Veterinary Section

:{{ping|Nthep}}, thank you very much. Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I have not had much time the last few days. If you able, would you be able to make the edits to the article? If not, I will be able to in a few days if you will be able to do a little quality control afterwards to ensure there was no mistakes?

== Subsequent use of previously attached units ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[File:D-day - British Forces during the Invasion of Normandy 6 June 1944 B5004.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Men from No. 5 Beach Group, formerly of the [[Liverpool Irish|8th (Irish) Battalion]], [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)]], coming ashore at [[Sword Beach]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], 6 June 1944.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Following the disbandment of the 66th Division, its constituent units were dispersed. The 197th Brigade, with the [[59th (Staffordshire) Divisional Engineers|257th Field Company]] [[Royal Engineers|RE]] and [[Manchester Artillery|110th (Manchester) Field Regiment]] [[Royal Artillery|RA]] was assigned to the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]] and reformed it as a standard infantry division of three brigades, having been organised as a motorised division. With the 59th Division, the 197th Brigade fought in the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] from July–August 1944 before its battalions were disbanded in August, due to a severe shortage of infantry, to make up combat losses in other divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-div&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/939BXIA.pdf |last=Nafziger |first=George |title=Organization of British Infantry Divisions, 1939–1945 |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://59div.morssweb.com/?frontpage |title=59th Division, 1939–44 |first=Robert |last=Morss |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade headquarters was then assigned a number of support units for battlefield clearance duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-bde&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/939BXIE.pdf |last=Nafziger |first=George |title=British Infantry Brigades, 1st thru 214th, 1939–1945 |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[198th (East Lancashire) Brigade|198th Brigade]] was assigned to the [[56th (London) Division|1st London Infantry Division]] and in December 1940 was then assigned to the [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]. After the 54th Division was disbanded at the end of 1943, it became an administrative headquarters for [[line of communication]]s units.&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-div&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-bde&quot;/&gt; The [[Liverpool Irish|8th (Irish) Battalion]], [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)]] and 6th Battalion, Border Regiment were retrained as [[Beach groups]] and landed in Normandy on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], 6 June 1944. The 7th Battalion, Border Regiment was later transferred to the [[222nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|222nd Brigade]] and, in April 1944, redesignated the 5th Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/jscsc/jscsc-library/archives/operation-overlord/CONF4171_AssaultLandNormandy.pdf/view |title=The Assault Landings in Normandy: Order of Battle, Second British Army |last=Latham|first=H. B. |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 199th Brigade with [[Westmorland and Cumberland Yeomanry|109th Field Regiment, RA]], was assigned to [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division]], reforming it as a standard infantry division, and renumbered the [[166th (South Lancashire) Brigade|166th Infantry Brigade]] in August 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-div&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-bde&quot;/&gt;

The 111th Field Regiment, RA was assigned to the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, then to the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] and in 1942 was sent to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], where it served in the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] in [[North African Campaign|Africa]], [[Tunisia Campaign|Tunisia]], [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-div&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertrats.org.uk/bde/4thABunits.htm#RA111|title=Units That Served With The 4th Armoured Brigade: Royal Artillery Regiments|work=The History of the British 4th and 7th Armoured Brigades|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944–45, it was detached to Land Forces Adriatic and operated from [[Vis (island)|Vis]] on the Croatian coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1030000903|title=Index: Private Papers of Brigadier T de F Jago OBE|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 256th Field Company, Royal Engineers later served with the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th ''Battleaxe'' Infantry Division]] in Africa and Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;naf-div&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- 255th Field &amp; 258th Park could not be traced and probably became army troops somewhere --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have moved this section here to the talkpage. The information on the brigades being moved around has already been edited into the article, and the information on the RA and RE units will follow. However, the rest appears to be more suited to the various regiment, brigade, and division articles than here. This article should focus on the division, IMO.[[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] ([[User talk:EnigmaMcmxc|talk]]) 15:29, 3 May 2016 (UTC)</text>
