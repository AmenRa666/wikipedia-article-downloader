'''HMS ''Belfast''''' is a [[museum ship]], originally a [[Royal Navy]] [[light cruiser]], permanently moored in [[London]] on the [[River Thames]] and operated by the [[Imperial War Museum]].

Construction of ''Belfast'', the first Royal Navy ship to be named after the capital city of [[Northern Ireland]], and one of ten [[Town-class cruiser (1936)|Town-class cruisers]], began in December 1936. She was launched on [[St Patrick's Day]], 17 March 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], ''Belfast'' was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939 ''Belfast'' struck a German [[naval mine|mine]] and spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. ''Belfast'' returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment and armour. ''Belfast'' saw action escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] to the [[Soviet Union]] during 1943, and in December 1943 played an important role in the [[Battle of North Cape]], assisting in the destruction of the German warship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}. In June 1944 ''Belfast'' took part in [[Operation Overlord]] supporting the [[Normandy landings]]. In June 1945 ''Belfast'' was redeployed to the Far East to join the [[British Pacific Fleet]], arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. ''Belfast'' saw further combat action in 1950–52 during the [[Korean War]] and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before ''Belfast'' entered reserve in 1963.

In 1967, efforts were initiated to avert ''Belfast''{{'s}} expected scrapping and preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the [[River Thames]] near [[Tower Bridge]] in the [[Pool of London]], in [[Southwark]], [[London]], [[England]]. Opened to the public in October 1971, ''Belfast'' became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. A popular tourist attraction, ''Belfast'' receives over a quarter of a million visitors per year.&lt;ref name=ALVA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423/|title=Visits Made to Visitor Attractions in Membership with ALVA|publisher=Association of Leading Visitor Attractions|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a branch of a national museum and part of the [[National Historic Fleet]], ''Belfast'' is supported by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], by admissions income, and by the museum's commercial activities. The ship was closed to visitors following an accident in November 2011, and re-opened on 18 May 2012.

''Belfast'' is a cruiser of the [[Town-class cruiser (1936)|second Town class]]. The Town class had originated in 1933 as the [[Admiralty]]'s response to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Mogami|cruiser|2}}, an 11,200-ton cruiser mounting fifteen 6-inch guns with a top speed exceeding 35 knots. The Admiralty's [[requirement]] called for a 9,000 ton cruiser, sufficiently armoured to withstand a direct hit from an 8-inch shell, capable of 32 knots and mounting twelve 6-inch guns. Seaplanes carried aboard would enable shipping lanes to be patrolled over a wide area, and the class was also to be capable of its own anti-aircraft defence.{{sfn | Wingate | 2004 |p=7}} Under the [[Director of Naval Construction]] the new design evolved during 1933.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=6}} The lead ship of the new class, the 9,100-ton {{HMS|Southampton|83|6}}, and her sister {{HMS|Newcastle|C76|6}}, were ordered under the 1933 estimates.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=8}} Three more cruisers were built to this design, with a further three ships built to a slightly larger 9,400-ton design in 1935–36.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=8}} By 1935, however, the Admiralty was keen to improve the firepower of these cruisers to match the firepower of the Japanese ''Mogami''- and American {{sclass-|Brooklyn|cruiser|2}}s; both were armed with fifteen 6-inch guns.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=6}} The Admiralty rejected a design featuring five triple turrets as impractical, while an alternative design fitting four quadruple turrets was rejected as an effective quadruple turret could not be developed.{{sfn |Watton|1985|pp=6-7}} In May 1936 the Admiralty decided to fit triple turrets, whose improved design would permit an increase in deck armour.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=7}} This modified design became the 10,000-ton Edinburgh subclass, named after ''Belfast''{{'}}s sister ship {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}}.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=8}} ''Belfast'' was ordered from [[Harland and Wolff]] on 21 September 1936,{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=9}} and her keel laid on 10 December 1936.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=9}} Her expected cost was £2,141,514; of which the guns cost £75,000 and the aircraft (two [[Supermarine Walrus]]es) £66,500.&lt;ref name=IWM1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080612093723/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |archivedate=6 January 2009|title=History of HMS Belfast: Building and Launch |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=8 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 17 March 1938, by [[Anne Chamberlain]], the wife of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=9}} The launch was filmed by Pathe News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mrs-chamberlain-opens-new-airport-at-belfast-and-l |title=Pathe News film of launch |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From March to August 1939 ''Belfast'' was fitted out and underwent sea trials.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=11}}{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=9}}

[[File:HMS Belfast - Boiler diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of one of ''Belfast'''s boilers.]]When completed, ''Belfast'' had an [[overall length]] of {{convert|613|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|63|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|3|in|m|1}}. Her [[Displacement (ship)|standard displacement]] during her sea trials was {{convert|10420|LT|t}}.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=9}} She was propelled by four three-drum oil-fired Admiralty [[water-tube boiler]]s, turning [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving four propeller shafts.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=11}} She was capable of {{convert|32.5|kn|lk=in}} and carried {{convert|2400|LT|t}} of fuel oil.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=9}} This gave her a maximum range of {{convert|8664|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|13|kn}}.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=12}}

''Belfast'''s main armament comprised twelve [[BL 6 inch Mk XXIII naval gun|Mk XXIII six-inch guns]] in four triple turrets. With a rate of fire of up to eight rounds per gun per minute, her main battery was capable of a maximum rate of fire of 96 rounds per minute.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=12}} Her secondary armament comprised twelve [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|4-inch guns]] in six twin mounts. Her initial close-range anti-aircraft armament was sixteen [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot;]] guns in two eight-barrel mountings, and two quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun]]s. She also mounted six [[British 21 inch torpedo|Mk IV 21-inch torpedo]] tubes in two triple mounts, and fifteen Mk VII [[depth charge]]s.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=11}}{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=9}}

''Belfast'' was protected by a {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} main [[belt armor|armour belt]], with deck armour of {{convert|3|in|mm}} over her magazines, and {{convert|2|in|mm}} over her machinery spaces.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=9}} Her six-inch turrets were protected by up to {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} of armour.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=12}}

[[file:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A20690.jpg|thumb|One of ''Belfast'''s [[Supermarine Walrus]] aircraft, photographed in an Icelandic fjord, 1942-1943.]]''Belfast''{{'}}s aviation capability was provided by two catapult-launched [[Supermarine Walrus]] amphibious biplanes. These could be launched from a D1H [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] mounted aft of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted on either side of the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s HMS ''Belfast'' Flight of [[700 Naval Air Squadron]], were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=28}}

==Second World War==

===1939–1942: Commissioning, prize capture, mining, and repairs===
''Belfast'' sailed for [[Portsmouth]] on 3 August 1939, and was commissioned on 5 August 1939, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Her first captain was [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] G A Scott with a crew of 761, and her first assignment was to the [[Home Fleet]]'s [[2nd Cruiser Squadron]]. On 14 August ''Belfast'' took part in her first exercise, Operation [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Hipper'']], in which she played the role of a German [[commerce raider]] attempting to escape into the Atlantic. By navigating the hazardous [[Pentland Firth]], ''Belfast'' successfully evaded the Home Fleet.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=33}}

On 31 August 1939 ''Belfast'' was transferred to the [[18th Cruiser Squadron]]. Based at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney]] islands, 18th Cruiser Squadron was part of the British effort to impose a naval [[blockade]] on Germany. Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] the following day, and Britain and France declared war on 3 September. At 11:40 that morning, ''Belfast'' received the message ‘Commence hostilities at once against Germany’.{{sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=77}}  On 8 September ''Belfast'' put to sea from Scapa Flow with the battlecruisers ''[[HMS Hood|Hood]]'', ''[[HMS Renown (1916)|Renown]]'', her sister ship ''Edinburgh'' and four destroyers, on a patrol intended to intercept German ships returning from Norway. In particular, they were to search for the [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] liner ''[[SS Europa (1928)|Europa]]''. No enemy vessels were found.{{sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=77}} On 25 September, ''Belfast'' took part in a fleet operation to recover the submarine ''[[HMS Spearfish|Spearfish]]'', during which the ship was attacked by German aircraft, but suffered no damage.{{ sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=80}} On 1 October 1939 ''Belfast'' left Scapa Flow for a patrol in the North Sea. On 5 October ''Belfast'' intercepted and boarded a neutral Norwegian factory ship that was sailing in company with six whaling ships. {{Sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=81-82}} On 8 October the ship sighted the Swedish merchant ship ''C. P. Lilljevach'' but, in poor weather, did not intercept or board her. The following day she boarded ''Tai Yin'', a Norwegian ship. ''Tai Yin'' had been listed by the Admiralty as suspicious, so a [[prize crew]] from ''Belfast'' sailed her to Kirkwall for investigation.{{sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=82}} On 9 October ''Belfast'' intercepted a German liner, the 13,615-ton ''Cap Norte'', {{convert|50|mi|km}} north-west of the [[Faroe Islands]]. Disguised as a neutral Swedish vessel, the SS ''Ancona'', ''Cap Norte'' was attempting to return to Germany from Brazil; her passengers included German reservists.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=33}} Under the Admiralty's [[prize rules]], ''Belfast'''s crew later received prize money.&lt;ref name=IWMoutbreak&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.176n |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080612093723/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.176 |archivedate=6 January 2009 |title=History of HMS Belfast: Outbreak of War 1939 |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=3 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October ''Belfast'' boarded the Swedish ship ''Uddeholm'', which was also sailed to Kirkwall by a prize crew.{{sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=85}} Returning to harbour, on the night of 13-14 October, ''Belfast'' was among the few ships anchored in Scapa Flow, following intelligence reports of an expected air raid. That night, the battleship ''[[HMS Royal Oak (08)|Royal Oak]]'' was torpedoed by German submarine ''[[German submarine U-47 (1938)|U-47]]'', which had infiltrated the anchorage. On the morning following the sinking, ''Belfast'' left for [[Loch Ewe]].{{sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=85-86}}

On 10 November ''Belfast'' was taken off the northern patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at [[Rosyth]]. On 21 November, ''Belfast'' was to take part in the force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58&amp;nbsp;am she struck a magnetic [[naval mine|mine]] while leaving the [[Firth of Forth]]. The mine broke ''Belfast''{{'}}s keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=34-35}} Twenty officers and men would require hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died of a head injury, having been thrown against the deckhead by the blast.{{Sfn | Lavery | 2015 | p=15-19}} The [[tugboat]] ''Krooman'', towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed ''Belfast'' to Rosyth for initial repairs.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=34-35}}

Initial assessments of ''Belfast''{{'}}s damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct damage to the outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, the shock of the explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to [[Hogging and sagging|hog]] (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 ''Belfast'' was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of [[Rosyth Dockyard]], and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=35-36}}

[[File:Hms belfast mine damage.jpg|thumb|Photograph of ''Belfast'''s damaged hull, taken while the ship was drydocked for repairs.]]During her repairs, work was carried out to straighten, reconstruct and strengthen her hull. Her [[Belt armor|armoured belt]] was also extended and thickened. Her armament was updated with newer [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot;]] mountings, and her anti-aircraft armament improved with eighteen [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&amp;nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] guns  in five twin and eight single mountings, replacing two quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.5-inch Vickers]] guns. ''Belfast'' also received new fire control [[radar]]s for her main, secondary and anti-aircraft guns. Her November 1942 radar fit included one [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 284|Type 284]] set and four [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 283|Type 283]] sets to direct the main armament, three [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 285|Type 285]] sets for the secondary guns, and two [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 282|Type 285]] sets for the 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 273|Type 273]] general surface warning radar, Type 251 and 252 sets for [[identification friend or foe]] (IFF) purposes, and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 281|Type 281]] and Type 242 for air warning. Her 1942 electronics suite also included a Type 270 [[sonar|echosounder]].{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=39-40}} Due to her increased topweight, a bulge was introduced into her hull amidships to improve stability and provide extra longitudinal strength. Her beam had increased to {{convert|69|ft|m|abbr=on}} and her draught to {{convert|19|ft|m|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|20|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} aft.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=39-40}} Her displacement had risen to 11,550 tons.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron was responsible for the hazardous task of escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] to the [[Soviet Union]], operating from Scapa Flow and bases in [[Iceland]]. Her radar suite reduced ''Belfast''{{'s}} need for aerial surveillance, and her aircraft were disembarked in June 1943.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=14}} ''Belfast'' spent 1943 engaged on convoy escort and blockade patrol duties, and on 5–6 October formed part of the covering force during [[Operation Leader]], an airstrike against German shipping in northern [[Norway]] near [[Bodø]] by the aircraft carrier [[USS Ranger (CV-4)|USS ''Ranger'']].{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=43}}

On 26 December 1943, ''Belfast'' participated in the [[Battle of North Cape]]. This battle, which occurred during the [[Polar night|Arctic night]], involved two strong Royal Navy formations; the first, Force One, comprised the cruisers {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}}, {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}} and ''Belfast'' (the 10th Cruiser Squadron) with three destroyers, and the second, Force Two, comprised the battleship {{HMS|Duke of York|17|2}} and the cruiser {{HMS|Jamaica|44|2}} with four destroyers. On 25 December 1943, Christmas Day, Nazi Germany's {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}} {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} left port in northern Norway to attack Convoy JW55B, which was bound for the Soviet Union. The next day Force One encountered ''Scharnhorst'', prevented her from attacking the convoy, and forced her to turn for home after being damaged by the British cruisers. As ''Scharnhorst'' did so, she was intercepted by Force Two and sunk by the combined formations. ''Belfast'' played an important role in the battle; as flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron she was among the first to encounter ''Scharnhorst'', and coordinated the squadron's defence of the convoy. After ''Scharnhorst'' turned away from the convoy, Admiral Burnett in ''Belfast'' shadowed her by radar from outside visual range, enabling her interception by ''Duke of York''.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=44-55}}

===1944: ''Tirpitz'' and D-Day===
After North Cape, ''Belfast'' refuelled at [[Kola Inlet]] before sailing for the United Kingdom, arriving at Scapa to replenish her fuel, ammunition and stores on New Year's Day 1944. ''Belfast'' sailed to Rosyth on 10 January, where her crew received a period of leave. February 1944 saw ''Belfast'' resume her Arctic convoy duties, and on 30 March 1944 ''Belfast'' sailed with the covering force of [[Operation Tungsten]], a large carrier-launched [[Fleet Air Arm]] airstrike against the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=55-57}} Moored in [[Altafjord]] in northern Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was the German navy's last surviving [[capital ship]].&lt;ref name=HMSB1944/&gt; Forty-two [[Fairey Barracuda]] dive-bombers from {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} and {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} made up the strike force, escorted by eighty fighters.

On 8 May ''Belfast'' returned to Scapa and carried [[George VI of the United Kingdom|the King]] during his pre-invasion visit to the Home Fleet.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=57}}

[[File:The cruiser HMS Belfast bombarding German positions in Normandy.jpg|thumb|upright|HMS ''Belfast''{{'}}s 4-inch guns bombarding German positions in Normandy at night.]]
For the [[invasion of Normandy]] ''Belfast'' was made headquarters ship of Bombardment Force E flying the flag of Rear-Admiral [[Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton]], and was to support landings by British and Canadian forces in the [[Gold Beach|Gold]] and [[Juno Beach]] sectors. On 2 June ''Belfast'' left the River Clyde for her bombardment areas. That morning Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] had announced his intention to go to sea with the fleet and witness the invasion from HMS ''Belfast''. This was opposed by the Supreme Allied Commander, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and the [[First Sea Lord]], Sir [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]]. An intervention by the King eventually prevented Churchill from going.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=57}}

The invasion was to begin on 5 June but bad weather forced a 24-hour delay. At 5:30&amp;nbsp;am on 6 June ''Belfast'' opened fire on a German artillery battery at Ver-sur-Mer, suppressing the guns until the site was overrun by British infantry of 7th Battalion, [[Green Howards]]. On 12 June ''Belfast'' supported Canadian troops moving inland from Juno Beach and returned to Portsmouth on 16 June to replenish her ammunition. She returned two days later for further bombardments. On the night of 6 July ''Belfast'' was threatened at anchor by German [[motor torpedo boat]]s (&quot;[[E-boat]]s&quot;). She evaded them by [[Weigh anchor|weighing anchor]] and moving to the concealment of a [[smoke screen]].{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=57-58}} ''Belfast'' fired her last round [[fire in anger|in anger]] in European waters on 8 July, in company with the [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{HMS|Roberts|F40|6}} and the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}}, as part of [[Operation Charnwood]].{{refn|A [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch gun]] from {{HMS|Roberts|F40|6}} is one of the pair now on display outside [[Imperial War Museum|Imperial War Museum London]]&lt;ref name=IWM15inch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.990 |title= Collections: Exhibits and Firearms: Frequently Asked Questions: The 15-inch guns |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |work=iwm.org.uk |publisher= |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} On 10 July she sailed for Scapa, the fighting in France having moved beyond the range of her guns.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=57-58}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080612093723/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.297 |archivedate=6 January 2009|url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.297 |title=History of HMS Belfast: D-Day 6 June 1944 |work=|publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=8 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her five weeks off Normandy ''Belfast'' had fired 1,996 rounds from her six-inch guns.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=8}}

===1945: Service in the Far East===
On 29 July 1944 Captain Parham handed over command of HMS ''Belfast'' to Captain R M Dick, and until April 1945 ''Belfast'' underwent a refit to prepare for service against Japan in the Far East which improved her accommodation for tropical conditions, and updated her anti-aircraft armament and fire control in order to counter expected [[kamikaze]] attacks by Japanese aircraft. By May 1945 ''Belfast'' mounted thirty-six [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder guns]] in two eight-gun mounts, four quadruple mounts, and four single mounts. She also mounted fourteen 20mm Oerlikons.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=12}} Her two aftmost 4-inch mountings were removed, and the remainder fitted with [[List of British ordnance terms#RPC|Remote Power Control]]. Her empty hangars were converted to crew accommodation, and her aircraft catapult removed.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=58-61}}

[[File:HMS BELFAST at anchor in Sydney harbour, August 1945. ABS694.jpg|thumb|''Belfast'' at anchor in [[Sydney Harbour]], August 1945.]]Her radar fit now included a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 277|Type 277]] radar set to replace her Type 273 for surface warning. Her Type 281 air warning set was replaced by a single-antenna Type 281B set, while a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 293|Type 293Q]] was fitted for close-range height-finding and surface warning. A [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 274|Type 274]] set was fitted for main armament fire direction.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=11}}{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=14}} On 17 June 1945, with the war in Europe at an end, ''Belfast'' sailed for the Far East via Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo and Sydney. By the time she arrived in Sydney on 7 August ''Belfast'' had been made flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the [[British Pacific Fleet]]. While in Sydney ''Belfast'' underwent another short refit, supplementing her close-range armament with five [[Bofors 40 mm|40mm Bofors]] guns. ''Belfast'' had been expected to join in [[Operation Downfall]], but this was forestalled by the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on 15 August 1945.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=58-61}}

==Post-war service 1945–50==
[[File:HMS Belfast (C35) in Japan 1950.jpg|thumb|''Belfast'' arriving at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], southern Japan, in May 1950.]]
With the end of the war, ''Belfast'' remained in the Far East, conducting a number of cruises to ports in Japan, China and Malaya and sailing for Portsmouth on 20 August 1947. There she paid off into reserve, and underwent a refit during which her turbines were opened for maintenance. She also received two more single Bofors guns, in place of two of her single 2-pounder mountings.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=12}} She was recommissioned on 22 September 1948 and before returning to the Far East visited her home city of Belfast arriving on 20 October. The following day, 21 October 1948, the ship's company marked [[Trafalgar Day]] with a march through the city. The next day ''Belfast'' took charge of a silver ship's bell, a gift of the people of Belfast.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=62}} She sailed for [[Hong Kong]] on 23 October to join the Royal Navy's [[Far East Station]], arriving in late December. By 1949, the political situation in China was precarious, with the [[Chinese Civil War]] moving towards its conclusion. As flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, ''Belfast'' was the Far Eastern Station's headquarters ship during the April 1949 [[Yangtze Incident#Yangtze Incident|''Amethyst'' Incident]], in which a British sloop, {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} was trapped in the [[Yangtze River]] by the communist [[People's Liberation Army]]. ''Belfast'' remained in Hong Kong during 1949, sailing for [[Singapore]] on 18 January 1950. There she underwent a minor refit between January and March 1950 and in June she joined the Far East Fleet's summer cruise.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=73-76}} On 25 June 1950, while ''Belfast'' was visiting [[Hakodate, Hokkaidō|Hakodate]] in Japan, North Korean forces crossed the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]], starting the [[Korean War]].{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=76}}

==Korean War 1950–52==
[[File:HMS Belfast bombarding Korea.jpg|thumb|March 1951: ''Belfast'' fires a salvo against enemy troop concentrations on the west coast of Korea.]]

With the outbreak of the Korean War, ''Belfast'' became part of the [[United Nations]] naval forces. Originally part of the US Navy's [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]], ''Belfast'' was detached in order to operate independently on 5 July 1950. During July and early August ''Belfast'' undertook coastal patrols and was based at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] in Japan's [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]. From 19 July ''Belfast'' supported troops fighting around Yongdok, accompanied by the {{USS|Juneau|CL-119|6}}. That day ''Belfast'' fired an accurate 350-round bombardment from her 6-inch guns, and was praised by an American admiral as a &quot;straight-shooting ship&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The admiral is not identified in Wingate (2004), but may have been Rear Admiral [[John Higgins (admiral)|John Higgins]], for whom ''Juneau'' was flagship.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=81}} On 6 August she sailed for the UK for a short (but needed) refit, after which she again set sail for the far east and arrived back at Sasebo on 31 January 1951.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=81}}
[[File:HMS Belfast (C35) and HMS Ocean (R68) off Korea 1952.jpg|thumb|left|''Belfast'' cruising alongside {{HMS|Ocean|R68|2}} off Korea in 1952.]]
During 1951 ''Belfast'' mounted a number of coastal patrols and bombarded a variety of targets. On 1 June she arrived at Singapore for refitting, arriving back on patrol on 31 August. In September 1951 ''Belfast'' provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] jet fighter. She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month's leave from operations, returning to action on 23 December.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=84}}

In 1952 ''Belfast'' continued her coastal patrol duties. On 29 July 1952 ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire while engaging an [[artillery battery]] on Wolsa-ri island. A 75&amp;nbsp;mm shell struck a forward compartment, killing a British sailor of Chinese origin in his hammock and wounding four other Chinese ratings. This was the only time ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire during her Korean service. On 27 September 1952 ''Belfast'' was relieved by two other Town-class cruisers, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|6}} and {{HMS|Newcastle|C76|6}}, and sailed back to the UK. She had steamed over {{convert|80000|mi|km}} in the combat zone and fired more than 8,000 rounds from her 6-inch guns during the Korean War. She paid off in [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] on 4 November 1952 and entered reserve at Devonport on 1 December.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=87}}

==Modernisation and final commissions 1955–1963==
[[File:HMS Belfast 4 db.jpg|thumb|upright|After modernisation; showing the enclosed bridge, lattice mast and twin Bofors mountings.]]
In reserve, ''Belfast''{{'}}s future was uncertain: post-war defence cuts made manpower-intensive cruisers excessively costly to operate, and it was not until March 1955 that the decision was taken to modernise ''Belfast''. Work began on 6 January 1956. Although described as only an extended refit, the cost was substantial for this large middle aged cruiser, 5.5 million pounds &lt;ref&gt; M. Janistch. A Source book of 20C Warships. Ward Lock (1977) London, p60 &lt;/ref&gt;  Changes included providing the new twin MK 5 40mm and  the twin  4 inch  mount with individual MRS8 directors and the 4 inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees a sec and protecting key parts of the ship against [[Weapon of mass destruction|nuclear, biological or chemical]] attack. This last consideration meant enclosing her [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], creating a two-tiered, five-sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance. The most significant change was better accommodation for a smaller crew more fitting of post war needs, her tripod masts replaced with lattice masts, and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck. The overall effect was to create a cruiser significantly more habitable but different internally and to a degree in external appearance from wartime cruisers but only marginally superior in capability from its late war fit. ''Belfast'' recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=87-90}} Her close-range armament was standardised to six twin Bofors gun, and her close-range fire direction similarly standardised to eight close-range blind fire directors fitted with [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 262|Type 262]] radar.{{sfn |Watton|1985|p=14}} Her 1959 radar fit also included [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 274|Type 274]], retained for main armament direction, [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 277|Type 277Q]] and [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 293|293Q]] for height-finding and surface warning, Type 960M for air warning, and 974 for surface warning.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=88}} In order to save weight, her torpedo armament was removed.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=88}}

''Belfast'' arrived in Singapore on 16 December 1959, and spent most of 1960 at sea on exercise, calling at ports in Hong Kong, Borneo, India, Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), Australia, the Philippines and Japan. On 31 January 1961 ''Belfast'' recommissioned, under the command of Captain [[Morgan Morgan-Giles]]. On her final foreign commission ''Belfast'' joined a number of exercises in the Far East, and in December 1961 she provided the British guard of honour at [[Tanganyika]]'s independence ceremony in [[Dar-es-Salaam]].{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=90-99}}

[[File:HMS Belfast (C35) at Pearl Harbor in 1962.jpg|left|thumb|''Belfast'' at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, in 1962.]]The ship left Singapore on 26 March 1962 for the UK, sailing east via Hong Kong, Guam and [[Pearl Harbor]], San Francisco, Seattle, British Columbia, Panama and Trinidad. She arrived at Portsmouth on 19 June 1962. 

Recommissioned in July, she made a final visit to Belfast from 23–29 November, before paying off into reserve on 25 February 1963. In July 1963 ''Belfast'' was recommissioned for the last time, with a crew of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]] (RNR) and a number of [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadets]] flying the flag of the Admiral Commanding Reserves, Rear Admiral Hugh Martell. ''Belfast'' sailed for Gibraltar in company with sixteen RNR [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] for a two-week exercise in the Mediterranean on 10 August.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=101}} Martell's [[obituary|obituarist]] considered this commission a well-judged contrivance which 'did much to restore the confidence and image of the new RNR' which had undergone an acrimonious amalgamation with the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Reserve, decommissioning, and preservation efforts 1963–1971==
''Belfast'' returned to Devonport on 24 August 1963 and underwent a short refit to prepare her for paying off into reserve, which occurred in December 1963. In January 1966 parts of the ship and power systems were reactivated and from May 1966 to 1970 she was an accommodation ship (taking over those duties from {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}}), moored in [[Fareham]] Creek, for the Reserve Division at Portsmouth.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=101}} While ''Belfast'' lay at Fareham Creek the [[Imperial War Museum]], Britain's national museum of twentieth century conflict, became interested in preserving a 6-inch turret. The turret would represent a number of classes of cruiser (then disappearing from service) and would complement the museum's pair of British [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch]] naval guns.&lt;ref name=IWM15inch/&gt;{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=101}} On 14 April 1967 museum staff visited {{HMS|Gambia|C48|2}}, a {{sclass2-|Crown Colony|cruiser|2}} also moored in Fareham Creek at the time. Following the visit the possibility was raised of preserving an entire ship. ''Gambia'' had already severely deteriorated, so attention turned to the possibility of saving ''Belfast''. A joint committee was established by the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], which reported in June 1968 that the scheme was practical and economic. However, in early 1971 the [[Her Majesty's Government|government]]'s [[Paymaster General]] decided against preservation.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=101}} On 4 May 1971 ''Belfast'' was 'reduced to disposal' to await scrapping.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=101}}

Following the government's refusal, a private trust was formed to campaign for the ship's preservation. The HMS ''Belfast'' Trust was established; its chairman was Rear-Admiral Sir [[Morgan Morgan-Giles]], captain of ''Belfast'' from January 1961 to July 1962.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=101}} As [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for Winchester, Morgan-Giles addressed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 March 1971. He described ''Belfast'' as being in &quot;a really wonderful state of preservation&quot; and that saving her for the nation represented a &quot;case of grasping the last opportunity&quot;.&lt;ref name=hansardmarch71/&gt; Among the MPs who spoke in support of Morgan-Giles was [[Gordon Bagier]], MP for [[Sunderland South (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland South]], who served as a [[Royal Marine]] gunner aboard ''Belfast'' and was present at both the sinking of the ''Scharnhorst'' and the Normandy landings. Speaking for the government, the Under-secretary for the Navy, [[Peter Michael Kirk]], said that ''Belfast'' was &quot;one of the most historic ships which the Navy has had in the last 20 years&quot;,&lt;ref name=hansardmarch71/&gt; but that he could not prevent the stripping of the ship's removable equipment, as this was already too far advanced to be halted. He did, however, agree to postpone any decision on the scrapping of ''Belfast'' to allow the Trust to put together a formal proposal.&lt;ref name=hansardmarch71&gt;{{cite web |title=HMS ''Belfast'' |work=[[Hansard]] 1803–2005 vol 813 cc207-16 |date=8 March 1971|publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/mar/08/hms-belfast#S5CV0813P0_19710308_HOC_525 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Trust's efforts, the government agreed to hand over ''Belfast'' to the Trustees in July 1971, with [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] Sir Donald Gibson as her first director. At a press conference in August the Trust announced &quot;Operation Seahorse&quot;,{{refn|Operation Seahorse was named for the ship's badge, which shows a seahorse (which also appears on the [[City of Belfast]]'s coat of arms) wearing a red [[gorget]] over waves.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|p=9}}|group=nb}} the plan to bring ''Belfast'' to London.

Now a museum, the ship's opening was well received: in 1972 the HMS ''Belfast'' Trust won the [[British Tourist Authority]]'s &quot;Come to Britain&quot; trophy.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}} Support for the ship's restoration was received from individuals, from the Royal Navy, and from commercial businesses; in 1973, for example, the [[Worshipful Company of Bakers]] provided dummy bread for display in the ship's [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes|NAAFI]] and bakery.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}} By 1974 areas including the Admiral's bridge and forward boiler and engine rooms had been restored and fitted out.

==Imperial War Museum 1978–present==
By 1977, the financial position of the HMS ''Belfast'' Trust had become marginal, and the Imperial War Museum sought permission to merge the Trust into the museum. On 19 January 1978 the Secretary of State for Education and Science, [[Shirley Williams, Baroness Williams of Crosby|Shirley Williams]], accepted the proposal stating that HMS ''Belfast'' &quot;is a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HMS ''Belfast'' |work=[[Hansard]] 1803–2005 vol 942 c301W |date=19 January 1978|publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/jan/19/hms-belfast#S5CV0942P0_19780119_CWA_145 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was transferred to the museum on 1 March 1978,{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}} and became the Imperial War Museum's third branch, [[Imperial War Museum Duxford|Duxford aerodrome]] having been acquired in 1976. In October 1998, the HMS ''Belfast'' Association was formed to reunite former members of the ship’s company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.211 |title=HMS Belfast Association: About the Association |work= iwm.org.uk |publisher= Imperial War Museum |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial War Museum's [[Imperial War Museum#Collections|Sound Archive]] also seeks to record [[oral history]] interviews with former crewmen.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}}

===Preservation===
[[File:HMS Belfast (C35), London, England-25Sept2010.jpg|thumb|left|A floating crane was moored alongside HMS ''Belfast'' during the installation of her new masts; September 2010.]]
Since being brought to London ''Belfast'' has twice been [[drydock]]ed as part of the ship’s long-term preservation. In 1982 she was docked at [[Tilbury]], and in June 1999 ''Belfast'' was towed to [[Portsmouth]]. This was the first time she had been to sea in 28 years and required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]].{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}} While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, [[sandblasting|blasted]], and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic survey]] carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maritime.org/conf/conf-wenzel.htm  |title=Diminishing Shipyard Resources |author=Wenzel, Jon |date=April 1997 |work= |publisher=Third International Conference on the Technical Aspects of the Preservation of Historic Vessels |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is not expected to require further drydocking until 2020.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}} While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=War veteran battles weather |work=BBC News |date=7 June 1999 |accessdate=20 April 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/363318.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the maintenance work, ''Belfast'''s  hull and topsides were repainted in her specific [[Ship camouflage|camouflage]] scheme officially known as ''Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25'', which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}} With the establishment of the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]'s (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, ''Belfast'' was listed as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/ships_register.php?action=ship&amp;id=123 |title=HMS Belfast |work=National Register of Historic Vessels |publisher=[http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/ National Historic Ships] |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|''Belfast'' is one of three vessels with such listing in London, the other two being the [[tea clipper]] ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' and the coastal steamer {{SS|Robin}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/news.php/246/ss-robin-arrives-in-london |title=SS Robin arrives in London |author=[[National Historic Ships]] |date=14 July 2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

On 9 May 2010, a ceremony was held aboard ''Belfast'' to mark the 65th anniversary of end of the war in Europe. Veterans of the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] were in attendance to receive medals from the Russian Ambassador [[Yuri Fedotov]]. During the ceremony it was announced that, as part of the restoration of the ship, two new masts had been manufactured at the [[Severnaya Verf]] shipyard near [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;londonse1masts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4533 |title=New masts for HMS Belfast made in Russian shipyard

===Interpretation===
[[File:HMS Belfast - Arctic messdeck 1.jpg|thumb|Arctic messdeck in a forward compartment.]]
When ''Belfast'' was first opened to the public, visitors were limited to the upper decks and forward superstructure.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}} As of 2011, nine decks are open to the public. Access to the ship is via a walkway which connects the [[quarterdeck]] with the pedestrianised footpath on the south bank of the [[River Thames]]. The Imperial War Museum's guidebook to HMS ''Belfast'' divides the ship into three broad sections.{{sfn |Imperial War Museum | 2009 |pp=6–7}} The first of these, 'Life on board the ship', focuses on the experience of serving at sea. Restored compartments, some populated with dressed figures, illustrate the crew's living conditions and the ship's various facilities such as the sick bay, galley, laundry, chapel, mess decks and [[NAAFI]].{{sfn |Imperial War Museum | 2009 |pp=28–39}} Since 2002 school and youth groups have been able to stay onboard ''Belfast'' overnight, sleeping in bunks on a restored 1950s mess deck.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|loc=Postscript}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2193408 |title=All Aboard |author=Adams, Bernard |date=10 February 2006 |work=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second section, 'The inner workings', below the waterline and protected by the ship's armoured belt, contains core mechanical, electrical and communication systems. As well as the engine and boiler rooms, other compartments include the transmitting station (housing the ship's [[Admiralty Fire Control Table]], a mechanical computer), the forward steering position and one of ''Belfast''{{'}}s six-inch shell rooms and [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazines]].{{sfn |Imperial War Museum | 2009 |pages=40–49}} The third section, 'Action stations', includes the upper deck and forward superstructure with the ship's armament, fire control, and command facilities.{{sfn |Imperial War Museum | 2009 |pp=50–57}} Areas open to the public include the operations room, Admiral's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and gun direction platform. During 2011 two of these areas were [[heritage interpretation|reinterpreted]]. The operations room was restored to its appearance during Exercise Pony Express, a large British-Australian-American joint exercise held off [[North Borneo]] in 1961. The reinterpretation included an interactive audio-visual [[plot (radar)|plotting table]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In a thesis entitled ''[http://scholarship.shu.edu/dissertations/1828 Save our Ships: The Viability of Naval Vessels as Museum Exhibitions]'', historian and museum studies scholar Seth Weiner cites the 2011 accident as an example of the vitality of preventative maintenance in preserving complex artifacts, including historic ships. Weiner emphasizes the need for comprehensive oversight of exhibit maintenance operations as a means of preventing future accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seth|first=Weiner,|date=2012-01-01|title=Save Our Ships: The Viability of Naval Vessels as Museum Exhibitions|url=http://scholarship.shu.edu/dissertations/1828|publisher=Seton Hall University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure delayed the construction of a new two-storey bankside pavilion to replace ''Belfast''{{'}}s existing retail and admissions building. The structure, for which [[planning permission]] was received in October 2011, provides a ground floor café, shop and admissions area, and a rooftop bar.
