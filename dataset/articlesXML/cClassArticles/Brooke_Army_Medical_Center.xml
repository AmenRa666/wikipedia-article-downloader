'''Brooke Army Medical Center''' (BAMC) is the United States Army's premier medical institution. Located on [[Fort Sam Houston]], BAMC is the Army's largest and busiest medical center. The center is composed of ten separate organizations centered on the Army's largest in-patient hospital, the San Antonio Military Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bamc.amedd.army.mil/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

SAMMC has a history which dates back to 1879 when the first Post Hospital opened as a small medical dispensary located in a single-story wooden building. During the early years the Post Hospital was in temporary structures, and it was not until 1886 that the first permanent hospital was built. In 1907 an 84-bed Station Hospital was constructed on the west side of the post.

In 1929, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Roger Brooke]] assumed command of the Station Hospital, a position he held until 1933. Brooke is credited with instituting the first routine [[chest X-ray]] in military medicine. In July 1936, the cornerstone was laid for the construction of a replacement Station Hospital. By November 1937, the new 418-bed hospital was operational, having cost $3 million. The new hospital was the first in a series of moves which changed [[Fort Sam Houston]] from an [[Infantry]] to a medical [[Military base|Post]].

In 1941, the Station Hospital prepared for an overwhelming flow of casualties from [[World War II]] battlefields by converting a 220-person enlisted [[barracks]] into additional patient wards.

===Brooke General Hospital===
In 1942, the Station Hospital was renamed '''Brooke General Hospital''' in Brooke's honor. In 1944, BAMC converted a Cavalry Battalion barracks into a convalescent unit to accommodate the flow of casualties from the war. This building later became Beach Pavilion. Beach housed a substantial portion of BAMC assets to include patient wards and specialty clinics.

===Brooke Army Medical Center===
In 1946, [[Fort Sam Houston]] was chosen as the new site for the U.S. Army Medical Field Service School. The decision to centralize the [[United States Army|Army's]] medical research and training at one location resulted in the renaming of '''Brooke General Hospital''' to '''Brooke Army Medical Center'''. In September 1987, the official groundbreaking took place for the construction of a new hospital.

[[File:BAMC salute.jpg|thumb|right|Folding the US flag at the BAMC main entrance in 2005.]]
On July 18, 1995, ownership of the replacement hospital was given to the BAMC Commander by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the key turnover ceremony. On March 14, 1996, the new facility was officially dedicated and on April 13, BAMC opened for business with the transfer of inpatients from the &quot;old&quot; BAMC to the &quot;new&quot; BAMC.

Today &quot;old&quot; BAMC is home to [[United States Army South]] and a number of smaller units.

===SAMMC===
Because of the 2005 [[Base realignment and closure]], Brooke Army Medical Center was renamed San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) on September 6, 2011. The designation BAMC continues to represent the headquarters that serves as the command for all medical facilities in San Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bamc.amedd.army.mil/brac.asp|title=BRAC Information|publisher=Brooke Army Medical Center|date=May 23, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SAMMC==
'''San Antonio Military Medical Center''' (SAMMC) — formerly '''Brooke General Hospital''' (BGH) — is situated at [[Fort Sam Houston]], [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], and is part of [http://www.bamc.amedd.army.mil/ Brooke Army Medical Center] (BAMC) and the [[U.S. Army Medical Command]]. BAMC is the command element over all Army medical facilities in the San Antonio area, including SAMMC. It is a [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]] and [[USUHS]] teaching hospital and is home to the [[Army Burn Center]].

The hospital today is a 425-bed [[Joint Commission]]-accredited facility, expandable to 653 beds in the event of disaster. Services include general medical and surgical care, adult and [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] [[primary care]] clinics, 24-hour [[Emergency department]], specialty clinics, clinical services, wellness and prevention services, veterinary care, and environmental health services.

SAMMC is the only [[United States Army Medical Command|MEDCOM]] [[Level I trauma center]] in the United States, and is part of the [[Southern Regional Medical Command]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gprmc.amedd.army.mil/ Southern Regional Medical Command (SRMC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The old BGH building (1937) was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 30, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP&quot;/&gt;

==SAMMC (BAMC) concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Under [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|BRAC 2005]], BAMC will expand its inpatient services as those services are relocated from the [[59th Medical Wing]], [[Wilford Hall Medical Center]] ([[USAF]]). The Nuclear Medicine service is one of the first to completely integrate operations, and offers PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and other molecular imaging and therapy services.

To accomplish the realignment of inpatient services and related specialty care from Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) to Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) as presented in the BRAC 2005 scenario, BAMC will undergo the construction of a consolidated tower, a parking facility, a central energy plant, and renovations within the existing facility.

===Consolidated Tower (CoTo)===
Construction began in March 2009 on the nearly {{convert|738000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} project. CoTo was added on the east side of the facility adjacent to the clinical building and medical mall. This addition houses administrative space, an outpatient pediatrics clinic, an expanded Emergency and Trauma department, a SICU, a CCU, a psychiatric unit, and an expansion of the USAISR Burn Unit. SAMMC will serve as a health science center for inpatient and ambulatory care, consisting of training for Graduate Medical Education (GME), a Level 1 Trauma Center, and the only American Burn Association verified Burn Center within the DoD.

===Parking garage===
Construction began in March 2009 on a multi-level, 5,000-space parking structure to accommodate the increased capacity at the upgraded medical facility.

===Central energy plant===
Due to the size increase in the BAMC facility, additional heating and cooling capacities are being provided with a {{convert|22,400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} central energy plant, which is under construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sammc.amedd.army.mil/sammc_north.asp] SAMMC Concept: Realignment of inpatient services and related specialty care from Wilford Hall Medical Center to Brooke Army Medical Center, creating the San Antonio Military Medical Center.&lt;/ref&gt;
