The '''5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade''' was a [[cavalry]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Indian Army]] that saw active service in the [[Indian Army during the First World War]].  Formed in November 1914, it served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as part of the [[2nd Indian Cavalry Division|2nd]] and [[1st Indian Cavalry Division]]s until it was broken up in March 1918.

==History==
Uniquely amongst the six Indian [[cavalry]] [[brigade]]s sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the [[First World War]], the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade was not a pre war formation.{{efn|The other five Indian [[cavalry]] [[brigade]]s sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the [[First World War]] were:
* [[2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade]] of [[2nd (Rawalpindi) Division]]&lt;ref name=Perry40&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[3rd (Ambala) Cavalry Brigade]] of [[3rd (Lahore) Division]]&lt;ref name=Perry49&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[7th (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade]] of [[7th (Meerut) Division]]&lt;ref name=Perry85&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[8th (Lucknow) Cavalry Brigade]] of [[8th (Lucknow) Division]]&lt;ref name=Perry100&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade]] of [[9th (Secunderabad) Division]]&lt;ref name=Perry106&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The only remaining pre-war cavalry brigade{{snd}}[[1st (Risalpur) Cavalry Brigade]] of [[1st (Peshawar) Division]]{{snd}}stayed in India throughout the war.&lt;ref name=Perry36&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The brigade was formed on 11 November 1914{{efn|11 November 1914 was the appointment date of the brigade's first commanding officer.&lt;ref name=Perry17&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} from units in [[5th (Mhow) Division]] and the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons]] from [[Muttra]].&lt;ref name=Perry19&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In company with the [[7th (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade]], it departed [[Bombay]] on 19 November 1914 and landed at [[Marseilles]] on 14–16 December.  It joined the [[2nd Indian Cavalry Division]] which was formally constituted on 14 December.  The division concentrated around [[Orléans]] on 20–24 December and moved up to the Front on 1–4 January 1915.  While in France, the brigade was known by its geographical rather than numerical designation so as to avoid confusion with the British [[5th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Cavalry Brigade]] also serving on the Western Front at the same time.&lt;ref name=Perry20&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 1915, the brigade swapped places with the [[3rd (Ambala) Cavalry Brigade]] of [[1st Indian Cavalry Division]].&lt;ref name=Perry14&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry18&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] when it helped to hold the German counter-attack, it was not involved in battle. Instead, it was held in reserve in case of a breakthrough, although it did send parties to the trenches on a number of occasions. They would hold the line, or act as [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneers]]; such parties were designated as the '''Mhow Battalion'''.&lt;ref name=Perry16&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 1917, [[Lance-Daffadar]] [[Gobind Singh (VC)|Gobind Singh]] of the [[28th Light Cavalry]], attached to [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette | date = 15 May 1919 | issue = 31340 | startpage = 6084 | supp = | accessdate = 22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; won the [[Victoria Cross]] during the Battle of Cambrai.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette | date = 11 January 1918 | issue = 30471 | startpage = 725 | supp = yes | accessdate = 22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Dissolved
In March 1918, the brigade was broken up in France. The British units (6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and [[A Battery, Royal Horse Artillery]]) remained in France, 11th Machine Gun Squadron was broken up on 14 April 1918&lt;ref name=LLT_Cav_MGC&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Long Long Trail|accessdate=22 July 2015|last=Baker|first=Chris|title=Cavalry units of the Machine Gun Corps|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mgccav.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Indian elements were sent to Egypt.&lt;ref name=Perry16/&gt;  On 24 April 1918, these were merged with the [[6th Mounted Brigade]] of the [[Yeomanry Mounted Division]].&lt;ref name=Becke33&gt;{{harvnb|Becke|1936|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 1918 the 6th Mounted Brigade was redesignated as [[10th Cavalry Brigade (British Indian Army)|10th Cavalry Brigade]] and the division as [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]].&lt;ref name=Perry22&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
