The United States Army's '''Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Programs''' are executed within the [[Installation Management Command]] G9, Family and MWR Directorate,&lt;ref name=&quot;armymwr.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.armymwr.com/commander/history.aspx|title = webpage|format = |date = |accessdate = 2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the deactivation of the Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command on 3 June 2011 in a ceremony at Fort Sam Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;about MWR&quot;&gt;[http://www.armymwr.com/commander/aboutfmwrc.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508024916/http://www.armymwr.com/commander/aboutfmwrc.aspx |date=8 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the organization's official mission statement, IMCOM G9 delivers &quot;quality Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs and services supporting the readiness and resilience of the All-Volunteer Army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.armymwr.com/commander/mission.aspx|title = Family and MWR Mission and Vision|publisher = |date = |accessdate = 2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to U.S. Army Regulation 215-1, Army MWR is a quality-of-life program that directly supports readiness by providing a variety of community, soldier, and family support programs, activities and services. Included in MWR are social, fitness, recreational, educational, and other programs and activities that enhance community life, foster soldier and unit readiness, promote mental and physical fitness, and generally provide a working and living environment that attracts and retains quality for [[U.S. Army]] soldiers, family members, retirees and its civilian workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r215_1.pdf |title=Army Regulation 215-1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of MWR programs offered at Army garrisons is based on the needs of authorized patrons who work and reside there. Programs are managed by garrison commanders within the framework of authorized and available appropriated and non-appropriated funds. Non-appropriated funds are those funds that are locally generated by MWR programs or provided by [[Installation Management Command]] (IMCOM) region directors and/or the Family and MWR Programs. AAFES dividends are also a source of non-appropriated funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;

Each MWR program is classified by category. Categories are determined by their effect on the military mission and their ability to generate revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;

==Objectives==
Family and MWR supports combat readiness and effectiveness; supports recruitment and retention of quality personnel; provides leisure time activities, which support a quality of life commensurate with generally accepted American values; promotes and maintains the mental and physical wellbeing of authorized personnel; fosters community pride, soldier morale, and family wellness and promotes unit esprit de corps, eases the impact of unique aspects of military life, such as frequent relocations and deployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;

Although the United States Army was founded in 1775,&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Army Center of Military History]], The Birthday of the U.S. Army [http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/birth.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Morale, welfare, and recreation programs did not exist for the Army until the start of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

Before that time, troop support came informally in the form of tradesmen and trading posts. The goods they were able to provide included meals, clothing, and laundering.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

The formalization of MWR services began with limited Congressional oversight established in 1876 over &quot;Post Traders&quot; and then the establishment of Army &quot;PX&quot; or The Post Exchange, by Headquarters, [[Department of the Army]] (HQDA) in 1895, with [[United States Department of War|War Department]] General Order No. 46, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafes.ws/pa/history/docs/BriefHistory.pdf Army and Air Force Exchange Service Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Military Homefront, History of MWR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryhomefront.dod.mil/portal/page/mhf/MHF/MHF_DETAIL_1?section_id=20.80.500.387.0.0.0.0.0&amp;current_id=20.80.500.387.500.60.30.0.0 |title=Military Homefront, History of MWR |publisher=Militaryhomefront.dod.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profits from the Post Exchange were used to support recreational activities for the troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

In 1903, the [[United States Congress]] passed the 1903 Army Appropriations Act, which provided funds to build, operate and maintain PXs, libraries, schools, recreation centers, and gyms for the troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Military Homefront, History of MWR&quot;/&gt;

[[File:27 Jun 51 Hospital Library Ward Service.jpg|thumb|A 1951 image from Hospital Library Ward Service. U.S. Army Photo.]]

The Army Morale Division was established in 1918, followed by the Army Motion Picture Service in 1920 and the Library Service in 1923. In 1941, the Army Morale Division and these other organizations collectively became &quot;Special Services.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

By 1943, Special Services had grown to include all of Army Recreation Services, the Army Exchange (the precursor to the Army and Air Force Exchange [AAFES]), and the Army Soldier Show. Special Services soon established the first [[Armed Forces Recreation Center]] (AFRC) in Bavaria (FMWR currently manages five AFRCs) and, by 1950, Special Services was placed under the Army Adjutant Generalâ€™s Office during an Army reorganization.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

Services for families, rather than just troops, began to emerge in the mid to late 1960s. In 1965, Army Community Services was created, followed in 1968 by a Youth Activities Program and, in 1971, an Outdoor Recreation Program.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Jessica Simpson at the PGA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jessica Simpson]] sings &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; during the opening ceremony of the AT&amp;T National PGA Tour event July 1 at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda]]
Emphasis on the family continued in 1981 with the first Family Advocacy Program and the first Army Family Symposium.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

With the publication in 1983 of [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] General John A. Wickham Jrâ€™s White Paper, the Army Family, the integral support role of Soldiersâ€™ families was acknowledged. The development of Gen. Wickham's White Paper led to initiatives such as the Army Family Action Plan (AFAP), Family Readiness Groups and Army Family Team Building.&lt;ref&gt;The Army Family by General [[Eric K. Shinseki]] â€“ Foreword (June 2003)[http://www.whs.mil/library/dig/ar-m620u_20080912.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1984, the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center (CFSC) was formed under General Order Number 40, as a Field Operating Agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penfed.org/usawoa/downloads/CFSC_Fact_Sheet.pdf |title=Pentagon Federal Credit Union, CFSC Fact Sheet |publisher=Penfed.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, oversight of CSFC changed from the [[Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel]] (DCSPER), to the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) and the organization itself changed from a Field Operating Agency to a Direct Reporting Unit on 24 October 2006 when [[Installation Management Command]] (IMCOM) was activated and the Installation Management Agency (IMA) was deactivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imcom.army.mil/hq/about/history/ Installation Management Command History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911030122/http://www.imcom.army.mil/hq/about/history/ |date=11 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the activation of IMCOM, CFSC became the Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command (FMWRC) on 24 October 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;MWR History and Philosophy&quot;/&gt;  Since 1996, ArmyMWR.com has been the website serving Soldiers and their Families at Garrisons and Installations in the United States and throughout the world.

The Family and MWR Command revised and published a new brand logo in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mwrbrandcentral.com/HOMEPAGE/ourbrand.html |title=new brand logo in 2010 |publisher=Mwrbrandcentral.com |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2011, the command retired its flag in Alexandria, Va., to prepare for a move to San Antonio, Texas, in accordance with Base-Realignment and Closure law.&lt;ref&gt;United States Army, Evan Dyson [http://www.army.mil/article/58740/ &quot;Flag casing ceremony marks new era for Army MWR&quot;] 1 June 2011. Retrieved 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command was deactivated on 3 June 2011 in a ceremony at Fort Sam Houston. The deactivation ceremony formally changed FMWRC into the [[Installation Management Command]] G9 Division, commonly known as Family and MWR Programs.&lt;ref&gt;United States Army, Tim Hipps [http://www.army.mil/article/59047/ &quot;Army MWR integrated into Installation Management Command&quot;] 6 June 2011. Retrieved 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Director, G9 for MWR Programs was James C. Abney, SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armymwr.com/commander/director.aspx |title=Director, G9 |publisher=Armymwr.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SES (Senior Executive Service)&lt;ref&gt;[[Senior Executive Service (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a pay grade for civilians in the Federal Government, somewhat equivalent to the rank of General.  Prior to this appointment,&lt;ref&gt;Deputy to the Commanding General of the Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command (FMWRC)&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Abney was Deputy to the Commanding General of the Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command (FMWRC) (now deactivated), and a Highly Qualified Expert (HQE)&lt;ref&gt;http://cpol.army.mil/library/nonarmy/dod_062706.html&lt;/ref&gt; with duties as the Special Assistant to the FMWRC Commanding General.

A new campus for the [[Installation Management Command]] was dedicated at [[Fort Sam Houston]] on 19 Aug. 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United States Army, Tim Hipps [http://www.army.mil/article/63962/ &quot;Ribbon cutting opens Installation Management Command on Fort Sam&quot;] 25 August 2011. Retrieved 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides adding additional office space for MWR employees, the campus also features a new building for the Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR School of the Installation Management Academy, formerly the Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;army.mil&quot;&gt;United States Army, Tim Hipps [http://www.army.mil/article/64535/ &quot;Installation Management Academy welcomes students to Fort Sam Houston&quot;] 30 August 2011.

When complete, interior modifications will include a modified stage, additional storage space and more room for lighting and recording equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Army 2011&quot;&gt;United States Army, Evan Dyson [http://www.army.mil/article/64964/ &quot;Army Entertainment Detachment holds change of command ceremony&quot;] 6 September 2011.

The current director of Family and MWR Programs is Ms. Stephanie L. Hoehne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Command|url = http://www.armymwr.com/commander/command.aspx|website = www.armymwr.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive summary==

The Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality Program (NAFI),&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;  is operated by the Army for Department of Defense agencies and MWR programs are established, maintained, and disestablished under sole authority of Army Regulation AR215-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/35622762/Army-Regulation-215-1-Military-Morale-Welfare-and-Recreation-Programs-and-Nonappropriated-Fund-Instrumentalities |title=Army Regulation 215_1 Military Morale, Welfare and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMWRâ€™s major business partner, the [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]], provides a dividend to Army FMWR based on two distinct agreements. In the first, the Army shares 50 percent of AAFES net income after depreciation with the Air Force based on the number of active duty Soldiers and Airmen in each serviceâ€”currently the Army receives 30 percent and the Air Force 20 percent of AAFES generated dividend revenue. Through the Army Simplified Dividend, garrisons receive 100 percent of profits from &quot;Class VI&quot; or personal demand supply items (such as health and hygiene products, soaps and toothpaste, writing material, snack food, beverages, cigarettes, batteries, and alcohol), 80 percent of pay telephone revenue, and 0.4 percent of all local AAFES sales. The latter component is deducted from the Army share of total AAFES profits with the remainder going to the Army Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;armymwr.org&quot;/&gt;

Revenues received from Army Lodging room charges are used solely to sustain and recapitalize the Lodging program and its facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;armymwr.org&quot;/&gt;

Monies derived from user fees and sales, AAFES, and recreation and amusement machine operations are invested and earn interest to benefit Army FMWR operations. When combined, NAF represents 42 percent of all funding, allowing Army FMWR programs to continue to serve more than 3.9&amp;nbsp;million patrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;armymwr.org&quot;/&gt;

Most of this money goes to Army installations and is used to run FMWR operations, programs, and services. What is left is focused on Army-wide capital improvements and minor construction and capital purchases.&lt;ref name=&quot;armymwr.org&quot;/&gt;

==Army Family Covenant==

Unveiled on 8 October 2007, the Army Family Covenant institutionalized the U.S. Armyâ€™s publicly announced pledge to support its soldiers and their familiesâ€”Active, Guard and Reserveâ€”with resourced programs to deliver a quality of life &quot;commensurate with their service and sacrifice to the nation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myarmyonesource.com/CommunitiesandMarketplace/ArmyFamilyCovenant/default.aspx |title=Army Family Covenant Official Website |publisher=Myarmyonesource.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. Army officials, the Army Family Covenant commits the U.S. Army to enhance soldier and family readiness by:

*Standardizing family programs and services
*Increasing accessibility to health care
*Improving Soldier and family housing
*Ensuring excellence in Child, Youth &amp; School Services
*Expanding education and employment opportunities for family members.&lt;ref name=&quot;armymwr.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Army News Service [http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,153120,00.html &quot;Army Leaders Sign Covenant with Families&quot;] 18 Oct 2007. Retrieved 11 Aug 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since implementing the Army Family Covenant, U.S. Army senior leaders say theyâ€™ve made significant progress in fulfilling its promises.&lt;ref&gt;Stars and Stripes, Matt Millham â€“ [http://www.stripes.com/news/covenant-benefits-kick-in-for-army-programs-1.75748 &quot;Covenant benefits kick in for Army programs&quot;] 1 March 2008. Retrieved 11 Aug 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; But, they also acknowledge more work is needed to build an environment where Army families can prosper and realize their full potential within the constraints of persistent conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;armymwr.org&quot;/&gt; In 2015, the Army renamed the covenant program to &quot;Total Army Strong.&quot;

==MG Robert M. Joyce FMWR School==

The Installation Management Academy is a full-fledged brick and mortar institution of professional learning and career development, featuring the Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR School. The school includes numerous subject matter experts in various areas of U.S. Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Activities. Nearly 100 courses are offered through online or classroom formats. Recently, 39 courses have received college credit recommendations from the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) and graduates are increasingly transferring them to colleges and universities to receive college credits. Since its inception, employees have completed over 28,400 courses in various Family and MWR program areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Family and MWR Academy Website&quot;&gt;[https://www.mwraonline.com/index.asp Family and MWR Academy Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MWRAcademyDedicationCeremony.jpg|thumb|right|Maj. Gen. Reuben Jones and Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; Joyce unveil the plaque commemorating the newly named Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR Academy at a ceremony 27 May 2010.]]In May 2010 the Family and MWR Academy was renamed the MG Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR Academy in honor of the first Commander of the Community and Family Support Center. MG Joyce was instrumental in the founding of the Academy and the inspired vision of a professional and developed workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Family and MWR Academy Website&quot;/&gt; Following the transition from a headquarters in Alexandria, Va., to San Antonio, Texas, The Academy became the Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR School within the Installation Management Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;army.mil&quot;/&gt;

On 7 April 1986 the Commanding General of Community and Family Support Center (CFSC) tasked Colonel Perkins, as Chief of Field Operations, to review training within MWR and its programs throughout the Army. The focus of the review was to identify the system's currently available training, specify its shortfalls, determine the optimum training program, and project the estimated resources necessary to fund an improved program. The ultimate qualifier to apply to the review was &quot;What is best for the Army.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Family and MWR Academy â€“ About Us&quot;&gt;[https://www.mwraonline.com/aboutus.asp Family and MWR Academy â€“ About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of Colonel Perkins' task, a Master Training Concept was developed and approved, and the MWR Academy was launched. A graphical representation of the Master Training Concept was defined in terms of a pyramid. The Master Training Concept was designed to integrate all levels of training and all programs for training, and ensure availability of training to the workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Family and MWR Academy â€“ About Us&quot;/&gt;

The Master Training Concept is still applicable today. This plan, in conjunction with the Army Civilian Training, Education and Development System (ACTEDS) Plan for Career Field 51 (MWR) forms the basis of the Family and MWR Academy's curriculum. Together, these guidelines provide a structured, progressive, and sequential approach to Family and MWR employee development and training for entry-level through executive-management positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Family and MWR Academy â€“ About Us&quot;/&gt;

The Family and MWR School is also an Authorized Provider (AP) of [[Continuing Education Unit]]s (CEUs) from the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI)/ International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET). All Family and MWR-sponsored courses are reviewed for their compliance with ANSI/IACET standards and receive CEUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Family and MWR Academy â€“ About Us&quot;/&gt;

Since the Academy's inception, over 28,400 family and MWR employees have been trained in various Family and MWR program areas and at various levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Family and MWR Academy â€“ About Us&quot;/&gt;

==Funding categories==

===Category A: Mission-sustaining programs===
Considered essential to sustaining readiness, these programs generally enhance and promote the physical and mental
well being of Soldiers. Programs in this category have little or no capacity for generating Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) income and are supported almost entirely with funds appropriated by the U.S. Congress (APF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appropriations.senate.gov/ht-defense.cfm?method=hearings.download&amp;id=a2613a06-d133-4e73-9a5a-3ece411fcac9 |title=Senate Committee on Appropriates, Subcommittee on Defense, Second Session, 111th Congress, on the Posture of the United States Army |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Category B: Community support programs===
These programs are closely related, in terms of supporting the military mission, to those grouped in category A. They satisfy the basic physiological and psychological needs of Soldiers and their Families and provide, to the extent possible, the community support systems that make military garrisons temporary hometowns for a mobile military population. These support programs will receive substantial amounts of APF support, but differ from those programs in category A, in part because of their ability to generate NAF revenues. That ability to generate revenues is limited, however, and in no case may they be sustained without substantial APF support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;

===Category C: Revenue-generating programs===
These programs have less impact on readiness. They offer desirable social and recreational opportunities. Programs in this category have the capability of generating enough income to cover most of their operating expenses, but they lack the ability to sustain themselves based purely on their business activity; consequently, they receive limited APF support. Chapter 5 addresses funding for category C MWR programs located at remote and isolated sites, funding for base closures, and funding as a result of special security conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;

==Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI)==

Every NAFI is legally constituted as an &quot;instrumentality of the United States.&quot; The term &quot;NAFI&quot; includes entities at the garrison level, also referred to as garrison MWR operating entities or simply entities (previously the installation MWR fund). Funds in NAFI/entity accounts are Government funds, and NAF property, including buildings, is Government property. However, NAFs are separate from APFs of the U.S. Treasury. They are not commingled with APFs and are managed separately, even when supporting a common program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;

Each NAFI/entity operates under the authority of the U.S. Government in accordance with applicable Federal laws and departmental regulations. Because NAFIs/entities operate under the authority of the Federal Government, they are entitled to the same sovereign privileges and immunities as the Federal Government accorded by Federal law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;

Applicable DOD directives and implementing Army regulations are binding on NAFIs. NAFI/entity programs and facilities are operated, maintained, and funded as part of the U.S. Army's personnel and readiness program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Regulation 215-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appropriations.senate.gov/ht-defense.cfm?method=hearings.download&amp;id=1eebbcfa-f06a-4c10-bedd-d11132ea1136 |title=2009 Army Posture Statement |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
