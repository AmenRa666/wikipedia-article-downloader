[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KG}} (8 March 1726 &amp;ndash; 5 August 1799) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval officer. After serving throughout the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], he gained a reputation for his role in [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]] against the French coast as part of Britain's policy of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War#Naval &quot;Descents&quot;|naval descents]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. He also took part, as a naval captain, in the decisive British naval victory at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in November 1759.

In North America, Howe is best known for his service during the [[American Revolutionary War]], when he acted as a naval commander and a peace commissioner with the American rebels; he also conducted a successful relief during the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] in the later stages of the War.

Howe later commanded the victorious British fleet during the [[Glorious First of June]] in June 1794 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

== Early career ==
Howe was born in Albermarle Street, London, the second son of [[Emanuel Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe]], who died as [[List of Governors of Barbados|governor of Barbados]] in March 1735, and of [[Charlotte Howe, Viscountess Howe|Charlotte]], a daughter of [[Sophia von Kielmansegg, Countess of Darlington|Baroness von Kielmansegg]], afterwards [[Earl of Darlington|Countess of Darlington]], the half-sister of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB |last=Knight |first=Roger |date=October 2009 |origyear=2004 |id=13963 |title=Howe, Richard, Earl Howe (1726–1799)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After education at [[Eton College]], Richard Howe entered the navy in the [[fourth-rate]] [[HMS Pearl (1726)|HMS ''Pearl'']] in July 1739.&lt;ref name=heath122&gt;Heathcote 2002, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; He then transferred to the fourth-rate [[HMS Severn (1695)|HMS ''Severn'']], one of the squadron sent into the south seas with Admiral [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]] in 1740.&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt; The ''Severn'' sailed to [[Cape Horn]] and then, after encountering storms, returned home in Spring 1742.&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt; Howe next served in the [[West Indies]] aboard the [[third-rate]] [[HMS Burford (1722)|HMS ''Burford'']] and was present when she was severely damaged in the unsuccessful attack on [[Battle of La Guaira|La Guaira]] in February 1743 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt; He transferred to the third-rate [[HMS Suffolk (1680)|HMS ''Suffolk'']], flagship of Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], Commander-in-Chief in the West Indies, in March 1743 and then to the [[fifth-rate]] [[HMS Eltham (1736)|HMS ''Eltham'']] in July 1743, before being promoted to [[midshipman]] on 8 October 1743 and returning to HMS ''Suffolk'' later that month.&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 25 May 1744, he joined the [[bomb vessel]] [[HMS Comet (1742)|HMS ''Comet'']] and then transferred to the [[first-rate]] [[HMS Royal Charles (1673)|HMS ''Royal George'']], flagship of Admiral [[Edward Vernon]], in August 1745.&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt;

Promoted to [[commander]] on 5 November 1745, Howe was commanding officer of the [[sloop]] [[HMS Baltimore|HMS ''Baltimore'']] in the [[North Sea]] during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] and was severely wounded in the head while cooperating with a frigate in an engagement with two French privateers.&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt; Promoted to [[post-captain]] on 10 April 1746, he was given command of the [[sixth-rate]] [[HMS Tryton (1745)|HMS ''Triton'']] and took part in convoy duties off [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt; He transferred to the command of the fourth-rate [[HMS Rippon (1712)|HMS ''Ripon'']] in Summer 1747 and sailed to the West Indies before becoming Flag Captain to Admiral Sir Charles Knowles, Commander-in-Chief, Jamaica, in the third-rate [[HMS Cornwall (1692)|HMS ''Cornwall'']] in October 1748.&lt;ref name=heath122/&gt; He was given command of the fifth-rate [[HMS Glory (1747)|HMS ''Glory'']] off the coast of West Africa in March 1751 and then transferred to the command of the sixth-rate [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']] in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in June 1752.&lt;ref name=heath123&gt;Heathcote 2002, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seven Years' War==
[[Image:Quibcardinaux2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] by [[Nicholas Pocock]]. Howe took part in the battle as a captain. The overwhelming British victory at Quiberon Bay ended the prospect of a [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|French Invasion of Britain or Ireland]].]]
{{Main article|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}
In January 1755, Howe was given command of the fourth-rate [[HMS Dunkirk (1754)|HMS ''Dunkirk'']] and was sent to North America as part of a squadron commanded by Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]]: [[Action of 8 June 1755|his capture of the French ''Alcide'']] was the first shot fired in the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref name=heath123/&gt; He was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Dartmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartmouth]] in May 1757 and became commanding officer of the third-rate [[HMS Magnanime (1748)|HMS ''Magnanime'']] in the Channel in July 1757.&lt;ref name=heath123/&gt; From then until the peace of 1763, he served in the Channel in various more or less futile expeditions against the French coast, gaining a reputation as a firm and skillful officer for his role in the series of naval descents on the French coast including the [[Raid on Rochefort]] in September 1757.&lt;ref name=heath123/&gt; Promoted to [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]], with his [[broad pennant]] in the third-rate [[HMS Essex (1679)|HMS ''Essex'']], he took part in the [[Raid on St Malo]] in June 1758, the [[Battle of Saint Cast]] in September 1758 and the [[Raid on Cherbourg]] in August 1758.&lt;ref name=heath123/&gt; He was particularly noted for his conduct at Rochefort, where he had taken the [[Île-d'Aix]], and was described by [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|George Rodney]] as performing his duties &quot;with such cool and steady resolution, as has most justly gained him the universal applause of army and navy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger 2006, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his elder brother, killed near [[Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]] on 6 July 1758, Howe became [[Earl Howe|Viscount Howe]] in the [[Peerage of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; On 20 November 1759, he led Admiral [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Edward Hawke]]'s fleet at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] where the British won a decisive victory, forestalling a [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|Planned French invasion of Britain]].&lt;ref name=heath123/&gt; He became Flag Captain to Rear-Admiral the [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] in the third-rate [[HMS Princess Amelia (1757)|HMS ''Princess Amelia'']] in June 1762.&lt;ref name=heath123/&gt;

Howe was appointed a [[List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty]] on the Admiralty Board led by [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]] in April 1763.&lt;ref name=sainty&gt;{{cite web|title=Sainty, JC, ''Lord High Admiral and Commissioners of the Admiralty 1660-1870', Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 4: Admiralty Officials 1660-1870'' (1975), pp. 18-31.|url=http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16652| accessdate =19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Treasurer of the Navy]] in 1765 and, having been promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 18 October 1770, went on to be [[Mediterranean Fleet|Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet]] in November 1770.&lt;ref name=heath124&gt;Heathcote, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[vice admiral]] on 5 February 1776,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=11637|supp=|startpage=2|date=3 February 1776|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became [[North America and West Indies Station|Commander-in-Chief, North American Station]] later that month.&lt;ref name=heath124/&gt;

==American Revolutionary War==
At the beginning of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], Howe was known to be sympathetic to the colonists. He had known [[Benjamin Franklin]] since late 1774 and was joined in a commission with his brother, [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Sir William Howe]], head of the land forces, to attempt a reconciliation.&lt;ref name=heath124/&gt;

===Blockade===
Howe was ordered to institute a [[Blockade|naval blockade]] of the American coastline, but this proved to be ineffective. Howe claimed to have too few ships to successfully accomplish this, particularly as a number had to be detached to support operations by the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]]. As a result, large amounts of covert French supplies and [[Ammunition|munitions]] were smuggled to America. It has been suggested that Howe's limited blockade at this point was driven by his sympathy with and desire for conciliation with the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, pp. 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; By 1778 the blockade was looking more promising, with many merchant ships being taken. Howe complained to London that while his ships were able to successfully guard the southern colonies, the blockade of the northern colonies was still ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York and Philadelphia===
[[File:Die Anlandung der Englischen Trouppen zu Neu Yorck.jpeg|thumb|right|286px|The arrival of British troops in New York in 1776]]
The strategy of the British in North America was to deploy a combination of operations aimed at capturing major cities and a blockade of the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The British took [[Long Island]] in August 1776 and captured [[New York City]] in September 1776 in combined operations involving the army and the navy during the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]]. In 1777 Howe provided support to his brother's [[Philadelphia campaign|operation to capture Philadelphia]], ferrying General Howe's army to a landing point from which they successfully marched and took the city. Howe spent much of the remainder of the year concentrating on [[Siege of Fort Mifflin|capturing Forts Mifflin]] and [[Fort Mercer|Mercer]] which controlled entry to the [[Delaware River]] without which ships could not reach Philadelphia. News of the [[Battles of Saratoga|capture of a separate British army]] under General [[John Burgoyne]] threw British plans into disarray. Howe spent the winter in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, pp. 69-75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to England===
In Summer 1778 a French squadron commanded by the [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|Comte d'Estaing]] was sent to America. Howe's fleet was delayed departing New York by contrary winds, and he arrived off [[Point Judith, Rhode Island|Point Judith]] on 9 August.&lt;ref&gt;Dearden, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Since d'Estaing's fleet outnumbered Howe's, the French admiral, fearful that Howe would be further reinforced and eventually gain a numerical advantage, reboarded the French troops, and sailed out to do battle with Howe on 10 August.&lt;ref name=Daughan177&gt;Daughan, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; As the two fleets prepared to battle and maneuvered for position, the weather deteriorated, and a [[nor'easter|major storm]] broke out.  Raging for two days, the storm scattered both fleets, severely damaging the French flagship.&lt;ref name=Mahan362&gt;Mahan, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; As the two fleets sought to regroup, individual ships encountered enemy ships, and there were several minor naval skirmishes; two French ships (including d'Estaing's flagship), already suffering storm damage, were badly mauled in these encounters.&lt;ref name=Mahan362/&gt; The French fleet regrouped off Delaware, and returned to Newport on 20 August, while the British fleet regrouped at New York.&lt;ref name=Mahan363&gt;Mahan, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Howe's ships, the sixth-rate [[HMS Sphinx (1775)|HMS ''Sphynx'']], the converted [[Cargo ship|merchantman]] [[HMS Vigilant (1777)|HMS ''Vigilant'']] and the [[galley|row galley]] [[USS Spitfire (1776)|HMS ''Spitfire Galley'']], bombarded the American troops during the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] on 29 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rihs.org/assetts/files/publications/2009_WinSpring.pdf|title=The Forgotten Ships of the Battle of Rhode Island|first=D. K.|last=Abbass|date=2009|publisher=The Rhode Island Historical Society|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howe then chased the remaining ships of the French fleet to [[Boston]] in [[Massachusetts]] where they made repairs. With no prospect of the French fleet coming out of port, Howe left his station in September 1778.&lt;ref name=heath124/&gt;

Declining to serve afterwards, Howe cited distrust of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] and a lack of support during his command in America. He was further embittered by the replacement of himself and his brother as peace commissioners, as well as by attacks in the press against him by ministerial writers including the prominent [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|American Loyalist]] [[Joseph Galloway]]. An inquiry in Parliament demanded by the Howe brothers to justify their conduct in America was held during 1779 but ended inconclusively.&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, pp. 95-98&lt;/ref&gt; Howe spent much of the next three years with the opposition attacking the government's alleged mismanagement of the war at sea. The only exception was his support of a motion of thanks to Admiral George Rodney for his victory against the Spanish during the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Moonlight Battle]].&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

As Howe had joined the opposition in Parliament to North's government, it was clear that until it was replaced he would be unable to secure a fresh naval command. Despite the setback at Saratoga, and the entry of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic into the war North's government continued to gain strength until October 1781 when a British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] was forced to surrender to a combined Franco-American force at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. Although the government was able to continue for several more months its effective power had been sapped.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger 2006, pp. 343-353&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1782 the House of Commons passed a motion ending offensive actions against the American rebels, although the war around the rest of the globe continued with the same intensity. North's government then fell to be replaced by a weak coalition of Whigs led by the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

===Command of the Channel Fleet===
[[File:Thomas Gainsborough 011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mary Countess Howe by [[Thomas Gainsborough]]]]
Not until the fall of Lord North's government in March 1782 did Howe once again accept a command. Despite the suspension of hostilities in America, the war in Europe continued with the same force and the Royal Navy was severely stretched in having to deal with the French, Spanish and Dutch fleets. Howe received instructions from [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]], the new First Lord of the Admiralty to proceed to [[Portsmouth]] and take command of the [[Channel Fleet]] which he did in April 1782.&lt;ref name=heath124/&gt; Promoted to full [[admiral]] on 8 April 1782,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=12286|supp=|startpage=2|date=9 April 1782|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was created [[Earl Howe|Viscount Howe]] in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]] on 20 April 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=12290|supp=|startpage=1|date=23 April 1782|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howe's task was complex. He had to protect inbound trade convoys from the Americas, keep track of the Franco-Spanish fleet, while also keeping an eye on the Dutch fleet at port in the [[Texel]] but reportedly ready to sail. He also had to keep in mind the need to attempt a relief of [[Gibraltar]] which had been [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|under siege for several years]] and would be forced to surrender if it wasn't resupplied soon. Howe had to accomplish these tasks with significantly fewer ships than his combined opponents. Keppel observed the Royal Navy's best hope was to quickly shift their limited forces from one area of danger to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syrett 2006 p. 101&quot;&gt;Syrett 2006, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In May Howe took a number of ships to the Dutch coast to scout out Dutch preparations. If the Dutch made a [[sortie]] into the [[North Sea]] they would be able to threaten Britain's vital [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] convoys, including precious naval stores which were needed for continuing the war. This in turn might lead the Dutch to launch attacks on the East coast of England. As the Dutch fleet appeared unlikely to immediately put to sea, Howe returned to Britain leaving a squadron of nine ships to keep a watch on the Texel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syrett 2006 p. 101&quot;/&gt; The French and Spanish fleets had sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Cádiz]] and combined in the [[Western Approaches]], where they managed to capture some merchant ships. Howe put to sea to try and monitor them, and received information that a major trade convoy was incoming from the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Howe had only 25 ships-of-the-line against 36 enemy ships under [[Luis de Córdova y Córdova|Admiral Córdoba]] and was separated by them from the convoy he was ordered to protect. He sent a message for the convoy to put into safety in ports in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. Howe then took his fleet through a dangerous route, around the north side of the [[Isles of Scilly]]. This allowed him to get between the inbound convoy and the Franco-Spanish fleet as well as allowing him to gain the [[Weather gage|weather gauge]] which would be a major advantage in any battle.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger 2006, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning the Franco-Spanish fleet had disappeared. After waiting a while Howe decided to go in pursuit of them, later receiving news that the West Indian convoy had safely reached harbour in the English Channel. The Franco-Spanish fleet had been blown southwards by a strong [[gale]], and then received orders in early August to return home.&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, pp. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relief of Gibraltar===

The Franco-Spanish fleet can be seen in the background, anchored in [[Bay of Gibraltar|Algeciras Bay]].]]
{{Main article|Great Siege of Gibraltar}}
In September 1782, Howe carried out the relief of [[Gibraltar]] &amp;mdash; a difficult operation, 46 French and Spanish ships-of-the-line against only 33 of his own. The exhausted state of the fleet made it impossible for Howe to fit his ships properly or supply them with good crews, and Howe's progress to Gibraltar was hampered by the need to escort a large convoy carrying stores. Howe successfully relieved Gibraltar and then fought an indecisive action at the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]] in October 1782 after which he was able to bring his fleet safely back to Britain, bringing an effective end to the naval campaign.&lt;ref name=heath124/&gt;

==First Lord of the Admiralty==
Howe became [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in January 1783 during the [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Earl of Shelburne]]'s ministry, resigning in April 1783 when the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] came to power and being re-appointed in December 1783 under [[William Pitt the Younger|the Younger Pitt]]'s first ministry.&lt;ref name=heath124/&gt; The task was often difficult, for he had to agree to extreme budgetary constraints and disappoint the hopes of many officers who were left unemployed by the peace. Nonetheless, during his time in office a number of new ships were built as part of a naval [[arms race]] with France and Spain. During his time at the Admiralty, Howe oversaw a number of innovations to [[Naval flag signalling|signalling]].&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, pp. 113-117&lt;/ref&gt; Howe felt constantly undermined by [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Charles Middleton]], the [[Third Sea Lord|Comptroller of the Navy]]. Pitt often completely bypassed Howe on naval decisions and went directly to Middleton. By 1788 Howe grew tired of this and he resigned his post as First Lord despite efforts to persuade him to stay. To show their goodwill and approval of him, the government awarded Howe an [[Earl]]dom on 22 July 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13009|supp=|startpage=349|date=19 July 1788|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish Armament==
{{Main article|Nootka Crisis}}
In 1790 a dispute by Britain and Spain over the [[Nootka Sound]] on the Pacific coast of North America threatened to spark a war between the two states. Howe, as one of the most senior and experienced officers still serving, was offered command of the fleet in May 1790 and took up his post in Portsmouth in July 1790. Consisting of 35 [[Ship of the line|ships-of-the-line]] the Channel Fleet put to sea and cruised for around a month to the west of [[Ushant]] before returning to port. The crisis was then settled peacefully by diplomats and Howe was able to return to his retirement on land.&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; During a similar crisis with [[Russia]] in 1791 known as the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|Russian Armament]] Howe was not offered any command, probably because he was suffering from [[gout|ill health]].&lt;ref&gt;Syrett 2006, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
