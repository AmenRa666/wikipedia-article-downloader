The two {{nihongo|'''''Shōkaku''-class'''|翔鶴型|Shōkaku-gata}} [[aircraft carrier]]s were built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the late 1930s. Completed shortly before the start of the [[Pacific War]] in 1941, they have been called &quot;arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world&quot; when built.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the [[Battle of Midway]], they participated in every major naval action of the Pacific War, including the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Indian Ocean Raid]], the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]].

Their inexperienced air groups were relegated to airfield attacks during the attack on Pearl Harbor, but they later sank two of the [[List of sunken aircraft carriers#United States|four fleet carriers lost]] by the [[United States Navy]] during the war in addition to one elderly British [[light carrier]]. The [[sister ship]]s returned to Japan after the Battle of the Coral Sea, one to repair damage and the other to replace aircraft lost during the battle, so neither ship participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After the catastrophic losses of four carriers during that battle, they formed the bulk of the IJN's carrier force for the rest of the war. As such they were the primary [[counterattack]] force deployed against the American invasion of [[Guadalcanal]] in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] in August. Two months later, they attempted to support a major offensive by the Imperial Japanese Army to push the [[United States Marines]] off Guadalcanal. This resulted in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] where they crippled one American carrier and damaged another in exchange for damage to {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2}} and a light carrier. Neither attempt succeeded and the Japanese withdrew their remaining forces from Guadalcanal in early 1943 using the air group from {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} to provide cover.

For the next year, the sisters trained before moving south to defend against any American attempt to retake the [[Mariana Islands]] or the [[Philippines]]. ''Shōkaku'' was sunk by an American [[submarine]] during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June 1944 as the Americans invaded the Marianas and ''Zuikaku'' was sacrificed as a decoy four months later during the [[Battle of Cape Engano]].

==Background and description==
[[File:Fig of japanese aircraft carrier Shokaku in 1942.gif|thumb|left|Right elevation and plan view of ''Shōkaku'' in 1942]]
The two ''Shōkaku''-class carriers were ordered in 1937 as part of the [[3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme|3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Program]]. No longer restricted by the provisions of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which had expired in December 1936, and with relaxed budgetary limitations, the IJN sought qualitative superiority over their foreign counterparts. Drawing on experience with their existing carriers, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|Navy General Staff]] laid out an ambitious requirement for a ship that equaled the 96-aircraft capacity of the {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}}, the speed of {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryū||2}} and the defensive armament of ''Kaga''. The new ship was also to have superior protection and range over any of the existing carriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lengerer, p. 90&quot;&gt;Lengerer, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basic Design Section of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department|Navy Technical Department]] decided upon an enlarged and improved ''Hiryū'' design with the [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]] on the port side, [[amidships]]. After construction of the ships began, the Naval Air Technical Department (NATD) began having second thoughts about the location of the island because it thought that the portside location of the island on ''Hiryū'' and ''Akagi'' had an adverse impact on airflow over the flight deck. Another issue identified was that the amidships position shortened the available landing area, which had the potential to be problematic in the future as aircraft landing speeds increased with their growing weight. To verify these assumptions, the NATD filmed hundreds of takeoffs and landings aboard ''Akagi'' in October–November 1938 and decided to move the island over to the starboard side and further forward, about one-third of the length from the bow. ''Shōkaku'' was the furthest advanced by this point and the supporting structure for the bridge had already been built; rebuilding it would have delayed construction so it was left in place. The changes that had to be made consisted of a {{convert|1|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} widening of the flight deck opposite the island and a corresponding {{convert|50|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} narrowing on the starboard side and the addition of {{convert|100|t|LT|sp=us|0}} of [[ballast (ship)|ballast]] on the port side to re-balance the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 91, 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships had a length of {{convert|257.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|29|m|ftin|sp=us}}, a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|9.32|m|ftin|sp=us}} at [[deep load]], and a [[moulded depth]] of {{convert|23|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|32105|t|LT|sp=us}} at deep load. Based on hydrodynamic research conducted for the {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship}}s, the ''Shōkaku'' class received a [[bulbous bow]] and twin [[rudder]]s, both of which were positioned on the centerline [[abaft]] the propellers. Their crew consisted of 1,660 men: 75 [[commissioned officer]]s, 56 special duty officers, 71 [[warrant officer]]s and 1,458 [[petty officer]]s and crewmen, excluding the air group.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 93, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shōkaku''-class ships were fitted with four [[Kampon]] geared [[steam turbine]] sets, each driving one {{convert|4.2|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} propeller, using steam provided by eight Kampon Type Model B [[water-tube boiler]]s. With a working pressure of {{convert|30|kg/cm2|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, the boilers gave the turbines enough steam to generate a total of {{convert|160000|shp|kW|lk=in}} and a designed speed of {{convert|34.5|kn|lk=in}}. This was the most powerful propulsion system in IJN service, {{convert|10000|and|8000|shp|kW}} more than the ''Yamato'' class and the {{sclass-|Mogami|cruiser}}, respectively. During their [[sea trial]]s, the sister ships achieved {{convert|34.37|-|34.58|kn}} from {{convert|161290|-|168100|shp|kW}}. They carried {{convert|5000|t|LT|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]] which gave them a range of {{convert|9700|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|18|kn}}. The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ships' starboard side amidships and exhausted just below [[flight deck]] level through two [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s that curved downward. The ''Shōkaku'' class was fitted with three {{convert|600|kW|adj=on}} [[turbo generator]]s and two {{convert|350|kW|adj=on}} [[diesel generator]]s, all operating at 225 [[volt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 102–04, 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight deck and hangars===
[[File:Japanese.aircraft.carrier.zuikaku.jpg|thumb|''Zuikaku'' at anchor on the day she was completed, 25 September 1941]]
The carriers' {{convert|242.2|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} flight deck had a maximum width of 29&amp;nbsp;meters and overhung the [[superstructure]] at both ends, supported by pillars. Ten transverse [[arrestor wire]]s were installed on the flight deck that could stop a {{convert|4000|kg|lb|sp=us|adj=on}} aircraft. If the aircraft missed those, it could be stopped by one of three [[Arresting gear#Barricade|crash barricades]]. Although space and weight were allocated for two [[aircraft catapult]]s, their development was not completed before the ''Shōkaku''-class ships were sunk. The ships were designed with two superimposed [[hangar]]s; the upper hangar was about {{convert|200|m|ftin|sp=us}} long and had a width that varied between {{convert|18.5|and|24|m|ftin|sp=us}}. It had a height of {{convert|4.85|m|ftin|sp=us}} while the lower hangar was {{convert|4.7|m|ftin|sp=us}} high and only usable by fighters. The lower hangar was about {{convert|20|m|ftin|sp=us}} shorter than the upper one and its width ranged from {{convert|17.5|to|20|m|ftin|sp=us}}. Together they had a total area of {{convert|5545|sqm|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 93–95, 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Each hangar could be subdivided by five or six fire curtains and they were fitted with [[fire fighting foam]] dispensers on each side. The lower hangar was also fitted with a [[carbon dioxide]] [[Gaseous fire suppression|fire suppression system]]. Each subdivision was provided with a pair of enclosed and armored stations to control the fire curtains and fire fighting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by three [[Elevator#Aircraft elevators|elevators]] that took 15 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck. The forward elevator was larger than the others to allow aircraft that had just landed to be moved below without folding their wings and measured {{convert|13|x|16|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The other elevators were narrower, {{convert|13|x|12|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The ships mounted a [[crane (machine)|crane]] on the starboard side of the flight deck, abreast the rear elevator. When collapsed, it was flush with the flight deck.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shōkaku''-class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96, including 24 aircraft in reserve. These were envisioned as 12 [[Mitsubishi A5M]] (&quot;Claude&quot;) [[monoplane]] fighters, 24 [[Aichi D1A2]] (&quot;Susie&quot;) Type 96 [[dive bomber]]s, 24 [[Mitsubishi B5M]] (&quot;Mabel&quot;) Type 97 No. 2 [[torpedo bombers]], and 12 [[Nakajima C3N]] Type 97 [[reconnaissance aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; All of these aircraft were either superseded by larger, more modern aircraft or cancelled while the ships were being built, so the air group was revised to consist of 18 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, 27 [[Aichi D3A]] (&quot;Val&quot;) dive bombers, and 27 [[Nakajima B5N]] (&quot;Kate&quot;) torpedo bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ship carried 2 Zeros, 5 &quot;Vals&quot;, and 5 &quot;Kates&quot; as spares for a total of 84 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lengerer, p. 90&quot;/&gt;

===Armament and sensors===
[[File:Zuikaku November 1941-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|{{convert|12.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} Type 89 guns aboard ''Zuikaku'', November 1941]]
The carriers' primary [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA)]] armament consisted of eight twin-gun mounts equipped with 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|12.7-centimeter (5 in) Type 89]] [[dual-purpose gun]]s mounted on projecting [[sponson]]s, grouped into pairs fore and aft on each side of the hull.&lt;ref name=Brown19/&gt; The guns had a range of {{convert|14700|m|yd|sp=us}}, and a [[ceiling (aircraft)|ceiling]] of {{convert|9440|m|ft|sp=us}} at an elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was fourteen rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 192–93&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was equipped with four Type 94 [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control directors]] to control the 12.7&amp;nbsp;cm guns, one for each pair of guns,&lt;ref name=l7&gt;Lengerer, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; although the director on the island could control all of the Type 89 guns.&lt;ref name=Brown19&gt;Brown 1977, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Their light AA armament consisted of a dozen triple-gun mounts for [[license-built]] [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-aircraft gun|Hotchkiss]] [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25&amp;nbsp;mm (1 in) Type 96]] AA guns, six mounts on each side of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA weapon during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to &quot;handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stille 2007, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; These guns had an effective range of {{convert|1500|-|3000|m|yd|sp=us}}, and a ceiling of {{convert|5500|m|ft|sp=us}} at an elevation of +85 degrees. The effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15-round [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The Type 96 guns were controlled by six Type 95 directors, one for every pair of mounts.&lt;ref name=l7/&gt;

In June 1942, ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' had their anti-aircraft armament augmented with six more triple 25&amp;nbsp;mm mounts, two each at the bow and stern, and one each fore and aft of the island. The bow and stern groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25&amp;nbsp;mm mount was added at the bow and stern and 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. After the battle, ''Zuikaku''{{'}}s anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 26 single mounts for the 25&amp;nbsp;mm Type 96 gun, bringing the total of 25&amp;nbsp;mm barrels to 96, 60 in 20 triple mounts and 36 single mounts. These guns were supplemented by eight 28-round AA rocket launchers.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 105; Dickson, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Each {{convert|12|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} rocket weighed {{convert|22.5|kg|lb|sp=us}} and had a maximum velocity of {{convert|200|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. Their maximum range was {{convert|4800|m|yd|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bridge of IJN CV ZUIKAKU with 21-GO rader.jpg|thumb|The island with its Type 21 radar aboard ''Zuikaku'', 1942–43]]
''Shōkaku'' was the first carrier in the IJN to be fitted with [[radar]], a [[List of Japanese World War II radar#Shipborne Radar|Type 21]] [[early-warning radar]], mounted on the top of the island around September 1942. The date of ''Zuikaku''{{'}}s installation is unknown, but both ships received a second Type 21 radar in a retractable installation adjacent to the flight deck after October. Before June 1944, a Type 13 air-search radar was installed on the light tripod mast abaft the island. The ''Shōkaku''-class carriers were also fitted with a Type 91 [[hydrophone]] in the bow that was only useful when anchored or moving very slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 101, 105, Dickson, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection===
The ''Shōkaku'' class had a [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] that consisted of {{convert|46|mm|sp=us|1}} of [[Copper-alloy non-cemented armor|Copper-alloy Non-Cemented]] armor (CNC) that covered most of the length of the ship. The belt was {{convert|4.1|m|ftin|sp=us}} high, of which {{convert|2|m|ftin|sp=us}} was below the [[waterline]]. The lower [[strake]] of the armor was backed by {{convert|50|mm|sp=us|1}} of [[Ducol steel]]. The [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s were protected by {{convert|165|mm|sp=us|1}} of [[New Vickers non-cemented armor|New Vickers Non-Cemented]] (NVNC) armor, sloped at an inclination up to 25° and tapered to thicknesses of {{convert|55|-|75|mm|sp=us|1}}. The flight and both hangar [[deck (ship)|decks]] were unprotected and the ships' propulsion machinery was protected by a {{convert|65|mm|sp=us|adj=on|1}} deck of CNC armor. The NVNC armor over the magazines was {{convert|132|mm|sp=us|1}} thick and {{convert|105|mm|sp=us|1}} thick over the [[aviation gasoline]] storage tanks. All of the deck armor was overlaid on a 25-millimeter deck of Ducol steel.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shōkaku''s were the first Japanese carriers to incorporate a [[torpedo belt]] system. Based on model experiments that began in 1935, it consisted of a liquid-loaded &quot;sandwich&quot; of compartments outboard of the [[torpedo bulkhead]]. The experiments showed that a narrow liquid-loaded compartment was necessary to distribute the force of a torpedo or [[naval mine|mine]]'s detonation along the torpedo bulkhead by spreading it across the full width of the bulkhead and to stop the splinters created by the detonation. Outboard of this were two compartments intended to dissipate the force of the gases of the detonation, including the [[Ship floodability|watertight compartment]] of the [[double bottom]]. The two innermost compartments were intended to be filled with fuel oil that would be replaced by water as it was consumed. The torpedo bulkhead itself consisted of an outer Ducol plate {{convert|18|-|30|mm|sp=us}} thick that was riveted to a {{convert|12|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} plate. The IJN expected the torpedo bulkhead to be damaged in an attack and placed a thin holding [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] slightly inboard to prevent any leaks from reaching the ships' vitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lengerer, pp. 100–01, 107–08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers==
[[File:Carrier shokaku.jpg|thumb|left|Planes from ''Shōkaku'' preparing for the attack on Pearl Harbor]]
Shortly after completion in 1941, ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' were assigned to the newly formed [[Fifth Carrier Division]], which was itself assigned to the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Air Fleet]] (''Kidō Butai''), and began [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]] to prepare for the Pearl Harbor attack.&lt;ref name=d8&gt;Dickson, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their inexperience, their air groups were tasked with the less demanding airfield attack role rather than the anti-ship mission allocated to the veteran air groups of the older carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Zimm, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Each carrier's aircraft complement consisted of 18 Zero fighters, 27 D3A dive bombers, and 27 B5N torpedo bombers.&lt;ref name=d8/&gt; The two carriers contributed a total of 12 Zeros and 54 D3As to the first wave on the morning of 8 December 1941 (Japan time);&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[Japan Standard Time]] is 19 hours ahead of [[Hawaiian Standard Time]], so in Japan, the attack on Pearl Harbor happened on 8 December.&lt;/ref&gt; these latter aircraft struck [[Wheeler Army Airfield]], [[Hickam Field]], and [[Ford Island|Naval Air Station Ford Island]] while the fighters [[strafed]] [[Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay]]. Only the 54 B5Ns participated in the second wave, striking Ford Island, Hickam Field and Kaneohe Bay again. The Fifth Carrier Division's aircraft conducted the majority of the attack against the airfields, supplemented only by fighters from the other four carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Stille 2011, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of ''Shōkaku''{{'}}s dive bombers was lost during the attack;&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; in exchange 314 American aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Historian Alan Zimm said the young aviators delivered &quot;a sterling performance, greatly exceeding expectations and outshining the dive bombers from the more experienced carriers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zimm, pp. 101, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1942, together with ''Akagi'' and ''Kaga'' of the [[First Carrier Division]], the sisters supported the [[battle of Rabaul (1942)|invasion of Rabaul]] in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. Aircraft from all four carriers attacked the Australian base at Rabaul on 20 January; the First Carrier Division continued to attack the town while the Fifth Carrier Division moved westwards and attacked [[Lae]] and [[Salamaua]] in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; They covered the landings at Rabaul and [[Kavieng]] on 23 January before returning to [[Chuuk State|Truk]] before the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Marshalls–Gilberts raids]] on 1 February, the Fifth Carrier Division was retained in home waters until mid-March to defend against any American carrier raids on the [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]].&lt;ref name=d1&gt;Dickson, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Ocean raid===
{{main article|Indian Ocean raid}}
The sister ships then rejoined the ''Kido Butai'' at [[Staring Bay]] on [[Sulawesi|Celebes Island]] in preparation for the Indian Ocean raid. By this time the air groups had been reorganized to consist of 21 each of the A6Ms, D3As and B5Ns.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt; The Japanese intent was to defeat the British [[Eastern Fleet]] and destroy British airpower in the region in order to secure the flank of their [[Japanese conquest of Burma|operations in Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' contributed aircraft to the 5 April [[Easter Sunday Raid]] on [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. Although the civilian shipping had been evacuated from Colombo harbor, the Japanese sank an [[armed merchant cruiser]] and a [[destroyer]] and severely damaged some of the support facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Shores, Cull &amp; Izawa, Vol. II, pp. 395, 405&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kido Butai'' returned to Ceylon four days later and attacked Trincomalee; the sisters' aircraft sank a large [[cargo ship]] and damaged the [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{HMS|Erebus|I02|6}}. In the meantime, the Japanese spotted the [[light carrier]] {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}}, escorted by the destroyer {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|6}}, and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships. Aircraft from ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' were the first to attack the Allied ships, both of which were sunk.&lt;ref&gt;Shores, Cull &amp; Izawa, Vol. II, pp. 413, 421–23, 426–29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Coral Sea===
{{main article|Battle of the Coral Sea}}
En route to Japan, the Fifth Carrier Division was diverted to Truk to support [[Operation Mo]] (the planned capture of [[Port Moresby]] in [[New Guinea]]). While they were preparing for the mission, the Americans [[Signals intelligence in modern history|intercepted]] and [[Cryptography|decrypted]] [[Japanese naval codes|Japanese naval messages]] discussing the operation and dispatched the carriers {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} to stop the invasion. The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying [[Tulagi]], in the [[Solomon Islands]], on 3 May. American land-based aircraft had spotted the light carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōhō||2}} escorting the transports of the main invasion force on 6 May, and the American carriers moved west to place themselves in a position to attack it the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BattleCoralSea Shokaku g17031.jpg|thumb|left|''Shōkaku'' under attack on the morning of 8 May. A large fire in the bow from the first bomb hit and a column of smoke from the second one are visible.]] 
''Shōhō'' was quickly located again that morning and sunk. In turn, the Japanese spotted the [[oiler (ship)|oiler]], {{USS|Neosho|AO-23|2}}, and her escorting destroyer, which were misidentified as a carrier and a [[light cruiser]]. A single dive bomber was lost during the consequent airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged ''Neosho'' badly enough that she had to be [[scuttled]] a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American [[Combat Air Patrol]] (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, but some of the surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.&lt;ref&gt;Lundstrom 2005a, pp. 192, 206–07, 209–17&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 8 May, both sides located each other at about the same time and began launching their aircraft about 09:00. The American dive bombers disabled ''Shōkaku''{{'}}s flight deck with three hits, but the carrier was able to evade all of the torpedoes. Hidden by a rain squall, ''Zuikaku'' escaped detection and was not attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Lundstrom 2005a, pp. 230–43&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the Japanese aircraft badly damaged ''Lexington'' with two torpedo and two bomb hits and scored a single bomb hit on ''Yorktown''. The torpedo hits on ''Lexington'' cracked one of her [[avgas]] tanks, and leaking vapor caused a series of large explosions that caused her to be scuttled.&lt;ref&gt;Stille 2009, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shokaku Coral Sea battle damage 1.jpg|thumb|The bow damage suffered by ''Shōkaku'']]
The air groups of the sisters were decimated in the battle, which forced ''Zuikaku'' to return to Japan with ''Shōkaku'' for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier was able to take part in the [[Battle of Midway]] in June. En route to Japan, ''Shōkaku'' was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used to put out the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months and she was not ready for action until late August.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Eastern Solomons===
{{main article|Battle of the Eastern Solomons}}
The [[Guadalcanal Campaign|American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi]] on 7 August 1942 caught the Japanese by surprise. The next day, the light carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūjō||2}} joined the sister ships in the First Carrier Division, which departed for Truk on 16 August.&lt;ref&gt;Lundstrom 2005b, pp. 91–94&lt;/ref&gt; Having learned the lesson taught at Midway, the IJN strengthened the fighter contingent at the expense of the torpedo bombers assigned to its carriers; the ''Shōkaku''-class carriers mustered 53 Zeros, 51 D3As, 36 B5Ns and 2 [[Yokosuka D4Y]]1-C &quot;Judy&quot; reconnaissance aircraft between them. After an American carrier was spotted near the Solomon Islands on 21 August, the division was ordered to bypass Truk and continue to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ryūjō'' was detached early on 24 August to move in advance of the troop convoy bound for [[Guadalcanal]] and to attack the American air base at [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]] if no carriers were located. The two fleet carriers were to stand off, prepared to attack the Americans if found.&lt;ref&gt;Lundstrom 2005b, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ryūjō'' and her escorts were the first Japanese ships spotted and sunk by the Americans later that morning, but ''Zuikaku'' and ''Shōkaku'' were not spotted until the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before an unsuccessful attack by the pair of [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]]es conducting the search, the sisters launched half of their dive bombers to attack the American carriers {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}. Most of the American carrier aircraft were already airborne by this time, either on CAP, returning from search missions, or from sinking ''Ryūjō'', so only a small airstrike was launched in response to the spot report. About an hour after the first Japanese airstrike took off, a second airstrike that included the rest of the dive bombers was launched, but their target location was mistaken and they failed to find the Americans. The first airstrike attacked the two American carriers, scoring one hit on the battleship {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|6}} and three hits on ''Enterprise'', but they were mauled by the large number of airborne American aircraft and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Uncertain of the damage inflicted on each other, both sides disengaged later that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Lundstrom 2005b, pp. 124–25, 136–41, 152, 156–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands===
{{main article|Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands}}

The First Carrier Division, now including the light carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuihō||2}}, departed Truk on 11 October to support the Japanese Army operation to capture [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on Guadalcanal. At this time, the sisters mustered 54 A6Ms, 45 D3As, and 36 B5Ns between them. Four days later, the Japanese spotted a small American convoy that consisted of a [[tugboat|fleet tug]] towing a gasoline [[barge]] and escorted by the destroyer {{USS|Meredith|DD-434|2}}. Aircraft from ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' sank the latter, but did not attack the tug.&lt;ref&gt;Lundstrom 2005b, pp. 309–10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shokaku Santa Cruz fire.jpg|thumb|right|''Shōkaku'' crewmembers fight fires on the flight deck, 26 October 1942]]
The Japanese and American carrier forces discovered each other in the early morning of 26 October and each side launched air strikes. ''Shōkaku'' was badly damaged by six hits from {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}}'s dive bombers;&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 181–83&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zuikaku'' was not spotted or attacked as she was hidden by the overcast conditions, just like at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In exchange, the Japanese crippled ''Hornet'' with two torpedoes and three bombs. In addition, two aircraft crashed into the American carrier and inflicted serious damage. ''Enterprise'' was also damaged by two bomb hits and a near miss and a destroyer was damaged when it was struck by a B5N. Attacks later in the day further damaged ''Hornet'', which was abandoned and later sunk by Japanese destroyers {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Makigumo|1942|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Akigumo||2}}. The Japanese lost nearly half their aircraft that participated in the battle, together with their irreplaceable experienced aircrew. On 2 November, the First Carrier Division was ordered home for repairs and training.&lt;ref&gt;Lundstrom 2005b, pp. 374, 391–407, 415–16, 447–50, 454&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shōkaku''{{'}}s repairs continued until March 1943&lt;ref name=ts&gt;Tully, ''Shokaku''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Zuikaku'', together with the recently repaired ''Zuihō'', sailed for Truk on 17 January to support the impending evacuation of Japanese ground forces from Guadalcanal ([[Operation Ke]]). On 29 January, the two carriers flew off 47 Zeros to Rabaul and [[Kahili Airfield]], contributing some of their own aircraft and pilots. ''Zuihō'' was then used to cover the evacuation, while ''Zuikaku'' remained at Truk, together with the two ''Yamato''-class battleships, acting as a [[fleet in being]] threatening to sortie at any time.&lt;ref&gt;Letourneau &amp; Letourneau, pp. 20, 24, 271–72&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' were assigned to a mission to counterattack the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|American offensive]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]], but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on [[Attu Island|Attu]] on 29 May 1943. The sister ships were transferred to Truk in July. In response to the carrier raid on [[Tarawa]] on 18 September, the carriers and much of the fleet sortied for [[Eniwetok]] to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested another attack on [[Wake Island]], and on 17 October, ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack, but no attack occurred and the fleet returned to Truk.&lt;ref name=tsz&gt;Tully, ''Shokaku'' and ''Zuikaku''&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of November, the bulk of their air groups were transferred to Rabaul to bolster the defenses there, just in time to help defend the port against the [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|Allied attack]] a few days later. They accomplished little there, for the loss of over half their number, before returning to Truk on the 13th.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 214–17&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters returned to Japan in December.&lt;ref name=tsz/&gt;

In February 1944, ''Shōkaku'' and ''Zuikaku'' were transferred to [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=tsz/&gt; On 1 March the carrier divisions were reorganized with the new fleet carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taihō||2}} replacing ''Zuihō'' in the division.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt; The First Carrier Division sailed in mid-May for [[Tawi-Tawi]] in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=tsz/&gt; The new base was closer to the oil wells in [[Borneo]] on which the IJN relied and also to the [[Palau]] and western [[Caroline Islands]] where the Japanese expected the next American attack; the location lacked an airfield on which to train the inexperienced pilots and American submarine activity restricted the ships to the anchorage.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 380–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===
{{main article|Battle of the Philippine Sea}}
The [[1st Mobile Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Mobile Fleet]] was en route to [[Guimaras Island]] in the central Philippines on 13 June, where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when [[Vice Admiral]] [[Jisaburō Ozawa]] learned of the American attack on the [[Mariana Islands]] the previous day. Upon reaching Guimares, the fleet refueled and sortied into the [[Philippine Sea]] where they spotted [[Task Force 58]] on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 255–57&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the sister ships mustered 54 Zeros, 60 D4Ys and 36 [[Nakajima B6N]] &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bombers. As the carriers were launching their first airstrike the following morning, ''Taihō'' was torpedoed by an American submarine and later sank.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 389, 393, 395&lt;/ref&gt; Later that morning, ''Shōkaku'' was torpedoed by a different submarine, {{USS|Cavalla|SS-244|6}}. The three or four torpedoes started multiple fires in the hangar, which ignited fueling aircraft, in addition to causing heavy flooding. As the bow continued to sink, aircraft and munitions began to slide forward and a bomb in the hangar detonated. This ignited gas and oil fumes which caused a series of four explosions that gutted the ship. ''Shōkaku'' sank several minutes later with the loss of 1,263 of her crew. 570 men were rescued by a light cruiser and a destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, Parshall &amp; Wolff&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of ''Taihō'' and ''Shōkaku'' left ''Zuikaku'' to recover the Division's few remaining aircraft after their heavy losses (only 102 aircraft remained aboard the seven surviving carriers by the evening) and the 1st Mobile Fleet continued its withdrawal towards [[Okinawa]]. The Americans did not spot the Japanese carriers until the afternoon of the following day&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2009, pp. 262–65&lt;/ref&gt; and launched a large airstrike that only succeeded in hitting ''Zuikaku'' with a single bomb that started a fire in the hangar.&lt;ref name=tz/&gt;

===Battle of Leyte Gulf===
{{main article|Battle of Leyte Gulf}}

[[File:Japanese carrier under attack during Battle of Cape Engaño 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of ''Zuikaku'' burning, 25 October 1944]] In October 1944, ''Zuikaku'' was the flagship of Admiral [[Jisaburo Ozawa]]'s decoy Northern Force in [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Operation ''Shō-Gō 1'']], the Japanese counterattack against the [[Battle of Leyte|Allied landings on Leyte]].&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 415, 420&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the ship had 28 A6M5 Zero fighters, 16 A6M2 Zero [[fighter-bomber]]s, 7 D4Y reconnaissance aircraft and 15 B6Ns. On the morning of 24 October, she launched 10 fighters, 11 fighter-bombers, 6 torpedo bombers, and 2 reconnaissance aircraft&lt;ref name=tz/&gt; as her contribution to the airstrike intended to attract the attention of the American carriers away from the other task groups that were to destroy the landing forces. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters; the survivors landed at airfields on [[Luzon]]. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks and finally found the Northern Force late that afternoon, but Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.]], commander of [[Task Force 38]], decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He turned all of his ships north to position himself for an attack.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar &amp; Genda, pp. 427–28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lowering the flag on Zuikaku.jpg|thumb|''Zuikaku''{{'}}s crew salute as the flag is lowered before abandoning ship]]
The American carriers launched an airstrike shortly after dawn; ''Zuikaku'' was struck by three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one [[propeller shaft]], and gave her a 29.5° [[list (watercraft)|list]] to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before ''Zuikaku'' sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.&lt;ref name=tz&gt;Tully, ''Zuikaku''&lt;/ref&gt;
