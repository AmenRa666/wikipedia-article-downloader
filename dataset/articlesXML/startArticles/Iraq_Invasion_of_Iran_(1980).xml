{{Campaignbox Iran-Iraq War}}

'''Iraq Invasion of Iran''' was a full-scale invasion by [[Iraq]] against [[Iran]] which was launched on 22 September  and lasted until 7 December 1980. Finally, Iranian resistance led to stall of Iraq's invasion. However, Iraq could capture more than 15000 Km2 of Iran's territory. Iraq took a defensive position since then. This invasion led to eight years war between Iran and Iraq.

On 17 September Saddam Hussein announced that Iraq abrogates the [[1975 Algiers Agreement]] and declares it will
exercise full sovereignty over the [[Shatt al-Arab]] to restore the legal position of it to the pre-1975 status.
On 22 September, Iraqi aircraft bombarded ten airfields in Iran to destroy the Iranian air force on the ground. While this attack failed, the next day Iraqi forces crossed the border in strength and advanced into Iran in three simultaneous thrusts along a front of some 400 miles (644&amp;nbsp;km). Of Iraq's six divisions that were invading by ground, four were sent to Khuzestan, which was located near the border's southern end, to cut off the Shatt al-Arab&lt;ref group=note name=waterway&gt;Called ''Arvand Roud'' ({{lang|fa|اروندرود}}) in Iran and ''Shatt al-Arab''({{lang|ar|شط العرب}}) in Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; from the rest of Iran and to establish a territorial security zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Iran–Iraq War: 1980–1988| pages = 22| author=Karsh, Efraim |publisher=Osprey Publishing |date= 25 April 2002 |isbn =978-1841763712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasion's purpose, according to Saddam, was to blunt the edge of Khomeini's movement and to thwart his attempts to [[export of revolution|export his Islamic revolution]] to Iraq and the Persian Gulf states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruze1988&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Iran and Iraq: Perspectives in Conflict| first = Gregory S.| work = Military Reports| last = Cruze| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1988/CGS.htm| date = Spring 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam hoped that by annexing Khuzestan, he would send such a blow to Iran's prestige that it would lead to the new government's downfall, or, at the very least, end Iran's calls for his overthrow.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; He also wanted to elaborate his standing in the Arab world and among Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Iran-Iraq War: A Military and Strategic History| pages = 98| author1=Murray, Williamson | author2= Woods, Kevin M. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date= 2014 |isbn = 9781107062290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam expected the local [[Arabs of Khuzestan]] to rise against the Islamic government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranchamber.com/history/iran_iraq_war/iran_iraq_war1.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, these objectives failed to materialize, and the local Iranian Arabs fought alongside Iranian forces.

==Iraq's purpose==

Saddam's primary interest in war may have also stemmed from his desire to right the supposed &quot;wrong&quot; of the Algiers Agreement, in addition to finally achieving his desire of annexing Khuzestan and becoming the regional superpower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt; Saddam's goal was to replace [[Egypt]] as the &quot;leader of the Arab world&quot; and to achieve [[hegemony]] over the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brittanica Saddam Hussein&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Saddam Hussein|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277539/Saddam-Hussein/284496/Presidency}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw Iran's increased weakness due to revolution, sanctions, and international isolation.&lt;ref name=AggrPolitics&gt;{{cite book|title=The Iran-Iraq War: The Politics of Aggression|year=1993|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|isbn=978-0813011776|editor=Rajaee, Farhang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam had invested heavily in Iraq's military since his defeat against Iran in 1975, buying large amounts of weaponry from the Soviet Union and France. By 1980, Iraq possessed 200,000 soldiers, 2,000 tanks and 450 aircraft.&lt;ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/iran_iraq_war/iran_iraq_war1.php|title=Iran-Iraq War 1980–1988|work=History of Iran|publisher=Iran Chamber Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1|date=November 2012}} Watching the powerful Iranian army that frustrated him in 1974–1975 disintegrate, he saw an opportunity to attack, using the threat of Islamic Revolution as a pretext.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranchamber-iraniraqwar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fürtig&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Den Spieß umgedreht: iranische Gegenoffensive im Ersten Golfkrieg|trans_title=Turning of the Tables: the Iranian counter-offensive during the first Gulf War|first=Henner |last=Fürtig |language=German |work=[[Damals]] |issue=5 |year=2012 |pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shatt al arab.png|thumb|right|The [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway on the Iran–Iraq border]]
A successful invasion of Iran would enlarge Iraq's petroleum reserves and make Iraq the region's dominant power. With Iran engulfed in chaos, an opportunity for Iraq to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province materialized.&lt;ref name=brogan89 /&gt;{{rp|261|date=November 2012}} In addition, Khuzestan's large ethnic Arab population would allow Saddam to pose as a liberator for Arabs from Persian rule.&lt;ref name=brogan89 /&gt;{{rp|260|date=November 2012}} Fellow Gulf states such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]] (despite being hostile to Iraq) encouraged Iraq to attack, as they feared that an Islamic revolution would take place within their own borders. Certain Iranian [[exiles]] also helped convince Saddam that if he invaded, the fledgling Islamic republic would quickly collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt;

The invasion's purpose, according to Saddam, was to blunt the edge of Khomeini's movement and to thwart his attempts to [[export of revolution|export his Islamic revolution]] to Iraq and the Persian Gulf states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruze1988&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Iran and Iraq: Perspectives in Conflict| first = Gregory S.| work = Military Reports| last = Cruze| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1988/CGS.htm| date = Spring 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam hoped that by annexing [[Khuzestan]], he would send such a blow to Iran's prestige that it would lead to the new government's downfall, or, at the very least, end Iran's calls for his overthrow.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;

According to former Iraqi general [[Ra'ad al-Hamdani]], the Iraqis believed that in addition to the Arab revolts, the Revolutionary Guards would be drawn out of Tehran, leading to a [[counter-revolution]] in Iran that would cause Khomeini's government to collapse and thus ensure Iraqi victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woods 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Woods |first=Kevin |title=Saddam's Generals: A Perspective of the Iran-Iraq War |url=http://www.ndu.edu/inss/docuploaded/saddams-generals.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403150153/http://www.ndu.edu/inss/docuploaded/saddams-generals.pdf |archivedate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than turning against the revolutionary government as experts had predicted, Iran's people (including Iranian Arabs) rallied in support of the country and put up a stiff resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar /&gt;&lt;ref name=pike /&gt;

==Prelude==
In 1979–80, Iraq was the beneficiary of an oil boom that saw it take in US$33&amp;nbsp;billion, which allowed the government to go on a spending spree on both civilian and military projects.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; On several occasions, Saddam [[Modern usage of al-Qādisiyyah#Qādisiyyat-Ṣaddām: The Iran-Iraq War|alluded to]] the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Islamic conquest of Iran]] in promoting his position against Iran. For example, on 2 April 1980, half a year before the war's outbreak, in a visit to Baghdad's [[al-Mustansiriya University]], he drew parallels to Persia's defeat at the 7th century [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;In your name, brothers, and on behalf of the Iraqis and Arabs everywhere we tell those Persian cowards and dwarfs who try to avenge al-Qadisiyah that the spirit of al-Qadisiyah as well as the blood and honor of the people of al-Qadisiyah who carried the message on their spearheads are greater than their attempts.&lt;ref name=saddam80&gt;Speech made by Saddam Hussein. Baghdad, ''Voice of the Masses'' in Arabic, 2 April 1980. FBIS-MEA-80-066. 3 April 1980, E2-3. E3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam and Revolution: Writing and Declarations of Imam Khomeini|author=Khomeini, Ruhollah|publisher=Mizan Press|year=1981|page=122|isbn=978-0933782037|others=Algar, Hamid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macket1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Sandra|last2=Harrop|first2=W.

In 1979–1980, anti-Ba'ath riots arose in the Iraq's Shia areas by groups who were working toward an Islamic revolution in their country.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; Saddam and his deputies believed that the riots had been inspired by the Iranian Revolution and instigated by Iran's government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt; On 10 March 1980, when Iraq declared Iran's ambassador [[persona non grata|persona non-grata]], and demanded his withdrawal from Iraq by 15 March,&lt;ref name=cia80&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001251999/DOC_0001251999.pdf |title=National Intelligence Daily |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |date=10 March 1980 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105212626/http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001251999/DOC_0001251999.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran replied by downgrading its diplomatic ties to the [[charge d'affaires]] level, and demanded that Iraq withdraw their ambassador from Iran. In April 1980, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr]] and his sister Amina Haydar (better known as [[Bint al-Huda]]) were hanged as part of a crackdown to restore Saddam's control. The execution of Iraq's most senior Ayatollah caused outrage throughout the Islamic world, especially among Shias.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;

In April 1980, Shia militants assassinated 20 Ba'ath officials, and Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] was almost assassinated on 1 April;&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; Aziz survived, but 11 students were killed in the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt; Three days later, the funeral procession being held to bury the students was bombed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruze1988&quot; /&gt; [[List of Iraqi Information Ministers|Iraqi Information Minister]] Latif Nusseif al-Jasim also barely survived assassination by Shia militants.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; The Shias' repeated calls for the overthrow of the Ba'ath party and the support they allegedly received from Iran's new government led Saddam to increasingly perceive Iran as a threat that, if ignored, might one day overthrow him;&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; he thus used the attacks as pretext for attacking Iran that September,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruze1988&quot; /&gt; though skirmishes along the Iran–Iraq border had already become a daily event by May that year.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;

Iraq soon after expropriated the properties of 70,000 civilians believed to be of Iranian origin and expelled them from its territory.&lt;ref name=Viewpoints&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewpoints of the Iranian political and military elites|url=http://en.merc.ir/default.aspx?tabid=98&amp;ArticleId=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, of those expelled were in fact Arabic-speaking Iraqi Shias who had little to no family ties with Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;westcott03&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2783989.stm|work=BBC News|first=Kathryn|last=Westcott|title=Iraq's rich mosaic of people|date=27 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused tensions between the two nations to increase further.&lt;ref name=Viewpoints /&gt;

Iraq also helped to instigate riots among Iranian Arabs in Khuzestan province,&lt;ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar /&gt; supporting them in their labor disputes,&lt;ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar /&gt; and turning uprisings into [[1979 Khuzestan uprising|armed battles]] between Iran's Revolutionary Guards and militants, killing over 100 on both sides.{{clarify|date=November 2012|reason=&quot;Both&quot; is ambiguous}} At times, Iraq also supported armed rebellion by the [[Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran]] in Kurdistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noi Arab Spring&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Noi|first=Aylin|title=The Arab Spring, Its Effects on the Kurds|url=http://www.gloria-center.org/2012/07/the-arab-spring-its-effects-on-the-kurds-and-the-approaches-of-turkey-iran-syria-and-iraq-on-the-kurdish-issue/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurdistan Global Security&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurdistan, Iraq Global Security|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/kurdistan-iraq.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of such events was the [[Iranian Embassy siege]] in London, in which six armed Khuzestani Arab [[insurgents]] took the Iranian Embassy's staff as hostages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Coughlin-Telegraph newspaper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Con|title=Lets Deport the Iran Embassy Siege survivor to Iraq|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/concoughlin/5414437/Lets_deport_the_Iran_Embassy_siege_survivor_to_Iraq/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barnes&gt;{{cite book|last=Fremont-Barnes|first=Gregory|title=Who dares wins the SAS and the Iranian embassy siege, 1980|year=2009|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=9781780964683|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an armed siege that was finally ended by Britain's [[Special Air Service]].

According to former Iraqi general [[Ra'ad al-Hamdani]], the Iraqis believed that in addition to the Arab revolts, the Revolutionary Guards would be drawn out of Tehran, leading to a [[counter-revolution]] in Iran that would cause Khomeini's government to collapse and thus ensure Iraqi victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woods 2010&quot; /&gt; However, rather than turning against the revolutionary government as experts had predicted, Iran's people (including Iranian Arabs) rallied in support of the country and put up a stiff resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar /&gt;&lt;ref name=pike /&gt;

===Border conflicts leading to war===
By September, [[skirmishes]] between Iran and Iraq were increasing in number. Iraq began to grow bolder, both [[shell (projectile)|shell]]ing and launching border incursions in [[territorial dispute|disputed territories]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt; Iran responded by shelling several Iraqi border towns and posts, though this did little to alter the situation on the ground. By 10 September, Saddam declared that the Iraqi Army had &quot;liberated&quot; all disputed territories within Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt; With the conclusion of the &quot;liberating operations&quot;, on 17 September, in a statement addressed to Iraq's parliament, Saddam stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;The frequent and blatant Iranian violations of Iraqi sovereignty...have rendered the 1975 Algiers Agreement null and void... This river [Shatt al-Arab]...must have its Iraqi-Arab identity restored as it was throughout history in name and in reality with all the disposal rights emanating from full sovereignty over the river...We in no way wish to launch war against Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Saddam's claim that Iraq did not want war with Iran, the next day his forces proceeded to attack Iranian border posts in preparation for the planned invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt; Iraq's 7th Mechanised and 4th Infantry Divisions attacked the Iranian border posts leading to the cities of Fakkeh and [[Bostan, Iran|Bostan]], opening the route for future armoured thrusts into Iran. Weakened by internal chaos, Iran was unable to repel the attacks; which in turn led to Iraq becoming more confident in its military edge over Iran and prompting them to believe in a quick victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Destroyed Douglas C-47 of IIAF.jpg|thumb|left|Destroyed Iranian [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]]]]

===Air Attack===
Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran on 22 September 1980.

The attack failed to damage Iranian Air Force significantly: it damaged some of Iran's airbase infrastructure, but failed to destroy a significant number of aircraft: the Iraqi Air Force was only able to strike in depth with a few [[MiG-23BN]], [[Tu-22]], and [[Su-20]] aircraft. Three MiG-23s managed to attack Tehran, striking [[Mehrabad International Airport|its airport]], but destroyed only a few aircraft.&lt;ref name=cordesman90&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0813309552|title=The Lessons of Modern War: Volume Two&amp;nbsp;– The Iran-Iraq Conflict|first1=Anthony H.|last1=Cordesman|first2=Abraham|last2=Wagner|year=1990|page=102|publisher=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ground Invasion===
The next day, Iraq launched a ground invasion along a front measuring {{convert|644|km|mi|abbr=on}} in three simultaneous attacks.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;

Of Iraq's six divisions that were invading by ground, four were sent to Khuzestan, which was located near the border's southern end, to cut off the Shatt al-Arab&lt;ref group=note name=waterway /&gt; from the rest of Iran and to establish a territorial security zone.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;{{rp|22}} The other two divisions invaded across the northern and central part of the border to prevent an Iranian counter-attack.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;

====Northern Front====
On the northern front, the Iraqis attempted to establish a strong defensive position opposite [[Suleimaniya]] to protect the Iraqi [[Kirkuk–Ceyhan Oil Pipeline|Kirkuk oil complex]].&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;{{rp|23}}

====Central Front====
On the central front, the Iraqis occupied [[Mehran, Ilam Province|Mehran]], advanced towards the foothills of the [[Zagros Mountains]], and were able to block the traditional Tehran–Baghdad invasion route by securing territory forward of [[Qasr-e Shirin|Qasr-e Shirin, Iran]].&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;{{rp|23}}

====Southern Front====
[[File:Locator map Iran Khuzestan Province.png|thumb|Location of Khūzestān Province in Iran]]
Two of the four Iraqi divisions which invaded Khuzestan, one [[mechanised infantry|mechanised]] and one armoured, operated near the southern end and began a siege of the strategically important port cities of [[Siege of Abadan|Abadan]] and [[Battle of Khorramshahr|Khorramshahr]].&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;{{rp|22}} The other two divisions, both armoured, secured the territory bounded by the cities of Khorramshahr, [[Ahvaz]], [[Susangerd]], and [[Musian]].&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;{{rp|22}}

Iraqi hopes of an uprising by the ethnic [[Arabs of Khuzestan]] failed to materialise, as most of the ethnic Arabs remained loyal to Iran.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; The Iraqi troops advancing into Iran in 1980 were described by Patrick Brogan as &quot;badly led and lacking in offensive spirit&quot;.&lt;ref name=brogan89&gt;{{cite book|last=Brogan|first=Patrick|title=World Conflicts: A Comprehensive Guide to World Strife Since 1945|year=1989|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-7475-0260-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|261|date=November 2012}} The first known chemical weapons attack by Iraq on Iran probably took place during the fighting around Susangerd.&lt;ref name=iranchamber-chemicalwarfare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/chemical_warfare_iran_iraq_war.php|title= Chemical Warfare in the Iran-Iraq War 1980–1988|work=History of Iran|first1=Julian Perry|last1=Robinson|last2=Goldbat|first2=Jozef|publisher=Iran Chamber Society|date=May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Battle of Khorramshahr====
{{Main|Battle of Khorramshahr}}
On 22 September, a prolonged battle began in the city of Khorramshahr, eventually leaving 7,000 dead on each side.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; Reflecting the bloody nature of the struggle, Iranians came to call Khorramshahr &quot;City of Blood&quot; ({{lang|fa|خونین شهر}}, ''{{transl|fa|Khunin shahr}}'').&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;

The battle began with Iraqi air raids against key points and mechanised divisions advancing on the city in a crescent-like formation. They were slowed by Iranian air attacks and Revolutionary Guard troops with [[recoilless rifle]]s, [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s, and [[Molotov cocktail]]s.&lt;ref name=wilson07&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/PF-Iran-Iraq.pdf|title=The Evolution of Iranian Warfighting During the Iran-Iraq War: When Dismounted Light Infantry Made the Difference|author=Wilson, Ben|date=July–August 2007|publisher=U.S. Army: Foreign Military Studies Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranians flooded the marsh areas around the city, forcing the Iraqis to traverse through narrow strips of land.&lt;ref name=wilson07 /&gt; Iraqi tanks launched attacks with no infantry support, and many tanks were lost to Iranian anti-tank teams.&lt;ref name=wilson07 /&gt; However, by 30 September, the Iraqis had managed to clear the Iranians from the outskirts of the city. The next day, the Iraqis launched infantry and armoured attacks into the city. After heavy [[house-to-house fighting]], the Iraqis were repelled. On 14 October, the Iraqis launched a second offensive. The Iranians launched a controlled withdrawal from the city, street by street.&lt;ref name=wilson07 /&gt; By 24 October, most of the city was captured, and the Iranians evacuated across the [[Karun River]]. Some [[partisan (military)|partisans]] remained, and fighting continued until 10 November.

Though the Iraqi air invasion surprised the Iranians, the Iranian air force retaliated with an attack against Iraqi military bases and infrastructure in [[Operation Kaman 99|Operation ''Kaman'' 99]] ([[Bow (weapon)|Bow]] 99). Groups of [[F-4 Phantom]] and [[F-5 Tiger]] fighter jets attacked targets throughout Iraq, such as oil facilities, dams, petrochemical plants, and oil refineries, and included [[Mosul Air Base|Mosul Airbase]], Baghdad, and the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq was taken by surprise at the strength of the retaliation, as Iran took few losses while the Iraqis took heavy defeats and economic disruption.

The Iranian force of [[AH-1 Cobra]] helicopter gunships began attacks on the advancing Iraqi divisions, along with F-4 Phantoms armed with [[Maverick missile]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh 03&quot; /&gt; they destroyed numerous armoured vehicles and impeded the Iraqi advance, though not completely halting it.&lt;ref name=cooper03_206&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_206.shtml|last1=Cooper|first1=Thomas|last2=Bishop|first2=Farzad|title=Persian Gulf War: Iraqi Invasion of Iran, September 1980|date=9 September 2003|work=Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf Database|publisher=Air Combat Information Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern Warfare&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Modern Warfare: Iran-Iraq War|medium=film documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran had discovered that a group of two or three low-flying F-4 Phantoms could hit targets almost anywhere in Iraq.&lt;ref name=iranchamber-iraniraqwar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/iran_iraq_war/iran_iraq_war1.php|title=Iran-Iraq War 1980–1988|work=History of Iran|publisher=Iran Chamber Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1|date=November 2012}} Meanwhile, Iraqi air attacks on Iran were repulsed by Iran's [[F-14 Tomcat]] interceptor fighter jets, using [[Phoenix missile]]s, which downed a dozen of Iraq's Soviet-built fighters in the first two days of battle.&lt;ref name=cooper03_206/&gt; {{Dubious|date=July 2013}}

The Iranian regular military, police forces, volunteer Basij, and Revolutionary Guards all conducted their operations separately; thus, the Iraqi invading forces did not face coordinated resistance.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; However, on 24 September, the [[Iranian Navy]] attacked [[Basra|Basra, Iraq]], destroying two oil terminals near the Iraqi port Faw, which reduced Iraq's ability to export oil.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; The Iranian ground forces (primarily consisting of the Revolutionary Guard) retreated to the cities, where they set up defences against the invaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Ben|title=The Evolution of Iranian Warfighting during the Iran-Iraq War|url=http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/PF-Iran-Iraq.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September, Iran's air force launched [[Operation Scorch Sword]], striking and badly damaging the [[Osirak Nuclear Reactor|Osirak nuclear reactor]] near Baghdad.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;

By 1 October, Baghdad had been subjected to eight air attacks.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;{{rp|29}} In response, Iraq launched aerial strikes against Iranian targets.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt;&lt;ref name=cooper03_206/&gt;

==Iraqi advance stalls==
{{Main|Siege of Abadan|Operation Morvarid}}
The people of Iran, rather than turning against their still-weak Islamic Republic, rallied around their country. An estimated 200,000 fresh troops had arrived at the front by November, many of them ideologically committed volunteers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pike&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm |title =Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988)|editor=Pike, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Khorramshahr was finally captured, the battle had delayed the Iraqis enough to allow the large-scale deployment of the Iranian military.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; In November, Saddam ordered his forces to advance towards [[Dezful]] and Ahvaz, and lay sieges to both cities. However, the Iraqi offensive had been badly damaged by Iranian militias and air power. Iran's air force had destroyed Iraq's army [[supply depot]]s and fuel supplies, and was strangling the country through an aerial siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper03_206&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, Iran's supplies had not been exhausted, despite sanctions, and the military often [[cannibalization (parts)|cannibalised]] spare parts from other equipment and began searching for parts on the black market. On 28 November, Iran launched [[Operation Morvarid|Operation ''Morvarid'']] (Pearl), a combined air and sea attack which destroyed 80% of Iraq's navy and all of its [[radar]] sites in the southern portion of the country. When Iraq laid [[Siege of Abadan|siege to Abadan]] and dug its troops in around the city, it was unable to blockade the port, which allowed Iran to resupply Abadan by sea.&lt;ref name=Abdoleinen-Ghazaleh&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/ghazalah%E2%80%99s-phased-analysis-of-combat-operations-part-two-of-three|title=Egyptian Field Marshal Abdul-Halim Abu Ghazalah on the Combat Tactics and Strategy of the Iran-Iraq War|series=Ghazalah's Phased Analysis of Combat Operations|first1=Youssef|last1=Aboul-Enein|first2=Andrew|last2=Bertrand|first3=Dorothy|last3=Corley|date=12 April 2012|journal=Small Wars Journal|publisher=Small Wars Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq's strategic reserves had been depleted, and by now it lacked the power to go on any major offensives until nearly the end of the war.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; On 7 December, Hussein announced that Iraq was going on the defensive.&lt;ref name=efraimkarsh/&gt; By the end of 1980, Iraq had destroyed about 500 Western-built Iranian tanks and captured 100 others.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, A.
