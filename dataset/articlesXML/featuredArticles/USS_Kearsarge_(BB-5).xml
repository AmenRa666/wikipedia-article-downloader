'''USS ''Kearsarge'' (BB-5)''', the [[lead ship]] of [[Kearsarge-class battleship|her class]] of [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, was a [[United States Navy]] ship, named after the [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Kearsarge|1861|2}}. Her keel was laid down by the [[Newport News Shipbuilding|Newport News Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Virginia]], on 30 June 1896. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 March 1898, sponsored by the wife of Rear Admiral [[Herbert Winslow]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 20 February 1900.

Between 1903 and 1907 ''Kearsarge'' served in the [[North Atlantic Fleet]], and from 1907 to 1909 she sailed as part of the [[Great White Fleet]]. In 1909 she was decommissioned for modernization, which was finished in 1911. In 1915 she served in the Atlantic, and between 1916 and 1919 she served as a training ship. She was converted into a [[crane ship]] in 1920, renamed ''Crane Ship No. 1'' in 1941, and sold for [[scrap]] in 1955.

== Design ==
{{main article|Kearsarge-class battleship}}

The ''Kearsarge''-class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=12}} They had a displacement of {{convert|11540|ST}}, an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|375|ft|4|in}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|72|ft|3|in}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|23|ft|6|in}}.{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}} The two 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] and five [[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch boilers]], connected to two propeller shafts, produced a total of {{convert|11674|ihp|lk=in}}, and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|16.816|kn|mph km/h}}.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=94}} ''Kearsarge'' was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men, a total of 554 crew.{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=21}}

[[File:Kearsarge - det1994013792 (crop).jpg|left|thumb|alt=A smaller turret on top of a bigger turret.|''Kearsarge'''s double turret on 8 April 1900]]
''Kearsarge'' had two double [[Gun turret|turrets]], with two [[13&quot;/35 caliber gun|{{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/35 caliber guns]] and two [[8&quot;/40 caliber gun|{{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/40 caliber guns]] each, stacked in two levels.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=30–32}} The guns and turret armor were designed by the [[Bureau of Ordnance]], while the turret itself was designed by the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. This caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret, making the ports very large. Admiral [[William Sims]] claimed that as a result, a shell fired into the port could reach the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] below, disabling the guns.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=17}} In addition to these guns, ''Kearsarge'' carried fourteen [[5&quot;/40 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}/40 caliber guns]], twenty [[6-pounder gun|6-pounder]] ({{convert|57|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) guns, eight [[QF 1 pounder pom-pom|1-pounder]] ({{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) guns, four {{convert|.30|in|mm|abbr=on}} machine guns, and four {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s.{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}} ''Kearsarge'' had a very low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], which resulted in her guns becoming unusable in bad weather.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=92}}

The ship's [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] was {{convert|5|-|16.5|in}} thick and the main gun turrets were protected by {{convert|15|-|17|in}} of armor, while the secondary turrets had {{convert|6|-|11|in}} of armor. The [[barbette]]s were {{convert|12.5|-|15|in}} thick, while the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|10|in}} of armor.{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}} The armor was made of [[Harvey armor|harveyized steel]].{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=94}}

''Kearsarge'' carried 16 smaller boats. A {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} steam [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], with a capacity of 60 men, together with a {{convert|33|ft|adj=on}} steam cutter, were used for general carrying from and to port, and could tow the  other boats if needed. Two 33-foot [[Launch (boat)|launches]], each capable of carrying 64 men, were the &quot;working boats&quot;. There were ten {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} boats: four cutters, each with a capacity of 45 men, the Admiral's [[barge]], two [[whaleboat]]s (which served as [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]]), and the [[Captain's gig]]. Four smaller boats completed ''Kearsarge''{{'}}s small fleet: two {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} [[Dinghy|dinghies]] and two {{convert|18|ft|adj=on}} [[catamaran]]s.{{sfn|''New-York Tribune'' 6 May 1900}}

''Kearsarge'' was authorized on 2 March 1895,{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=83}} the contract for her construction was awarded on 2 January 1896,{{sfn|NVR Crane Ship No. 1 (AB 1)}} and the keel of the vessel was laid down on 30 June 1896 by [[Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company]] in [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Chesneau|Koleśnik|Campbell|1979|p=141}}{{sfn|''Houston Daily Post'' 25 March 1898}} The total cost was US$5,043,591.68.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=94}} She was named soon after the [[American Civil War]] sloop-of-war {{USS|Kearsarge|1861|2}} sank, and was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named, by act of [[United States Congress|Congress]], in its honor. She was the only US battleship not named after a state.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=30}} She was christened on 24 March 1898 (the same day as her sister ship, [[USS Kentucky (BB-6)|''Kentucky'']]) by the wife of Captain [[Herbert Winslow]],{{sfn|''Houston Daily Post'' 25 March 1898}} daughter-in-law of Captain [[John Ancrum Winslow]], the commander of the original ''Kearsarge''.{{sfn|''New York Times'' 26 September 1914}} She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 20 February 1900, under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[William M. Folger]].{{sfn|''Times'' 20 February 1900}}

On 31 March 1905, {{USS|Maine|BB-10|2}} replaced ''Kearsarge'' as flagship of the North Atlantic Fleet,{{sfn|''Evening Star'' 24 March 1905}} although she remained with the fleet.{{sfn|DANFS Kearsarge (BB-5)}} Captain Herbert Winslow took command of the ship during December.{{sfn|''Evening Star'' 13 December 1905}} On 13 April 1906, while participating in an exercise off [[Cape Cruz]], Cuba, the [[gunpowder]] in a 13-inch gun ignited accidentally, killing two officers and eight men.{{sfn|''Pensacola Journal'' 21 April 1905}}{{sfn|''New-York Tribune'' 24 April 1905}}

=== Great White Fleet ===
[[File:USS Kearsarge in great white fleet 1908.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Kearsarge|''Kearsarge'' during the cruise of the [[Great White Fleet]]]]

Attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron,{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=46}} and under command of Captain Hamilton Hutchins,{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=177}} she sailed on 16 December 1907 with the [[Great White Fleet]].{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=181}} The fleet left from [[Hampton Roads]],{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=181}} passed by [[Trinidad]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]],{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=54}} and then passed through the [[Straits of Magellan]].{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=66}} From there she passed by the west coast of South America, visiting [[Punta Arenas]]{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=64}} and [[Valparaíso]], Chile,{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=67}} [[Callao]], Peru,{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=69}} and [[Magdalena Bay, Mexico]].{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=73}} The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=184}} and moved on to San Francisco on 6 May.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=185}} Two months later the warships sailed for [[Honolulu, Hawaii]],{{sfn|Albertson|2007|pp=90–95}} and from there to [[Auckland]], New Zealand, arriving 9 August.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=95}} The fleet made [[Sydney, Australia]], on 20 August, and after a week sailed for Melbourne.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=188}}

She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 February, and was inspected by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Albertson|2007|pp=191–192}}

=== World War I ===
[[File:USS Kearsarge after WWI refit 1916.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Kearsarge|''Kearsarge'' off Boston in October 1916, following her modernization]]

As with most of the Great White Fleet ships, ''Kearsarge'' was modernized on her return.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=82}} She was decommissioned at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] on 4 September 1909,{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=21}} and the modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of US$675,000.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=82–83}} The ship received [[Lattice mast|cage masts]], new [[water-tube boiler]]s, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=92}} She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915,{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=21}} and operated along the Atlantic coast. On 17 September she left Philadelphia to land a detachment of [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]], remaining there from 28 September 1915 to 5 January 1916.{{sfn|DANFS Kearsarge (BB-5)}} She then carried the Marines to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]],{{sfn|DANFS Kearsarge (BB-5)}} before joining the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] at Philadelphia on 4 February.{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=21}} Until the United States joined [[World War I]], she trained [[naval militia]] from Massachusetts and Maine. During the war she was used to train Armed Guard crews and [[naval engineer]]s during cruises along the Atlantic seaboard.{{sfn|DANFS Kearsarge (BB-5)}} On 18 August 1918 ''Kearsarge'' rescued 26 survivors of the Norwegian [[barque]] ''Nordhav'' which had been sunk by {{SMU|U-117||2}}, bringing them to Boston.{{sfn|Daniels|1920|p=95}}

=== Inter-war period ===
[[File:USS Kearsarge as crane ship AB-1.jpg|thumb|alt=Kearsarge with a large crane on her deck|''Kearsarge'' as ''Crane Ship No. 1'']]

Between 29 May and 29 August 1919, ''Kearsarge'' trained [[United States Naval Academy]] [[Midshipman|midshipmen]] in the [[Caribbean]]. ''Kearsarge'' sailed from [[Annapolis, Maryland]] to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she decommissioned on either 10 May{{sfn|DANFS Kearsarge (BB-5)}}{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=419}}{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=179}} or 18 May 1920.{{sfn|NVR Crane Ship No. 1 (AB 1)}}{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=83}}

''Kearsarge'' was converted into a [[crane vessel|crane ship]], and was given [[hull classification symbol]] '''IX-16''' on 17 July 1920,{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=103}} but it was changed to '''AB-1''' on 5 August.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=419}}{{efn|name=classification}} Her turrets, superstructure, and armor were removed, and were replaced by a large revolving crane with a lifting capacity of 250&amp;nbsp;tons (230&amp;nbsp;tonnes), as well as {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}} blisters, which improved her stability.{{sfn|Graff|2010|p=54}} The crane ship was utilized often over the next 20 years, including the raising of {{USS|Squalus|SS-192|6}} in 1939.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=179}}

=== World War II ===
On 6 November 1941, ''Kearsarge'' was renamed ''Crane Ship No. 1'', allowing her name to be given to {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|3}}, and later to {{USS|Kearsarge|CV-33|3}}.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=179}} She continued her service, however, handling guns, turrets, armor, and other heavy lifts for vessels such as {{USS|Indiana|BB-58|2}},{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1995|p=72}} {{USS|Alabama|BB-60|2}}, {{USS|Savannah|CL-42|2}}, {{USS|Chicago|CA-29|2}}, and {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}.{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=21}}

She was transferred to the [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard]] in 1945, where she participated in the construction of ''Hornet'' and {{USS|Boxer|CV-21|2}} and the re-construction of {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}.{{sfn|DANFS Kearsarge (BB-5)}} One of her last projects was performing heavy lifts during the reassembly of another crane vessel, [[Herman the German (crane vessel)|YD-171]] (ex-''Schwimmkran nr. 1'') on [[Terminal Island]].{{sfn|''Popular Mechanics'' September 1948}} In 1948 she left the West Coast for the [[Boston Naval Shipyard]].{{sfn|Morris|Kearns|2011|p=206}} On 22 June 1955 her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]], and she was sold for scrap on 9 August.{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=177}}

The [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]] mentions that ''Kearsarge'' was reclassified as AB-1 on 5 August 1920, and that it was renamed to ''Crane Ship No.&amp;nbsp;1'' on 6 November 1941.{{sfn|DANFS Kearsarge (BB-5)}} This is repeated by a number of other sources.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=419}}{{sfn|Newhart|1995|p=21}}{{sfn|Albertson|2007|p=179}} However, the symbol AB was not used in 1920: Roberts claims the symbol was created in 1931,{{sfn|Roberts|2010}} while Reilly and Scheina claim it was established even later, in 1939.{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=93}} According to Reilly and Scheina, on 5 August 1920 ''Kearsarge'' (BB-5) became ''Kearsarge'' (Crane Ship No. 1), with the &quot;Crane Ship&quot; serving instead of a different designation, and on 15 April 1939,{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=83}} when the AB designation was adopted, she became ''Kearsarge'' (AB-1). In 1941, when the name ''Kearsarge'' was wanted for other ships, she was renamed, and she became ''Crane Ship No.&amp;nbsp;1'' (AB-1).{{sfn|Reilly|Scheina|1980|p=93}}

The IX-16 classification is also uncertain. Bauer and Roberts report that ''Kearsarge'' was reclassified as IX-16 on 17 July 1920, before being classified AB-1 on 15 April 1939,{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=103}} although Roberts also claims that the designation IX-16 may have been used for {{USS|Tallahassee|BM-9}} between 1921 and 1922, and that this was before it was used for ''Kearsarge''.{{sfn|Roberts|2010}} However, a number of other sources also mention ''Kearsarge'' being designated IX-16.{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1978|p=1581}}{{sfn|Polmar|2005|p=242}}
