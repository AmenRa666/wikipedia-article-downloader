[[:Air Transport Command]] → {{no redirect|Air Transport Command (disambiguation)}}; [[:Air Transport Command (World War II)]] → {{no redirect|Air Transport Command}} – [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]]. If we look at the other articles currently linked from [[Air Transport Command]] as a dab page, one is [[I Troop Carrier Command|a unit]] that only briefly used the name, (and - as it is also a WW2 unit - is technically ambiguous to the title this page is currently at), while the other is [[Canadian Forces Air Transport Command]] which is a longer full official/common title. [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 03:07, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
: I have no objections.  Whatever works is fine. [[User:Bwmoll3|Bwmoll3]] ([[User talk:Bwmoll3|talk]]) 09:39, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
: '''Agree''' A hatnote on this article pointing to [[I Troop Carrier Command]] should be all that's needed to discriminate the articles.   --[[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 21:58, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' –  no good primarytopic case has been presented.  [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 00:39, 12 April 2014 (UTC)
**In what way has it not been presented? What other topics have a claim? A gBooks check for &quot;Air Transport Command&quot; shows only three results in the first '''9 pages''' of results that are ''not'' referring to this - and of those one a misnaming of the RAF Transport Command and the other is a translation of ''Groupement des Moyens Militaire de Transports Aeriens''. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 02:47, 12 April 2014 (UTC)

Why was this page moved to '''Air Transport Command (USAF)'''????   The command was a part of the United States Air Force for only a brief time.    It was a World War II command of the United States Army Air Forces for nearly five years.   This was NOT what I concurred with during the move request.   [[User:Bwmoll3|Bwmoll3]] ([[User talk:Bwmoll3|talk]]) 18:07, 13 April 2014 (UTC)

: I do not see where the discussion to move this article was concluded.   The USAF disambiguation was not part of the discussion; in fact the discussion was to remove the disambiguation alltogether [[User:Bwmoll3|Bwmoll3]] ([[User talk:Bwmoll3|talk]]) 18:22, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
::didn't see the  discussion! Point taken about USAAF. Change it to Air Transport Command (US) or (USAAF)![[User:Petebutt|Petebutt]] ([[User talk:Petebutt|talk]]) 18:31, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
::: '''Oppose''' this suggestion.  '''Support''' original suggestion.  Parenthetical is not required for disambiguation. --[[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 20:24, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I've moved the page back to [[Air Transport Command (World War II)]], the title it was at when this discussion began. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 19:49, 13 April 2014 (UTC)
:[[Air Transport Command (WWII)]],  [[Air Transport Command (USA)]], [[Air Transport Command (U.S.)]], [[Air Transport Command (USAAF)]], [[Air Transport Command (USAAC)]] should probably redirect here, whatever title it uses. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.77.36|65.94.77.36]] ([[User talk:65.94.77.36|talk]]) 22:00, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
::No need to create multiple redirects as it appears this is the primary topic. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 22:21, 14 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' It is not clear that a casual mention of an &quot;air transport command&quot; would be &quot;highly likely&quot; and &quot;much more likely&quot; per [[wp:primarytopic]] to refer to the American than to the British or Canadian ones. Also, I'd consider &quot;(US)&quot; or &quot;(USAAF)&quot; a better disambiguator per [[WP:MILMOS#UNITS]]. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Victor_falk|''walk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user:victor falk|''victor falk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[user_talk:victor falk|''talk'']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 07:17, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
**Please see the comment regarding the gBooks search above that establishes a clear [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]]. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 07:58, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
::The RAF unit never had the word &quot;Air&quot; in it. I found the relatively new [[European Air Transport Command]] organization so have added it to disambig. But don't think that dilutes Primary Topic argument (significantly). [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 11:28, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
::: [[European Air Transport Command]] needs disambiguation all by itself.  [[United States Air Forces Europe]] had a subordinate EATS from 1945 to 1948 which at the time may have moved more cargo and people than any civil airline on the continent in its first years. And [[Air Transport Command (USAAC)]] -- where does that come from?
::: It seems to me that the only competition for [[Air Transport Command]] (as opposed to [[Air transport command]] is the Canadian command, which had the name (in caps) for a number of years, and that has been taken care of by [[WP:NCDAB]] 1. Natural Disambiguation.  --[[User:Lineagegeek|Lineagegeek]] ([[User talk:Lineagegeek|talk]]) 21:39, 16 April 2014 (UTC)
::::: It is not NATURALDIS, the CF ATC is at ATC (CF), if you click on the disambiguation page link you'll end up with parenthetical disambiguation. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.77.36|65.94.77.36]] ([[User talk:65.94.77.36|talk]]) 05:47, 17 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::::[[Air Transport Command (Canadian Armed Forces)]] only got moved to that title on the 13th. It ''was'' naturally disambiguated when this discussion started. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] ([[User talk:GraemeLeggett|talk]]) 10:27, 17 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::::And I've just moved it back as controversial. The user who moved it has a history of making...''unconventional''...page moves but never ''quite'' to the point of anything being done about it. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 21:32, 17 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' move to Air Transport Command as primary topic. [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] ([[User talk:MilborneOne|talk]]) 19:30, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' as proposed. It's clearly the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary topic]]. [[User:Armbrust|Armbrust]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Armbrust|&lt;font color=&quot;#E3A857&quot;&gt;The&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;Homunculus&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:21, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
