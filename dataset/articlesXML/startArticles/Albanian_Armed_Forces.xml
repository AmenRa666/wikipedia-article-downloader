The '''Albanian Armed Forces''' (AAF) ({{lang-sq|Forcat e Armatosura të Republikës së Shqipërisë}} (FARSH)) were formed after the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence in 1912]]. Today it consists of: the [[Albanian General Staff|General Staff]], the [[Albanian Land Force]], the [[Albanian Air Force]] and the [[Albanian Naval Force]]. The [[President of Albania]] is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the country's armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite constitution |article=168 |section=2 |country=Albania |language=|ratified=28 November 1998 |url=http://www.osce.org/albania/41888 |accessdate=6 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of peace, the President's powers as Commander-in-Chief are executed through the [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Albania)|Defence Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite constitution |article=169 |section=1 |country=Albania |language=|ratified=28 November 1998 |url=http://www.osce.org/albania/41888 |accessdate=6 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missions and duties==
According to the Albanian Constitution, the Albanian Armed Forces are charged to:
*Protect the territorial integrity of the country.
*Always be present in areas incurring menace.
*Assist the population in case of natural and industrial disasters and warn the dangers of military and non military nature.
*Protect the constitutional order as it is determined by law.
*Participate in international operations in composition of multinational forces.

==History==
On 4 December 1912 Albanian Prime Minister [[Ismail Qemali]] and [[Provisional Government of Albania|his government]] formed the Albanian National Army. Its first Chief in Command was [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Ali Shefqet Shkupi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;aaf&quot;&gt;[http://www.aaf.mil.al/english/index.php/shtabipergjithshem/1061-shefat-ne-vite Albanian Army]&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1923, the Albanian Armed Forces's numbered 10,691, including military police forces.  At that time, Albania did not yet have a navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zimand |first1=Savel |title=Armies of the Nations Still Huge and Costly |newspaper=New York Times |date=19 April 1925 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E0DD1431EE3ABC4152DFB266838E639EDE&amp;legacy=true |accessdate= 16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal Albanian army ===
[[File:Italian soldiers passing Albanians, 7 April 1939.png|thumb|left|Albanian soldiers in April 1939 during the [[Italian invasion of Albania]]]]The [[Royal Albanian Army]] ({{sq|Ushtria Mbretërore Shqiptare}}) was the army of King [[Zogu]] from 1928 until 1939. Its commander-in-chief was King Zog; its commander General [[Xhemal Aranitasi]]; its Chief of Staff was General [[Gustav von Myrdacz]]. The army was mainly financed by Italy.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=FEkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=King+Zog&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=qjHuTavcEsftOaC8rZII&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=King%20Zog&amp;f=false (Life, 17 April 1939)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 1939, [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian troops invaded the country]], and captured it in six days after fierce resistance by the overwhelmed Albanian army.

===Cold War===
After the Second World War, Albania became a Soviet-aligned country. The ranks and the structure of the Albanian Armed Forces were organized based on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] concepts, thus increasing the political control of the State-Party over the Armed Forces. One of the defining characteristics of civilian-military relations during this period was the effort of the civilian leadership to ensure the loyalty of the military to the communist system's values and institutions.

Like all other branches of the state, the military was subjugated to [[Party of Labour of Albania|Communist Party]] control. All high-ranking military officers and most of the lower and middle ranks were members of the Communist Party—and had loyalties to it. The system was re-enforced by the establishment of Party cells within the military and extensive communist political education alongside soldiers’ military training, by the [[political commissar]]s. To further increase its political control, the Albanian Communist Party enlarged the conscription system, thus enlisting in the Armed Forces personnel dedicated to the military career from the Albanian rural areas.

The State and Party went even further, starting from 1 May 1966, [[military rank]]s were abolished following the example of the [[China|Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]], heavily influenced by [[Maoism]] during the years of the [[Cultural Revolution]], and thus adopting strategic concepts related to forms of [[guerrilla war]] ([[Vietnam War]] doctrine). The military were still organized during this period into their basic structure forms, but the role of the military commander was insignificant with respect to the commanding role of the political [[commissar]]s. In 1991 the rank system was reestablished under [[President of Albania|President]] [[Ramiz Alia]].&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Vickers. ''The Albanians: A Modern History''. New York: I.B. Tauris, 2000. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

During all these years, [[Sigurimi]] which was the Albanian secret service during that period and was formed upon the [[KGB]] structure, was responsible for the execution, the imprisonment and deportation of more than 600 Officers from the Armed Forces, by completely neutralizing the Armed Forces ability to start a coup d'état. Initially the communist purge concentrated on the military personnel graduated by the Western Military Academies (mainly from Italy 1927–1939), extended later on to the officers graduated in Soviet Union (after the Albanian abandon of the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1968). As the [[communist regime]] collapsed in Albania during 1990, there was a real fear that the armed forces might intervene to halt the collapse of communism by force. In the event, the armed forces stood by as the regime of which they had been a part disintegrated.

During the 1980s, Albania had reduced the number of infantry brigades from eight to four. It had shifted to fully manned units from its prior reliance on the mobilisation of reserve soldiers to flesh out a larger number of units manned at a lower level. Each brigade had three infantry battalions and one lightly equipped artillery battalion. Armoured forces consisted of one tank brigade. Artillery forces were increased from one to three regiments during the 1980s, and six battalions of coastal artillery were maintained at strategic points along the Adriatic Sea littoral.

===Post 1991 history===
[[File:Albanian army deploys T-59 tanks near Kosovo border, May 1999 (Robert Wright).jpg|thumb|An Albanian [[Type 59 tank|T-59]] tank during the [[13 April 1999 Albania–Yugoslav border incident|Albania-Yugoslav border incident in May 1999]].]]In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] estimated that the ground forces had about 35,000 men, or about three-quarters of all armed forces personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies Albania&lt;/ref&gt; Because the strength of the ground forces was sufficient to man only about two divisions, brigades of approximately 3,000 soldiers became the largest army formation. In 1991 four infantry brigades constituted the bulk of combat units in the ground forces.

During the civilian riots in 1997, the political attempts by the government to use the Armed Forces to crush the rebellion were soon demonstrated to be a failure, following a total disintegration of the Armed Forces and the looting of the military facilities by the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.al/index.php?page=projects/project&amp;id=111&amp;lng=en|title=UNDP Albania|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania sheltered many thousands of Kosovar refugees during the 1999 conflict, and allowed NATO to provide logistical assistance for [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) troops through Communications Zone West headquartered in Durrës.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nato.int/kfor/chronicle/2001/nr_010626.htm. Operational until 2006, see [[NATO Headquarter Tirana]]&lt;/ref&gt; Albania was part of the International Stabilization Force ([[SFOR]]) serving in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] (then EU mission ''ALTHEA''), and Albanian peacekeepers are part of the International Security Assistance Force in [[Afghanistan]], [[ISAF]] and the international stabilization force in [[Iraq]]. Albania has been a steadfast supporter of U.S. policy in Iraq, and one of only four nations to contribute troops to the combat phase of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of State]], Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs/May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Increasing the military budget was one of the most important conditions for [[NATO]] integration. Military spending has generally been lower than 1.5% since 1996 only to peak in 2009 at 2% and fall again to 1.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Bank&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Albanian military expenditure as % of GDP|url=http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ms_mil_xpnd_gd_zs&amp;idim=country:ALB&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=military+expenditure+of+albania#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ms_mil_xpnd_gd_zs&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ALB&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 050113-F-9085B-026.jpg|thumb|left|Albanian soldiers conduct a joint patrol with U.S. soldiers in Iraq on 13 January 2005]]In December 2006, the Armed Forces adopted a new structure based on the [[Joint warfare]] concept. It had three main Commands: the ''Joint Forces Command'', the ''Joint Support Command'' and the ''Training and Doctrine Command''. The [[Albanian Joint Forces Command]] (AJFC) consists of the Rapid Reaction Brigade, the Commando Regiment, the Navy Brigade, the Air Brigade and the Area Support Brigade. The [[Albanian Joint Support Command]] provides support and logistical functions to all AAF units. The [[Albanian Training and Doctrine Command]] was established as the main educational and training provider for the Albanian Armed Forces. The final number of personnel will be 13,800 (including 2,000 civilians). However this new structure lasted a little more than 3 years and on April 2010 returned to its classic and current form.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAF new structure&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Kondi|first=Luan|title=Forcat e Armatosura, struktura e re pa Komandën e Bashkuar|url=http://www.gazeta-shqip.com/aktualitet/0dee7528fb5fbc55b0625fb8b487de07.html|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=Shqip|date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 the problem of massive amounts of excess ammunition stockpiled in Albania became known to the public through the tragic consequences of the explosion of an ammunition depot (the [[2008 Tirana explosions]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5i_cGtcfLDRa76mRV27XYdLsVGn6w The Canadian Press: Albanian army ammunition depot explodes, killing 5 and injuring 215] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319010031/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5i_cGtcfLDRa76mRV27XYdLsVGn6w |date=19 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian Land Force or Albanian Army consists of the [[Rapid Reaction Brigade]], a [[Commando Regiment (Albania)|Commando Regiment]], and the [[Area Support Brigade]]. Part of the structure of the Albanian Commando Regiment is the [[Special Operations Battalion (Albania)|Special Operations Battalion]] (BOS). The Albanian Army is mostly supported by the United States, [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Belgium]].

The Albanian Navy performs mainly Coast Guard duties, and recently the Albanian parliament has approved some amendments to the articles of the actual Law on the Coast Guard in Albania, in order to improve the necessary legal framework due to efforts at European Union-NATO integration. Since February 2008, Albania participates officially in NATO's [[Operation Active Endeavor]] in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/issues/active_endeavour/index.html NATO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830210539/http://www.nato.int/issues/active_endeavour/index.html |date=30 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania became a full member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] on 1 April 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO’s relations with Albania&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO Official website|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_48891.htm|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania hosts an international fair on security and defense called the [[Albanian Military Exhibition]] (ALMEX) where different security industries can present their products and services for the regional market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albanian Military Exhibition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ALMEX|url=http://www.albanianmilitaryexhibition.com/english/|work=Albanian Military Exhibition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization===

[[File:Albanian army badges.jpg|thumb|left|Albanian army badges]]
After several major re-equipment programs, in 2001 the Albanian Armed Forces launched a 10-year reform program to become technologically advanced and fully professional by 2011. The new armed forces consists of about 14,500 troops including 2,000 civilians, trained to [[NATO]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koci|first=Jonilda|title=Albania to abolish conscription by 2010|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/08/21/feature-03|publisher=SETimes|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same radical reform is being implemented on surplus equipment, including [[airplanes]], [[tanks]], [[helicopters]], [[artillery]] equipment, navy vessels, SALW and [[ammunition]]. Albania started an ambitious destruction program. However, Albania is still dealing with a huge amount of surplus and obsolete ammunition, a direct result of the country's long isolation and ethnic tensions in the area. The [[Ministry of Defence (Albania)|Albanian Ministry of Defense]] estimates such quantity up to 85,000 tons, but it is expected to increase up to 104,000 tons due to the ongoing downsizing process of the AAF.

In 2004 U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] authorized the use of [[Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction]] program funds for projects in Albania, marking the first time such funds were authorized for use outside the former Soviet Union. With this funding the U.S. assisted the Government of Albania with the destruction of a stockpile of [[chemical warfare]] agents left over from the communist regime (Category 1, Total amount 16.7 tons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/cwcglance.asp|title=Armscontrol.org|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final cost of the project was US$48 million and was officially completed on 10 July 2007.

On 3 April 2006, the final contract for the delivery of 12 ''Bölkow-Blom MBB'' [[BO-105]] lightweight twin-engine multi-role helicopters to the Republic of Albania was signed in [[Tirana]] between the Albanian Ministry of Defense and [[Eurocopter]] ''Deutschland GmbH''.
