==Untitled==
The Army National Guard has a Camp Perry that is named after him. The location of this base is in Port Clinton, Ohio.

it is apparently attributed to him &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours&quot; -- Oliver &quot;Hazard&quot; Perry [[User:Dwarf kirlston|Dwarf Kirlston]] today

:Yes, that's correct. It's covered already in the article. He wrote that phrase in his official report on the Battle of Lake Erie. [[User:Jinian|Jinian]] 16:23, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)

What about &quot;Don't Give Up the Ship!&quot; Something about his motto and his flagship transfer during the Battle of Lake Erie should be included. [[User:Directorstratton|DirectorStratton]] 15:12, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

:No. He didn't say that. That was [[James Lawrence]] who later died and his crew did, in fact, give up the ship. The flagship transfer is covered in the article on the actual battle, but if you'd like to include some here as well, [[Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages|be bold]]. [[User:Jinian|Jinian]] 01:33, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

Minor edit: first, I found a period painting of Perry that looks better than the engraving/drawing posted previously.  Second, the phrase DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP was tagged to an article about a game with that title, when it should have been about the flag itself (there is no article about the flag).  I have also capitalized the phrase as it is written on the flag.  The painting of Perry also includes the flag. [[User:Carajou|Carajou]] 05:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

here is a public domain portrait of Perry, if anyone is interested (pub pre 1923)

==[[Congressional Gold Medal]]==
The Medal itself should be an expanded a part of this article, with a photo of the medal.  See [[Alexander Macomb (American general)]] for an example of how this was done.

:Now that we have that neat portrait, we need a rendition of the Congressional Gold Medal in the article.  [[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|7&amp;amp;6=thirteen]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|talk]]) 18:49, 22 December 2010 (UTC) Stan

==Barbary Coast==
The [[Battle of Derne]] article has more on what he did in Tripoli.[[Special:Contributions/211.225.34.183|211.225.34.183]] ([[User talk:211.225.34.183|talk]]) 03:38, 26 March 2011 (UTC)

==Lede==
There's no need to list all of the campaigns on the Great Lakes in the lede, but I'd add a sentence or so about the dispute with Eliot as that gets a fair amount of coverage in the main body.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 15:18, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

== Sarah Alexander and William Wallace ==

The first paragraph that says Sarah is a direct descendent of [[William Wallace]] may be wrong.

The link points to the Scottish leader of the 1200's but his page says nothing of any children.
Google also doesn't seem to make any mention of a relationship of Sarah and the famous Wallace.
The book citation does say otherwise though.

Should the William Wallace page be changed to mention kids?
Is there some other discrepancy?
[[User:Slothman32|Slothman32]] ([[User talk:Slothman32|talk]]) 08:55, 5 April 2012 (UTC)
:FWIW, all I know is what the source cited in the article says. [[WP:RS]], not [[WP:truth]].  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 19:40, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

Sarah was not a direct descendent of William Wallace. Multiple geneaology sites trace Sarah's ancestry to Richard Wallace, the brother (or step brother) Williams father Alan &lt;http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=maclaren&amp;id=I13137&gt;. 

Some accounts report that Richard sheltered William from &quot;the authories&quot; when he ran amuck as a young man.&lt;http://books.google.com/books?id=4EfCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=william+wallace+richard+youth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_8zBuiZjxx&amp;sig=t9speTXHOVjjKbyJROihhsbWNzo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hTkjVLetF-j2iwKHuoGoDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20wallace%20richard%20youth&amp;f=false&gt; [[User:Nilpad|Nilpad]] ([[User talk:Nilpad|talk]]) 21:39, 24 September 2014 (UTC)

:In addition to the sourcing question (which might suggest we should delete the word &quot;direct&quot;), does the William Wallace reference belong in the very first paragraph of the article? This isn't really a central part of his notability; I think it would be more appropriately moved to the &quot;Family&quot; section, as in the article about his brother [[Matthew C. Perry]] (where, I note, the assertion is that his mother was a &quot;direct descendant of the uncle of Scottish patriot William Wallace&quot;).  --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 18:33, 21 November 2014 (UTC)

::[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]], I agree.  Do it.  It was an interesting bit (of trivia), and is hardly central to his notability. So just move it.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 18:36, 21 November 2014 (UTC)

==Page needs work==

The bibliography and reference sections need work. A bibliography is a list of books used as references -- it is not a grouping of inline citations which are supposed to be listed under 'References'.  Also, 'Cite book' should be used once per book, in the bibliography, not stuck in the body of the text, and then referred/linked to with cite-tags :&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Book-reference|Author-name, 19XX]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; The 'blockquote' was used incorrectly with the signature floating about outside the quote box area. Attempted to fix but was reverted only to see another error take its place. -- [[User:Gwillhickers|Gwillhickers]] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers|talk]]) 19:37, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
:Suggest you consider using the sfn format. Bon appetit.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 22:38, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

== &quot; Don't Give Up the Ship&quot; should be attributed to Capt. James Lawrence ==

&quot;Don't give up the ship&quot; attributed to Oliver Hazard Perry.  See Captain James Lawrence, Wikipedia. According to this account, honoring his friend and fallen comrade Captain James Lawrence, Oliver Hazard Perry adopted James Lawrence's saying, &quot;Don't Give Up the Ship&quot; and put it on his battle flag. Kristin Augustine Christensen, ancestor of James Lawrence  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:FleetGhost|FleetGhost]] ([[User talk:FleetGhost|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/FleetGhost|contribs]]) 21:42, 14 November 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:It is so attributed.&lt;br&gt;
:Perhaps you missed this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Faithful to the words of his battle flag, &quot;DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP&quot; (a paraphrase of the dying words of Captain James Lawrence, the ship's namesake and Perry's friend.''' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Hope that assuages your concern.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 21:38, 15 November 2015 (UTC)

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Oliver Hazard Perry]].

Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive http://web.archive.org/web/20060306213553/http://www.hillsdale.edu:80/personal/stewart/war/America/1812/Naval/1813-Erie-Perry.htm to http://www.hillsdale.edu/personal/stewart/war/America/1812/Naval/1813-Erie-Perry.htm
