'''HMS ''Barham''''' was a {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship}} built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the early 1910s. Often used as a [[flagship]], she participated in the [[Battle of Jutland]] during the [[First World War]] as part of the [[Grand Fleet]]. Other than that battle, and the inconclusive [[Action of 19 August 1916]], her service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the [[North Sea]].

During the 1920s and 1930s, the ship was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean]], and [[Home Fleet]]s. ''Barham'' played a minor role in quelling the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. The ship was in the Mediterranean when the [[Second World War]] began in September 1939 and accidentally collided with and sank one of her escorting [[destroyer]]s on her voyage home three months later. She participated in the [[Battle of Dakar]] in mid-1940 where she damaged a [[Vichy French]] battleship and was slightly damaged in return. ''Barham'' was then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet where she covered multiple [[Malta Convoys]]. She helped to sink an Italian [[heavy cruiser]] and a destroyer during the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941 and was damaged by German aircraft two months later during the [[Battle of Crete#Evacuation, 28 May – 1 June|evacuation of Crete]]. ''Barham'' was sunk off the Egyptian coast the following November by the {{GS|U-331}} with the loss of 862 crewmen, approximately two-thirds of her crew.

== Design and description ==
The ''Queen Elizabeth''-class ships were designed to form a fast [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing [[battleline]]. This required maximum offensive power and a speed several [[knot (unit)|knots]] faster than any other battleship to allow them to defeat any type of ship.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1986, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, pp. 560–61&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barham'' had a [[length overall]] of {{convert|643|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|7|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}}. She had a normal [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of {{convert|32590|LT|t}} and displaced {{convert|33260|LT|t|abbr=on|0}} at [[deep load]]. She was powered by two sets of Brown-Curtis [[steam turbine]]s, each driving two shafts, using steam from 24 [[Yarrow boiler]]s. The turbines were rated at {{convert|75000|shp|abbr=on}} and intended to reach a maximum speed of {{convert|25|kn|1}}. During her abbreviated [[sea trial]]s on 6 July 1916, the ship only reached a mean top speed of {{convert|23.91|kn}}. ''Barham'' had a range of {{convert|5000|nmi|lk=in|0}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|12|kn|1}}. Her crew numbered 1,016 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1986, pp. 255, 257–58, 261&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Queen Elizabeth'' class was equipped with eight [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|{{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} Mk I]] guns in four twin [[gun turret]]s, in two [[superfire|superfiring pairs]] fore and aft of the [[superstructure]], designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. Twelve of the fourteen [[BL 6 inch Mk XII naval gun|BL {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} Mk XII]] guns were mounted in [[casemate]]s along the [[broadside]] of the vessel [[amidships]]; the remaining pair were mounted on the [[forecastle]] deck near the aft [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] and were protected by [[gun shield]]s. Their [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft]] (AA) armament consisted of two [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|{{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}} 20&amp;nbsp;cwt Mk I]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&quot;Cwt&quot; is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; guns. The ships were fitted with four submerged {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each broadside.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1986, pp. 252–53, 256–57&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barham'' was completed with two [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control directors]] fitted with {{convert|15|ft|1|adj=on}} [[rangefinder]]s. One was mounted above the [[conning tower]], protected by an armoured hood, and the other was in the [[Top (sailing ship)|spotting top]] above the tripod [[foremast]]. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by 'B' turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in July 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 20–21, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] of the ''Queen Elizabeth'' class consisted of [[Krupp cemented armour]] (KC) that was {{convert|13|in|0}} thick over the ships' vitals. The gun turrets were protected by {{convert|11|to|13|in|mm|0}} of KC armour and were supported by [[barbette]]s {{convert|7|-|10|in|0}} thick. The ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from {{convert|1|to|3|in|0}} in thickness. The main conning tower was protected by 13 inches of armour. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of [[high-tensile steel]] was added to the main deck over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, pp. 21, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was fitted with [[Flight deck#Early flight decks|flying-off platforms]] mounted on the roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and [[reconnaissance aircraft]] could launch. During her early 1930s refit, the platforms were removed from the turrets and an extending Type EIT [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] was installed on the roof of 'X' turret, along with a [[crane (machine)|crane]] to recover a [[floatplane]]. This was initially a [[Fairey III]]F until it was replaced by a [[Fairey Swordfish]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, pp. 30, 197, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major alterations ===
''Barham'' received a series of minor refits during the 1920s. In 1921–22, {{convert|30|ft|adj=on|1}} rangefinders replaced the smaller ones in 'B' and 'X' turrets.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1986, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later her anti-aircraft defences were upgraded when the original three-inch AA guns were replaced with a pair of [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|sing=on|0|spell=in}} Mk V]] AA guns between November 1924 and January 1925 and another pair of four-inch AA guns was added later that year in October–November. To control these guns a temporary High-Angle Control Position was added above the torpedo control tower aft. This was replaced by a torpedo rangefinder in early 1928 when the permanent position was installed in the remodelled spotting top.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was extensively refitted between January 1931 and January 1934 at a cost of £424,000. During this refit, the aft superstructure was rebuilt and the torpedo control-tower and its rangefinder were removed, together with the aft set of torpedo tubes. The fore funnel was trunked into the aft funnel to reduce smoke in the spotting top. A [[HACS|High-Angle Control System (HACS)]] Mk I director were added to the roof of the spotting top and the [[mainmast]] was reconstructed as a tripod to support the weight of a second HACS director. A pair of octuple mounts for [[QF 2 pounder naval gun#QF 2-pounder Mark VIII|2-pounder (40&amp;nbsp;mm) Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot;]] anti-aircraft guns were added abreast the funnel and two positions for their directors were added on new platforms abreast and below the spotting top. In addition, a pair of quadruple mounts for [[Vickers .50 machine gun]]s were added abreast the conning tower.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

The turret roofs were reinforced to a thickness of {{convert|5|in|0}} and the armour added over the magazines after Jutland was replaced by 4 inches of Krupp non-cemented armour, the first British battleship to receive such. In addition, the rear of the six-inch gun casemates was enclosed by a {{convert|1.5|in|adj=on}} bulkhead. Underwater protection improved by the addition of [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s. They were designed to reduce the effect of torpedo detonations and improve stability&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, pp. 129, 197, 200&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of widening the ship's beam by almost {{convert|14|ft|m|1}} to {{convert|104|ft|m|1}},&lt;ref name=&quot;conways_1922-46&quot;&gt;Chesneau, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced her draught to {{convert|32|ft|6|in|m|1}}. This increased her metacentric height to about {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} at deep load, despite the increase in her deep displacement to {{convert|35970|LT|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1986, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Barham'' conducted her sea trials on 20 November 1933, her speed was reduced to {{convert|22.5|kn}} from {{convert|65655|shp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 2012, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Later alterations included replacing the single mounts of the AA guns with twin mounts for the [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mark XVI gun]], removal of the forward submerged torpedo tubes and the high-angle rangefinder in March–May 1938. In addition the torpedo-control tower aft was replaced by an air-defence position during that same refit. While under repair in December 1939 – March 1940, a 20-barrel [[Unrotated projectile]] (UP) rocket launcher was installed on the roof of 'B' turret and her HACS Mk I directors were replaced with Mk III models. The following year the UP mount was replaced by a pair of quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mounts and another pair of 8-barreled &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts were added abreast her conning tower.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 2012, p. 85; Raven &amp; Roberts, pp. 203, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and service==
The ''Queen Elizabeth'' class was ordered as part of the 1912 Naval Programme and the contract for ''Barham'' was awarded to [[John Brown &amp; Company]].&lt;ref name=gg3&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The ship, named after Admiral [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham]],&lt;ref name=s6&gt;Silverstone, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; was [[laid down]] at their [[Clydebank]] shipyard on 24 February 1913 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 31 December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1986, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Curiously, Gardiner &amp; Gray, Silverstone, and Parkes all give a launch date of 31 October.&lt;ref name=gg3/&gt;&lt;ref name=s6/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Barham'' cost a total of [[Pound sterling|£]]2,470,113.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1986, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; She was completed for trials on 19 August 1915 which took until the end of September to finish under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Arthur Craig Waller]]. The following day, 1 October, [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Hugh Evan-Thomas]], commander of the [[British 5th Battle Squadron|5th Battle Squadron]], hoisted his flag aboard his new flagship.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 19, 21, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
''Barham'' joined the [[Grand Fleet]] at [[Scapa Flow]] the next day and participated in a fleet training operation west of [[Orkney]] during 2–5 November.&lt;ref&gt;Jellicoe, pp. 249, 253&lt;/ref&gt; During another training exercise in early December, the ship was accidentally [[naval ram|rammed]] by her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}} on 3 December. After temporary repairs at Scapa, ''Barham'' was sent to [[Cromarty Firth]] for more permanent repairs in the [[floating dock]] there that lasted until 23 December.&lt;ref&gt;Jellicoe, pp. 257–58; Jones, pp. 26–29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the [[Harwich Force]] to sweep the [[Heligoland Bight]], but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting [[destroyer]]s. On the night of 25 March, ''Barham'' and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty's battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German [[Zeppelin]] base at [[Tondern]]. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong [[gale]] threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off [[Horns Reef]] to distract the Germans while the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]] relaid its defensive minefields in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|raid on Lowestoft]]. The 5th Battle Squadron preceded the rest of the Grand Fleet to reinforce [[Vice-Admiral]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]]'s battlecruiser fleet, but the British arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Jellicoe, pp. 271, 275, 279–80, 284, 286–90&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May, the 5th Battle Squadron was attached to Beatty while his [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] was detached for gunnery training and arrived at [[Rosyth]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Jutland====

{{Main article|Battle of Jutland}}
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 [[light cruiser]]s, and 31 [[torpedo boat]]s, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]]'s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's [[Room 40]] had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, pp. 54–55, 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham'' slipped her [[mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] at 22:08 and was followed by the rest of Beatty's ships.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The times used in this section are in [[Universal Time|UT]], one hour behind [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.&lt;/ref&gt;

When dawn broke Beatty ordered his forces into cruising formation with the 5th Battle Squadron trailing his battle cruisers by {{convert|5|nmi|spell=in}}. At 14:15, Beatty ordered a turn [[north by east]] to rendezvous with the Grand Fleet. Shortly before the turn, one of his escorting light cruisers, {{HMS|Galatea|1914|2}} spotted smoke on the horizon and continued on her course to investigate. Ten minutes later, the ship radioed &quot;Two cruisers, probably hostile, in sight...&quot; They were actually two German destroyers that had stopped to check a Danish merchant ship's papers. At 14:32 Beatty ordered a course change to south-southeast in response to the spot report. ''Barham''{{'}}s signallers were unable to read the signal and her [[officer of the watch]] presumed that it was the expected point [[zigzag]] to the left of the base course and signalled that course change to the rest of the squadron. After several minutes it became apparent that the squadron was not conforming to Beatty's other ships, but Evan-Thomas refused to change course until clear instructions had been received despite entreaties from the ''Barham''{{'}}s [[captain (nautical)|captain]]. While the exact time when Evan-Thomas ordered his ships to turn to follow Beatty is not known, the consensus is that it was about seven minutes later, which increased his distance from Beatty to nothing less than {{convert|10|nmi|spell=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 67, 74–77, 81–82, 85&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Gordon devotes a whole chapter to this issue as the various accounts cannot be reconciled with the surviving records.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 81–101&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty's ships did not see the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east-southeast, positioning the British ships to cut off the German's line of retreat, and signalled [[action stations]]. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to {{convert|18|kn}} to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, {{convert|60|mi}} behind him. Beatty then altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, pp. 69, 71, 75&lt;/ref&gt; This was later characterised as the &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 15:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than {{convert|18000|yd}} away. By this time the 5th Battle Squadron was about {{convert|7.5|nmi|spell=in}} northwest of Beatty. The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British battlecruisers.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 34–35, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group were the first German ships visible to Evan-Thomas's ships and ''Barham'' opened fire on them at 15:58 until the cruisers disappeared into their own [[smoke screen]] at around 16:05.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 43–46&lt;/ref&gt; About three minutes later, the ship opened fire on the battlecruiser {{SMS|von der Tann}} at a range of about {{convert|23000|yd|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 113–15&lt;/ref&gt; A minute later she scored one hit on the German ship's stern before she was ordered to switch targets to the battlecruiser {{SMS|Moltke}}, together with her sister {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}. The shell struck just below the waterline and burst on impact with the belt armour. The impact was right on the joints between several armour plates and drove them inwards and destroyed part of the hull behind them. The damage allowed over {{convert|1000|LT|t|0}} of water to flood the stern and nearly knocked out the ship's steering gear. Between them, ''Barham'' and ''Valiant'' hit ''Moltke'' four times from 16:16 to 16:26, but only one of those hits can be attributed to ''Valiant''. Two of the others detonated upon striking the waterline armour, but failed to penetrate. The impacts drove in the plates and fragments caused much flooding by damaging the surrounding structure. The last shell passed all the way through the ship without detonating; it struck and dislodged a {{convert|100|mm|adj=on}} armour plate on the waterline on the other side of the ship that caused also some flooding. ''Barham'' was herself was struck twice during the &quot;Run to the South&quot;: the first was a {{convert|28.3|cm|adj=on|0}} shell from ''von der Tann'' that failed to do any damage when it hit the waterline armour and the battlecruiser {{SMS|Lützow}} fired a {{convert|30.5|cm|adj=on|0}} shell that detonated in the aft superstructure. This sent splinters in every direction and started a small fire, but otherwise did no significant damage.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 49, 76–77, 85–90&lt;/ref&gt;

At 16:30, the light cruiser {{HMS|Southampton|1912|2}}, scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet coming north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]]'s battleships, but did not report this for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north, towards the Grand Fleet in what came to be known as the &quot;Run to the North&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 598–600&lt;/ref&gt; His order only applied to his own forces; the 5th Battle Squadron continued south until after it passed Beatty heading northwestwards at 16:51. Beatty then ordered Evan-Thomas to turn his ships in succession to follow the battlecruisers three minutes later. This meant that they were some {{convert|4000|yd|m}} closer to the rapidly advancing High Sea Fleet. And now within range of the battleships of the 3rd Squadron which opened fire on the 5th Battle Squadron as they made their turn.{{refn|This is another problematic issue in which sources differ to which Gordon devotes an entire chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 129–151&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Evan-Thomas continued his turn until his ships were steering due north, which interposed the 5th Battle Squadron between Scheer's battlecruisers,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 404–07&lt;/ref&gt; which had reversed course around 16:48 to follow Beatty north,&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; and Beatty's ships. While making the turn,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 143–44&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham'' was struck by two 30.5-centimetre shells beginning at 16:58, probably from the battlecruiser {{SMS|Derfflinger}}. The first of these struck the ship's upper deck before detonating upon striking the main deck above the medical store compartment, which was completely burnt out. The detonation blew a {{convert|7|by|7|ft|m|1|adj=on}} hole in the main deck, sent fragments through the middle and lower decks and burned out the casemate for starboard No. 2 six-inch gun. Three minutes later another shell hit the aft superstructure, severing the antenna cables of the main [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless]] station. One fragment ricocheted off the upper deck and through the side plating on the opposite side of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 100, 126–29&lt;/ref&gt; Either the first or the fourth of these shells destroyed the ship's sickbay, killing the staff and all of its patients, including eight [[ship's boy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham'' returned fire at the battlecruisers at 17:02, together with ''Valiant'', the two northernmost of Evan-Thomas's ships, and the two of them made three hits on the battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz}} and ''Lützow'' between 17:06 and 17:13 while ''Barham'' was hit twice more by ''Derfflinger'', although neither of them did any significant damage. In contrast, the hit on ''Lützow'' flooded a {{convert|15|cm|adj=on}} magazine and the hits on ''Seydlitz'' blew a {{convert|10|by|13|ft|m|1|adj=on}} hole in the side of her bow. Fragments from this hit caused flooding that spread throughout the bow, while the ship's speed caused water to enter directly though the hole in the side. Other fragments from the second hit caused damage that allowed the water to spread even further. These two hits were ultimately responsible for the massive flooding that nearly sank the ship after the battle. The third shell detonated on the face of the starboard [[wing turret]], although some fragments entered the turret and caused minor damage.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatty in the meantime had turned further west to open up the range between his battered battlecruisers and the Germans. At 17:45 he turned eastwards to take his position in front of the Grand Fleet and re-engage Hipper's ships. This meant that the 5th Battle Squadron and the light cruisers were the sole targets available for the German ships until after his turn, although the worsening visibility hampered both sides' shooting. ''Barham'' was not hit during this time and she and ''Valiant'', later joined by their sister ''Warspite'', continued to fire at Hipper's 1st Scouting Group until 18:02 when ''Valiant'' lost sight of the Germans. They hit ''Lützow'', ''Derfflinger'' and ''Seydlitz'' three times each between 17:19 and about 18:05. ''Lützow'' was only slightly damaged by these hits, which essentially only knocked out the primary and back-up wireless rooms while the shells that hit ''Derfflinger'' hit the side of the ship's bow, knocking off several armour plates, while fragments opened holes that ultimately allowed roughly {{convert|2000|t|LT|0}} of water to enter the bow. One of these hits also started several major fires inside the hull. The hits on ''Seydlitz'' mostly opened up more holes that facilitated the flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 101–02, 108–10, 115–16, 134–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Hipper turned his ships southward around 18:05 to fall back upon Scheer's advancing battleships and then reversed course five minutes later. Evan-Thomas turned northeast at around 18:06 and then made a slow turn to the southeast once he spotted the Grand Fleet. He first spotted the battleship {{HMS|Marlborough|1912|2}}, flagship of the 6th Division of the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]] and thought she was leading the Grand Fleet as it deployed from cruising formation into [[line ahead]]. At 18:17 he realised that ''Marlborough'' was actually at the rear of the formation and he ordered a turn to the north to bring his squadron into line behind the Grand Fleet. This took some time and his ships had to slow down to {{convert|12|-|18|kn}} to avoid overrunning the 6th Division and blocking its fire. The 5th Battle Squadron concentrated their fire on the German battleships after losing sight of the battlecruisers, with ''Barham'' opening fire at 18:14. No hits were observed and the ships stopped firing after making their turn north, but ''Barham'' opened fire for a short time when they fell in line with the Grand Fleet a few minutes later, probably without making any hits.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 147, 153, 158, 165&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barham'' fired 337 fifteen-inch shells and 25 six-inch shells during the battle. The number of hits cannot be confirmed, but it is believed that she and ''Valiant'' made 23 or 24 hits between them, making them two of the most accurate warships in the British fleet. She was hit six times during the battle, five times by 30.5&amp;nbsp;cm shells and once by a 28.3&amp;nbsp;cm shell, suffering casualties of 26 killed and 46 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1986, pp. 340, 346, 349, 354–55, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subsequent activity====
[[File:NH 50155.jpeg|thumb|Aerial view of ''Barham'' in Scapa Flow, 1917]]
Following Jutland, ''Barham'' was under repair until 5 July 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway06 p34&quot;&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnoughts and 6 battlecruisers while the Germans mustered 18 dreadnoughts and 2 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet, received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where they expected to encounter the High Seas Fleet, the British turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of [[cruiser]]s and destroyers under [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Reginald Tyrwhitt]]. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and [[U-boat]]s unless the odds of defeating the High Seas Fleet in a decisive engagement were favourable.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 682–84&lt;/ref&gt;

She was refitted at [[Cromarty]] between February and March 1917&lt;ref name=&quot;Conway06 p34&quot;/&gt; and King [[George V]] inspected the ship on 22 June at [[Invergordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham'' was refitted at Rosyth from 7–23 February 1918&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1972, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and Waller was relieved by Captain [[Henry Buller]] on 18 April. The latter was succeeded by Captain Richard Horne on 1 October. She was present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered for internment on 21 November.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 79–81, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between the wars===
[[File:HMS Barham Malaya and Argus.jpg|thumb|left|''Barham'' leading ''Malaya'' and the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}} in the late 1920s]]
''Barham'' became flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in April 1919, and made a port visit to [[Cherbourg]], France that month together with the rest of the squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 2012, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Robin Dalglish]] relieved Horne on 1 October 1920.&lt;ref name=j5&gt;Jones, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; She retained her position when the 1st and 2nd Battle Squadrons were merged in May 1921.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Dalglish was relieved in his turn by Captain [[Percy Noble (Royal Navy officer)|Percy Noble]] on 18 October 1922.&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; ''Barham'' participated in the [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)|Fleet review]] on 26 July 1924 at [[Spithead]]. A few months later, now under the command of Captain [[Richard Hill (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Hill]],&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; the ship again retained her position as the 1st BS was split in two and the ''Queen Elizabeth''s of the new 1st Battle Squadron were transferred to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] on 1 November 1924.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; On 14 October 1925, Captain [[Francis Marten]] relieved Hill, but he retained command only until 9 March 1926 when Captain [[Joseph Henley]] assumed command.&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; Together with her sister {{HMS|Malaya||2}}, ''Barham'' was sent to [[Alexandria, Egypt]] in May 1927 during a time of unrest.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Now under the command of Captain [[Hubert Monroe]]&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; and accompanied by the battleship {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}}, she cruised along the coast of [[West Africa]] from December 1927 to February 1928. She became a [[private ship]] in January of that year and was refitted at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in February–July. Shortly after her return to the Mediterranean, ''Barham'' again became flagship of the 1st BS in September after her sister ''Warspite'' had to return home for repairs after [[Ship grounding|running aground]].&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Captain [[James Somerville]] relieved Monroe on 1 December and he was relieved in his turn on 16 March 1929 by Captain [[John Claude Hamilton|John C. Hamilton]].&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; The ship was relieved as flagship by {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}} in June&lt;ref name=b5&gt;Burt 2012, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; and she was ordered to Palestine in August where her crew helped to suppress [[1929 Palestine riots|rioting in Haifa]] and also operated the [[Palestine Railways|Haifa-Jerusalem railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 115–16&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was transferred to the 2nd BS of the Atlantic Fleet in November 1929,&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; and, together with ''Malaya'', made a port visit to [[Trondheim]], Norway in mid-1930 where they fired a salute to celebrate the birth of [[Princess Ragnhild, Mrs. Lorentzen|Princess Ragnhild]] on 9 June.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 121–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Between January 1931 and January 1934, ''Barham'' underwent a major refit. While the other four ships of the ''Queen Elizabeth ''class were given a second, more extensive refit in the mid-to-late 1930s (which for ''Warspite'', ''Valiant'' and {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}} amounted to a compete reconstruction with new machinery and superstructures), changes to ''Barham'' were relatively minor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conwayss22 p8&quot;&gt;Chesneau, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Now under the command of Captain [[Richard Scott (Royal Navy Officer)|Richard Scott]],&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; ''Barham'' was assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] as the flagship of the 2nd BS,&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; and deployed to the West Indies in January–February 1935 for training. The ship participated in the [[Silver Jubilee]] Fleet Review for George V on 16 July at Spithead&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 127–31&lt;/ref&gt; and was then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of August.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; At that time, Captain [[Norman Wodehouse]] relieved Scott. She was briefly deployed to [[Haifa]] in May 1936 at the beginning of the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Shortly afterwards, she was deployed to Gibraltar for several months after the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 135–36, 139, 149, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barham'' served as the flagship of the 1st BS from November 1936 to May 1937 and participated in the Coronation Fleet Review for King [[George VI]] on 19 May at Spithead. She became the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet on 9 June until relieved by ''Warspite'' on 8 February 1938.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Captain [[Henry Horan]] assumed command on 28 July 1937, although he only remained in command until 22 April 1938 when he was relieved by Captain [[Algernon Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 151, 265&lt;/ref&gt; The ship resumed her former role as flagship of the 1st BS in February 1938 while undergoing a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until May.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Willis was relieved by Captain [[Thomas Walker (Royal Navy Officer)|Thomas Walker]] on 31 January 1939. During a port visit to [[Corfu]] in July, the ship was visited by King [[George II of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 164, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
''Barham'' remained part of the Mediterranean Fleet at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939. She became a private ship on 1 December and departed Alexandria to join the Home Fleet that same day.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 169, 172&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December, she accidentally rammed one of her escorts, the destroyer {{HMS|Duchess|H64|2}}, in thick fog {{convert|9|mi|spell=in}} west of the [[Mull of Kintyre]]. ''Duchess'' [[capsized]] and sank, with the loss of 124 of her crew.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barham'', the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Repulse|1916|06}} and the destroyers {{HMS|Fame|H78|2}}, {{HMS|Icarus|D03|2}}, {{HMS|Imogen|D44|2}}, {{HMS|Isis|D87|2}} and {{HMS|Nubian|F36|2}} were on patrol off the [[Butt of Lewis]] to protect against a possible break-out into the [[Atlantic]] by German warships when they were spotted by the {{GS|U-30|1936|6}}, commanded by [[Fritz-Julius Lemp]], on 28 December. Lemp fired four torpedoes at the two [[capital ship]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; and one struck ''Barham'' on her port side, adjacent to the shell rooms for 'A' and 'B' turrets. The anti-torpedo bulge was essentially destroyed adjacent to the strike, with four men killed and two wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley p103&quot;&gt;Whitley, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the adjacent compartments flooded and the ship took on a 7 degree [[list (watercraft)|list]] that was countered by transferring fuel oil to starboard. ''Barham''{{'}}s speed was initially reduced to {{convert|10|kn}}, but it was increased to {{convert|16|kn}} about an hour and a half later and she was able to proceed under her own power&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Birkenhead]] for repairs by [[Cammell-Laird]] that lasted until April 1940.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt;

[[File:HMS Barham.JPG|left|thumb|''Barham'' in the Mediterranean]]
Captain Geoffrey Cooke assumed command on 25 March&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; and the Navy took the opportunity to augment her light anti-aircraft armament and upgrade its directors.&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham'' played no role in the [[Norwegian Campaign]] although some of her crew and [[Royal Marines|marines]] participated. In preparation for [[Operation Menace]], a British naval attack on [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], prior to a planned landing by the [[Free French]], the ship was detached from the Home Fleet on 28 August and was assigned to Force M, the Royal Navy component of the operation. She departed Scapa Flow that day, escorted by four destroyers,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 190, 192&lt;/ref&gt; and rendezvoused with the troop convoy en route to [[Gibraltar]]&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; where she arrived on 2 September. She later became the flagship of Force M's commander, Vice-Admiral [[John Cunningham (Royal Navy officer)|John Cunningham]].&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Reinforced by the battleship {{HMS|Resolution|09|2}} and the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} from [[Force H]], ''Barham'' departed Gibraltar for [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], four days later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operation Menace====
{{main article|Battle of Dakar}}
Force M departed Freetown for Dakar on 21 September and arrived there before dawn two days later. After Free French emissaries were either captured or driven off by the [[Vichy French]], Cunningham ordered his ships to open fire.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Dumas, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham''{{'}}s six-inch guns were the first to do so and fired at the {{ship|French submarine|Persée||6}} on the surface. They claimed at least one hit&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 197–98&lt;/ref&gt; and the submarine was finished off by two of the escorting destroyers and the light cruiser {{HMS|Dragon|D46|2}}. Her main guns targeted the port and the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu|1939|2}}. Hindered by poor visibility, no significant damage was inflicted and ''Richelieu'' was not hit before the bombardment was called off after 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Dumas, pp. 141–42&lt;/ref&gt;

After the expiration of an ultimatum to surrender the following morning, the battleships engaged the port's {{convert|24|cm|in|adj=on}} [[coastal artillery|coast-defence guns]] and ''Richelieu'' at 09:30. The latter was only struck by a single shell splinter before the Allies broke off the bombardment at 10:07, although she had hit ''Barham'' once with a {{convert|155|mm|in|abbr=on}} shell&lt;ref name=jd3&gt;Jordan &amp; Dumas, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; that blew a hole {{convert|4|ft|1}} in diameter in the bulge.&lt;ref name=dnc&gt;Director of Naval Construction&lt;/ref&gt; The {{ship|French destroyer|Le Hardi}} [[sortie]]d from the harbour at 12:00 to rescue a British pilot in the water, but was engaged at 12:53 by the battleships at a range of {{convert|11000|m|yd|disp=flip}}. The ship was not hit, but was forced to return to port under the cover of a heavy smoke screen. The British battleships then switched targets to bombard the harbour and ''Richelieu''. They set several merchant ships on fire, but again failed to hit the latter at a range of {{convert|15500|m|yd|disp=flip}} before breaking off fire at 13:20.&lt;ref name=jd3/&gt; During this time ''Barham'' was struck by a 24&amp;nbsp;cm shell that penetrated through the superstructure before exploding with little effect and without causing any casualties. Another shell, probably also 24&amp;nbsp;cm in size, detonated in the water on the starboard side abreast of the funnels. The resulting shockwave pushed the bulge inwards for a length of {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} and it started to slowly flood.&lt;ref name=dnc/&gt;

After a conference aboard ''Barham'' later that day, the Allied commanders resolved to continue the attack. On the morning of 25 September, ''Richelieu'' was the first ship to open fire at 09:04 at a range of {{convert|22000|m|yd|disp=flip}}. As the British battleships were manoeuvering to take up their positions, the submarine {{ship|French submarine|Bévéziers|Q179|2}} fired a spread of four torpedoes at a range of {{convert|2500|m|yd|disp=flip}}. ''Barham'' was able to dodge them, but ''Resolution'' was struck by one torpedo amidships that caused a heavy list, and she fell out of line. ''Barham'' opened fire at a range of {{convert|19000|m|yd|disp=flip}} and hit ''Richelieu'' with one 15-inch shell at 09:15. The shell devastated a [[messdeck]] and dented the armoured deck by a depth of {{convert|8|cm}}, but caused no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan &amp; Dumas, pp. 144–47&lt;/ref&gt; The severe damage to ''Resolution'' caused Operation ''Menace'' to be abandoned and ''Barham'' had to tow her to Freetown for temporary repairs, before escorting a convoy to Gibraltar where she arrived on 15 October where her own damage was repaired.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 201–06&lt;/ref&gt; She was briefly assigned to Force H, before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in November 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Historical Section, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barham'', two cruisers, and three destroyers also assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet were designated Force F as part of Operation ''Coat'', one of a [[Operation MB8|complex series of fleet movements]] in the Mediterranean. The battleship and the other ships of Force F were tasked to ferry troops to Malta, before continuing on to Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Historical Section, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham'' was loaded with 600 troops, including the men of 12 Field Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Force F departed Gibraltar on 7 November, escorted by Force H, rendezvoused with the main body of the Mediterranean Fleet three days later and unloaded their cargo at Malta later that day. While sailing eastwards, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}} was detached from the main body to attack [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]] on the night of 11/12 November, damaging three Italian battleships. ''Barham'', now assigned to the 1st BS, and ''Malaya'' were detached to refuel at [[Souda Bay]], [[Crete]], before sailing for Alexandria, reaching there on 14 November.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 10–13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Barham in Suda Bay.jpg|thumb|left|''Barham'' refuelling in Souda Bay, February 1941]]
As part of [[Operation Collar (convoy)|Operation Collar]] in late November, ''Barham'', ''Malaya'' and the carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}} covered the forces rendezvousing with a convoy coming from Gibraltar. En route, ''Eagle''{{'}}s aircraft attacked [[Tripoli]] on 26 November.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barham'' became the flagship of the 1st BS in December.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; On 3 January 1941, the ship, together with ''Warspite'' and ''Valiant'', bombarded [[Bardia]] as a prelude to the [[Battle of Bardia]]. On 26 March, the Italian fleet sortied in an attempt to intercept British convoys to Greece. The British had [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|recently broken the Italian codes]] and sailed after dark on the 27th to intercept the Italians. The following morning, they were spotted by an aircraft from the carrier {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] began. Multiple air strikes by ''Formidable''{{'}}s Fairey Swordfish [[torpedo bomber]]s damaged the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}} and crippled the heavy cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Pola||2}} later that evening. Admiral [[Angelo Iachino]], commander of the Italian fleet, ordered the two other heavy cruisers of the 1st [[Division (naval)|Division]] to render assistance to ''Pola'' in the darkness. The Italian ships and the British arrived almost simultaneously at ''Pola''{{'}}s location, but the Italians had almost no clue that the British were nearby. On the other hand, the British knew exactly where the Italians were, thanks to their radar-equipped ships.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 54, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; They opened fire at [[point-blank range]], ''Barham'' crippling the destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Alfredo Oriani||2}} and then joining ''Warspite'' and ''Valiant'' in crippling {{ship|Italian cruiser|Zara||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April she escorted the fast transport {{MV|Breconshire}}, together with ''Warspite'' and ''Valiant'', from Alexandria to Malta before the battleships bombarded Tripoli on the evening of 20 April. On 6–12 May, she covered the Alexandria-Malta convoy of [[Operation Tiger (1941)|Operation Tiger]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; With her newly arrived sister ''Queen Elizabeth'', ''Barham'' escorted ''Formidable'' as her aircraft attacked the Italian airfield at [[Scarpanto]] at dawn on 26 May with some success. While covering the evacuation of Crete the following day, the ship was attacked by [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers from II./[[Lehrgeschwader 1|LG (Demonstration Wing) 1]] and [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers of II./[[Kampfgeschwader 26|KG (Bomber Wing) 26]]. One {{convert|250|kg|adj=on}} bomb struck 'Y' turret and started a fire inside the turret that took 20 minutes to quench. A near miss ruptured her portside bulge over an area {{convert|20|by|16|ft|m|1}} and caused a 1.5 degree list that was easily corrected by pumping oil. Casualties were five dead and six wounded. She reached Alexandria later that day, but she was too large for the floating dock there and had to be sent elsewhere for repairs. She sailed south through the [[Suez Canal]] to [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], where her damage was inspected. It proved to be worse than expected and ''Barham'' had to be repaired at [[Durban]], [[South Africa]] as she was unfit to make the trans-Atlantic crossing for repair in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 219–20; Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 359; Shores, Cull &amp; Malizia, pp. 377, 386&lt;/ref&gt; Repairs were completed six weeks later on 30 July and the ship returned to Alexandria in August where she resumed her role as flagship of the 1st BS.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt;

On the afternoon of 24 November 1941, the 1st BS, ''Barham'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and ''Valiant'', with an escort of eight destroyers, departed Alexandria to cover the [[7th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|7th]] and [[15th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|15th Cruiser Squadrons]] as they hunted for Italian convoys in the Central Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 201–02&lt;/ref&gt; The following morning, the {{GS|U-331}}, commanded by ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' [[Hans-Diedrich von Tiesenhausen]], detected the faint engine noises of the British ships and moved to intercept. By the afternoon the submarine and the 1st BS were on reciprocal courses and von Tiesenhausen ordered his boat to [[battle stations]] around 16:00. An [[ASDIC]] operator aboard one of the leading destroyers, {{HMS|Jervis||2}}, detected the submarine at 16:18 at an estimated range of {{convert|900|-|1100|yd}}, but the contact was disregarded as it [[subtend]]ed an angle between 40 and 60 degrees wide, far larger than a submarine. U-331 thus passed through the screen and was only in a position to fire her torpedoes after the leading ship, ''Queen Elizabeth'', had passed her by and the second ship, ''Barham'', was closing rapidly. Von Tiesenhausen ordered all four bow torpedo tubes fired at a range of {{convert|375|m|yd}} at 16:25. Possibly due to her closeness to ''Valiant''{{'}}s [[bow wave]] and discharging the torpedoes, the boat's conning tower broached the surface and was fruitlessly engaged by one of the battleship's &quot;pom-pom&quot;s at a range of about {{convert|30|yd|m}}. The boat dived out of control after she broached, reaching an indicated depth of {{convert|265|m}}, well below her [[Submarine depth ratings|design depth]] of {{convert|150|m}}, before she stabilized without any damage. U-331 was not attacked by the escorting destroyers and reached port on 3 December. Von Tiesenhausen was not certain of the results of his attack and radioed that he had hit a ''Queen Elizabeth''-class battleship with one torpedo.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 225–32&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no time for evasive action, and three of the four torpedoes struck amidships so closely together as to throw up a single massive water column. ''Barham'' quickly capsized to port and was lying on her side when a massive magazine explosion occurred aft about four minutes after she was torpedoed and sank her. The Court of Enquiry into the sinking ascribed the final magazine explosion to a fire in the 4-inch magazines outboard of the main 15-inch magazines, which would have then spread to and detonated the contents of the main magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 258–59&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the speed at which she sank, 862 officers and ratings were killed,&lt;ref name=b5/&gt;&lt;ref name=r8&gt;Rohwer, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; including two who died of their wounds after being rescued. The destroyer {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|2}} rescued some 337 survivors, including Vice-Admiral [[Henry Pridham-Wippell]] and the pair who later died of their wounds, while the Australian destroyer {{HMAS|Nizam|G38|2}} reportedly rescued some 150 men.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 242–43&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Jones refers to the 861 men listed in the casualty list published by the Times in 1942,&lt;ref name=j2&gt;Jones, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; but the biggest discrepancies concern the number of survivors. Naval historians Alan Raven and John Roberts give a figure of 396,&lt;ref&gt;Raven &amp; Roberts, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; while historian [[Jurgen Rohwer]] says 450.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;|group=Note}} The sinking was captured on film by a cameraman from [[Pathé News]], aboard ''Valiant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|YdrISbwy_zI|&quot;British Pathé video of Barham sinking.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====
In an effort to conceal the sinking from the Germans and to protect British morale, the [[Board of Admiralty]] censored all news of ''Barham''{{'}}s sinking. After a delay of several weeks the [[War Office]] notified the [[next of kin]], but they added a special request for secrecy: the notification letters included a warning not to discuss the loss of the ship with anyone but close relatives, stating it was &quot;most essential that information of the event which led to the loss of your husband's life should not find its way to the enemy until such time as it is announced officially...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Following repeated claims by German radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000564/19420114/060/0003|title=Nazi Radio Claims HMS Barham Sunk|date=14 January 1942|work=Dundee Courier|page=3|accessdate=28 May 2015| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Admiralty officially announced the loss on 27 January 1942 and explained that {{quote|it was clear at that time that the enemy did not know that she had been sunk, and it was important to make certain dispositions before the loss of this ship was made public.}}&lt;ref name=j2/&gt; It was not until the Admiralty's admission that ''Barham'' had been sunk and described the circumstances that von Tiesenhausen knew that he had sunk her. He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson&quot;&gt;Williamson, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;
