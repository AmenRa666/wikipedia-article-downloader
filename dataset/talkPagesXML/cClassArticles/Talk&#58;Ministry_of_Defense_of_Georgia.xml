* '''Comment''' – the rationale is inappropriate.  How the &quot;offical website&quot; spells it is not as important as what it is called in English-language sources.  And maybe [[WP:RETAIN]] applies.  [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 06:06, 16 December 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' in site based searches on the official website &quot;defence&quot; got over 100 times more results than &quot;defence&quot;.

*'''Move''' to [[Ministry of Defence (Georgia)]]. Its name is just the Ministry of Defence. We don't usually append &quot;of Foo&quot; on the ends of ministries whatever their English-language websites say. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 15:27, 17 December 2014 (UTC)

[[:Ministry of Defense of Georgia]] → {{no redirect|Ministry of Defence (Georgia)}} – Their official website, http://www.mod.gov.ge/, spells it &quot;Ministry of Defence&quot;. As does their [https://www.facebook.com/mod.gov.ge verified Facebook page]. [[WP:NC-GAL]] states &quot;Use official names in article titles&quot;. This is not a machine translation. This is the official name they use. [[WP:RETAIN]] does not mean we keep incorrect names, have some common sense please. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 08:40, 2 March 2016 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' I'd say [[WP:RETAIN]] holds as true here as anywhere else.

*'''Oppose''' per [[WP:RETAIN]] and the arguments above.

::{{ping|Cuchullain}} You appear to be missing the point. [[WP:RETAIN]] does not require we retain incorrect names. This seems to be a truly absurd lack of common sense. It does not matter what sources say, as American sources will usually spell it &quot;defense&quot; irrespective of the actual name, while Australian, British, Irish, Indian etc will do the opposite. For example, the actual name of the Indian Defence Ministry is &quot;Ministry of Defence&quot;. Yet the ''New York Times'' [http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/asia/india-air-base-attack-pathankot.html spells it] &quot;defense&quot;. This is not a [[WP:TIES]] or [[WP:RETAIN]] issue. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 17:39, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
:::Yes, it is. Regardless of what they happen to translate the word on their website, Georgia has no ties to any variety of English, and both spellings are in use. This one was both the first used on Wikipedia, and more common.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 17:44, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
::::{{ping|Cuchullain}} In what context is &quot;defense&quot; more common? Why is it the name of their official verified Facebook page? Please also see [[WP:NC-GAL]] which states &quot;Use official names in article titles&quot;. It seems to me you are favouring your own national variety of spelling in a rather nationalistic way. There is no national ownership of articles. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 17:52, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::It's more common on Google Books, as I said. Plus, it was [[WP:RETAIN|first]]. Your insinuation about &quot;favo'''u'''ring your own national variety&quot; could apply just as well to your comments.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 18:00, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
::::::Your rationale for opposing the move is non-policy based. I have explained precisely why it is more common. You are incorrect to suggest I am favouring my own national spelling. I would never seek to rename the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)]] because that is the proper and correct name. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 18:15, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::::Nonsense, my rationale is based entirely on the [[WP:ENGVAR]] guideline. And I suggested nothing about what you're &quot;favouring&quot;, I merely pointed out that your [[WP:AFG|assumptions]] above could apply equally to your own statements.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 18:36, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. On Engvar, I feel more swayed by what the website is written in when you look through the English version than by the google hits, which I've never found compelling in Engvar cases due to it often depending on the writer. Currently the article is mixed on usage, so either way it should be standardised. Regarding &quot;of Georgia&quot; vs &quot;(Georgia)&quot;, I think &quot;(Georgia)&quot; is a more standard disambiguation. [[User:Chipmunkdavis|CMD]] ([[User talk:Chipmunkdavis|talk]]) 18:51, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per [[WP:TITLEVAR]] and [[WP:TITLECHANGES]] – Neither RETAIN nor ENGVAR apply to article titles. There is no benefit to this change. A reader can understand either version, and TITLEVAR makes it clear that articles should not be renamed only for the sake of changing the variety of English used. This organisation does not have an official English name, and Georgia does not speak English, so even if RETAIN or ENGVAR applied to article titles, they would not apply here. [[User:RGloucester|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000&quot;&gt;RGloucester &lt;/span&gt;]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 23:03, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
*'''Support''' My experience is that, if available, we use the spelling variant used by the organisation. For instance, several years ago we moved [[Israeli Labor Party]] to its current title based on what the party currently calls itself in English (as opposed to Labour, which was what the article started off at). [[User:RGloucester|RGloucester]], your comment about the organisation not having an official English website is incorrect - had you clicked on the link provided in the move rationale, you'd see it does indeed have an [http://www.mod.gov.ge/?lang=eng English language version of the website], which uses &quot;Defence&quot;.

::::::The idea that the English name can only be defined by legislation is, frankly, ridiculous. The British [[Department of Education]] was renamed in the UK simply at the whit of the minister; Israeli ministries are renamed almost every parliament; it's nothing to do with laws.

::::::::If it is not the name as it is in law, it cannot be considered &quot;official&quot;. The meaning of &quot;official&quot; is very clear, is it not? There is a difference between branding, i.e. branding this organisation as &quot;ministry of defence&quot; on a website, and the official Georgian name. Likewise, the [[Police Service of Scotland]], which is called that in law, is branded as &quot;Police Scotland&quot;. The name &quot;Police Scotland&quot; is used in almost every instance, but it cannot ever be considered &quot;official&quot;.

:::::::::I've never seen a meaning of official that meant it had to be defined by law.

The result of the move request was: '''No consensus''' to move the article has been established within the RM time period and thus defaulting to not moved. Policy references in the less-supported oppose votes are convincing enough not to move. {{RMpmc}} &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:sans-serif; color:red&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;[[User:Music1201|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt; Music1201&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Music1201|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 22:24, 15 June 2016 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' per [[WP:TITLECHANGES]] and [[WP:RETAIN]]. And introduce a moratorium to further requested moves, to prevent &quot;[[WP:BURO]] at it's{{sic}} absolute worst&quot;. Just because the Ministry's website employs a translator who prefers British English is ''not'' a proof that there is a national tie of Georgia to BrEn. This is a pure wasting of our collective time, so I also request a moratorium to further requested moves, to prevent &quot;[[WP:BURO]] at it's{{sic}} absolute worst&quot;.

:Very clever pick up on a typo as the main basis for your &quot;argument&quot;. Because let's face it rehashing the &quot;translator&quot; bullshit just doesn't cut it. That has been PROVEN wrong. So continuing to push that is a case of [[WP:NOTLISTENING]] [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 08:44, 30 May 2016 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Precedent exists for this move. [[Israeli Labor Party]] was initially created as [[Israeli Labour Party]]. But because the organisation uses &quot;labor&quot; not &quot;labour&quot;, even though Israel is non-English speaking, the party article was moved. Although, to be fair, of course this was a &quot;British&quot; to &quot;American&quot; move which many editors are wholly in favour of in all circumstances. Some of the arguments to move included that the US was a super-power and that American spelling were &quot;reform spellings&quot;. Nevertheless, this was a clear precedent to support this move. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 09:55, 30 May 2016 (UTC)

::{{ping|Calidum}} So you would prefer [[Israeli Labor Party]] to have remained at [[Israeli Labour Party]]? Talk about arrogance. You see a sign at an event hosted by the Ministry and you still want to use an incorrect name for them. That's condescending and imperialist.

*&lt;s&gt;'''Support'''&lt;/s&gt; - Since &quot;Defence&quot; is what the official website uses, I see no reason not to also, otherwise it can be confusingif we use something different. However, 3 move requests in a year and a half, and 2 in 2 months, is ridiculous, so I support a moratorium on futher move requests for at least a year, no matter the outcome. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 15:04, 30 May 2016 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' per my comments in the last identical RM started by the same user only 2 months ago. Georgia has no [[WP:TIES]] to any variety of English, so [[WP:RETAIN]] indicates we should keep the original spelling. [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ministry+of+Defence+of+Georgia%22&amp;oq=%22Ministry+of+Defence+of+Georgia%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.927j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=%22Ministry+of+Defense+of+Georgia%22&amp;tbm=bks &quot;Ministry of Defense of Georgia&quot;] is as or more common on Google Books than &quot;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ministry+of+Defence+of+Georgia%22&amp;oq=%22Ministry+of+Defence+of+Georgia%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.927j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Ministry+of+Defence+of+Georgia%22 Ministry of Defence of Georgia]&quot;. I don't believe the form used in the English version of the webpage is a compelling reason to change; Georgian government sources using &quot;Ministry of Defense&quot; in English translation, or both spellings interchangeably, are easily found.[http://www.csb.gov.ge/en/Competition-in-the-Ministry-of-Defense-of-Georgia-/572][http://www.dea.gov.ge/uploads/DAY-2/MOD.pptx][http://www.mrdi.gov.ge/en/news/page/52aef8030cf260af4f9cf49d][http://delta.gov.ge/en/about-delta/]--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 14:18, 31 May 2016 (UTC)
::{{ping|Cuchullain}} Firstly, with the other RM closes as no consensus I see no problem with starting another RM. [[WP:RETAIN]] does not indicate that we keep incorrect names, have some [[WP:COMMONSENSE|common sense]]. What astonishes me is the way nationalistic American editors are so protective of their &quot;reform&quot; spellings. If this was the other way around, and the Georgian Defence Ministry had logos and signs, Facebook and Twitter accounts and websites spelling it &quot;defense&quot; but an article spelling it &quot;defence&quot; I'd be the first to support a move. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 23:02, 31 May 2016 (UTC)
:::Your shows of [[WP:BADFAITH|bad faith]] toward other editors is tiresome. All it does is hurt your own position.&lt;br&gt;
:::There's nothing &quot;incorrect&quot; about &quot;Defense&quot; here, as it's been demonstrated that other Georgian government documents use it and it's apparently more common in [[WP:RELIABLESOURCES]], so [[WP:RETAIN]] is compelling. There's another problem with the proposal: &quot;of Georgia&quot; is perfectly suitable [[WP:NATURALDIS|natural disambiguation]] under either spelling, so there's no need to insert the less preferable parenthetical disambiguation &quot;(Georgia)&quot;.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 13:58, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
::::I concur. The combativeness and sarcasm is certainly getting old very fast, and isn't necessary. The user's intention to keep making new proposals every time the user discovers a new &quot;source&quot; that backs up his preferred title is also problematic, and seems to indicate a [[WP:BATTLEGROUND]] attitude here. That needs to stop.

::::Further, Georgia is not an English speaking country, ENGVAR does not apply. Therefore, &quot;defense&quot; is not incorrect. I still support using what is on the Official Website, Facebook, and Twitter. But again, once this discussion closes, a moratorium on new proposals would be very refreshing. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 14:20, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
:::::{{ping|BilCat}} I never said ENGVAR applied. I have made a two proposals, not &quot;every time&quot; I discover a source. Thanks for your own display of bad faith. I think what they use on a sign at a conference they organised is a significant development. Opening a second proposal this year given the other one closed as no consensus is entirely appropriate. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 14:44, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
::::::It's less fact that you've opened a new RM, than the timing and your other behavior. Just cool it and there won't be further problems. You've said your piece, just let the RM proceed and accept the outcome.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 15:00, 1 June 2016 (UTC)


::::::{{ec}} AusLondonder, I said &quot;intention to&quot;, but if I misread your comment, forgive me. I would like some assurance that this isn't going to be a regular thing here. If ENGVAR doesn't apply, then &quot;defense&quot; can't be incorrect per WP policy as you're claiming, that's all I said or meant.  Railing against American English as you've done isn't winning you any points with me, and I support the move! However, comments like &quot;What astonishes me is the way nationalistic American editors are so protective of their &quot;reform&quot; spellings&quot; are not helpful. Although I'm American, I was partly educated in a Commonwealth country, and in a British Overseas territory, so I am tolerant of other spellings. I do understand your frustration, but please remember this is about one little letter, and in the long run irrelevant. Please drop the sarcasm like linking to Freedom Fries. All that does is engender a hostile environment here. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 15:06, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
:::::::My apologies for any offence caused. I view &quot;defense&quot; as incorrect because it is not the name used by the Ministry on any internet profiles nor its signage. I am not railing against appropriate use of American English. I have no problem with it. I do feel American editors tend to be rather defensive about US English in a way British editors aren't, for example. Look at the drama that takes place all the time at [[Talk:Humour]] or the successful bid to move [[Yoghurt]] to [[Yogurt]]. I also feel that editors are not listening to the very credible points I have made. [[User:AusLondonder|AusLondonder]] ([[User talk:AusLondonder|talk]]) 09:15, 3 June 2016 (UTC)
::::::::People expressly challenging your points suggests they're being listened to, if not agreed with. Also, your comments are evidence that British editors are perfectly capable of being &quot;defensive&quot; about their national spelling. At any rate, that particular line of argument isn't winning you much sympathy, even from editors who already agree with you.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 14:28, 3 June 2016 (UTC)
