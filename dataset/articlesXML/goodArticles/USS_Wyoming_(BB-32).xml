'''USS ''Wyoming'' (BB-32)''' was the [[lead ship]] of [[Wyoming-class battleship|her class]] of [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s and was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] named Wyoming, although she was only the second named in honor of [[Wyoming|the 44th state]]. ''Wyoming'' was laid down at the [[William Cramp and Sons]] in [[Philadelphia]] in February 1910, was launched in May 1911, and was completed in September 1912. She was armed with a [[main battery]] of twelve {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} guns and capable of a top speed of {{cvt|20.5|kn|lk=on}}.

During the [[First World War]], she was part of the [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division Nine]], which was attached to the British [[Grand Fleet]] as the [[6th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|6th Battle Squadron]]. During the war, she was primarily tasked with patrolling in the [[North Sea]] and escorting convoys to Norway. She served in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets throughout the 1920s, and in 1931–1932, she was converted into a [[training ship]] according to the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930.

''Wyoming'' served as a training ship throughout the 1930s, and in November 1941, she became a gunnery ship. She operated primarily in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area, which earned her the nickname &quot;Chesapeake Raider&quot;. In this capacity, she trained some 35,000 gunners for the hugely expanded US Navy during [[World War II]]. She continued in this duty until 1947, when she was decommissioned on 1 August and subsequently sold for scrap; she was broken up in New York starting in December 1947.

==Design==
{{main|Wyoming-class battleship}}

''Wyoming'' was {{cvt|562|ft|lk=on|0}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|93|ft|3|in|0}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{cvt|28|ft|6|in|0}}. She displaced {{cvt|26000|LT|lk=on|0}} as designed and up to {{cvt|27243|LT}} at full combat load. The ship was powered by four-shaft [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbines]] and twelve coal-fired [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s rated at {{cvt|28000|shp|lk=on}}, generating a top speed of {{cvt|20.5|kn}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{cvt|8000|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{cvt|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=114}}

The ship was armed with a [[main battery]] of twelve [[12&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|12-inch/50 caliber Mark 7]]{{efn|/50 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. A /50 gun is 50 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} guns in six Mark 9 twin [[gun turret]]s on the centerline, two of which were placed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] forward. The other four turrets were placed aft of the [[superstructure]] in two superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of twenty-one [[5&quot;/51 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}}/51 caliber guns]] mounted in [[casemate]]s along the side of the hull. The main [[armored belt]] was {{cvt|11|in|0}} thick, while the gun turrets had {{cvt|12|in|0}} thick faces. The [[conning tower]] had {{cvt|11.5|in|0}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=114}}

=== Modifications ===
In 1925, ''Wyoming'' was modernized in the Philadelphia Navy Yard.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} Her displacement increased significantly, to {{cvt|26066|LT|t}} standard and {{cvt|30610|LT|t}} full load. Her beam was widened to {{cvt|106|ft|0}}, primarily from the installation of [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s, and draft increased to {{cvt|29|ft|11.75|in|0}}. Her twelve coal-fired boilers were replaced with four [[White-Forster boiler|White-Forster oil-fired]] boilers that had been intended for the ships cancelled under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]; performance remained the same as the older boilers. The ship's deck armor was strengthened by the addition of {{cvt|3.5|in|0}} of armor to the second deck between the end barbettes, plus {{cvt|1.75|in|0}} of armor on the third deck on the bow and stern. The deck armor over the engines and boilers was increased by {{cvt|0.75|in|0}} and {{cvt|1.25|in|0}}, respectively. Five of the 5-inch guns were removed and eight [[3&quot;/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}/50 caliber]] [[anti-aircraft]] guns were installed. The mainmast was removed to provide space for an aircraft catapult mounted on the Number 3 turret [[amidships]].{{sfn|Gardiner|Chesneau|1980|p=91}}

== Service history ==
''Wyoming'' was laid down at the [[William Cramp and Sons]] shipyard in [[Philadelphia]] on 9 February 1910, and was launched on 25 May 1911. She was completed a year and four months later, on 25 September 1912.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=114}} After her commissioning, the final [[fitting-out]] work was completed at the [[New York Navy Yard]] over the next three months. She then proceeded to join the rest of the fleet at [[Hampton Roads]] on 30 December, where she became the [[flagship]] of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Charles J. Badger]], the commander of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]]. ''Wyoming'' left Hampton Roads on 6 January 1913, bound for the Caribbean. She visited the [[Panama Canal]], which was nearing completion, and then participated in fleet exercises off Cuba. The ship was back in port in [[Chesapeake Bay]] on 4 March.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

[[File:USSWyoming2.jpg|thumb|''Wyoming'' steaming up the [[East River]] in 1912]]

''Wyoming'' then took part in gunnery drills off the [[Virginia Capes]], and on 18 April, entered drydock at the New York Navy Yard for some repairs, which lasted until 7 May. She joined the rest of the fleet for maneuvers off [[Block Island]] that lasted from 7–24 May. During the maneuvers, the ship's machinery proved troublesome, which necessitated repairs at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] from 9–19 May. At the end of the month, she was in New York harbor, to participate in the ceremonies for the dedication of the monument to the [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}}, which had been destroyed in [[Havana]] harbor on 15 February 1898. On 4 June, ''Wyoming'' steamed to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], where she took on a crew of naval cadets from the [[USNA|Naval Academy]] for a summer midshipman cruise.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

After returning the cadets to Annapolis on 24–25 August, ''Wyoming'' took part in gunnery and torpedo training over the next few weeks. On 16 September, she returned to New York for repairs, which lasted until 2 October. She then ran full–power [[sea trial]]s before proceeding to the Virginia Capes, where she participated in another round of fleet maneuvers. Next, she departed for a European goodwill cruise on 26 October. She toured the [[Mediterranean Sea]], stopping in [[Valletta, Malta]], [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], and [[Villefranche-sur-Mer|Villefranche, France]]. She departed France on 30 November, and arrived in New York on 15 December. There, she went into dock at the New York Navy Yard for periodic repairs, which lasted until January 1914. On the 6th, ''Wyoming'' left for Hampton Roads, where she took on coal in preparation for the annual fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

The exercises lasted from 26 January to 15 March, and the fleet was based out of [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in Cuba. ''Wyoming'' and the rest of the fleet then proceeded to [[Tangier Sound]] for additional training, including gunnery drills. On 3 April, ''Wyoming'' left the fleet for an overhaul in New York, which lasted until 9 May. She then returned to Hampton Roads, where she took on a contingent of troops and ferried them to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], arriving on 18 May. The US had intervened in the [[Mexican Revolution]] and [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupied Veracruz]] to safeguard American citizens there. ''Wyoming'' cruised off Veracruz into the Autumn of 1914, at which point she returned to the Virginia Capes for exercises. On 6 October, she entered New York for repairs; this work lasted until 17 January 1915.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

''Wyoming'' then proceeded to Hampton Roads, and then to Cuba, where she joined the fleet for the annual maneuvers off Cuba. These lasted until April, when she returned to the US. She participated in more exercises off Block Island over the next several months, and on 20 December, she returned to New York for another overhaul. On 6 January 1916, she emerged from dry dock, and then proceeded to the Caribbean. On 16 January, she reached [[Culebra, Puerto Rico]], then visited [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti on 27 January. She entered port at Guantanamo the next day, and took part in fleet maneuvers until 10 April, after which she returned to New York. Another round of dockyard work took place from 16 April to 26 June. After returning to service, ''Wyoming'' took part in more maneuvers off the Virginia Capes for the remainder of the year. She left New York on 9 January 1917, bound for Cuban waters for exercises that lasted through mid-March. She left Cuba on 27 March, and was cruising off [[Yorktown, Virginia]] when the US declared war on Germany on 6 April, formally entering [[World War I]].{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

=== World War I ===
''Wyoming'' operated out of the Chesapeake Bay area for the next seven months, training engine-room personnel for the expanding American fleet. On 25 November, [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division 9]] (BatDiv 9), which at that time comprised ''Wyoming'', {{USS|New York|BB-34|2}}, {{USS|Delaware|BB-28|2}}, and {{USS|Florida|BB-30|2}}, departed the US, bound for Britain. BatDiv 9 was to reinforce the British [[Grand Fleet]] at its base in [[Scapa Flow]]. The American ships reached Scapa on 7 December, where they became the [[6th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|6th Battle Squadron]] of the Grand Fleet. The American ships drilled with their British counterparts from December 1917 to February 1918.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

[[File:Battleship Division Nine WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Battleship Division 9 steaming into Scapa Flow]]
On 6 February, ''Wyoming'' and the other American battleships undertook their first wartime operation, to escort a convoy to [[Stavanger]], Norway, in company with eight British [[destroyer]]s.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} On 7 February, lookouts on several ships, including ''Wyoming'', thought they spotted German [[U-boat]]s attacking the ships with [[torpedo]]es, though these proved to be incorrect reports.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=37}} The convoy successfully reached Norway two days later; the return trip to Scapa Flow took another two days. ''Wyoming'' patrolled in the [[North Sea]] for the next several months, watching for a sortie by the German [[High Seas Fleet]].{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}  On 30 June, ''Wyoming'' and the rest of the 6th Battle Squadron covered a minelaying operation in the North Sea; the operation lasted until 2 July.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} During the operation, jumpy crewmen again incorrect reported U-boat sightings, and ''Wyoming'' opened fire on the supposed targets.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=56&amp;ndash;57}} On the return voyage, the 6th Battle Squadron joined up with Convoy HZ40, which was returning from Norway.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=58}}

On 14 October, ''New York'' collided with a U-boat and sank it. The collision nevertheless damaged her screws, which forced Rodman to transfer his flag from ''New York'' to ''Wyoming'' while the former was in dock for repair.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=67}} On 21 November, after the [[Armistice with Germany]] ended the war, ''Wyoming'' and an Allied fleet of some 370 warships met the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea and escorted it into internment in Scapa Flow.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}{{sfn|Herwig|1980|pp=254–255}} On 12 December, ''Wyoming'', now the flagship of Rear Admiral [[William Sims]], the new BatDiv 9 commander, left Britain for France. There, she rendezvoused off [[Brest, France]] with {{SS|George Washington||2}}, which was carrying President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to the peace negotiations in Paris. ''Wyoming'' then returned to Britain two days later before departing for the US, arriving in New York on 25 December. She remained there through the new year, and on 18 January 1919, she became the flagship of BatDiv 7, flying the flag of Rear Admiral [[Robert Coontz]].{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

=== Inter-war period ===
[[File:USS Wyoming in the Panama Canal, 1919.jpg|thumb|''Wyoming'' transiting the Panama Canal on 26 July 1919]]

On 1 February, ''Wyoming'' steamed out of New York to join the annual fleet maneuvers off Cuba, before returning to New York on 14 April. On 12 May, she left port to help guide a group of Navy [[Curtiss NC]] [[flying boat]]s as they made the first aerial transatlantic crossing. The battleship was back in port by 31 May. She then took on a crew of midshipmen for a training cruise off the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes. After finishing the cruise, ''Wyoming'' entered dry dock at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] on 1 July for a modernization for service in the Pacific.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} Her secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=202}} After emerging from the shipyard, she became the flagship of BatDiv 6 of the newly designated [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. On 19 July, ''Wyoming'' and the rest of the Pacific Fleet departed the east coast, bound for the Pacific. The ships transited the Panama Canal later that month, and reached [[San Diego, California]] on 6 August.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

On 9 August, ''Wyoming'' moved to [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], where she was based for the next month. She went to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] for an overhaul that lasted until 19 April 1920. On 4 May, she was back in San Pedro and resumed her normal routine of fleet maneuvers off the California coast. On 30 August, ''Wyoming'' left California for Hawaii, where she participated in more training exercises through September. She then returned to San Diego on 8 October for more maneuvers off the west coast. The ship left San Francisco on 5 January 1921 for a cruise to Central and South American waters; the trip culminated in [[Valparaíso]], Chile, where she was reviewed by the [[President of Chile]] [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]] on 8 February. ''Wyoming'' then returned north, arriving in Puget Sound for repairs on 18 March.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

On 2 August, ''Wyoming'' was in [[Balboa, Canal Zone|Balboa]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]], where she picked up Rear Admiral Rodman and a commission traveling from Peru back to New York. She arrived in New York on 19 August and rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. There, she became the flagship of [[Admiral]] [[Hilary P. Jones]], the commander of the Atlantic Fleet. ''Wyoming'' spent the next three and a half years on the normal routine of winter fleet exercises off Cuba, followed by summer maneuvers off the east coast of the US. Throughout the period, she served as the flagship of [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]]s [[John McDonald (naval officer)|John McDonald]], [[Newton McCully]], and [[Josiah McKean]] in the Scouting Fleet. In the summer of 1924, she conducted a midshipman training cruise to Europe, and stopped in [[Torbay, England|Torbay]], Great Britain, [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Gibraltar]], and the [[Azores]].{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} In January and February 1924, the Navy conducted [[Fleet Problem II#Fleet Problems II, III, IV|Fleet Problem II, III, and IV]] concurrently. During the FP III maneuvers, ''Wyoming'', her sister {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|2}}, and the two {{sclass-|Florida|battleship|2}}s stood in for the new {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|1}}s.{{sfn|Nofi|2010|p=26}} During the FP IV portion of the maneuvers, ''Wyoming'' served in the &quot;Blue&quot; force, which represented the US Navy. She was attacked by &quot;Black&quot; aircraft, but the umpires judged ''Wyoming''{{'}}s anti-aircraft fire and the escort fighters provided by {{USS|Langley|CV-1|2}} to have effectively defended the fleet.{{sfn|Nofi|2010|p=66}}

On 14 February 1925, ''Wyoming'' again passed through the Panama Canal to return to the Pacific. There, she joined fleet exercises off California. She then proceeded to Hawaii, where she remained from late April to early June. She visited San Diego on 18&amp;ndash;22 June, and then returned to the east coast via the Panama Canal, arriving in New York on 17 July. A cruise to Cuba and Haiti followed, after which ''Wyoming'' returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted from 23 November to 26 January 1926. During this period, then-[[Commander]] [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]] came aboard as the ship's executive officer; he served on ''Wyoming'' until 4 January 1927.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

[[File:USS Wyoming in March 1930.jpg|thumb|left|''Wyoming'' underway in March 1930]]
''Wyoming'' then returned to the routine of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean and training cruises in the summer. In late August, the ship went to Philadelphia for an extensive modernization. Her old coal-fired boilers were replaced with new oil-fired models and [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s were added to improve her resistance to underwater damage. The work was completed by 2 November, after which ''Wyoming'' conducted a shakedown cruise to Cuba and the [[Virgin Islands]]. She was back in Philadelphia on 7 December, and two days later, she returned to her post as the flagship of the Scouting Fleet, flying the flag of Vice Admiral [[Ashley Robertson (admiral)|Ashley Robertson]].{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

''Wyoming'' spent the next three years in the Scouting Fleet. She conducted training cruises with [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (NROTC) cadets from various universities, including [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Harvard]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]. These cruises went throughout the Atlantic, including to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], to the Azores, and to [[Nova Scotia]]. While on one of these cruises in November 1928, ''Wyoming'' picked up eight survivors from the wrecked steamship {{SS|Vestris}}; she took them to Norfolk on 16 November. On 19 September 1930, ''Wyoming'' was transferred from the Scouting Force to BatDiv 2, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Wat T. Cluverius]]. She served here until 4 November, when she was withdrawn from front-line service and became the flagship of the Training Squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral [[Harley H. Christy]]. Thereafter, she conducted a training cruise to the Gulf of Mexico.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

After returning to Philadelphia on 1 January 1931, ''Wyoming'' was placed on reduced commission. Under the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]] signed the previous year, ''Wyoming'' was to be demilitarized. During the demilitarization process, her anti-torpedo bulges, side armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. She was back in service by May, and on the 29th, she took on a crew of midshipmen from Annapolis for a training cruise to Europe, which began on 5 June. While en route on 15 June, ''Wyoming'' rescued the disabled submarine {{USS|O-12|SS-73|2}} and took it under tow to [[Cobh|Queenstown, Northern Ireland]]. While in Europe, she stopped in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, [[Greenock, Scotland]], [[Cadiz, Spain]], and Gibraltar. The ship was back in Hampton Roads on 13 August; while on the cruise, ''Wyoming'' was reclassified as &quot;AG-17&quot;, to reflect her new role as a training ship.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

''Wyoming'' spent the next four years conducting training cruises for midshipmen and NROTC cadets to various destinations, including European ports, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. On 18 January 1935, she carried the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, from Norfolk to [[Puerto Rico]] for amphibious assault exercises. On 5 January 1937, the ship left Norfolk and steamed to the Pacific via the Panama Canal. She took part in more amphibious assault exercises and gunnery drills at [[San Clemente Island]]. On 18 February, during the exercises, a 5-inch [[shrapnel shell]] exploded as it was being loaded into one of her guns. The blast killed six [[USMC|Marines]] and wounded another eleven. ''Wyoming'' immediately steamed to San Pedro and transferred the wounded Marines to the [[hospital ship]] {{USS|Relief|AH-1|2}}.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

On 3 March, ''Wyoming'' left Los Angeles, bound for the Atlantic. She reached Norfolk on 23 March, where she served as the temporary flagship for Rear Admiral [[Wilson Brown (admiral)|Wilson Brown]], the commander of the Training Squadron, from 15 April to 3 June. On 4 June, she left port to conduct a goodwill cruise to [[Kiel]], Germany, arriving on 21 June. There, she visited [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|''Admiral Graf Spee'']]. She left Germany on 29 June, stopping in Torbay, Britain, and [[Funchal, Madeira]], and arrived in Norfolk on 3 August. ''Wyoming'' resumed her training ship duties for Naval and Merchant Marine Reserve units. She returned to Norfolk Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted from 16 October to 14 January 1938.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

''Wyoming'' performed her typical routine of training cruises in the Atlantic through 1941. The cruises included another European trip in 1938; she took the midshipmen to [[Le Havre, France]], Copenhagen, and [[Portsmouth]].{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe in September 1939, ''Wyoming'' was assigned to a naval reserve force in the Atlantic, alongside the battleships ''New York'', ''Arkansas'', and {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}} and the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=4}} ''Wyoming'' became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Randall Jacobs]], the commander of the Training, Patrol Force on 2 January 1941. In November, ''Wyoming'' became a gunnery training ship. Her first cruise in this new role began on 25 November; she was cruising off [[Platt's Bank]] when she received word of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

=== World War II ===
[[File:USS Wyoming, gunnery training ship, 1944.jpg|thumb|''Wyoming'' in April 1944]]
Following the United States' entrance into World War II, ''Wyoming'' performed her normal duties as a gunnery training ship with the Operational Training Command, United States Atlantic Fleet starting in February 1942. She operated primarily in the Chesapeake Bay area, and frequent sightings of the ship steaming around the bay earned her the nickname &quot;Chesapeake Raider&quot;. ''Wyoming'' was very busy, training thousands of anti-aircraft gunners on weapons ranging from light .50 caliber (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) guns to medium-caliber 5-inch guns for the rapidly expanding American fleet.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} Early in the war, the Navy briefly considered converting ''Wyoming'' back to her battleship configuration, but decided against the plan.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=114}}

These duties continued throughout the rest of the war. ''Wyoming'' was modernized at Norfolk Navy Yard from 12 January to 3 April 1944;{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} the reconstruction removed the last of her three 12-inch gun turrets, and replaced them with four twin and two single enclosed mounts for [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|5-inch/38 caliber guns]].{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=202}} New fire control radars were also installed; these modifications allowed ''Wyoming'' to train anti-aircraft gunners with the most modern equipment they would use while in combat with the fleet. She was back in service in the Chesapeake Bay by 10 April. Over the course of the war, ''Wyoming'' trained an estimated 35,000 gunners on seven different types of guns: 5-inch, 3-inch, 1.1-inch, 40-millimeter, and 20-millimeter weapons. Due to her extensive use as a gunnery training ship, she claimed the distinction of firing more ammunition than any other ship in the fleet during the war.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

''Wyoming'' finished her gunnery training duties in the Chesapeake area on 30 June 1945, when she left Norfolk for the New York Navy Yard, for further modifications. Work was completed by 13 July, after which she left for [[Casco Bay]]. There, she joined Composite Task Force 69 (CTF 69), under command of Vice Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]].  ''Wyoming'' was tasked with developing tactics to more effectively engage the Japanese [[kamikaze]] suicide aircraft. The gunners conducted experimental gunnery drills with towed sleeves, drone aircraft, and radio-controlled targets. On 31 August, CTF 69 was renamed Operational Development Force, United States Fleet.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}

''Wyoming'' continued in this unit through the end of the war, and began to be used to test new fire control equipment.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}} In the summer of 1946, then-[[Ensign]] [[Jimmy Carter]], the future [[President of the United States]], came aboard as part of the final crew of the old battleship.{{sfn|Gherman|2004|pp=31–32}} On 11 July 1947, ''Wyoming'' put into Norfolk and was decommissioned there on 1 August. Her crew was transferred to the ex-battleship {{USS|Mississippi|AG-128|3}}, which was also serving in the gunnery training unit. ''Wyoming'' was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Registry]] on 16 September, and she was sold for scrapping on 30 October. She arrived on 5 December in New York, where she was dismantled by Lipsett, Incorporated.{{sfn|DANFS Wyoming (BB-32)}}
