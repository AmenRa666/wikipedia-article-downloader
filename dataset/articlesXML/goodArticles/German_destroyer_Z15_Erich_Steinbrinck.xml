'''Z15 ''Erich Steinbrinck''''' was a {{sclass2-|Type 1934A|destroyer}} built for [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' in the mid-1930s. The ship was named after the First World War German naval officer [[Erich Steinbrinck]]. At the beginning of [[World War II]] on 1 September 1939, the ship was initially deployed to [[blockade]] the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the [[North Sea]] to lay defensive [[minefield]]s. In late 1939 and 1940 the ship laid multiple offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 24 merchant ships and a destroyer. ''Steinbrinck'' was under repair for most of the [[Norwegian Campaign]] of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year.

After a lengthy refit in Germany, she returned to France in early 1941 where she escorted returning [[warship]]s, [[commerce raider]]s, and [[Auxiliary ship|supply ships]] through the [[Bay of Biscay]] for several months. After her refit was completed, ''Steinbrinck'' was transferred to Northern Norway in 1942 where she participated in several minor operations before she was damaged [[Ship grounding|running aground]] and forced to return to Germany for repairs. The ship returned to Norway in mid-1943 where she escorted German capital ships as they moved between Norway and Germany and participated in the German attack ([[Operation Zitronella]]) on the Norwegian island of [[Spitzbergen]], well north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. ''Steinbrinck'' was ordered home in November to begin a lengthy refit, during which she was badly damaged by Allied bombs, and was unserviceable for the rest of the war. She was turned over to the [[Soviet Union]] after the war as war reparations and only served a few years before she was converted into a [[training ship]] and then a [[barracks ship]] before being [[ship breaking|sold for scrap]] in 1958.

==Design and description==
''Erich Steinbrinck'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|119|m|ftin|sp=us}} and was {{convert|114|m|ft|sp=us}} [[Length at the waterline|long at the waterline]]. The ship had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.30|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.23|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She displaced {{convert|2239|LT|lk=out|sp=us}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard]] and {{convert|3165|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]]. The Wagner geared [[steam turbine]]s were designed to produce {{convert|70000|PS|kW shp|lk=on|0}} which would propel the ship at {{convert|36|kn|link=on}}. Steam was provided to the turbines by six high-pressure Benson [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s&lt;ref name=g9&gt;Gröner, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; with [[superheater]]s. ''Erich Steinbrinck'' carried a maximum of {{convert|752|t|LT|0|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]] which was intended to give a range of {{convert|4400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|19|kn}}, but the ship proved top-heavy in service and 30% of the fuel had to be retained as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] low in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The effective range proved to be only {{convert|1530|nmi|abbr=on|lk=in}} at {{convert|19|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Koop and Schmolke, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The ship's crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 sailors.&lt;ref name=g9/&gt;

''Erich Steinbrinck'' carried five [[12.7 cm SK C/34 naval gun|12.7 cm SK C/34 guns]] in single mounts with [[gun shield]]s, two each [[superfire|superimposed]], fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of four [[3.7 cm SK C/30]] guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] and six [[2 cm FlaK 30/38/Flakvierling|2&amp;nbsp;cm C/30]] guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above-water {{convert|53.3|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s in two power-operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount.&lt;ref name=g9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[depth charge]] throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Sufficient depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of sixteen charges each.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of sixty [[Naval mine|mines]].&lt;ref name=g9/&gt; 'GHG' ([[Gruppenhorchgerät]]) passive [[hydrophone]]s were fitted to detect [[submarine]]s and an active [[sonar]] system was installed by the end of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. In 1941, improved 2&amp;nbsp;cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced at some point by a single 2&amp;nbsp;cm quadruple ''Flakvierling'' mount, probably in 1942. Sometime in 1944–45, ''Steinbrinck'' received the &quot;Barbara&quot; anti-aircraft refit in which all of her existing 3.7&amp;nbsp;cm and most of her 2&amp;nbsp;cm guns were replaced. She retained her ''Flakvierling'' mount and the remainder of her anti-aircraft armament now consisted of seven twin [[3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43#Flak 43|3.7&amp;nbsp;cm SK M/42]] mounts and four twin 2&amp;nbsp;cm mounts on the forecastle and side of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Erich Steinbrinck'', named after the commander of the [[torpedo boat]] {{SMS|V-29}} killed during the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916, was ordered on 19 January 1935 from [[Blohm &amp; Voss]]. She was [[Keel|laid down]] at their shipyard in [[Hamburg]] on 30 May 1935 as yard number B504, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 September 1936 and completed on 31 May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; She was commissioned under the command of ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' [[Rolf Johannesson]], later promoted to ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]'', who commanded her until January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Dörr, pp. 284–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 3rd Destroyer Division.&lt;!-- On 23–24 March 1939, ''Friedrich Ihn'' was one of the destroyers escorting [[Adolf Hitler]] aboard the [[pocket battleship]] {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} as the Germans [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|occupied Memel]].&lt;ref name=ks7&gt;Koop &amp; Schmolke, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--That is correct but not relevant to ''Erich Steinbrinck'' or is it?--&gt; She participated in the Spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

When World War II began, ''Erich Steinbrinck'' was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the [[Polish Navy]] and to enforce a [[blockade]] of Poland,&lt;ref name=ks7&gt;Koop &amp; Schmolke, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; but she was soon transferred to the [[German Bight]] where she joined her [[sister ship]]s in laying defensive minefields.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She also patrolled the [[Skagerrak]] to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October.&lt;ref name=ks7/&gt; On the night of 18/19 November, ''Steinbrinck'' was [[Commander]] (''Fregattenkapitän'') [[Erich Bey]]'s flagship for an offensive minelaying mission off the British coast when she led her [[sister ship]]s [[German destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt|''Friedrich Eckoldt'']] and [[German destroyer Z10 Hans Lody|''Hans Lody'']]&lt;ref name=w6&gt;Whitley, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Humber Estuary]] that claimed seven ships of {{GRT|38710|disp=long}}, including the Polish [[ocean liner]] {{MS|Piłsudski||14}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hervieux, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 12/13 December, German destroyers [[sortie]]d to lay minefields off the British coast. Under the command of Commodore (''[[Kommodore]]'') [[Friedrich Bonte]]&lt;ref&gt;Hervieux, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[flagship]] [[German destroyer Z19 Hermann Künne|''Hermann Künne'']], ''Steinbrinck'', [[German destroyer Z8 Bruno Heinemann|''Bruno Heinemann'']], [[German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen|''Richard Beitzen'']], and [[German destroyer Z14 Friedrich Ihn|''Friedrich Ihn'']] laid 240 mines off the mouth of the [[River Tyne]], where the navigation lights were still lit.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost eleven ships totaling 18,979 GRT.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Rohwer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyers were later ordered to escort the crippled [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Nürnberg||2}} which had been torpedoed by the submarine {{HMS|Salmon|N65|6}} while covering the destroyers' withdrawal. ''Ihn'' and ''Steinbrinck'' had machinery problems en route and were forced to return to port before they reached the cruisers. ''Steinbrinck'' and her sisters [[German destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt|''Friedrich Eckoldt'']] and ''Ihn'' sortied again on the night of 18 December, but the British had turned off the navigation lights off [[Orfordness]] and the German were forced to abandon the attempt because they could not locate themselves precisely enough to lay the minefield in the proper position.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940–41===
Another minefield of 170 [[magnetic mine]]s was laid by ''Steinbrinck'', ''Ihn'' and ''Eckoldt'' on the night of 6–7 January 1940 off the [[Thames Estuary]]. The destroyer {{HMS|Grenville|H03|6}} and six merchant ships totalling 21,617 GRT were lost to this minefield as well and another ship was damaged as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was under repairs during [[Operation Weserübung]] in April and did not leave the dockyard until May when she began [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]] as part of the [[5th Destroyer Flotilla (Kriegmarine)|5th Destroyer Flotilla]]. Her work up was cut short to escort the [[battleship]]s {{Ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{Ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, as well as the [[heavy cruiser]] {{Ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} participating in [[Operation Juno]], a planned attack on [[Harstad]], Norway, to relieve pressure on the German garrison at [[Narvik]]. The ships sortied on 8 June and sank the [[troop transport]] {{HMS|Orama|1924|2}}, the [[oil tanker]] {{MV|Oil Pioneer||2}} and the [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]] [[Naval trawler|trawler]] {{HMT|Juniper|T123|2}} en route. The German commander, [[Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Marschall]], then ordered the ''Admiral Hipper'' and all four destroyers to [[Trondheim]] because of the heavy weather, where they arrived in the morning of 9 June. The two battleships continued the sortie and sank the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glorious||2}} and her two escorting destroyers, although ''Scharnhorst'' was badly damaged by a torpedo from the destroyer {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} in the engagement. The battleship was escorted home by the destroyers ''Steinbrinck'', ''Lody'' and [[German destroyer Z7 Hermann Schoemann|''Hermann Schoemann'']] for repairs. ''Steinbrinck'' and ''Lody'' then returned to Trondheim to escort ''Gneisenau'' home, after she been torpedoed by a British submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 26; Whitley, pp. 105–06&lt;/ref&gt;

The flotilla laid defensive minefields in the North Sea in August and early September before it was transferred to the Atlantic Coast of France in mid-September. Now based at [[Brest, France|Brest]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; the flotilla laid a minefield in [[Falmouth Bay]] during the night of 28/29 September. Five ships totalling only 2,026 GRT were sunk by this minefield.&lt;ref&gt;Hervieux, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] (''Kapitän zur See'') [[Erich Bey]], ''Steinbrinck'' and four other destroyers sortied for the [[Southwest Approaches]] on 17 October and were intercepted by a British force of two light cruisers and five destroyers. The British opened fire at extreme range and were forced to disengage in the face of long-range torpedo [[Volley fire (infantry tactic)|volleys]] and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers without having hit any of the German ships. ''Steinbrinck'' returned home on 7 November for a refit in [[Stettin]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 107–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Her refit was completed in late January 1941, but she was trapped by thick ice so that she could not reach [[Gotenhafen]] to work up until mid-February.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; ''Steinbrinck'' returned to France in April where she was based at [[La Pallice]]. There she was primarily occupied with escorting returning commerce raiders, warships and supply ships through the [[Bay of Biscay]] to bases in France. These included the raider [[German auxiliary cruiser Thor|''Thor'']] on 22 April, the supply ship ''Nordland'', and the [[fleet oiler]] ''Ermland'' in late May. The heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} was escorted to Brest in early June after separating from the [[battleship]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} during [[Operation Rheinübung]]. By the late summer, ''Steinbrinck'' was well overdue for a refit and was suffering from boiler problems but her refit was postponed to allow her to escort the raider [[German auxiliary cruiser Orion|''Orion'']] on 21 August. Her departure was delayed when she [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] at the beginning of the next month and she did not depart for Germany until 6 September.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 115–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===1942–43===
''Steinbrinck'' only briefly operated in northern Norway where she participated in  [[Operation Wunderland]] in August, where she and her sisters ''Eckoldt'' and ''Beitzen'' escorted the pocket battleship {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} at the beginning and end of its mission to attack Soviet shipping in the [[Kara Sea]]. They also escorted the [[minelayer]] {{ship|German minelayer|Ulm||2}} as it departed to lay a minefield off [[Cape Zhelaniya]] in mid-August. ''Steinbrinck'' ran aground at the beginning of September and was sent home after temporary repairs were made at Trondheim. The ship returned to Norway in January 1943 where she was slightly damaged by a practice torpedo fired by the submarine {{GS|U-703||2}}. In early March she escorted ''Scharnhorst'' through the Skaggerak to Trondheim in heavy weather that washed two men overboard. By mid-month, ''Steinbrinck'' was the flagship of Captain (''[[Kapitän zur See]]''), commander of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 142, 164–65&lt;/ref&gt;

In September the ship participated in [[Operation Zitronella]], ferrying troops of the [[349th Grenadier Regiment]] to destroy Norwegian facilities on the island of [[Spitzbergen]], together with the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} and ''Scharnhorst'', escorted by eight other destroyers. After unloading her troops, she bombarded targets on the island until her [[fire main]] broke from the shock of shooting and partially flooded one of her compartments. While successful, the operation was primarily intended to boost the morale of the ships stationed in the Arctic when fuel shortages limited their activities and the Allies reestablished the bases five weeks later. ''Steinbrinck'' and two other destroyers escorted the pocket battleship {{ship|German cruiser|Lützow||2}} back to Germany in September and returned to Narvik. On 25 November she was ordered to return to Germany for an [[wikt:overhaul|overhaul]], but accidentally collided with a small Norwegian steamer en route later that night. The collision severely damaged her bow and she had to sail slowly to Trondheim for emergency repairs lest the forward [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] collapse. The ship then received temporary repairs in Oslo before departing for Germany on 18 December.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 167–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===1944–45===
After her refit was completed on 18 January 1944, ''Steinbrinck'' and her sister [[German destroyer Z6 Theodor Riedel|''Theodor Riedel'']] spent the first half of the year laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. On 3 May the ship passed through the [[Kiel Canal]] en route to Hamburg for a lengthy refit. While in the dockyard, she was struck by a bomb in the [[diesel generator]] room on 18 June. Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside ''Steinbrinck'' and caused extensive flooding and shock damage from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to [[Wesermünde]] for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a single engine was operable and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to [[Cuxhaven]]. She was still there in May when the Germans surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===
The ship was moved to [[Wilhelmshaven]] over the summer under British control while the division of the surviving warships was decided among the victorious Allies. While this was being argued the ships were overhauled with a small maintenance crew aboard to preserve their value. The [[Allied Tripartite Commission]] allocated ''Steinbrinck'' to the [[Soviet Union]] at the end of 1945 and she sailed for [[Liepāja|Libau]] on 2 January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 191–92, 198, 205&lt;/ref&gt;
She was commissioned into the [[Soviet Navy]] under the name ''Pylky'' ({{lang-ru|Пылкий}}) and assigned to the Soviet 4th Fleet, based at [[Rostock]], through 1948.  Renamed ''PK3-2'', she served as a [[barracks ship]] until 19 February 1958, when she was struck from the list. On 18 April 1958, she was sold for scrap and [[ship breaking|broken up]] afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=S.V.|last=Patjanin|title=Эсминцы типа ''Леберехт Мааcс''.
