This page needs to be moved to [[Mikoyan]], to reflect the name that the bureau has had for decades. [[User:N328KF|Joseph/N328KF]] [[User talk:N328KF|(Talk)]] 17:48, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

*'''support''' --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 23:04, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
*'''no''' -- the bureau name was '''OKB-155'''. Period. '''MiG''' (which is short for '''M'''ikoyan-'''i'''-'''G'''urevich, where '''i''' is &quot;and&quot; in russian) is the name prefix for aircraft designed by the OKB and entered service.

=== Discussion ===

I won't edit this page, since i'm not in the &quot;maintenance&quot; team, but please note that parallel between fictional MiG-31 Firefox and real world MiG-31 Foxhound is flawed. MiG-31's radar set is not NATO designated &quot;Fox Fire&quot;, it's designated &quot;Flash Dance&quot;. MiG-25's radar set is &quot;Fox Fire&quot;. 
[[User:Zb10948|Zb10948]] 06:48, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

&quot;No&quot; to what? &quot;No,&quot; as in you want it to stay Mikoyan-Gurevich, &quot;no,&quot; as in you want it to be OKB-155, or &quot;no,&quot; as in you're being obstinant? [[User:N328KF|Joseph/N328KF]] [[User talk:N328KF|(Talk)]] 13:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

: &quot;No&quot; to move to mere [[Mikoyan]]. Names like '''Mikoyan-Gurevich''', '''MiG''' (the current company name is '''RSK MiG'''), and '''OKB-155''' have some meaning while simple Mikoyan is a source of possible mess (his brother was a famous politician is exUSSR, for instance).--[[User:Jno|jno]] 12:02, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:: [[Mikoyan-Gurevich]] is inaccurate, '''MiG''' is inconsistent with the naming of other OKBs, same with '''OKB-155'''. I think '''Mikoyan''' is the best choice, but if we have to, we can call it '''Mikoyan (company)''' or '''Mikoyan (design bureau)''' or something olike that. [[User:N328KF|Joseph/N328KF]] [[User talk:N328KF|(Talk)]] 14:44, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
::: Sorry, folks. I don't understand why is it &quot;inaccurate&quot; and/or &quot;inconsistent&quot;. I'm a russian fun of aviation history and dont know of western naming traditions. All the &quot;proper&quot; (not too popular) russian-language books refer to '''any''' design bureau or production facility by their &quot;numbers&quot;, except of some R&amp;amp;D institutions (&quot;NII&quot;s). Yes, Gurevich is mostly known for his missiles as the head of OKB-155-2. But his name was and is the part of OKB name. I believe, it's a sort of &quot;popular vs scientific&quot; (of &quot;physics vs lyrics&quot;, if you want ;-) discussion. --[[User:Jno|jno]] 09:45, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
::::It's ''inaccurate'' because the company/design bureau is '''officially''' named &quot;Mikoyan,&quot; and has been so named for ''thirty-three years''. The ''inconsistency'' would be in that we don't name the article for [[Sukhoi]] &quot;Su&quot;, and we don't name the article for [[Ilyushin]] &quot;Il.&quot; [[User:N328KF|Joseph/N328KF]] [[User talk:N328KF|(Talk)]] 16:41, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

:::::Yes, it '''was''' named after Mikoyan. Just because Artem Ivanovich dead ''before'' Mikhael Iosifovich. Not 33 years, but long enough. Hence, you have all rights to rename. --[[User:Jno|jno]] 07:57, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

== MiG-29 Fulcrum comparable to F-15? ==

This looks like a major flop to me. The MiG-29 Fulcrum wasn't intended as a BVR fighter or interceptor, and definitely isn't comparable to either the F-15 Eagle or the F-18 Hornet. Going by role, the Fulcrum is a modern-era dogfighter, comparable to the F-16 Falcon, and the article should really reflect that, unless the comparison was based on shape only (twin vertical stabilizers and dual engines), but that's usually the less important part. However, I will not edit the article until someone can prove or disprove this. [[User:Stealth HR|Stealth]] 08:26, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
:You are right. But I'll avoid to edit as well - my level of english does not allow me to engage folks into a real flame. Hence, we have to wait for a real english-speaker to edit this. ;-) --[[User:Jno|jno]] 09:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

::The MiG-29 is generally considered comparable to the F-16 and F/A-18 (which are comparable to each other); it is not comparable to the F-15. [[User:Askari Mark|Askari Mark]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Askari Mark|(Talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:54, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

==Mig-13==
The mig-13 page directs here [[Mikoyan-Gurevich I-250 (N)|MiG I-250 (N)]]. The page states that the I-250 never entered service and never passed its trials, which, I would argue, put it into the experimental section. [[User:Crocodilicus|Crocodilicus]] 22:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

==in video games==
MiGs appear in computer games like command and conquer generals, and red alert 2 yuri's revenge so shouldn't that be added as well?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.12.199.43|74.12.199.43]] ([[User talk:74.12.199.43|talk]]) 01:17, 5 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:That should be added to the article of the aircraft that appears, but please only insert notable video game references. [[User:JetLover|JetLover]] ([[User talk:JetLover|talk]]) ([[User:JetLover/False reverts|Report a mistake]]) 01:26, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

== Meaning of &quot;MIG&quot; ==

I don't know if it was intentioned when it was created (although it must have been semi-intentioned, at least), but perhaps it would be good to mention that ''миг (mig)'' in Russian means &quot;moment, instant, blink&quot;, suggesting the speed (the association certainly doesn't escape the Russian ear). [[Special:Contributions/62.176.111.68|62.176.111.68]] ([[User talk:62.176.111.68|talk]]) 10:11, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

== Korean Use ==

The beginning of the article states that MiGs were (or are) used by South Korea.  I think it should probably be North Korea, but I'm not an expert. -[[User:Athaler|Athaler]] ([[User talk:Athaler|talk]]) 22:44, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

They were the one of the primaray fighters for North Korea during the Korean war. So yes they should be. [[Special:Contributions/168.212.190.2|168.212.190.2]] ([[User talk:168.212.190.2|talk]]) 15:51, 7 September 2012 (UTC)

== OKB short form name ==

Is the abbreviation &quot;MiG&quot; short for &quot;Mikoyan i Gurevich (Mikoyan and Gurevich)&quot; or is it derived from &quot;MIkoyan-Gurevich?&quot; I've always understood it to be the former. This may seem like a trivial matter but I want to clarify it for inclusion in my dissertation.

[[:Mikoyan]] → {{no redirect|MiG}} – Per [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aviation#Mikoyan-Gurevich]], pertinent to all other pages that use Mikoyan instead of Mikoyan-Gurevich. [[User:Brandmeister|Brandmeister]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Brandmeister|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;   19:01, 25 February 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support in part''': Move the company's primary article but take the aircraft pages case by case. A year after our 2005 article move to &quot;Mikoyan,&quot; the company changed its name to &quot;Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG&quot;. The first bit, the &quot;Russian Aircraft Corporation,&quot; is more of a formal status than a name, similar to the British &quot;plc&quot; or the American &quot;Corporation&quot;. [[WP:COMMONNAME]] requires that for the current company we use the name commonly adopted by the more recent reliable sources. This is &quot;MiG.&quot; As for the other pages, many of these are for aircraft types which were created under the &quot;Mikoyan&quot; name and these should remain so. Only types created since 2006 should be moved to &quot;MiG.&quot; For new variants of older types, we need to follow what the RS do. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 10:29, 4 March 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Over the history of the company, &quot;Mikoyan&quot; is the [[WP:COMMONNAME|most common phraseology]]; &quot;MiG&quot; is ambiguous ([[MIG welding]], for instance). - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 23:00, 4 March 2014 (UTC)
::We already have a [[mig]] disambig page to help those people who cannot tell &quot;MiG&quot; from &quot;MIG&quot; - or from a load of other things. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 10:18, 5 March 2014 (UTC)
::And that PoV assertion that &quot;Mikoyan&quot; is historically commonest appears false. Formally the company began as &quot;Mikoyan-Gurevich&quot; then, when Gurevich died, &quot;Mikoyan&quot; and since 2006, &quot;MiG.&quot; Meanwhile the &quot;MiG&quot; aircraft type designation has remained in use throughout and everybody has always commonly referred to &quot;MiGs&quot;. Google counts about 7,440,000 for &quot;MiG aircraft&quot; but only 1,190,000 for &quot;Mikoyan Aircraft.&quot; Sure &quot;Mikoyan&quot; ''was'' common during the Mikoyan era, but that was then and this is now.&amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 15:06, 5 March 2014 (UTC) [Update] In case it hels establish that I have no PoV to grind, I certainly think that a number of entries in the [[List of aircraft (M)]] need renaming from Mikoyan-Gurevich to Mikoyan. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 15:11, 5 March 2014 (UTC)
