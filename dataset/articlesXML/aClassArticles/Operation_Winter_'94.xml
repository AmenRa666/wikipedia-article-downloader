'''Operation Winter '94''' ({{lang-hr|Operacija Zima '94}}) was a joint military offensive of the [[Croatian Army]] (HV) and the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) fought in southwestern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] between 29 November and 24 December 1994. The operation formed part of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] and the [[Bosnian War]] fought between Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Croatia]] and two unrecognized para-states proclaimed by [[Croatian Serbs]] and [[Bosnian Serbs]]. Both para-states were supported by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]. The JNA pulled out in 1992, but transferred much of its equipment to the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb forces as it withdrew.

Operation Winter '94 was the first in a series of successful advances made by the HV and the HVO in or near the [[Livanjsko field]], an elongated flat-bottomed valley surrounded by hills. The region was formally controlled by the HVO, but the HV contributed a substantial force, including commanding officers. The attacks were primarily designed to draw the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) away from the [[Siege of Bihać|besieged city of Bihać]]. The secondary objective was threatening the single direct supply route between [[Drvar]] in the Bosnian Serb [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Knin]], the capital of the Croatian Serb [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK).

Operation Winter '94 pushed back the front line of the VRS by about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}}, capturing much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces within striking distance of the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;1 (''Operacija Skok&amp;nbsp;1'') on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on [[Dinara|Mount Dinara]] on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten [[Bosansko Grahovo]] on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a springboard for further offensive action on this front during [[Operation Summer&amp;nbsp;'95]].

Following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions grew. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' – JNA) confiscated Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] (''Teritorijalna obrana'') weapons to minimize resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] by [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]],&lt;ref name=Hoare118&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around [[Knin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[eastern Croatia]].&lt;ref name=MarticICTY&gt;{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by two unsuccessful attempts by [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]], supported by [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Serbia's provinces of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]] to obtain the [[Yugoslav Presidency]]'s approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991–95|Croatian special police]] in March,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|pp=384–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; the JNA, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency declare a [[state of emergency]] and grant the JNA wartime powers. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under control of Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Milošević, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than preservation of Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency.&lt;ref name=Hoare119&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of March, the conflict had escalated into the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents and preventing [[Law enforcement in Croatia|Croatian police]] from intervening.&lt;ref name=Hoare119/&gt; In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the [[Croatian National Guard]] (''Zbor narodne garde'' – ZNG),&lt;ref name=EECIS272&gt;{{harvnb|EECIS|1999|pp=272–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its development was hampered by a [[United Nations]] (UN) [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 713|arms embargo]] introduced in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Independent|10 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Narodne novine|8 October 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (''Hrvatska vojska'' - HV).&lt;ref name=EECIS272/&gt; Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the Croatian War of Independence, culminating in the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bjelajac|Žunec|2009|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Battle of Vukovar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|18 November 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] then began in the RSK, and most non-Serbs were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Department of State|31 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNCHR&gt;{{harvnb|ECOSOC|17 November 1993|loc=Section J, points 147 &amp; 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1992, an agreement to implement the [[Vance plan|peace plan]] negotiated by UN special envoy [[Cyrus Vance]] was signed by Croatia, the JNA and the UN.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) deployed to maintain the ceasefire,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Los Angeles Times|29 January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the JNA was scheduled to retreat to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where further conflict was anticipated.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire&quot;/&gt; Despite the peace arrangement requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, it remained on Croatian territory for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually withdrew, the JNA left its equipment to the [[Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina]] (ARSK).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armatta|2010|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The January ceasefire also allowed the JNA to maintain its positions in East and West [[Slavonia]] that were on the brink of military collapse following a [[Operation Orkan 91|Croatian counteroffensive]], which reclaimed 60% of the JNA-held territory in West Slavonia by the time the ceasefire went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Serbia continued to support the RSK.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2012|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HV restored small areas around Dubrovnik to Croatian control&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|15 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during [[Operation Maslenica]] it recaptured some areas of Lika and northern Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|24 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian population centres continued to be intermittently targeted by artillery, missiles and air raids throughout the war.&lt;ref name=MarticICTY/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ECOSOC|17 November 1993|loc=Section K, point 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|13 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Seattle Times|16 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The New York Times|17 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 1992, a Bosnian Serb state was declared, ahead of the 29 February{{spaced ndash}}1 March referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina{{mdash}}later cited as a pretext for the [[Bosnian War]]).&lt;ref name=Ramet382&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bosnian Serb state was later renamed [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref name=Ramet428&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the JNA withdrew from Croatia it started to transform into a Bosnian Serb army,&lt;ref name=Ramet382/&gt; handing over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops. The process was completed in May, when the Bosnian Serb army became the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (''Vojska Republike Srpske'' – VRS).&lt;ref name=Ramet429&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was faced by the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO), established in April,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eriksson|Kostić|2013|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bosnia and Herzegovina TO{{mdash}}renamed the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine'' – ARBiH) in May.&lt;ref name=Ramet429/&gt; Formal establishment of these forces was preceded by the first armed clashes in the country as the Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in [[Sarajevo]] and elsewhere on 1&amp;nbsp;March and the situation rapidly escalated. Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling [[Bosanski Brod]] by the end of March,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sarajevo was first shelled on 4&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref name=Ramet428/&gt; By the end of 1992, the VRS held 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;ref name=Ramet433&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a large-scale campaign of conquest and ethnic cleansing backed by military and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=Bieber&gt;{{harvnb|Bieber|2010|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bosnian War gradually evolved into a three-sided conflict. The initial [[Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia|ARBiH–HVO alliance]] soon deteriorated as the forces became rivals for control of parts of the country. Ethnic tensions escalated from apparently insignificant harassment in July,&lt;ref name=Ramet429/&gt; to an open [[Croat–Bosniak War]] by October 1992.&lt;ref name=Ramet433/&gt; The [[Bosnian Croat]] authorities, organized in the [[Herzeg-Bosnia]] territory, were intent on attaching the region to Croatia.&lt;ref name=Bieber/&gt; This was incompatible with Bosniak aspirations for a unitary state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burg|Shoup|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
In November 1994, the [[Siege of Bihać]] entered a critical stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town from the Bosniak-dominated ARBiH. [[Bihać]] was seen as a strategic area by the international community. It was thought that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war, widening the division between the United States on one side and France and the United Kingdom on the other (advocating different approaches to the area's preservation),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Independent|27 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and feared that Bihać would become the worst humanitarian disaster of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|pp=284–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, denying Bihać to the Serbs was strategically important to Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodge|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigadier General [[Krešimir Ćosić (politician)|Krešimir Ćosić]] expected the VRS and the ARSK would threaten Karlovac and Sisak once they captured Bihać, while Chief of Croatia's General Staff General [[Janko Bobetko]] believed the fall of Bihać would represent an end to Croatia's war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;JL-Winter&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jutarnji list|9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a US military strategy endorsed by President [[Bill Clinton]] in February 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|2010|p=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Washington Agreement]] was signed in March 1994. This ended the Croat–Bosniak War,&lt;ref name=&quot;JL-Winter&quot;/&gt; abolished Herzeg-Bosnia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jutarnji list|16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and forged the ARBiH–HVO alliance against the VRS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet 2006 439&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a series of meetings between US and Croatian officials were held in [[Zagreb]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;JL-Winter&quot;/&gt; In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bono|2003|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet 2006 439&quot;/&gt; In a meeting held on 29 November 1994, Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb-held territory from [[Livno]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina to draw off part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent its capture by the Serbs. U.S. officials made no response to the proposal. Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 was ordered the same day; it was to be carried out by the HV and the HVO{{mdash}}the main military forces of the Bosnian Croats.&lt;ref name=&quot;JL-Winter&quot;/&gt;

Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 became feasible after the HVO captured [[Kupres]] (north of the [[Livanjsko field]]) in [[Operation Cincar]] on 3 November 1994, securing the right flank of the planned advance northwest of Livno. The HVO and the ARBiH advanced towards Kupres, in the first military effort coordinated between them since the Washington Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|loc=note 227/V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order of battle==
The HV deployed up to 9,000 troops on rotation through the area during the Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94, keeping approximately 3,000–4,000 troops on the ground at any time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|loc=note 304/V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the HVO fielded an additional 2,000–3,000.

Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 began on 29 November 1994 in heavy snow and temperatures of {{convert|-20|C|abbr=off}}. One hundred and thirty soldiers from the HV&amp;nbsp;126th Home Guard Regiment commanded by Brigadier [[Ante Kotromanović]] infiltrated behind VRS positions on the left flank of the front line&lt;ref name=SD301111/&gt; (head of the initial north-west advance along the Livanjsko field and [[Dinara|Mount Dinara]], with most of the HV troops commanded by Gotovina&lt;ref name=BB250251&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=250–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the VRS 9th&amp;nbsp;Light Infantry Brigade. By 3 December, the advance gained {{convert|4|to|5|km|abbr=off}} around [[Donji Rujani]], followed by a brief stabilization of the newly established line of contact.&lt;ref name=RSK94&gt;{{harvnb|RSK|23 December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advance was resumed on 6 December as the HV 4th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade and the 126th&amp;nbsp;Home Guard Regiment gradually pushing back the VRS 9th&amp;nbsp;Light Infantry Brigade towards Bosansko Grahovo.&lt;ref name=RSK94/&gt; In more than a week of gradual advance, the force penetrated the VRS defences by {{convert|10|to|12|km|abbr=off}} in the general direction of Bosansko Grahovo. The HVO units on the right flank of the attack made little progress towards [[Glamoč]], and were faced with a determined VRS defence.&lt;ref name=BB250251/&gt; By 11 December, the VRS 9th Light Infantry Brigade had sustained losses sufficient to demoralize the unit, further complicating the battlefield situation for the VRS as the civilian population began to leave Glamoč. The civilian evacuation was nearly complete by 16 December; on that day valuables were removed from churches and monasteries in the VRS-held territory near the front line, although there was no immediate threat to them. On 23 December, the Croatian forces reached [[Crni Lug (Bosansko Grahovo)|Crni Lug]] at the northwest rim of the Livanjsko field, forcing the VRS 9th Light Infantry Brigade to withdraw to more defensible positions.&lt;ref name=RSK94/&gt; On 24 December, the VRS withdrawal was complete and the operation ended.&lt;ref name=BB251&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the reversals they had suffered, the VRS brought two brigades and two battalions from the 1st Krajina Corps, the Herzegovina Corps and the East Bosnian Corps to secure its defences in the Glamoč and Bosansko Grahovo areas and encourage civilians to return.&lt;ref name=Marijan47&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a month of fighting, the Croatian forces had advanced by about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} and had captured approximately {{convert|200|km2|abbr=off}} of territory northwest of Livno.&lt;ref name=BB251/&gt; The VRS had been pushed back to a line approximately {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} south-east of Bosansko Grahovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HV and the HVO sustained losses of 29 killed, 19 seriously wounded and 39 slightly injured troops. Three soldiers were captured by the VRS, but they were later released in a prisoner-of-war exchange.&lt;ref name=SD301111/&gt; In a report following Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94, the VRS 2nd&amp;nbsp;Krajina Corps reported serious manpower shortages and 20% casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the operation, ARSK deployed to Glamoč and Bosansko Grahovo area to assist the VRS in continued skirmishes against the Croatian forces in the area. Croatian troops retained most of the ground, representing a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Salient|salient]] to the north-west of Livno, gained during the winter offensive.&lt;ref name=BB295&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lull in fighting continued until mid-March 1995.&lt;ref name=BB296&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;1 (also known as Operation Jump&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;ref name=MORH17&gt;{{harvnb|MORH|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Operacija Skok&amp;nbsp;1'') was designed to widen the salient and allow the Croatian forces to advance towards Bosansko Grahovo.&lt;ref name=BB295296&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; By spring 1995, relatively small shifts of the line of control west of the Livanjsko field enabled the VRS and the ARSK to threaten the HV positions on Dinara and [[Staretina]] mountains.&lt;ref name=Marijan4748&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gotovina was concerned that the salient established by the HV and the HVO in Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 was too small and was vulnerable to counterattacks by the VRS and the ARSK.&lt;ref name=BB295296/&gt; To create the necessary preconditions for the upcoming push, elements of the HV [[4th Guards Brigade (Croatia)|4th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade]] and the 126th&amp;nbsp;Home Guard Regiment advanced approximately {{convert|4|km|abbr=off}} over Dinara. The 4th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade captured the strategic {{convert|1831|m|adj=on}} Presedla and {{convert|1777|m|adj=on}} Jankovo Brdo peaks on 14–18 March; the 126th&amp;nbsp;Home Guards Regiment protected its flank, advancing through areas around the  Croatia–Bosnia and Herzegovina border that were previously controlled by the ARSK.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB296&quot;/&gt;

Gotovina defined several objectives for Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;1: the capture of more favourable positions, allowing the approach to ARSK-held positions around [[Kijevo, Croatia|Kijevo]]{{mdash}}where a strategic mountain pass is located, and [[Cetina, Croatia|Cetina]] west of Dinara{{mdash}}where ARSK artillery positions were located; securing the left flank of the force on Dinara; preventing ARSK attacks from that direction, and regaining positions lost during the winter of 1994–1995. The operation was scheduled to allow a HV advance in two steps of {{convert|4|km|abbr=off}} each, over a period of one to two days.&lt;ref name=BB296/&gt;

Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;1 took place on 7 April 1995. The HV [[7th Guards Brigade (Croatia)|7th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade]] relieved the 4th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade and advanced for about {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}}, pushing the VRS defences along a {{convert|15|km|abbr=off|adj=on}}-wide front line and capturing approximately {{convert|75|km2|abbr=off}} of territory.&lt;ref name=BB296/&gt; This one-day operation moved the front line{{mdash}}from which the VRS 9th&amp;nbsp;Light Infantry Brigade had intermittently mounted attacks during the previous three months{{mdash}}north-west,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|loc=note 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put the HV within easy reach of [[Uništa (Bosansko Grahovo)|Uništa]]{{mdash}}one of the few passes over Dinara.&lt;ref name=Marijan4748/&gt; A secondary objective of the operation was also achieved; the salient created during Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 was extended towards Bosansko Grahovo and stabilized. The 126th&amp;nbsp;Home Guard Regiment protected the left flank of the 7th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade axis of advance, engaging in several skirmishes.&lt;ref name=BB296/&gt;

Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;2, or Operation Jump&amp;nbsp;2&lt;ref name=MORH17/&gt; (''Operacija Skok&amp;nbsp;2'') was a joint operation of the HV and the HVO aimed primarily at capturing the main mountain pass out of the Livanjsko field on the Livno-Bosansko Grahovo road, and the high ground overlooking Glamoč, to give the Croatian forces good positions from which to advance further into VRS-held territory. It was thought that the attack might also force the VRS to withdraw some of its forces that had been [[Battle of Orašje|attacking the Orašje pocket]] since May. Gotovina planned a two-stage, two-pronged advance towards the main objectives and an auxiliary attack on ARSK-held territory south-west of the salient. In the first stage of the operation, the attacking forces were tasked with capturing the village of Crni Lug and the southern part of the pass,&lt;ref name=BB299&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second stage was planned to capture the {{convert|1872|m|adj=on}} [[Šator|Mount Šator]] and the Crvena Zemlja ridge to the north,&lt;ref name=Marijan4849&gt;{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; blocking the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road and making Glamoč difficult to resupply.&lt;ref name=BB299/&gt;

The Croatian forces fielded approximately 5,000&amp;nbsp;troops, spearheaded by the HV 4th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade&lt;ref name=BB299/&gt; and supported by the [[1st Croatian Guards Brigade|1st&amp;nbsp;Croatian Guards Brigade]] (''1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug'' - HGZ), the 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion of the [[1st Guards Brigade (Croatia)|1st&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade]], the 3rd&amp;nbsp;Battalion of the 126th&amp;nbsp;Home Guard Regiment of the HV, the HVO 3rd&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade and the Bosnian Croat special police.&lt;ref name=Marijan4849/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBN94&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|loc=note 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing forces comprised approximately 3,000&amp;nbsp;troops in three light infantry brigades of the VRS 2nd&amp;nbsp;Krajina Corps and a 500-strong ARSK composite ''Vijuga'' [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]], assembled by the ARSK 7th&amp;nbsp;North Dalmatian Corps.&lt;ref name=BB300&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vijuga'' battlegroup was deployed with elements of the ARSK 1st Light Infantry Brigade in the Croatia-Bosnia and Herzegovina border zone on Dinara. The VRS formations consisted of the 3rd&amp;nbsp;and the 9th&amp;nbsp;Light Infantry Brigades in the Bosansko Grahovo area and the 5th&amp;nbsp;Light Infantry Brigade in the Glamoč zone. The reinforcements that had been sent to the area in the aftermath of Operation Winter '94 were broken up and used to reinforce the VRS brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|loc=note 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;2 began on 4 June with the advance of the HV 4th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade. HVO troops took Crni Lug and the mountain pass en route to Bosansko Grahovo, the operation's chief objective.&lt;ref name=BB300/&gt; Its left flank, in the border area, was protected by the 3rd&amp;nbsp;Battalion of the 126th&amp;nbsp;Home Guard Regiment and the Tactical Sniper Company attached to the HV Split Corps.&lt;ref name=BBN94/&gt; The VRS counterattacked on 6–7 June, trying to roll back the 4th&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade. The VRS push failed, as did its efforts to contain the advance with close air support and [[M-87 Orkan]] rockets. On 6 June (the same day as the VRS counterattack), the second phase of Operation Leap&amp;nbsp;2 began. The 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion of the 1st&amp;nbsp;Guards Brigade supported by the HV 264th Reconnaissance Sabotage Company and elements of the HV 1st HGZ advanced north from Livno, capturing the high ground near Glamoč and blocking the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road by 10 June.&lt;ref name=BB300/&gt; To pin down the VRS on the right flank of the attack, the HVO 2nd Guards Brigade attacked VRS positions on Golija Mountain south-west of Glamoč.&lt;ref name=BBN94/&gt;

Operations Leap&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;2 improved the positions of the Croatian forces east and west of the Livanjsko field, and brought Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč within striking distance. The advance secured the valley, threatened Glamoč and brought the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road, the Cetina valley and the [[Vrlika]] field within Croatian artillery range.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian forces sustained losses of 4 killed, 15 seriously wounded and 19 slightly injured during Operations Leap&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Gotovina said that although Operations Winter&amp;nbsp;'94, Leap&amp;nbsp;1 and Leap&amp;nbsp;2 were planned and executed as three distinct operations, they represent a unified military action.&lt;ref name=BB300/&gt; Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 ostensibly failed to achieve its primary objective of relieving pressure on the Bihać pocket by drawing off VRS and ARSK forces to contain the attack; however, that was due to a decision by Chief of VRS General Staff General [[Ratko Mladić]] and not to mistakes in planning or execution. Faced with a choice between continuing with the attack on Bihać and blocking the advance from the Livanjsko field, the VRS chose not to move its forces, but Bihać was successfully defended by the [[V Corps (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|5th&amp;nbsp;Corps]] of the ARBiH.&lt;ref name=BB251/&gt; The secondary objective of Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 was achieved more easily; the Croatian forces approached the Knin-[[Drvar]] road and directly threatened the main supply route between the Republika Srpska and the RSK capital.&lt;ref name=BB251/&gt; Operations Leap&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;2 built on the achievements of Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94, threatened Bosansko Grahovo and created conditions to isolate Knin in [[Operation Summer&amp;nbsp;'95]], which was executed the following month.&lt;ref name=BB300/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=364–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advance was strategically significant;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ripley|1999|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mladić's decision not to react to Operation Winter&amp;nbsp;'94 was a gamble which ultimately cost the Republika Srpska territory extending to [[Jajce]], [[Mrkonjić Grad]] and Drvar and brought about the destruction of the RSK as the advances of the Croatian forces paved the way for [[Operation Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sekulić|2000|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
