==Reversion: Laura Secord in Fiction==
I'm not opposed to inclusion of a &quot;Laura Secord in Fiction&quot; section as such, but the Harry Turtledove reference is, at best, extremely tangential, in that the character in the novel in question happens to have the name Laura Secord and is described as a distant descendent of the original.  Interesting perhaps to fans of Harry Turtledove, but so far as encyclopedia entries go... [[User:Geoff NoNick|Geoff NoNick]] 18:36, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah, that's true, sorry. I just get an itchy rollback finger when people remove large chunks of text without an edit summary :) [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] 03:03, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

== chocolates (&quot;legacy&quot;) ==

This appears to be blatant advertising, and I propose to remove it if no-one objects. [[User:Palmiro|Palmiro]] 17:25, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
:I'd just as soon leave it in.  Laura Secord Chocolates are something of an institution and it's not unreasonable that someone might look it up trying to find out more. [[User:Geoff NoNick|Geoff NoNick]] 17:32, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
::Fair enough, if you're convinced. [[User:Palmiro|Palmiro]] 17:35, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
:::I disagree strongly, Laura Secord is not, and never has been an &quot;institution&quot;. There's no historical relevance. Do all Wikipedia articles include references to corporations that use a name. Think about it... there is precidence to be considered.

:Most Canadians, when they hear the name Laura Secord, think chocolate. Avoiding commercialism is one thing, denying that commercial institutions exist is another. --22:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

I was going to wiki-link &quot;Laura Secord Chocolates&quot; in this reference, but noticed that that page redirects here. While it's fine making a brief mention of a company named after her, it doesn't make sense for that company to redirect here, since it really doesn't have anything to do with her. --[[User:Q Canuck|Q Canuck]] 00:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Good Website ==

I really Like this website.It has good information and is exactly what i needed for my mid-term project on Laura Secord. Thanks to all who helped make this biography.

                                         With Great Appreciation,
                                                           Niru''

== UE? ==

Whether or not descendents of Loyalists refer to themselves as UE, I don't know, but what possible justification can there be for referring to Secord that way? She herself would obviously not have used UE, and I have never seen anyone else use with her name either. It sounds not only dubious but also ridiculous. [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop, BA, MA, VC, GCVO, SGM, QHDS]] 15:50, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
:Well, the use of post-nominals in general is (as you illustrated) silly, but UE is a recognized one that was prevalent at the time of her life.  Whether or not she used it (and she probably didn't), she can be regarding in many ways as the archetypal '''UE'''.  Given her place in Canadian history and the otherwise lack of official recognition she received in her lifetime (100 pounds notwithstanding), some sort of title seems appropriate.  But I admit I haven't seen '''UE''' used with respect to Laura Secord in the past - can anyone offer other views? [[User:Geoff NoNick|Geoff NoNick]] 19:05, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Arctic.gnome]], can you explain why UE is necessary here? In what way is this a title or an official post-nominal? Are there any sources that ever use &quot;Laura Secord, UE&quot;? Who granted this title to her? When did she use it herself? When has anyone, anywhere, ever referred to his this way? [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] 06:52, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:[[Canadian_honorifics|U.E.]] is Canada's one official hereditary title, it was created as a post-nominal by [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Lord Dorchester]]'s [[Order-in-Council]] in [[1789]].  Laura's father qualified for it, and the honour is hereditary by children of either sex.  Of course we would not attach the letters to every single Loyalist descendent on the Wikipedia; however, she is famous ''because of'' her loyalty to a British Canada, and is possibly the most famous UE after politicians and generals.  I think that makes it worth adding her royally given title to her article.

::Great, but has anyone ever used this title in association with Laura, outside of Wikipedia? Did she use it? [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] 16:40, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:::I know that genealogists do, at least.  It’s the kind of thing that you only include when giving someone’s full, formal name, which rarely happens with anyone.  People don’t use her middle name when referring to her either, but we’ve included that.  The title legally applies to her, and is very relevant to who she is in history.  The Wikipedia convention is to include all titles on the first line, even if not commonly used in practice.

::::Well, Ingersoll isn't her middle name, and we shouldn't include that either. Where do genealogists use this, anyway? [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] 07:58, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
::::: I noticed that the article describes her family as not being loyalists, but when you klick on the link to her father and then onto the town of Ingersoll the story changes to him bing a loyalist. Are they loyalists? [[User:Ozdaren|Ozdaren]] 14:49, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

== Song title ==

I believe the song title is simply, &quot;Secord's Warning.&quot; I don't see where the &quot;for Love&quot; part would come in. It has nothing to do with the song to the best of my knowledge.

== Intro Paragraph ==
In the intro section it asserts that &quot;Suffering the aftermath of the American Revolution, her father, Thomas Ingersoll, moved the family to Canada in 1795...&quot;, without going into any details as to the alleged suffering. Ingersoll's own wiki page, however would lead one to believe that the move was instigated by the avilibility of cheap land in Canada. Unless anyone has a good reason not to, I would edit the intro section to conform to Ingersoll's page, as the existing version is vague and contradictory.

== Which house? ==
Under Attack it says;
Native warriors who led her the rest of the way to FitzGibbon's headquarters at the Decew house.
while in beaver dams it says DeCou house and refers to this link.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCou_House
Only one is right.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.53.102.186|70.53.102.186]] ([[User talk:70.53.102.186|talk]]) 00:24, 1 September 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:There's no absolute agreement about the proper spelling of Decou/DeCew/etc. While it'd be nice to have closure on the spelling, one can be sure that there'd be no confusion about where she was headed. Personally, I suspect that Decou is the proper spelling and is a victim of Anglicisation into Decew. However, the operative word there is &quot;suspect&quot;. [[User:Natty10000|Natty10000]] ([[User talk:Natty10000|talk]]) 22:05, 1 September 2011 (UTC)
::But changing the spelling from Decou to Decew changes the pronunciation. [[User:Varlaam|Varlaam]] ([[User talk:Varlaam|talk]]) 23:03, 9 June 2012 (UTC)
::From KOO to SYOO. Decue would be more obvious.
:::Decou is pronounced DeSoo. Decew can be properly pronounced the same way (though it can also be pronounced Deckew). Is there any confusion as to where she was taken? If not, then worrying the spelling 200 years after the fact is being a tad pedantic. [[User:Natty10000]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Natty10000|[Stop me before I edit again!]]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:34, 9 June 2012 (UTC)

::::My point was that &quot;Decou&quot; as French is KOO. A 'c' followed by an 'o' is '''never''' an 's' in French '''or in English'''. Ever.
::::The letter combination &quot;ew&quot;, I'm 99% confident, historically always came with an initial palatalization in English; it was a long 'u', so YOO. Hence DeKYOO.
::::But a hard 'c' followed by an 'e' is unnatural in English (and disallowed in French, Spanish, Italian, and so on). So that becomes DeSYOO.
::::But over the past few decades we've had a bit of a (slovenly) pronunciation shift, where we have dropped the Y in many cases.
::::When I was a kid, &quot;do&quot; and &quot;dew&quot; were distinct; now &quot;dew&quot; often merges with &quot;do&quot; (in the American? way).
::::So you arrive at DeSOO. And that pronunciation requires the spelling Decew, rather than Decou.

== Laura's sixth child (name and bithdate)? ==

&lt;s&gt;I can't find the name or birthdate of Laura's sixth child.  It doesn't seem to be in Peggy Dymond Leavey's ''Laura Secord: Heroine of the War of 1812'', which is the only book-length source I've had full access to (while I was visiting relatives).

I'm not actually residing in Canada, so I can't just pop down to the library to find this information.  I have a feeling it is likely in David Hemmings' ''Laura Ingersoll Secord: A Heroine and her Family'', which is supposed to be heavy on the genealogy.

Is their anyone out there who could help track down this info?&lt;/s&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;padding:0 .75ex;font-variant:small-caps;background-color:#fdd;&quot;&gt;[[User:Curly Turkey|&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#520;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f60;&quot;&gt;üRly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#040;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#090;&quot;&gt;üRkey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup style=&quot;margin-left:1.5ex;&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Curly Turkey|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;margin-left:-5ex;&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Curly Turkey|Contribs]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 00:08, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

:Actually, it ''was'' in Leavey's book, although with no precise birthdate.  I don't know how I could have missed it. &lt;span style=&quot;padding:0 .75ex;font-variant:small-caps;background-color:#fdd;&quot;&gt;[[User:Curly Turkey|&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#520;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f60;&quot;&gt;üRly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#040;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#090;&quot;&gt;üRkey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup style=&quot;margin-left:1.5ex;&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Curly Turkey|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;margin-left:-5ex;&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Curly Turkey|Contribs]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 01:56, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

== Works cited ==

This would be the third article I see in the past few weeks  using the &lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Refbegin|40em|indent=y}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; code/layout. I am not sure what others see but every time i see this coding I have to side scroll because of the odd format in the works cited section. Not only that but the are no bullets to separate  each book. Basically its a side scrolling undefined (not separated by line) list of books? Do others have this problem?[[User:Moxy|Moxy]] ([[User talk:Moxy|talk]]) 22:14, 22 December 2012 (UTC)
:What browser/OS are you using?  I don't see this happening in Chrome or firefox on Linux, or on the Android browser on my phone.  I've noticed you've changed this before.  Should it be taken to the {{tl|Refbegin}} talk page instead?

== Upcoming Secord stuff ==

I'm not going to add these things to the article until they cease to be &quot;coming soon&quot;, but I suppose it's no surprise that a lot of Secord Stuff is happening in 2013.  For instance:

*There will be a commemorative coin (more than one?)
*[http://www.thestar.com/life/2013/05/01/laura_secords_historic_walk_immortalized_in_wilderness_trail_and_opera.html The Laura Secord Legacy Trail] will be a reconstruction of the route Secord walked

== Draft TFA ==

Below is a draft of a [[Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests|TFA request]] for this article.

On June 22, 2013, the ''On This Day…'' section of the Main Page stated she began her walk on June 22.
