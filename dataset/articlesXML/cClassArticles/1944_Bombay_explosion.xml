The '''Bombay Explosion''' (or Bombay Docks Explosion) occurred on 14 April 1944, in the Victoria Dock of Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) when the freighter [[SS Fort Stikine|SS ''Fort Stikine'']] carrying a mixed cargo of cotton bales, gold, and ammunition including around 1,400 tons of explosives, caught fire and was destroyed in two giant blasts, scattering debris, sinking surrounding ships and setting fire to the area, killing around 800 to 1300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/explosion-on-cargo-ship-rocks-bombay-india|title=Explosion on cargo ship rocks Bombay, India - Apr 14, 1944 - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 80,000 people were made homeless&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33105898|title=Has India's contribution to WW2 been ignored? - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5tuzVvDSBSgC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=SS+Fort+Stikine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0AUPUrqWBIn7rAfxhoHgAQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=SS%20Fort%20Stikine&amp;f=false Bombay Explosion] A Corporal's War: World War II Adventures of a Royal Engineer Page 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hZjNWaIm_eUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=SS+Fort+Stikine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XwcPUt-_BMb9rAejioHYDw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=SS%20Fort%20Stikine&amp;f=false The Day It Rained Gold Bricks and a Horse Ran Headless] Bombay, Meri Jaan: Writings on Mumbai Page 138&lt;/ref&gt; and seventy-one firemen lost their lives in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Thats-how-Mumbais-fire-brigade-Rolls/articleshow/51354019.cms|title=That’s how Mumbai’s fire brigade Rolls - Mumbai Mirror -|website=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The vessel, the voyage and cargo==
[[Image:SS Fort Stikine.png|thumb|SS ''Fort Stikine'']]
The {{SS|Fort Stikine}} was a 7,142 [[gross register ton]] freighter built in 1942 in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], under a lend-lease agreement, and was named after [[Fort Stikine]], a former outpost of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] located at what is now [[Wrangell, Alaska]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Sailing from [[Birkenhead]] on 24 February via [[Gibraltar]], [[Port Said]] and [[Karachi]], she arrived at Bombay on 12 April 1944. Her cargo included 1,395 tons of explosives including 238 tons of sensitive &quot;A&quot; [[explosives]], [[torpedoe]]s, [[Naval mine|mine]]s, shells, [[munition]]s, [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter aircrafts, raw [[cotton]] bales, barrels of [[Petroleum|oil]], [[timber]], scrap [[iron]] and approximately £890,000 of [[gold bullion]] in bars in 31 crates.&lt;ref name=rocked&gt;{{cite news | last =Times News Network | first = |  title =When Bombay docks rocked | newspaper =The Times of India | pages = | year = | date =11 April 2004 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-04-11/mumbai/28331064_1_cargo-vessel-explosive-cargo-victoria-dock |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 87,000 bales of cotton and lubricating oil were loaded at Karachi and the ship's captain, Alexander James Naismith, recorded his protest about such a &quot;mixture&quot; of cargo.&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt; The transportation of cotton through sea route was inevitable for the merchants, as transporting cotton in rail from Punjab and Sindh to Bombay was banned at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ennis, John&quot;&gt;[[#Ennis, John|Ennis, John]].p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Naismith, who lost his life in the explosion, also described the cargo as &quot;just about everything that will either burn or blow up.&quot;&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt; The vessel had berthed and was still awaiting unloading on 14 April, after 48 hours of berthing.&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt;

==Incident==
[[File:Bombay-Docks-aftermath1.png|thumb|160px|Aftermath of the Bombay Explosion on 14 April 1944]]

[[File:Bombay-Docks-explosion-1.png|thumb|150px|People running for safety after the Bombay Explosion on 14 April 1944]]
In the mid-afternoon around 14:00, the crew were alerted to a fire onboard burning somewhere in the No. 2 hold. The crew, dockside fire teams and fireboats were unable to extinguish the conflagration, despite pumping over 900 tons of water into the ship, nor were they able to find the source due to the dense smoke. The water was boiling all over the ship, due to heat generated by the fire.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

At 15:50 the order to abandon ship was given, and sixteen minutes later there was a great explosion, cutting the ship in two and breaking windows over {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. This and a later second explosion were powerful enough to be recorded by seismographs at the [[Colaba Observatory]] in the city. Sensors recorded that the earth trembled at [[Shimla]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ennis, John|Ennis, John]].p.84&lt;/ref&gt; a city located at a distance of over 1700&amp;nbsp;km. The shower of burning material set fire to slums in the area. Around two square miles were set ablaze in an {{convert|800|m|yd|abbr=on}} arc around the ship. Eleven neighbouring vessels had been sunk or were sinking, and the emergency personnel at the site suffered heavy losses. Attempts to fight the fire were dealt a further blow when a second explosion from the ship swept the area at 16:34. Burning cotton bales fell from the sky on docked ships, on the dock yard, and on slum areas outside the harbour. The sound of explosions was heard as far as {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite news|last=LIFE|first=pub.by time|title=War Explodes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=bombay+harbour+explosion+1944+time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fg8n7Wg3bV&amp;sig=CahM8xVChbx-XrVwhmGFQbU4ahs&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=LIFE|date=22 May 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most developed and economically important parts of Bombay were wiped out because of the blast and resulting fire.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

===News===
The details of the explosions and losses were first reported to the outside world by Radio [[Saigon]], a Japanese-controlled radio which gave a detailed report of the incident on 15 April 1944.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last=Time magazine US|title=India: Fire in Bombay|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,796610,00.html|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Time Magazine.U.S.|date=22 May 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British-Indian wartime censorship permitted news reporters to send the reports only in the second week of May 1944.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; ''Time Magazine'' published the story as late as 22 May 1944 and still it was news to the outside world.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; A movie depicting the explosions and aftermath, made by Indian cinematographer Sudhish Ghatak, was confiscated by military officers&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt; although parts of it were shown to the public as a newsreel at a later date.&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt;

The total number of lives lost in the explosion is estimated at more than 800,  although some estimates put the figure around 1,300.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Explosion on Corgo ship rocks Bombay, India |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/explosion-on-cargo-ship-rocks-bombay-india |agency= |work= |publisher=History.com |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=15 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 500 civilians lost their lives, many of them residing in adjoining slum areas, but as it was wartime, information about the full extent of the damage was partially censored.&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt; The results of the explosion are summarised as follows:
*231 people killed were attached to various dock services including fire brigade and dock employees.&lt;ref name=navy&gt;{{cite web|last=.com|first=merchantnavyofficers|title=Explosion in Bombay|url=http://www.merchantnavyofficers.com/bomEx.html#memorial|publisher=merchantnavyofficers.com|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Of the above figure, 66 firemen were killed&lt;ref name=tribute/&gt;
*More than 500 civilians were killed&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;
*Some estimates put total deaths up to 1300&lt;ref name=history/&gt;
*More than 2500 were injured, including civilians&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;
*13 ships were lost&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; and some other ships heavily or partially damaged
*Out of above, three Royal Indian Navy ships lost&lt;ref name=&quot;aus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=On this day:1944 |url=http://www.navyhistory.org.au/category/navy-day-by-day/1944/page/3/ |archiveurl= |work= |publisher=Naval Historical Society of Australia |location= |page= |pages= |language= |format= |doi= |date= |month= |year= |archivedate= |accessdate=16 September 2012 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*31 wooden crates, each containing four gold bars, each gold bar weighing 800 Troy ounces or almost 25&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; (almost all since recovered)
*More than 50,000 tonnes of shipping destroyed and another 50,000 tonnes of shipping damaged&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;
*Loss of more than 50,000 tonnes of food grains, including rice, gave rise to blackmarketing of food grains afterwards.&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt;

==Salvage==
As part of the salvage operation, a British officer was seconded to the Indian government, to establish the pumping operation.  This was Sub-Lieutenant Ken Jackson, RNVR, who along with Chief Petty Officer Brazier arrived in Bombay on 7 May 1944. Over a period of three months many ships were salvaged. The de-watering operation took three months to complete, after which Jackson and Brazier returned to their base in Colombo. Jackson remained in the Far East for another two years, conducting further salvage work.  For their efforts with the pumping operation, both men were rewarded: Brazier was awarded the MBE, and Jackson received an accelerated promotion. An Australian minesweeper, [[HMAS Gawler (J188)|HMAS ''Gawler'']], landed working parties on 21 June 1944, to assist in the restoration of the port.&lt;ref name=&quot;aus&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==

It took three days to bring the fire under control, and later, 8,000 men toiled for seven months to remove around 500,000 tons of debris and bring the docks back into action. The official death toll was 740, including 476 military personnel, with around 1,800 people injured; unofficial tallies run much higher. The occupants of the slums were largely unregistered. In total, twenty-seven other vessels were sunk or damaged in both Victoria dock and the neighbouring Prince's Dock.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The inquiry into the explosion identified the cotton bales as probably being the seat of the fire. It was critical of several errors: 
*storing the cotton ''below'' the munitions, 
*''not'' displaying the ''red flag'' required to indicate a ''dangerous cargo on board&quot;, 
*''delaying'' unloading the explosives, 
*''not'' using steam injectors to contain the fire and a ''delay'' in alerting the local fire brigade.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Tuesday, 12 September 1944; pg. 3; Issue 49956; col E&lt;/ref&gt;

Many families lost all their belongings and were left with just the clothes on their back. Thousands became destitute. It was estimated that about 6,000 firms were affected and 50,000 lost their jobs.&lt;ref name=rocked/&gt; The government took full responsibility for the disaster and monetary compensation was paid to citizens who made a claim for loss or damage to property. During normal dredging operations carried out periodically to maintain the depth of the docking bays, many intact gold bars have been found over time&amp;nbsp;– some as late as February 2011&amp;nbsp;– and they have since been returned to the government. A live shell weighing 45&amp;nbsp;kg (100&amp;nbsp;lb) was also found in October 2011.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news|last=Tiwary |first=Deeptiman |title=Live, 45-kg shell dredged from WW-II ship's ruins |url=http://mumbaimirror.com/article/15/20111024201110240334556615f57c7a8/Live-45kg-shell-dredged-from-WWII-ship%E2%80%99s-ruins.html |accessdate=1 March 2016 |newspaper=Mumbai Mirror |date=24 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230054616/http://mumbaimirror.com/article/15/20111024201110240334556615f57c7a8/Live-45kg-shell-dredged-from-WWII-ship%E2%80%99s-ruins.html |archivedate=30 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mumbai Fire Brigade]]'s headquarters at [[Byculla]] has a memorial built in the memory of the numerous fire fighters who died.
