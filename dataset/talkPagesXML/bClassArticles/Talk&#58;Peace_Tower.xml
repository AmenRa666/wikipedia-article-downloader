== Memorial Room poem ==

I noticed a moving extract from a poem by Earle Birney on the wall of the Memorial Room when I visited several years ago. Apparently the poem is now out of print. Could somebody who visits the Peace Tower transcribe the verse for this page?

==Tower of Victory and Peace?==
The Peace Tower is not called &quot;Tower of Victory and Peace,&quot; and the linked source (http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/books/history.htm) does not make that claim either: &quot;And so it was two years later that the Prince of Wales laid the corner stone of 'The Tower of Victory and Peace' as it was originally known.&quot; It says &quot;as it was originally known,&quot; not &quot;this is its official name.&quot;

The Parliament of Canada website says: &quot;On September 1, 1919, the Prince of Wales laid the cornerstone of the tower and designated it the Tower of Peace and Victory. However, it was during 1927 celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of Confederation that the name of the tower was finally settled. Prime Minister Mackenzie King was keen on giving this important memorial a name that would match its role as a symbol of the principles for which Canada fought in the Great War, as well as the high aspirations of the Canadian people. As in so many other decisions surrounding the reconstructed Centre Block, architect Pearson's opinion must have carried considerable weight. He wrote to the Prime Minister: 'In all my thought of the tower, Peace was dominant. I believe there is a quiet peaceful dignity about it.'&quot;

There we have it. The name of the tower was originally chosen to be: &quot;Tower of Victory and Peace&quot; or even &quot;Tower of Peace and Victory&quot; but was finally chosen to be the &quot;Peace Tower&quot; by WLMK in 1927.

:&quot;Was originally known&quot; doesn't mean the official name changed, just the name it's known by. Nothing there says the official name is &quot;Peace Tower&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Miesianiacal|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:black;color:white&quot;&gt;'''Ħ'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Miesianiacal|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;MIESIANIACAL&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:51, 5 May 2015 (UTC)
:&quot;It was two years later that the Prince of Wales laid the corner stone of 'The Tower of Victory and Peace', which today is known as the Peace Tower.&quot;[http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/books/history#peace] That implies the original name is &quot;Tower of Victory and Peace&quot; and it's casual name today is &quot;Peace Tower&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Miesianiacal|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:black;color:white&quot;&gt;'''Ħ'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Miesianiacal|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;MIESIANIACAL&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:57, 5 May 2015 (UTC)


::Did you read the second source found here: http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/House/Collections/heritage_spaces/main/main_entrance-e.htm

::The first source does NOT say that the Peace Tower is &quot;officially&quot; called &quot;Tower of Victory and Peace,&quot; so you cannot use that source to back up such a claim, and the second source quite clearly says that William Lyon Mackenzie King chose the name &quot;Peace Tower:&quot;

::&quot;On September 1, 1919, the Prince of Wales laid the cornerstone of the tower and designated it the Tower of Peace and Victory. However, it was during 1927 celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of Confederation that the name of the tower was finally settled. Prime Minister Mackenzie King was keen on giving this important memorial a name that would match its role as a symbol of the principles for which Canada fought in the Great War, as well as the high aspirations of the Canadian people. As in so many other decisions surrounding the reconstructed Centre Block, architect Pearson's opinion must have carried considerable weight. He wrote to the Prime Minister: 'In all my thought of the tower, Peace was dominant. I believe there is a quiet peaceful dignity about it.'&quot;

::&quot;It was two years later that the Prince of Wales laid the corner stone of 'The Tower of Victory and Peace', which today is known as the Peace Tower&quot; does NOT say &quot;today is casually known&quot; like you claim, it says outright that &quot;today is known as the Peace Tower.&quot;

::More sources that support the name is just the &quot;Peace Tower:&quot;

::The Parliament of Canada: http://www.parl.gc.ca/about/parliament/publications/parliamentbuildings/parlblgs-e.asp

::&quot;The Peace Tower

::The Peace Tower was named in commemoration of Canada’s commitment to peace. On the third floor is the Memorial Chamber, a richly carved room of gentle light built to honour Canadians who died in the armed conflicts in which Canada has fought since Confederation. The 92.2-metre tower also contains an observation area and the Carillon, a series of 53 bells weighing from 4.5 kg to 10,090 kg. The Dominion Carillonneur entertains visitors to Parliament Hill with regular recitals.&quot;

::Public Works and Government Services Canada: http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/collineduparlement-parliamenthill/batir-building/centre/tour-tower/tour-tower-eng.html

::&quot;Peace Tower

::The Peace Tower is larger than the Victoria Tower of the original Centre Block. It is the dominant feature on Parliament Hill, and probably the most widely recognized symbol of Canada after the flag.

::In the base of the tower is the Memorial Chamber, dedicated to Canadians who have died in conflicts around the world. It contains the Books of Remembrance. The soaring stone tower is covered with carved figures, grotesques and gargoyles that can only be properly seen when scaffolding is erected for repair work.&quot;

::Ottawa Tourism: http://www.ottawatourism.ca/ottawa-insider/parliament-hill/

::&quot;Free guided tours are available daily, including a chance to head up to the Peace Tower for an incredible view of the city.&quot;

::&quot;The 53-bell carillon in the Peace Tower marks each quarter hour; the Dominion Carilloneur performs daily free concerts.&quot;

::If the official name is the &quot;Tower of Victory and Peace&quot; then somebody forgot to tell the Government of Canada that.

::This is historical revisionism at its finest and has no place in this article. Your own sources do not support your flimsy and tenuous assertions.

:::That's all a straw man; I said there's nothing in your sources to affirm &quot;Peace Tower&quot; is the official name, or even the only name.
:::I trust you'll find the edit I made to be satisfactory. --&lt;span style=&quot;border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Miesianiacal|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:black;color:white&quot;&gt;'''Ħ'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Miesianiacal|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;MIESIANIACAL&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:03, 7 May 2015 (UTC)</text>
