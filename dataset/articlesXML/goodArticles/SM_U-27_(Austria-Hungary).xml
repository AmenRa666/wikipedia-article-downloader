'''SM ''U-27''''' or '''''U-XXVII''''' was the [[lead boat]] of the [[U-27 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-27'' class]] of [[U-boat]]s or [[submarine]]s for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. ''U-27'' was built by the Austrian firm of [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] (CNT) at the [[Pola Navy Yard]] and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 19 October 1916. She was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed on 24 February 1917.

She had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] and was just over {{convert|121|ft|m}} in length. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] nearly {{convert|265|MT|LT|0}} when surfaced and over {{convert|300|MT|LT|0}} when submerged. Her two [[diesel engine]]s moved her at up to {{convert|9|knots|km/h}} on the surface, while her twin [[electric motor]]s propeller her at up to {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while underwater. She was armed with two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry a load of up to four [[torpedo]]es. She was also equipped with a {{convert|75|mm|in|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[deck gun]] and a [[machine gun]].

During her service career, ''U-27'' sank the British destroyer {{HMS|Phoenix|1911|2}}, damaged the Japanese destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Sakaki||2}}, and sank or captured 34 other ships totaling {{GRT|14,386}}. ''U-27'' was surrendered at [[Pula|Pola]] at war's end and handed over to Italy as a [[war reparation]] in 1919. She was broken up the following year. ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921'' calls ''U-27'' Austria-Hungary's &quot;most successful submarine&quot;.

== Design and construction ==
[[Austria-Hungary]]'s U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Con-341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] submarines that comprised the {{sclass|U-10|submarine|4}} from Germany,&lt;ref name=Con-343&gt;Gardiner, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine [[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] as {{SMU|U-14|Austria-Hungary|2}},&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] had been caught in an [[anti-submarine net]] while trying to enter the harbor at [[Pula|Pola]] on 20 December 1914. See: Gardiner, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; and by building four submarines of the {{sclass|U-20|submarine|4}} that were based on the 1911 Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class]].&lt;ref name=Con-344&gt;Gardiner, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The plans for the Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class submarines]], three of which were built in Austria-Hungary, were seized from [[Whitehead &amp; Co.]] in [[Fiume]]. See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs,&lt;ref name=Con-341 /&gt; the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the [[German Type UB II submarine|German Type UB II]] design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.&lt;ref name=Hal-383&gt;Halpern, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name=Hal-383 /&gt; The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name=BS&gt;Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here] (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

''U-27'' displaced {{convert|264|MT|LT}} surfaced and {{convert|301|MT|LT}} submerged.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt; She had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] with [[Saddle tank (submarine)|saddle tank]]s,&lt;ref name=Con-181&gt;Gardiner, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; and was {{convert|121|ft|1|in|m}} long with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14|ft|4|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|2|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt; For propulsion, she had two shafts, twin [[diesel engine]]s of {{convert|270|bhp|abbr=on}} for surface running, and twin [[electric motor]]s of {{convert|280|shp|abbr=on}} for submerged travel. She was capable of {{convert|9|knots|km/h|1}} while surfaced and {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while submerged.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt; Although there is no specific notation of a range for ''U-27'', the German UB II boats, upon which the ''U-27'' class was based, had a range of over {{convert|6000|nmi|km}} at {{convert|5|knots|km/h}} surfaced, and {{convert|45|nmi|km}} at {{convert|4|knots|km/h}} submerged.&lt;ref name=Con-181 /&gt; ''U-27'' class boats were designed for a crew of 23–24.&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt;

''U-27'' was armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} bow [[torpedo tube]]s and carried a complement of four [[torpedo]]es. She was also equipped with a 75&amp;nbsp;mm/26 (3.0&amp;nbsp;in) [[deck gun]] and an {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]].&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt;

After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms,&lt;ref name=Hal-383 /&gt; ''U-27'' was ordered from [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] (CNT) on 12 October 1915.&lt;ref name=Miller-20 /&gt; She was [[keel laying|laid down]] by early 1916 at the [[Pola Navy Yard]],&lt;ref group=Note&gt;By this time, the [[Cantiere Navale Triestino|CNT]] shipyards at [[Monfalcone]] had been overrun by the [[Italian Army]]. See: Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here] (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 17 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 19 October.&lt;!-- launch date --&gt;&lt;ref name=Con-344 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hal-383 /&gt;&lt;!-- laid down date --&gt;

== Service career ==
After her completion, ''U-27'' was [[Ship commissioning|commission]]ed into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 24 February 1917 under the command of ''[[Linienschiffsleutnant]]'' Robert Teufl von Fernland.&lt;ref name=KUK-U-27 /&gt;
Previously in command of {{SMU|U-11|Austria-Hungary|2}}, von Fernland was 31-year-old native of [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=Fernland&gt;{{cite Uboat.net

|accessdate=19 January 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, von Fernland and ''U-27'' both achieved their first kills. On 12 April, ''U-27'' encountered the 3,756-ton Greek steamship ''Niritos'' sailing from [[Genoa]] for [[Port Said]]. About {{convert|5|nmi}} off [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]], [[Sicily]],&lt;ref name=nirito&gt;{{cite Uboat.net

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, von Fernland torpedoed another Greek steamer, the 2,976-ton ''Zinovia''. Carrying coal from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] for [[Taranto]], ''Zinovia'' was sent to the bottom {{convert|5|nmi|km}} from [[Isola di Capo Rizzuto|Cape Rizzuto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=5608112|shipname=Zinovia|accessdate=19 January 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-May 1917, ''U-27'' participated in a support role in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]] that precipitated the [[Battle of Otranto Straits (1917)|Battle of Otranto Straits]]. On the night of 14/15 May, the Austro-Hungarian cruisers {{SMS|Helgoland|Austria-Hungary|2}}, {{SMS|Saida||2}}, and {{SMS|Novara|1912|2}} attacked the [[Naval drifter|drifters]] that deployed the [[anti-submarine net]]s that formed part of the Barrage, sinking 14, damaging 5, and taking 72 prisoners.&lt;ref name=Gib-254&gt;Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 254–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[Joseph Watt]], the commander of the British [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]] ''Gowan Lea'', was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions in refusing to surrender to one of the Austrian cruisers.&lt;/ref&gt; Destroyers {{SMS|Csepel||2}} and {{SMS|Balaton||2}} were sent to simultaneously attack Italian transports shuttling between Italy and [[Vlorë|Valona]], and sank an Italian destroyer and a munitions ship. ''U-27'', which was assigned to patrol between [[Brindisi]] and [[Cattaro]], was a part of a force of three U-boats intended to intercept British and Italian ships responding to the attacks; the other two were the Austro-Hungarian {{SMU|U-4|Austria-Hungary|2}} (which was posted near Valona) and the German {{SMS|UC-25||2}} (assigned to mine Brindisi). A squadron of British cruisers and Italian and French destroyers joined the battle against the Austro-Hungarian cruisers on 15 May. Several ships on each side were damaged by the time the engagement was broken off. As a result of the attacks the drifter line of the Barrage was moved farther south and maintained only during the day, a success for the [[Central Powers]]. ''U-27'' did not take any offensive action during the raid and ensuing battle.&lt;ref name=Gib-254 /&gt;

On 9 June, ''U-27'' sank ''Roland'', a French sailing ship, off the Greek island of [[Cerigo]].&lt;ref name=roland&gt;{{cite Uboat.net
|name=Roland

|name=Sakaki (d.)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holub recorded his first victory with ''U-27'' in January 1918. While near Marca, Sirocco, the U-boat torpedoed and sank the Italian steamer ''Andrea Costa'' on 22 January. The 3,991-ton ''Andrea Costa'' had sailed from [[Rangoon]], but was sunk just short of her destination of [[Malta]].&lt;ref name=andrea&gt;{{cite Uboat.net

[[File:HMS Phoenix (1911) sinking.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Phoenix'' lists to port after being torpedoed, viewed from HMAS ''Warrego'']]
From late April to early May, ''U-27'' sank six small ships—five Greek and one Italian—including three on one day, 6 May. All of the ships with reported tonnages were under 50 tons.&lt;ref name=U27-ships /&gt; ''U-27'' torpedoed the British destroyer {{HMS|Phoenix|1911|2}} at 09:18 on 14 May with the loss of one [[stoker (occupation)|stoker]] and one artificer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1918-05May.htm|title=Royal Naval Casualties May 1918 at Naval-History.net|accessdate=28 September 2008

An attempt was made by Australian destroyer {{HMAS|Warrego|D70|2}} to tow ''Phoenix'' to safety but by 12:45 she was in danger of capsizing and her crew were removed. ''Phoenix'' eventually sank at 13:10 in position {{coord|40|23|30|N|19|14|00|E|display=inline}}.&lt;ref name=Hep-133&gt;Hepper, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 3 to 11 July, ''U-27'' sank another ten ships,&lt;ref name=U27-ships /&gt; the largest reported being the 67-ton sailing vessel ''Giuseppino Padre''.&lt;ref name=giusep&gt;{{cite Uboat.net

The 15-year-old ship was en route from [[Famagusta]] to Port Said, when ''U-27''  torpedoed her {{convert|2|nmi|km}} off [[Crete]].

Except for the two largest ships—the 113-ton ''Agios Nicolas'' and the 103-ton ''Theologos''—none were over 60 tons.&lt;ref name=U27-ships /&gt;

At the war's end, ''U-27'' was in port at Pola.
