The '''South African Navy''' (SAN) is the [[naval warfare]] branch of the [[South African National Defence Force]]. The role of the navy is to prepare for and to conduct naval operations in defence of the RSA, its citizens and interests and to carry out peacetime operations in support of other national objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/role/page3.htm#02 |title=Role of the SA Navy – Page 3 |publisher=Navy.mil.za |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tasks include the maintenance, preservation and the provision of naval services in support of other state departments and authorities, including search and rescue, protection of maritime resources, and diplomatic sea transport support.

==History==
The [[South Africa]]n Navy can trace its official origins back to the SA Naval Service, which was established on 15 November 1921. Unofficially, however, the SAN can trace its history even further back, to the [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] Naval Volunteers (NNV), which was formed in [[Durban]] on 30 April 1885 as well as to the Cape Naval Volunteers (CNV), which was formed in [[Cape Town]] in 1905. On 1 July 1913 these two units were amalgamated to form the South African Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). During World War I a total of 164&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanities.ufs.ac.za/dl/userfiles/Documents/00001/1069_eng.pdf |title= The South African Navy and its Predecessors, 1910–2010: A Century of Interaction with Commonwealth Navies|first=André|last=Wessels|publisher= Department of History, University of the Free State|year= 2009|accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the RNVR (SA) served in the Royal Navy and a total of 412 South Africans served in the RNVR (SA) during the war, while the naval base at Simons Town played a strategic role to the Allies.

[[File:HMSAS Immortelle.jpg|thumb|right|SAS ''Immortelle,'' circa 1935]]
The first ships acquired (on permanent loan from the [[Royal Navy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=South Africa's Navy : A Navy of the People and for the People | last=[[Chris Bennett (admiral)|Bennett, C. H.]] and [[Arne Söderlund|Söderlund, A. G.]] | year=2008 | page=17 | isbn=978-0-620-41446-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the newly formed navy were HMSAS ''Protea'' (a hydrographic survey vessel), HMSAS ''Sonneblom'' and HMSAS ''Immortelle'' (both minesweeping trawlers). However the [[Great Depression]] meant the government had to cut back and the ships acquired by the Navy were handed back to the Royal Navy (HMSAS ''Protea'' in 1933 and the remaining ships in 1934).

===World War II===
[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A4606.jpg|thumb|Members of the South African Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve serving on board [[HMS Nelson (28)]] during WWII]]
When [[World War II]] broke out the South African Naval Service was virtually non-existent, with only three officers and three ratings. In January 1940 a new naval unit, called the Seaward Defence Force, was formed.&lt;ref name=frd-4&gt;{{cite book|title=South Africa: a country study|year=1997|publisher=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|isbn=0-8444-0796-8|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/South%20Africa%20Study_4.pdf|format=PDF|chapter=5 – National Security}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|338}}  [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Guy Hallifax]] CMG, who had retired in South Africa from the Royal Navy, was appointed Director of the Seaward Defence Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = NAVY, South African|encyclopedia = Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa|volume = 8|pages = 113–5|publisher = Nasou Limited|year = 1971
|isbn = 978-0-625-00324-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit was to be responsible for operating the minesweepers, anti-submarine ships, and the other inspection and signalling duties in South African waters. From 1941 a number of SDF antisubmarine trawlers served in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wessels|first=Andre|title=The first two years of war: the development of the Union Defence Forces|journal=Journal for Contemporary History|date=December 1994|volume=19 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seaward Defence Force and the South African RNVR were consolidated on 1 August 1942 to form the South African Naval Forces (SANF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/history/index.htm |title=History of the SA Navy |publisher=Navy.mil.za |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the strong Royal Navy influence on its origins, South African naval forces used Royal Navy ranks.

===Post World War II===
On 1 May 1946 the SANF was reconstituted as part of the [[Union of South Africa|Union Defence Force]].  It was renamed 'South African Navy' on 1 July 1951.&lt;ref name=proc&gt;Union of South Africa ''Government Gazette'' 4698 (28 September 1951) : Proclamation 209 of 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[ship prefix|title]] of [[His Majesty's Ship#Obsolete|HMSAS]] (His Majesty's South African Ship) was changed to SAS (South African Ship) in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/history/ambassadors.htm|title=South African Navy - Unlikely Ambassadors|work=navy.mil.za|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[St Edward's Crown|Crown]] in the SAN cap badge was replaced with the Lion of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Nassau]] from the crest of the country's [[Coat of arms of South Africa#1910 version|coat of arms]] in 1959, two years before South Africa became a [[republic]].
[[File:HMS Wessex.jpg|thumb|right|SAS ''Jan van Riebeeck'' pictured when still named HMS ''Wessex'']]
In 1947, the SANF acquired three additional ships: the {{sclass-|Algerine|minesweeper|1}}s HMSAS ''Rosamund'' (later renamed HMSAS ''Bloemfontein''), HMSAS ''Pelorus'' (later renamed [[HMSAS Pietermaritzburg|HMSAS ''Pietermaritzburg'']]), and the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette|1}} [[HMSAS Protea (K51)|HMSAS ''Rockrose'']] (later converted into a hydrographic survey ship and renamed HMSAS ''Protea''). The SAN's first destroyer, [[SAS Jan van Riebeeck|SAS ''Jan van Riebeeck'']] (the former British [[W and Z-class destroyer|W-class destroyer]] HMS ''Wessex'') was transferred to South Africa on 29 March 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Du Toit|first=Allan|title=South Africa's fighting ships past and present|year=1992|publisher=Ashanti Publishing|isbn=978-1874800507|pages=193–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAN's second destroyer, [[SAS Simon van der Stel|SAS ''Simon van der Stel'']] (the former HMS ''Whelp'', and a sister-ship of the ''Jan van Riebeeck''), was handed over to the Navy on 23 February 1953.

Meanwhile, negotiations were taking place between the British and South African governments on the future of the Royal Navy's base at [[Simon's Town]]. The outcome of these talks was that the base was transferred to the Union on 2 April 1957 under the terms of the [[Simonstown Agreement]], and that the Navy would purchase four additional frigates, ten coastal minesweepers and five seaward defence boats from Britain. In 1963 the first of the Type-12 ''President''-class frigates were delivered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wessels|first=Andre|title=The South African Navy's frigates, 1944–1985|journal=Naval Digest|date=November 2005|volume=11|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1970 the Navy received the first of its three {{sclass-|Daphné|submarine|1}}s from France, the first of which being named SAS ''Maria van Riebeeck'', after Jan van Riebeeck's [[Walloon church|Walloon]] [[Maria van Riebeeck|wife]].

Political unrest in [[Soweto]] and elsewhere prompted the [[apartheid]] government to take even sterner measures in an attempt to keep the opposition under control which in turn led to a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa in 1977. As a result of this, two corvettes and two {{sclass-|Agosta|submarine|1}}s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Du Toit|first=Allan|title=South Africa's fighting ships past and present|year=1992|publisher=Ashanti Publishing|isbn=978-1874800507|pages=281–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that had been ordered for the Navy were not delivered. Instead, South Africa covertly ordered the [[Sa'ar 4 class missile boat|Strike craft]] from Israel, three being built in Israel and six in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Du Toit|first=Allan|title=South Africa's fighting ships past and present|year=1992|publisher=Ashanti Publishing|isbn=978-1874800507|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the then Chief of the [[South African Defence Force]] changed the Navy's focus to that of a coastal navy and as the Border War began to escalate, the Navy's budget was cut dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett, C. H.  |author2=Söderlund, A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=South Africa's Navy : A Navy of the People and for the People|year=2008|isbn=978-0-620-41446-3|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Border conflict ended in April 1989 and was followed by cutbacks in all arms of the South African Defence Force and the Navy had to retrench approximately 23% of its personnel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett, C. H.  |author2=Söderlund, A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=South Africa's Navy : A Navy of the People and for the People|year=2008|isbn=978-0-620-41446-3|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; the South African Marines were disbanded and the two Naval Commands (Naval Command East and Naval Command West) were closed, as were the Naval Bases Cape Town and Walvis Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaybyDay&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=South African naval events : day-by-day, 1488 to 2009 | publisher=Naval Heritage Trust, 2011. | author=Bennett, Christopher Hart | year=2011 | pages=9780620430142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first democratic elections in South Africa, the South African Navy once again started showing the flag around the world and began participating in exercises with other navies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/history/ambassadors.htm |title=South African Navy - Unlikely Ambassadors |publisher=Navy.mil.za |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the South African Navy celebrated 75 years with 15 countries sending ships for the festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss.org.za/Pubs/PAPERS/27/Paper27.html |title=The SA Navy and an African Renaissance - Occasional Paper No 27 - November 1997 |publisher=Iss.org.za |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to re-equip the Navy was addressed by what is known as the [[South African Arms Deal|Arms Deal]] and the Navy acquired four frigates (the [[South African Air Force]] also acquired helicopters for the frigates) as well as three submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/sa-navy-to-have-all-new-corvettes-and-submarines-by-2007-2005-11-23 |title=SA navy to have all new corvettes and submarines by 2007 |publisher=Engineeringnews.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) was located in a bunker at [[Silvermine Nature Reserve|Silvermine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/rsa/navy.htm|title=South African Navy (SAN)|publisher=Globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 this function passed from the Department of Defence to the [[South African Maritime Safety Authority]] (SAMSA), an agency of the [[Department of Transport|Department of Transport (South Africa)]]. The MRCC is located within the SAMSA [[Centre for Sea Watch and Response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samsa.org.za/content/sea-watch-response |title=Sea Watch &amp; Response |publisher=SAMSA |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A budget of roughly [[South African Rand|R]]2.55 billion ($303 million at 2012 exchange rates) was allocated for the Navy for the 2012–2013 fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov.za/documents/national%20budget/2012/enebooklets/Vote%2022%20Defence%20and%20Military%20Veterans.pdf |title= Vote 22 Defence and Military Veterans - National Treasury estimates of national expenditure|publisher= National Treasury Department: Republic of South Africa|date= 22 February 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an updated fleet, ''AllAfrica'' reported in December 2010 that the navy's capabilities are limited and it would have difficulty contributing to anti-piracy efforts off Somalia.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllAfrica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201012130252.html|accessdate=2010-12-15|title=allAfrica.com: South Africa: Navy's Frigates and the Somali Pirates|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''AllAfrica'' reported in January 2011 that with the navy's current budget it would only be able to put one frigate and support ship to sea at any given time.  It was thought that such a deployment would deplete the 2011 annual operational budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllAfrica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kruger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anton Kruger |year=2010 |title=SA's frigates and the Somali pirates |journal=the-african.org |volume= |issue=10 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Institute for Security Studies |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy conducts several naval warfare and patrol exercises per year despite its budget problems such as Exercise Red Lion. It regularly  participates in exercises with other national navies such as the [[United States Navy]] (Exercise Shared Accord/Southern Accord), [[NATO]] naval battlegroups (Exercise Amazolo), [[German Navy]] (the biennial Exercise Good Hope), [[Royal Navy]] (several ad hoc exercises when ships visit South African waters),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wingrin|first1=Dean|title=Royal Navy in exercise with SA sub|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=34276&amp;catid=74&amp;Itemid=30|website=defenceweb.co.za|publisher=DefenceWeb|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian Navy]] (the biennial Exercise Ibsamar), [[National Navy of Uruguay]] and the [[Brazilian Navy]] (Exercises Atlasur and Ibsamar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wingrin|first1=Dean|title=South African Navy readies for exercise Atlasur IX|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27570:south-african-navy-readies-for-exercise-atlasur-ix&amp;catid=111:sa-defence&amp;Itemid=242|website=defenceweb.co.za|publisher=DefenceWeb|accessdate=26 November 2014|date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one or two [[Valour-class frigate]]s and one [[Heroine-class submarine]] takes part in these multinational exercises, usually along with aircraft support from the [[South African Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helfrich|first1=Kim|title=Exercise Ibsamar set for October|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33888:exercise-ibsamar-set-for-october&amp;catid=51:Sea&amp;Itemid=106|website=defenceweb.co.za|publisher=DefenceWeb|accessdate=26 November 2014|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy has also provided security for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] by deploying three frigates to the coastal waters off the cities of Durban, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. The Frigates' sophisticated air and sea surveillance radars allowed them to provide security for the events taking place along the coast.&lt;ref name=NewCaptains&gt;{{cite web|title=New captains for three SA frigates|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16773:new-captains-for-three-sa-frigates&amp;catid=51:Sea&amp;Itemid=106|website=defenceweb.co.za|publisher=DefenceWeb|accessdate=26 November 2014|date=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years several decommissioned [[Warrior class strike craft|Warrior-class strikecraft]] were refurbished by Simons Town Dockyard and recommissioned as offshore patrol vessels (OPVs). Their aged [[Gabriel (missile)|Skerpioen missile launchers]] were removed, providing extra room for a small RHIB boat and a small contingent of seaborne commandos to board suspect vessels. Reclassed as OPVs, these vessels are armed with one or two [[OTO Melara 76 mm]] naval artillery gun as well as a pair of 20&amp;nbsp;mm guns and a pair of 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm heavy machine guns. Three of the former strikecraft were refurbished and are commissioned as  {{SAS|Isaac Dyobha}}, {{SAS|Galeshewe}} and {{SAS|Makhanda}}. A fourth vessel, {{SAS|Adam Kok}}, is being considered for refurbishment.&lt;ref name=DWOPV&gt;{{cite web|title=Revamped strike craft ready for counter-piracy duty|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35514:revamped-strike-craft-ready-for-counter-piracy-duty&amp;catid=108:maritime-security|website=defenceweb.co.za|publisher=defenceweb.co.za|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of August 2014 it appears unlikely that this fourth vessel will be converted, though its fate remains undetermined.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWeb20082014&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35925:south-african-shipbuilding-now-a-strategic-industry&amp;catid=51:Sea&amp;Itemid=106 | title=South African shipbuilding now a strategic industry | publisher=Defenceweb.co.za | date=20 August 2014 | accessdate=21 August 2014 | author=Helfrich, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The South African Navy Director Force Preparation has also said that they hope to use these craft as training vessels for the naval training base {{SAS|Saldanha}}. A further four ex-Mine Hunter vessels are also being operated in the OPV role. These include {{SAS|Umkomaas}}, {{SAS|Umhloti}}, {{SAS|Umzimkulu}} and {{SAS|Umgeni}}. Rear Admiral [[Hanno Teuteberg]], Chief Director Maritime Strategy, said in 2013 that the early Indications are that the life of the OPV vessels can be extended for at least five or more years, to coincide with Project Biro, the new build Offshore/Inshore patrol vessel project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wingrin|first1=Dean|title=Navy commences upgrade of fourth strike craft|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30430:navy-commences-upgrade-of-fourth-strike-craft&amp;catid=51:Sea&amp;Itemid=106|website=defenceweb.co.za|publisher=defenceweb.co.za|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy currently has a warship deployed in the [[Mozambique Channel]] to support the anti-piracy initiative, Operation Copper, which aims to dissuade pirates from operating in Southern African waters. The Operation has been running since 2011 after several ships were attacked by pirates in the area. All of the Navy’s [[Valour-class frigate]]s have been deployed in the region on rotation since the operation first began. The refurbished Warrior-class OPVs have also been deployed several times. The Navy’s single replenishment vessel {{SAS|Drakensberg|A301}} has also spent time on station. The vessels are supported by a C-47TP maritime patrol aircraft and rotary-winged aircraft including Super Lynx and Oryx helicopters from the South African Air Force. In addition to ship’s crews the Navy has also deployed elements of its Maritime Reaction Squadron (MRS) aboard vessels in the Mozambique Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helfrich|first1=Kim|title=Operation Copper still up and running|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=34089:operation-copper-still-up-and-running&amp;catid=108:maritime-security|website=DefenceWeb|publisher=DefenceWeb|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naval Base Durban]], previously downgraded to a naval station in 2002, is being upgraded to a fully-fledged naval base to house the newly refurbished Warrior-class Offshore Patrol Vessels, as well as those to be procured through Project Biro in the future. Rear Admiral Mosuwa Hlongwane commented that &quot;The re-establishment of the naval base on [[Salisbury Island, Durban|Salisbury Island]] is on track and the OPVs will be stationed in Durban. As this facility is in the heart of South Africa’s busiest harbour, a balance has to be found between commercial and defence requirements in the ever-growing Durban port&quot;. This also gives the South African Navy an operating base from which it can more effectively conduct missions along the South African Eastern coast and in the Indian Ocean. In December 2015 the facility was redesignated a naval base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfrich&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Kim |last=Helfrich |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=41760:minister-says-its-naval-base-durban-not-station&amp;catid=111:sa-defence&amp;Itemid=242 |title=Minister says it’s Naval Base Durban, not Station |publisher=defenceWeb |date=2015-12-09 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decommissioned ships===
{{main|List of decommissioned ships of the South African Navy}}

===Marines===
{{main|South Africa Marine Corps}}

The [[South Africa Marine Corps]] was set up as a sub-branch of the Navy in 1979,&lt;ref name=frd-4/&gt;{{rp|339}} with the primary purpose of protecting harbours.  Marines were also deployed at [[Katima Mulilo]] in [[South West Africa]] during the [[South African Border War]], where they were responsible for patrolling the [[Zambezi River]].  The Marines also acted as regular infantry at the Border until 1988 as well as performing [[counter-insurgency]] operations inside South Africa.   During township duties in the mid-1980s the detachment used facilities at SAS&amp;nbsp;''Rand'' in Johannesburg and on Signal Hill outside of Heidelberg. The Marines had an [[amphibious landing]] capability by operating from {{SAS|Tafelberg||2}} and {{SAS|Drakensberg|A301|2}}.  An elite company, named the Marine Amphibious Company (MAC), was formed to ensure the beach-head capability for landing large task forces. The Marines trained and fielded a small elite reconnaissance detachment between 1983 and 1989, under the direct control of the Marine CO, they received airborne, diver and urban counter measures training from other army units within the SADF.

The Marines were disbanded on 18 January 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitta|first=Robert|title=South African Special Forces|year=1993|publisher=Osprey}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a major restructuring of the Navy at the end of the [[South African Border War]].

An Maritime Reaction Squadron was established in 2005, which is effectively a marine corps.

===Fleet Command===
{{main|Fleet Command (SA Navy)}}

[[Fleet Command (SA Navy)|Fleet Command]] includes all vessels and units of the Navy other than Naval Headquarters, Pretoria. Fleet Command is based in Simon's Town under control of Flag Officer Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett, C. H.  |author2=Söderlund, A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=South Africa's Navy : A Navy of the People and for the People|year=2008|isbn=978-0-620-41446-3|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four directorates are responsible for the day to day control of Fleet Command:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett, C. H.  |author2=Söderlund, A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=South Africa's Navy : A Navy of the People and for the People|year=2008|isbn=978-0-620-41446-3|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Naval Base Simon's Town]] – the only full naval base currently in the SAN. All combat units have been concentrated here in an attempt to curb costs. The base also houses training facilities for the new frigates and submarines. A naval dockyard is also situated here, although it is in the process of being privatised.
[[File:Simonstown Naval base from above.jpg|thumb|A view of Simon's Town and the naval base]]
* [[Naval Base Durban]] – Naval Base Durban, built during the Second World War, was scaled down to a naval station in 2002 with the rationalisation of the fleet. In April 2013 it was announced that the base would be re-opened and upgraded to assist with the piracy mission on Africa's East coast and to establish a permanent fleet presence on the East Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOL&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/kwazulu-natal/navy-to-return-to-durban-s-salisbury-island-1.1496219#.UX4zfMpZJWo | title=Navy to return to Durban's Salisbury Island | date=5 April 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-29 |author1=Mkamba, Lungelo |author2=Coetzee, Cobus |author3=Sapa }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 it was redesignated a naval base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfrich&quot;/&gt;

* NBCD School – Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, Damage Control training

===Personnel===

As at 1 September 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; there are approximately 6104 active uniformed members augmented by 1313 civilians and 1000 reserve members. The seven old Navy Reserve units were closed down during 2006. They were modeled on the Royal Naval Reserve unit system. A new Navy Reserve system was created consisting of roughly 1000 reserve posts. These posts are pooled and members drawn from them as needed to augment full-time units and ships' companies.

====Uniforms====
From 1922 to the 1950s the SA Navy was effectively part of the Royal Navy and wore the same uniforms and similar insignia. In 1959 the [[St Edward's Crown|Crown]] in the SAN cap badge was replaced with the Lion of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Nassau]] from the crest of the country's [[Coat of arms of South Africa#1910 version|coat of arms]]. A black beret replaced the peaked cap in working uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett, C. H.  |author2=Söderlund, A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=South Africa's Navy : A Navy of the People and for the People|year=2008|isbn=978-0-620-41446-3|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the new Coat of Arms was unveiled and the Chief of the Navy tasked Fleet Command to look at revising the Navy uniforms to reflect the new coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett, C. H.  |author2=Söderlund, A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=South Africa's Navy : A Navy of the People and for the People|year=2008|isbn=978-0-620-41446-3|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saw new rank insignia for non commissioned officers being implemented as well as the introduction of a [[side cap]].

====Ranks====
The rank system is based on that of the (British) Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/visionmission.htm#uniform |title=Vision &amp; Mission |publisher=Navy.mil.za |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air Force maritime aircraft===
Although the SAN does not operate any aircraft itself, aircraft used on ships or supporting the SAN are operated by [[22 Squadron SAAF]]:

* 1 × [[Atlas Oryx]] – medium [[utility helicopter]] (deployed on the SAS Drakensberg)&lt;ref name=&quot;NavyAir&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.navy.mil.za/equipment/maritime_aircraft.htm | title=Maritime Aircraft | publisher=South African Navy | accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 4 × [[Westland Lynx|Westland Super Lynx 300 Mk64]] – [[anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] and [[Anti-surface warfare|ASuW]] helicopter (deployed on the Valour-class frigates)&lt;ref name=&quot;NavyAir&quot; /&gt;
There is a planned programme to equip the frigates with UAVs to supplement the helicopters. Previously before its retirement the SAAF operated the [[Westland Wasp]] for the SAN in the [[anti-submarine warfare]] role.
