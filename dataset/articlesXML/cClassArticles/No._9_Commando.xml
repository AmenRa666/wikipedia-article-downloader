'''No. 9 Commando''' was a [[battalion]]-sized [[British Commandos|British Commando]] unit raised by the [[British Army during the Second World War]]. It took part in raids across the [[English Channel]] and in the [[Mediterranean]], ending the war in Italy as part of the [[2nd Special Service Brigade]]. Like all Army commando units it was disbanded in 1946.

==Background==
The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of [[Winston Churchill]], the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. He called for specially trained troops that would &quot;develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; At first it was a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy occupied territory,&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1943 the unit's role had changed into lightly equipped assault Infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was [[Admiral]] Sir [[Roger Keyes]]; himself a veteran of the landings at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Galipoli]] and the [[Zeebrugge raid]] in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].&lt;ref name=haw48/&gt;

By the autumn of 1940, more than 2,000 men had volunteered for Commando training, and what became known as the [[Special Service Brigade]] was formed into 12 units called Commandos.&lt;ref name=haw48&gt;Haskew, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Each Commando would number around 450 men, who were commanded by a [[lieutenant colonel]]. They were sub-divided into [[Troops]] of 75 men and further divided into 15 man [[Section (military unit)|sections]].&lt;ref name=haw48/&gt; Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments; they retained their own [[cap badge]]s and remained on their regimental roll for pay.&lt;ref name=mo12&gt;Moreman, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; All volunteers went through the six week intensive commando course at [[Achnacarry]]. The course in the Scottish Highlands, concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions, both by day and by night.&lt;ref&gt;van der Bijl, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943 the Commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed in [[Brigade]]s of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller scale raids.&lt;ref&gt;Moreman, pp.84&amp;ndash;85&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:A member of No. 9 Commando at Anzio, equipped for a patrol with his Bren gun, 5 March 1944. NA12469.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A member of No. 9 Commando at Anzio, 5 March 1944]]
The men of No. 9 Commando were originally from No. 6 and No. 7 Independent Companies. They had been amalgamated in the autumn of 1940 in the 2nd Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel J.M. Saegert. After the general reorganisation of the Commando units, they were re-designated No. 9 Commando and based in [[Criccieth]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=Chappell46&gt;Chappell 1996, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreman 2006, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=website&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commandoveterans.org/site/mambots/editors/fckeditor/editor/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=|title=No. 9 Commando History|publisher=Commando Veterans Association|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No. 9 Commando undertook its first raid, Operation [[Operation Sunstar|''Sunstar'']], on the night of 22/23 November 1941 on the French coast at [[Houlgate]]. The raid was a success; the men landed and evacuated without any loss. After this raid the command of the Commando was taken over by Lieutenant Colonel [[Ronnie Tod]].&lt;ref name=website/&gt;&lt;ref name=website2&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.combinedops.com/No%209%20Commando.htm|title=No. 9 Commando|publisher=www.combinedops.com|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next operation that men from No. 9 were involved in was the [[St. Nazaire Raid]] in March 1942, the main landing force was provided by [[No. 2 Commando]] but most of the other Commando units supplied demolition parties to assist in demolishing the port facilities.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

The men were then used to reinforce the [[Gibraltar]] garrison during Operation [[Operation Torch|''Torch'']], the landings in [[French North Africa]]. They remained in Gibraltar until November 1943 when they carried out raids on the islands of [[Tremiti]] and [[Pianosa]].&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

During the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], as part of the [[2nd Special Service Brigade]] the men were involved in Operation [[Operation Partridge|''Partridge'']] in December 1943 in the area of the [[Garigliano River]]. This was followed by Operation [[Operation Shingle|''Shingle'']], the [[Anzio]] landings and fighting at [[Monte Ornito]] before being withdrawn to [[Naples]] in March 1943.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

In 1944, No. 9 Commando were involved in Operation [[Operation Darlington 11|''Darlington 11'']] in May and Operation [[Operation Gradient|''Gradient'']] in August. They then operated in Greece before returning to Italy and taking part Operation [[Operation Roast|''Roast'']], the crossing of [[Commachio]] Lagoon and the [[battle of the Argenta Gap]] in April 1945. The Second World War in Europe ended in May 1945 and in 1946 all the Army Commando units were disbanded.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;
