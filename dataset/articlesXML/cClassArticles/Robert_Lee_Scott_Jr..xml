'''Robert Lee Scott Jr.''' (12 April 1908 – 27 February 2006) was a [[brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]].  Scott is best known for his autobiography ''God is My Co-Pilot'' about his exploits in [[World War II]] with the [[Flying Tigers]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in [[China]] and [[Burma]].  The book was eventually made into a film of the [[God is My Co-Pilot (film)|same name]].
{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==Early years==
Scott was born in Waynesboro, near [[Macon, Georgia]], the oldest of three children born to Ola and Robert Scott. As a youth, Scott was educated in Macon and became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;&gt;Townley 2006, pp. 20–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;desalista&quot;&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf] &quot;Distinguished Eagle Scouts.&quot; ''Scouting.org.'' Retrieved: 4 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five he witnessed the fatal aircraft crash of pioneer aviator [[Eugene Ely]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1943, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Upon graduation from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1932, Scott completed pilot training at [[Kelly Air Force Base|Kelly Field]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1943, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1933, he was assigned to [[Mitchel Field]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Scott flew [[air mail]] in 1934, commanded a pursuit squadron in [[Panama]], and helped instruct other pilots at bases in Texas and [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1943, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
After [[World War II]] began, Scott joined [[Task Force Aquila]] in February 1942 to fly a group of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers to the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]]. Anxious to join the mission, which was to bomb Japan from China, he professed to be an experienced B-17 pilot. He actually learned to fly it en route to Africa. Upon arrival in India, he found the mission had been scrubbed so he became stuck in India when he really wanted to be on the frontline in a cockpit flying combat. Within a month, he was executive and operations officer of the Assam-Burma-China (Ferry) Command, forerunner of the famous [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]], flying [[the Hump]] from [[India]] to [[China]] to supply the Kuomintang government. When the commanding officer left for China on 17 June, Scott was left in command of the operation for several days.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1943, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still anxious to get into combat and wishing to learn the [[Flying Tigers]]' tactics,{{r|life19420820}} he obtained the use of a [[Republic P-43 Lancer]], actually assigned to the Flying Tigers from [[Claire Chennault]], with which he flew at least one high–altitude mission over [[Mount Everest]], as  described in the opening pages of his autobiography ''God Is My Co-Pilot''. Scott began flying missions with the Flying Tigers, piloting a P-40 as a single ship escort for the transports and on ground attack missions. During this period, he frequently repainted the propeller spinner in different colors to create the illusion of a much larger fighter force in the area than a single aircraft, becoming in effect a &quot;one-man air force&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;life19420820&quot;&gt;Belden, Jack. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sk4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=life%20magazine%20aug%2010%201942&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage%201942&amp;f=true] &quot;Chennault Fights to Hold the China Front.&quot; ''Life,'' 20 August 1942, p. 70. Retrieved: 19 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1942, at the request of [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Scott was named commander of the [[23rd Fighter Group]], newly formed by General [[Claire Chennault]] when the Flying Tigers were incorporated into the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]. Popular accounts stated that Scott inherited command of the Flying Tigers, which was incorrect, since that &quot;volunteer group&quot; had disbanded at the conclusion of the pilots' contracts on 30 June. The 23rd later become part of the [[14th Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1943, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonel]] Scott flew 388 combat missions in 925 hours from July 1942 to October 1943, shooting down 13 [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] aircraft to become one of America's earliest [[flying ace]]s of the war.

Scott was ordered back to the U.S. in October 1943 to become deputy for operations at the [[Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics]] at [[Orlando Executive Airport|Orlando Army Air Base]], Florida. He returned to China in 1944 to fly fighter aircraft equipped with experimental rockets directed against Japanese supply locomotives in eastern China. He then went to [[Okinawa]] to direct the same type of strikes against enemy shipping as the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis 1961, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
Scott then returned to the U.S. for staff duty in [[Washington, D.C.]] and other stations until 1947, when he was given command of the Jet Fighter School at [[Williams Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]]. In 1951, he was reassigned to [[West Germany]] as commander of the [[36th Wing|36th Fighter-Bomber Wing]] at [[Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1989, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott graduated from the [[National War College]] in 1954 and was assigned to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans at Headquarters U.S. Air Force, and then to the position of Director of Information under the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]]. In October 1956, he was assigned to [[Luke Air Force Base]], Arizona, as base commander.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1989, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Scott retired from the United States Air Force as a brigadier general on 30 September 1957, and remained in Arizona until the 1980s. He then lived in Warner Robins, Georgia, until his death in 2006. General Scott wrote about a dozen books including ''God Is My Copilot'' and ''The Day I Owned the Sky''.

Scott continued to be active well into his retirement. In 1980, he gained national attention by hiking the length of the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/interview-with-retired-brig-general-robert-l-scott-american-world-war-ii-ace-pilot-and-hero.htm] ''Interview with retired Brigadier-General Robert L. Scott'' history.net (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; He had seen portions of the Wall during his 1944 flights near [[Beijing|Peking]], and by 1980 had managed to obtain Chinese government permission to make the 1,900 mile (3050&amp;nbsp;km) trek, which took 94 days. He carried his food (65 pounds of oatmeal cookies and nutrition supplements) on his back, slept on the ground adjacent to the wall, and obtained water (usually in the form of fruits) from houses along the way. He was never able to pay for the fruit, being told each time, &quot;No, you are a guest of our country.&quot;

In 1984, he flew a [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] jet fighter, and in 1995, a [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott was required to pass the standard Air Force pilot physical before making the jet flights. (quoted in history.net interview)&lt;/ref&gt; On his 89th birthday, in 1997, Scott flew in a [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] bomber.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1989, pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
For his combat record in World War II, Scott received two [[Silver Star]]s, three [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Crosses]] and three [[Air Medal]]s.

During the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], Scott carried the [[Olympic Flame]] along a section of [[Georgia State Route 247]], which had been named in his honor.
