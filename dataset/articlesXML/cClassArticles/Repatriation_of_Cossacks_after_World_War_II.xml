The '''Repatriation of Cossacks after the Second World War''' refers to the forced [[repatriation]] to the USSR of the [[Cossacks]] and ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]] who were allies of [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].

The repatriations were agreed to in the [[Yalta Conference]]; Stalin claimed the repatriated people were Soviet citizens as of 1939, although many of them had left Russia before or soon after the end of the [[Russian Civil War]], or had been born abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodina&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=blood&gt;{{cite news |title=Blood on our hands; They Surrendered in Good Faith Only to Be Sent to Certain Torture and Death; the Betrayal of the Cossacks 60 Years Ago Was Not the Work of the Nazis or the Red Army, but of British Politicians |publisher=The Daily Mail |first=Andrew |last=Roberts |date=4 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those Cossacks and Russians fought the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in service to the [[Axis powers]], yet the repatriations included non-combatant civilians as well. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

General Poliakov and Colonel Chereshneff referred to it as the '''Massacre of Cossacks at Lienz'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodina&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=Chereshneff, Colonel W.V.|title=The History of Cossacks|year=1952|publisher=Rodina Society Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;massacre&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.holycross-hermitage.com/pages/Orthodox_Life/cossacks.htm|author=Major General of the General Staff Poliakov|title=Massacre of Cossacks at Lienz|journal=Russia|volume=VI|number=84|date=September 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
During the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–23), thousands of Russians integral to the [[Volunteer Army]] and the [[White Movement]] fought the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodina&quot;/&gt; [[Cossack Hosts]] (of which there were eleven at the start of the [[First World War]], 1914–18) composed much of the White Movement, and so were the strongest [[counter-revolution]]ary force against the Bolshevik Government.  During the Civil War [[Leon Trotsky]] imposed [[decossackization]] on the Cossacks, leading to many, especially the [[Don Cossacks]] and the [[Kuban Cossacks]], to escape Russia for the [[Balkans]] where they established the [[Russian All-Military Union]], the ROVS.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Cossacks who remained in Russia endured more than a decade of continual repression, e.g. the portioning of the lands of the [[Terek Cossacks|Terek]], [[Ural Cossacks|Ural]], and [[Semirechye Cossacks|Semirechye]] hosts, forced cultural assimilation and repression of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], deportation, and, ultimately, the [[Soviet famine of 1932-1933]]. The repressions ceased and some privileges were restored after publication of ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (1934) by [[Mikhail Sholokhov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shambarov&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Shambarov|first=Valery|title=Kazachestvo Istoriya Volnoy Rusi|publisher=Algorithm Expo, Moscow|year=2007|isbn=978-5-699-20121-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Second World War==
On 22 June 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|attacked the USSR]]. Russia had already been a part of World War II with [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|its occupation of eastern Poland]], its attack on Finland and [[Occupation of the Baltic States|its occupation of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia]]. During the attack some ROVS, especially the Cossack ''émigré'' generals [[Pyotr Krasnov]] and [[Andrei Shkuro]], asked Nazi Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]]’ permission to fight alongside Nazi Germany against Communist Russia. Goebbels welcomed this idea, and by 1942 General Krasnov and General Shkuro had mustered a Cossack force — mostly from Red Army [[POW]]s captured by the [[Wehrmacht]] — who would be under the command of General [[Helmuth von Pannwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;François de Lannoy: ''Les Cosaques de Pannwitz: 1942–1945''. Bayeux: Heimdal, 2000; ISBN 2-84048-131-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wehrmacht recognized the Cossacks as military units with their own uniforms and insignia; the [[1st Cossack Division]] was established the next year. Although the Cossack units were formed to fight the Communists in Russia, by the time they formed, the [[Red Army]] had already recaptured most of the Nazi-occupied territory, so they were deployed to the Balkans to fight the Communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]] commanded by [[Josip Broz Tito]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2germancavalry.info/cossackunits.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314180822/http://www.ww2germancavalry.info/cossackunits.htm|archivedate=14 March 2008|title=The 1st Cossack Division|publisher=WW2 German Cavalry}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into northern Italy, &quot;where their brutality was notorious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Hastings|Hastings, Max]] ''Churchill As Warlord'' p. 46, ISBN 978-0-00-7263684, Harper Press 20009&lt;/ref&gt;  By the war's end, the Cossack units had come under the command of the [[Waffen-SS]].

==Yalta and Tehran Conferences==
[[File:Yalta summit 1945 with Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at the Yalta conference.]]
The agreements of the [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Tehran Conference]]s, signed by American [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]], Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], and British [[Winston Churchill|Prime Minister Churchill]], determined the fates of the Cossacks who did not fight for the USSR, because many were [[POW]]s of the Nazis. Stalin obtained [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] agreement to the repatriation of every so-called &quot;Soviet&quot; citizen held prisoner because the Allied leaders feared that the Soviets either might delay or refuse repatriation of the Allied POWs whom the [[Red Army]] had liberated from Nazi POW camps.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ure|first=John|title=The Cossacks: An Illustrated History|year=2002|publisher=Gerald Duckworth|location=London, UK|isbn=0-7156-3253-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the agreement for the deportation of all &quot;Soviet&quot; citizens did not include [[White Movement|White Russian]] emigres who had fled during the Bolshevik Revolution before the establishment of the USSR, all Cossack prisoners of war were later demanded. After Yalta, Churchill questioned Stalin, asking, “Did the Cossacks and other minorities fight against us?” Stalin replied, “They fought with ferocity, not to say savagery, for the Germans”.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

In 1944, [[Peter Krasnov|General Krasnov]] and other Cossack leaders had persuaded Hitler to allow Cossack troops, as well as civilians and non-combatant Cossacks, to permanently settle in the sparsely settled [[Carnia]], in the [[Italian Alps|Alps]]. The Cossacks moved there and established garrisons and settlements, requisitioning houses by evicting the inhabitants, with several [[stanitsa]]s and posts, their administration, churches, schools, and military units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itcmarchetti.net/Sito%20con%20Frame/THE%20WAR.htm|title=Occupation of Friuli}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, they fought the partisans and persecuted the local population, committing numerous atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjargne.it/libri/COSACCHIinItalia.htm|title=I Cosacchi in Italia, 1944-'45 Atti dei Convegni di Verzegnis|publisher=I libri di Cjargne Online|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Allies progressed from central Italy to the Italian Alps, Italian partisans under [[General Contini]] ordered the Cossacks to leave Carnia and go north to Austria. There, near [[Lienz]], the British Army interned the Cossacks in a hastily established internment camp. For a few days, the British fed them; meanwhile, the [[Red Army]]'s advance units approached to within a few miles east, rapidly advancing to meet the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. On 28 May 1945, the British transported 2,046 disarmed Cossack officers and generals — including the [[cavalry]] Generals [[Pyotr Krasnov]] and [[Andrei Shkuro]] — to a nearby Red Army-held town and handed them over to the Red Army commanding general, who ordered them tried for treason. Many Cossack leaders had never been citizens of the Soviet Union, having fled revolutionary Russia in 1920; {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} hence they believed they could not be guilty of [[treason]]. Some were executed immediately. High-ranking officers were tried in [[Moscow]], and then executed. On 17 January 1947, Krasnov and Shkuro were hanged in a public square. General [[Helmuth von Pannwitz]] of the [[Wehrmacht]], who was instrumental to the formation and leadership of the Cossacks taken from Nazi POW camps to fight the USSR, decided to share the Cossacks' Soviet repatriation, and was executed for war crimes, along with five Cossack generals and [[ataman]]s in Moscow in 1947.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

On 1 June 1945, the British placed 32,000 Cossacks (with their women and children) into trains and trucks, and delivered them to the Red Army for repatriation to the USSR; {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} similar repatriations occurred that year in the American occupation zones in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. Most Cossacks were sent to the [[gulag]]s in far northern Russia and in [[Siberia]], and many died; some, however, escaped, and others lived until [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s amnesty in the course of his [[de-Stalinization]] policies (see below). In total, some two million people were repatriated to the USSR at the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0495a.asp|title=Repatriation — The Dark Side of World War II|first=Jacob G.|last=Hornberger|publisher=Freedom Daily|date=April 1995|accessdate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lienz==
On 28 May 1945, the British Army arrived at Camp Peggetz, in [[Lienz]], where there were 2,479 Cossacks, including 2,201 officers and soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;/&gt; They went to invite the Cossacks to an important conference with British officials, informing them that they would return to Lienz by six o’clock that evening; some Cossacks worried, but the British reassured them that everything was in order. One British officer told the Cossacks: “I assure you, on my word of honour as a British officer, that you are just going to a conference”.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;/&gt; By then, British–Cossack relationships were friendly to the extent that many on both sides had developed feelings for the other. The Lienz Cossack repatriation was exceptional, because the Cossacks forcefully resisted their British repatriation to the USSR; a Cossack noted: “The [[NKVD]] or the [[Gestapo]] would have slain us with truncheons, the British did it with their word of honour.”&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first to commit suicide, by hanging, was the Cossack editor Evgenij Tarruski. The second was General Silkin, who shot himself. . . . The Cossacks refused to board the trucks. British soldiers [armed] with pistols and clubs began using their clubs, aiming at the heads of the prisoners. They first dragged the men out of the crowd, and threw them into the trucks. The men jumped out. They beat them again, and threw them onto the floor of the trucks. Again, they jumped out. The British then hit them with rifle butts until they lay unconscious, and threw them, like sacks of potatoes, in the trucks. — ''Operation Keelhaul'' (1973), by Julius Epstein.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The British transported the Cossacks to a prison where the Soviets assumed their custody. In the town of [[Tristach]], Austria, there is a memorial commemorating General von Pannwitz and the soldiers of the [[XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps]] who were killed in action or died as POWs.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Other repatriations==

===Judenburg, Austria===
On 1–2 June, 18,000 Cossacks were handed over to the Soviets near the town of [[Judenburg]], Austria; of those in custody, some 10 officers and 50–60 Cossacks escaped the guards’ cordon with hand grenades, and hid in a nearby wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;massacre&quot; /&gt; One eyewitness described many of these Cossacks as &quot;Russians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Pearson's War Story|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/00/a2169100.shtml|work=WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|date=2 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near Graz, Austria===
The Russian Cossacks of [[XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps]], stationed in Yugoslavia since 1943, were part of the column headed for Austria that would take part in the [[Bleiburg repatriations]], and they are estimated to have numbered in thousands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dizdar-134&quot;&gt;[[#Dizdar-2005|Dizdar, 2005]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Tolstoy]] quotes a General Alexander telegram, sent to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, noting &quot;50,000 Cossacks including 11,000 women, children and old men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolstoy-1986&quot;&gt;[[#Tolstoy-1986|Tolstoy, 1986]], pp. 124-125: &lt;br&gt;In a second telegram sent to Combined Chiefs of Staff, Alexander asked for guidelines regarding the final disposition of “50,000 Cossacks including 11,000 women, children and old men; present estimate of total 35,000 Chetniks – 11,000 of them already evacuated to Italy – and 25,000 German and Croat units.” In each of above cases “return them to their country of origin immediately might be fatal to their health.”&lt;/ref&gt; At a location near [[Graz]], British forces repatriated around 40,000 Cossacks to [[SMERSH]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vuletić-144&quot;&gt;[[#Vuletić-2007|Vuletić, 2007]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fort Dix, New Jersey, United States===
Although repatriations are thought to have occurred only in Europe, it also occurred in the United States at [[Fort Dix]], New Jersey, where 154 people were repatriated to the USSR after the [[World War II|Second World War]]; three committed suicide in the US, and seven were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/GEN/WW2tIMELINE/repatriate.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513193057/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/repatriate.html|archivedate=13 May  2008|title=Russian Repatriation|work=World War II Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11598/pub_detail.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417151921/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11598/pub_detail.asp|archivedate=17 April 2009|title=It Didn't Start with Elian|first=Michael A |last=Ledeen |publisher=AEI Online|date=1 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Epstein (author)|Julius Epstein]] described the scene:&lt;blockquote&gt;First, they refused to leave their barracks when ordered to do so. The military police then used tear gas, and, half-dazed, the prisoners were driven under heavy guard to the harbor where they were forced to board a Soviet vessel. Here the two hundred immediately started to fight. They fought with their bare hands. They started — with considerable success — to destroy the ship's engines.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. A sergeant &amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. mixed barbiturates into their coffee. Soon, all of the prisoners fell into a deep, coma-like sleep. It was in this condition that the prisoners were brought to another Soviet boat for a speedy return to Stalin's hangmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Cossack officers, more politically aware than the enlisted men, expected that repatriation to the USSR would be their ultimate fate. They believed that the British would have sympathised with their anti-Communism, but were unaware that their fates had been decided at the [[Yalta Conference]]. Upon discovering that they would be repatriated, many escaped, some probably aided by their Allied captors;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; some passively resisted, and others committed suicide.

Of those Cossacks who escaped repatriation, many hid in forests and mountainsides, some were hidden by the local German populace, but most hid in different identities as Ukrainians, Latvians, Poles, Yugoslavians, Turks, Armenians, and Ethiopians. Eventually, they were admitted to [[displaced persons camp]]s under assumed names and nationalities; many emigrated to the US per the [[Displaced Persons Act]]. Others went to any country that would admit them (e.g. Germany, Austria, France, and Italy). Most Cossacks hid their true national identity until the [[dissolution of the USSR]] in late 1991.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Amnesty===
After the [[death of Stalin]] in 1953, partial [[amnesty]] was granted for some labour camp inmates on 27 March 1953 with the end of the GULAG system, then extended it on 17 September 1955. Yet, some specific political crimes were omitted from amnesty: people convicted under Section 58.1(c) of the Criminal Code, stipulating that in the event of a military man escaping Russia, every adult member of his family who abetted the escape or who knew of it is subject to five to ten years’ [[imprisonment]]; every dependant who did not know of the escape is subject to five years’ [[Siberia]]n exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1956/xx/stalintok.htm|title=Russia From Stalin To Khrushchev|first=Tony|last=Cliff|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===In literature===
The event was documented in publications such as Nicholas Bethell's ''The Last Secret: The Delivery to Stalin of Over Two Million Russians by Britain and the United States'' (1974).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

&lt;!-- In his 1986 book, or? --&gt;[[Nikolai Tolstoy]] describes this and other events resulting from the Yalta Conference as the “Secret Betrayal” (cf. [[Western betrayal]]), for going unpublished in the [[Western world|West]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Aleksander Solzhenitsyn]] describes the forced repatriation of the Cossacks by [[Winston Churchill]] as follows: &quot;He turned over to the Soviet command the Cossack corps of 90,000 men. Along with them, he also handed over many wagonloads of old people, women and children who did not want to return to their native Cossack rivers. This great hero, monuments to whom will in time cover all England, ordered that they, too, be surrendered to their deaths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: ''The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Parts I-II''. Harper &amp; Row, 1974. pp. 259-60; ISBN 0-06-080332-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorials===
In [[Lienz]], Austria, there is an eighteen-gravestone cemetery commemorating the “Tragedy of the [[Drava|Drau]]”.

==Fiction==

===Reference in ''GoldenEye'' film===
The plot of the ''[[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]]'' film ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995) involves the resentment of villain &quot;Janus&quot;, the son of &quot;Lienz Cossacks&quot;. Janus plots the destruction of the UK economy because of &quot;the British betrayal and Stalin's execution squads&quot;, the latter of which he and his family had survived, but, tormented by [[survivor's guilt]], his father ultimately [[Murder-suicide|killed his wife, then himself]], leaving Janus orphaned. Bond says of the repatriation, &quot;Not exactly our finest hour&quot;, though the Russian he says this to replies that the &quot;ruthless&quot; Cossacks &quot;got what they deserved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNMcZxyuf8Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaQbXfrdNA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
These events provide the historical context for the ''[[Foyle's War (series seven)|Foyle's War]]'' episode, &quot;The Russian House&quot;.
