The '''''Silba ''class''' (sometimes the ''Cetina ''class) is a class of three [[landing ship]]s, also used as [[minelayer]]s, built for the [[Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslav]] (JRM) and [[Croatian Navy]] (HRM) during the 1980s and 1990s. The ships were built at the [[Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata]] shipyard in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] with slight differences in armament configuration between the last two ships. By the time the [[Croatian War of Independence]] started, one ship was in service with the JRM while another was being completed.

The one in JRM service was relocated to [[Montenegro]] where it would be commissioned with the Navy of the new [[FR Yugoslavia]]. The second ship that was captured unfinished was completed by Croatian forces and entered service with the HRM, followed by a third that was laid down by Croatia in 1993. The two ships commissioned with the HRM remain in active service, providing assistance to civilian institutions aside from their regular military tasks. The fate of the first ship in the class remains unknown.

== Development and building ==
The ''Silba ''class was developed by the ''Brodarski institut'' (BI) from [[Zagreb]] as a replacement for a large number of aging barge-like landing craft based on German [[World War II]] designs ([[Marinefährprahm]] and [[Siebel ferry|Siebel]]).{{sfn|Gardiner|1995|p=646}} All three ships were completed at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (BSO) in Split, Croatia. The first one, ''Krk'' (DBM-241), was commissioned with the JRM sometime between 1986 and 1990.{{sfn|Wertheim|2007|p=147}}{{sfn|Review of delivered vessels since 1980.}} The keel for the second ship that was to be named ''Rab'' (DBM-242) was laid down in 1990.{{sfn|Wertheim|2007|p=147}}{{sfn|Flotila HRM}} As the Croatian War of Independence started, unfinished ''Rab'' was captured by Croatian forces. It was completed and launched as ''Cetina'' (DBM-81) on 18 July 1992. A third and final ship was launched on 17 September 1994 as ''Krka'' (DBM-82).{{sfn|Flotila HRM}}

== Description ==
These ferry-like ships feature a [[roll-on/roll-off]] design with two loading ramps located on the bow and the stern.{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=164}} Measuring {{convert|49.69|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in length, they have a {{convert|10.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} beam with a {{convert|2.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} draft. Propulsion consists of two {{convert|1140|kW|abbr=on|lk=in}} [[Burmeister &amp; Wain]] Alpha Diesel 10V 23L VO engines mounted on two shafts, enabling them a maximum speed of {{convert|12.5|kn|lk=in}} and a cruising speed of {{convert|12|kn}}. Traveling at their cruise speed they have a range of {{convert|1200|-|1400|nmi|lk=in}} with a 12-day endurance. The ships are manned by a crew of 32.{{sfn|Brodovi flote HRM u vježbi &quot;Phiblex&quot;}}

The Armament configuration differs between the first two ships and the last one; DBM-241 and DBM-81 are armed with two [[AK-230]] [[CIWS]] mounted on the sides, a single quadruple {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=in}} M-75 gun on the stern and a single quadruple MTU-4 [[Strela 2|9K32M Strela-2M]] (SA-7b &quot;Grail&quot;) anti-aircraft missile launcher. The interior, which features two mine rails, can be used to carry up to 152 different naval mines, six [[medium tank]]s or 300 troops with equipment, a total cargo capacity of {{convert|460|t|LT|abbr=on|lk=in}}. DBM-82 was completed with a different gun armament; in place of the AK-230, DBM-82 has two 20 mm M-71 guns on the sides and a single [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors D70 {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] gun on the bow. The ship was also completed as an auxiliary water carrier with a capacity of around {{convert|230|t|LT|abbr=on}} of fresh water.{{sfn|Čizmić|8 August 2007}}{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=164}} The number of mines that DBM-82 can carry is a maximum of 114.{{sfn|Flotila HRM}}

== Service history ==
[[File:AK-230 DBM-81 Cetina.JPG|thumb|right|250px|AK-230 on ''Cetina'' photographed in 2010]]
At the start of the Croatian War of Independence DBM-241 was relocated to [[Montenegro]] where it later entered service with the [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|SR Yugoslav Navy]]. DBM-242, now redesignated as DBM-81 was launched as ''Cetina'' and entered service with the Croatian Navy 19 February 1992 with Ivo Raffanelli in command. For the remainder of the war, ''Cetina'' was engaged in transporting troops and equipment along the coast, including supply runs for Croatian forces during [[Operation Maslenica]] in 1993. The same year the ship participated in testing of the new MNS-M90 naval mine. DBM-82, the third and final ship of the class, was commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 9 March 1995 with Jerko Bošnjak in command.{{sfn|Flotila HRM}}

According to publications and news reports, DBM-241 was reported operational as late as 2005.{{sfn|Kalajdžić|16 April 2004}}{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=653}} An article published in October 2012 reported that the [[Egyptian Navy]] bought DBM-241 a year earlier. Although the advance was paid, the official handover of the ship has not happened by the time the article was published.{{sfn|Luković|16 October 2012}} As of March 2014, the official website of the Armed Forces of Montenegro does not list DBM-241 among its fleet and the ships status remains unknown.{{sfn|Naoružanje i oprema Mornarice}} The two ''Silba''-class in Croatian hands continue to see service the Navy Flotilla performing traditional naval tasks as well as support missions for civilian institutions such water supply and transporting firefighters.{{sfn|Čizmić|8 August 2007}}{{sfn|Puljizević|May 2011}} 
[[File:Cetina i Krka 170909.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Cetina'' and ''Krka'' in [[Rijeka]], 2009]]
In July 2006 ''Krka'' was damaged during an overhaul at the [[Šibenik]] Shipyard. While being lowered to the sea, the winch of the [[syncrolift]] pulled out of the concrete causing the ship to fall down, creating a hole in the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.{{sfn|Jutarnji list|4 July 2006}}{{sfn|Grubač|12 July 2006}}

In 2015, ''Krka'' and ''Cetina'' were tasked with transporting [[Croatian Army]] vehicles and personnel to [[Spain]] for the [[NATO]] &quot;Trident Juncture&quot; exercise. The ships departed the [[Lora Naval Base]] on 11 October 2015, loaded with four [[Patria AMV]]s, two trucks, one motor vehicle and 14 soldiers scheduled to take part in the exercise.{{sfn|Valentić Mikšik|22 October 2015}} On 13 October they arrived in [[Catania]] where they rendezvoused with [[Croatian training ship Andrija Mohorovičić|''Andrija Mohorovičić'']] deployed in support of [[Operation Triton]]. The two ships made another stop at [[Cagliari]] before continuing to Spain, arriving in [[Sagunto]] on 18 October after spending seven days at sea.{{sfn|Knežević|18 October 2015}} The ships returned to the Lora Naval Base on 13 November, concluding their month long deployment during which they traversed a total of {{convert|2700|nmi|abbr=off|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Povratak brodova HRM-a s NATO vježbe u Španjolskoj|13 November 2015}}
