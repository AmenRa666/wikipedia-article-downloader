{{Campaignbox Rhodesian Bush War}}
'''Air Rhodesia Flight 825''' was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA) on 3 September 1978, during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. The aircraft involved, a [[Vickers Viscount]] named the ''Hunyani'', was flying the last leg of [[Air Rhodesia]]'s regular scheduled service from [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] to the capital [[Harare|Salisbury]], via the resort town of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]].

Soon after Flight 825 took off, a group of ZIPRA guerrillas scored a direct hit on its [[Port and starboard|starboard]] wing with a Soviet-made [[9K32 Strela-2|Strela-2]] surface-to-air [[infrared homing]] missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an [[emergency landing]]. An attempted [[belly landing]] in a cotton field just west of [[Karoi]] was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived.

ZIPRA leader [[Joshua Nkomo]] publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the ''Hunyani'' in an interview with the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white,&lt;ref name=nyarota62/&gt; saw the attack as an act of terrorism.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt; A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind.&lt;ref name=nyarota62/&gt; Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.

Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a &quot;monster&quot;.&lt;ref name=moorcraft154/&gt; On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of [[martial law]] over selected areas. The [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were [[refugee]]s camping in and around guerrilla positions.&lt;ref name=moorcraft155/&gt; In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident.

==Background==
[[File:Zimbabwe in Africa.svg|thumb|[[Rhodesia]] (or [[Southern Rhodesia]]), highlighted in red on a map of Africa|alt=A map. See description]]
A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the [[self-governing colony]] of [[Rhodesia]] (or [[Southern Rhodesia]]){{refn|group=n|name=zimbabwe}} led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], to [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declare independence]] from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of &quot;[[no independence before majority rule]]&quot; had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid [[decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]], and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white minority]], so the unilateral declaration went [[list of states with limited recognition|unrecognised]] internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;wood2008pp1to8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wood

|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), mostly comprising [[Shona people|Shona]]s, created the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of [[Maoism|Maoist]] doctrine, while the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]-dominated [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style [[Marxism–Leninism]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], mobilised the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA).&lt;ref name=nationalists&gt;{{Harvnb

The &quot;First ''Chimurenga''&quot; in question is the [[Second Matabele War]], fought by the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] and [[Shona people]]s (separately) against the [[company rule in Rhodesia|administration]] of [[Cecil Rhodes]]' [[British South Africa Company]] between 1896 and 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;moorcraft75&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb

The resulting conflict, the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;binda133136&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb

|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour. The leftist [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a [[People's Republic of Mozambique|communist state]] openly allied with ZANU. Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a [[détente]] initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup.&lt;ref name=&quot;cilliers22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb

In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], the Reverend [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] and Chief [[Jeremiah Chirau]] agreed what became the &quot;[[Internal Settlement]]&quot;. This created a joint black–white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in 1979, pursuant to [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|multiracial elections]]. ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith's black colleagues &quot;the blacksmiths&quot;.&lt;ref name=binda07327/&gt; ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be &quot;The Year of the People&quot; as the war continued.&lt;ref name=binda07327&gt;{{Harvnb

The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in [[Lusaka]], Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation [[Lonmin|Lonrho]]. Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader [[Robert Mugabe]], but Mugabe would have no part in the talks.&lt;ref name=&quot;moorcraft153154&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb

On 2 September, Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place.&lt;ref name=cilliers47&gt;{{Harvnb

==Incident==

===Prior threats to Rhodesian air traffic===

Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977, in the latter stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the [[9K32 Strela-2|Strela-2]] shoulder-launched [[Man-portable air-defense system|surface-to-air missile launcher]], supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] from the mid-1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact's materiel support.{{refn|ZANLA, aligned with China rather than the Soviets, never received such weapons. ZANLA's Mozambican ally, [[FRELIMO]], did receive Soviet arms, and reportedly had Strela-2 launchers as early as 1973.&lt;ref name=moorcraft97/&gt;|group=&quot;n&quot;}} By September 1978, there had been 20&amp;nbsp;reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some [[Rhodesian Air Force]] [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]]s had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War.&lt;ref name=&quot;moorcraft97&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb

===Flight===
[[File:Central African Airways Vickers Viscount Groves.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Viscount]] of [[Central African Airways]], [[Air Rhodesia]]'s predecessor, in 1957|alt=A Vickers Viscount aircraft on a runway, photographed from the port side]]
[[Air Rhodesia]] was the country's [[flag carrier|national airline]], established by the government on 1 September 1967 to succeed [[Central African Airways]], which was dissolved at the end of that year. Based at [[Harare International Airport|Salisbury Airport]], Air Rhodesia's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights, as well as international services to the South African cities of [[Johannesburg]] and [[Durban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Flight International
|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flight 825 aircraft was a [[Vickers Viscount]] 782D, a British-made [[turboprop]] aircraft with two engines on each wing. It was named the ''Hunyani'' after the [[Manyame River|river of the same name]], which flowed between [[Lake Kariba]] and the Rhodesian capital [[Harare|Salisbury]].&lt;ref name=nyarota62/&gt;

The ''Hunyani'' was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]].&lt;ref name=smith266/&gt; Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the [[Zambezi]] (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist destinations.&lt;ref name=nyarota62/&gt; The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, most of whom were holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake.&lt;ref name=nyarota62/&gt; The flight took off from [[Kariba Airport]] on schedule soon after 17:00 [[Central Africa Time]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, a native of [[Bulawayo]] who had gained his [[commercial pilot licence]] in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21 years old and from Bulawayo, and 23-year-old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury.&lt;ref name=lindsellstewart/&gt;

|caption=Flight 825 was shot down soon after taking off from Kariba.
}}
A group of ZIPRA guerrillas, armed with a Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the ''Hunyani'' about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the [[climb phase]] of its flight.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The [[infrared homing|heat-seeking]] missile hit the plane's [[port and starboard|starboard]] wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the ''Hunyani'' began to descend rapidly.&lt;ref name=nyarota62/&gt;

At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to [[air traffic control]], informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. &quot;We're going in,&quot; he radioed.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Telling his passengers to brace for an [[emergency landing]], he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of [[Karoi]], intending to [[belly landing|belly land]] the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the ''Hunyani'' hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze.&lt;ref name=petterbowyer331/&gt;

===Massacre on the ground===
Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of the wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water.&lt;ref name=heraldreporters&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rhodesia Herald
|5 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45.&lt;ref name=lindsellstewart/&gt; Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).&lt;ref name=lindsellstewart/&gt;

The guerrillas, who were armed with [[AK-47]] rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves. They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others. The passengers were assembled into an area of about {{convert|10|m2|ft2}}. Standing roughly {{convert|15|m|ft}} away, the cadres now raised their weapons. &quot;You have taken our land,&quot; one of them said.&lt;ref name=lindsellstewart&gt;{{Harvnb
|Lindsell-Stewart
|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Please don't shoot us!&quot; one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire.{{refn|Hidden in the bush surrounding the crash site, Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen avoided being spotted by the cadres, but were still close enough to see and hear what was happening by the plane wreckage.

Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots. Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren's group to &quot;come here&quot;.&lt;ref name=platts/&gt; The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee.&lt;ref name=platts&gt;{{Harvnb

After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19:45. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with passengers' belongings, then left again.&lt;ref name=lindsellstewart/&gt;

The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to Kariba Hospital, while MacLaren and his group were airlifted to [[Parirenyatwa Hospital|Andrew Fleming Hospital]] in Salisbury.&lt;ref name=heraldreporters/&gt;

===Nkomo claims responsibility, but denies killing survivors===

Nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' radio programme the next day, laughing as he did so,&lt;ref name=donovan&gt;{{Harvnb

Black and white united in condemnation of the shooting down of Flight 825 and the senseless loss of innocent lives. Reports that ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo had laughed about the incident when interviewed on television by the BBC were met with utter revulsion.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Nkomo asserted in his 1984 memoirs that he had laughed because of his evasiveness during the interview.

According to Eliakim Sibanda, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU, Nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the mixed race [[Selous Scouts]] unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion. Sibanda asserts that the massacre &quot;cannot be put beyond&quot; the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo's claim that the ''Hunyani'' had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board. &quot;Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job,&quot; he writes, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;[and] ZIPRA intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [at Victoria Falls]&quot;.&lt;ref name=sibanda191912&gt;{{Harvnb

==Reactions==

===Racial tensions===
A report published in the American magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' a fortnight later described the incident as &quot;a genuine horror story, calculated to make the most alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true.&quot;&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The white community in Rhodesia heard the news with fury, and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism.&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;{{Harvnb

|Time
|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours.&lt;ref name=nyarota63/&gt; Smith wrote in his memoirs that the &quot;degree of anger&amp;nbsp;... [was] difficult to control&quot;.&lt;ref name=smith266/&gt; White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of [[South African rand|R]]100,000 to anybody who would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial.&lt;ref name=sibanda191912/&gt;

[[Geoffrey Nyarota]], who was then one of the few black reporters at the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'' newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be &quot;terrorist sympathisers&quot;.&lt;ref name=nyarota63/&gt; Describing the ''Herald'' newsroom the night of the incident, he relates a &quot;vile collective temper&quot; among the white [[Copy editing|sub-editors]]: &quot;They cursed until their voices became hoarse, threatening dire consequences for all ''terrs'' and ''munts'' or ''kaffirs''...&amp;nbsp;I sensed that some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears.&quot;&lt;ref name=nyarota63&gt;{{Harvnb

Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days. According to the ''Time'' article, a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury bar &quot;fingering the triggers of rifles&quot; and forced blacks drinking there to leave.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; ''Time'' also reported a rumour that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Smith says that several would-be [[vigilante]] groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to &quot;make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists&quot;.&lt;ref name=smith266/&gt; He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, and that it would not do to attack them.&lt;ref name=smith266&gt;{{Harvnb
|Smith

|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target.&lt;ref name=petterbowyer331/&gt;

===Memorial service, 8 September 1978===
[[File:Anglican Cathedral, Salisbury Rhodesia ca1975 6899218321.jpg|thumb|The Anglican Cathedral of St Mary and All Saints in Salisbury was the location of the memorial service on 8 September 1978.|alt=A small stone cathedral, viewed from across the street]]
At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and [[South African Airways]] personnel, as well as [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including [[P. K. van der Byl|P&amp;nbsp;K van der Byl]], the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=heraldmemorial&gt;{{Harvnb|Rhodesia Herald|9 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] John de Costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a &quot;deafening silence&quot; from overseas. &quot;Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the Viscount,&quot; he said. &quot;But are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised? We are not! Like men in the story of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]], they pass by on the other side&lt;ref name=petterbowyer331&gt;{{Harvnb

===Smith–Nkomo talks halted===
The talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called Nkomo a &quot;monster&quot;.&lt;ref name=moorcraft154&gt;{{Harvnb
|Moorcraft
|McLaughlin

|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith–Nkomo talks at this time was &quot;potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre&quot;,&lt;ref name=cilliers47/&gt; as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two &quot;at this critical stage&quot; might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;cilliers47&quot;/&gt;

On 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of [[martial law]], which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to &quot;liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism&quot;, and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for &quot;any defensive strikes we might undertake&quot; against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

==Rhodesia strikes back==

===Operation ''Snoopy''; Rhodesia hits New Chimoio===

Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country,&lt;ref name=moorcraft154/&gt; but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around [[Chimoio]] in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during [[Operation Dingo|Operation ''Dingo'']], destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called &quot;New Chimoio&quot;, slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation ''Snoopy'', the Rhodesian Air Force, [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978.&lt;ref name=petterbowyer331/&gt; Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid in the form of nine Soviet-made [[T-54/55|T-54]] tanks and four Russian [[BTR-152]] armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were &quot;several hundred&quot; guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a [[friendly fire|friendly]] air strike.&lt;ref name=moorcraft154/&gt;

Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA's bases in Zambia, in what Group Captain Peter Petter-Bowyer later described as &quot;payback time&quot; for Flight 825.&lt;ref name=pb333&gt;{{Harvnb
|Petter-Bowyer
|2005
|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation ''Gatling'', launched on 19 October 1978, was another joint-force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers. ''Gatling''{{'s}} primary target, just {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=off}} north-east of central Lusaka, was the formerly white-owned Westlands Farm, which had been transformed into ZIPRA's main headquarters and training base under the name &quot;Freedom Camp&quot;. ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka. About 4,000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp, with senior ZIPRA staff also on site.&lt;ref name=pb333/&gt; The Rhodesian operation's other targets were Chikumbi, {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} north of Lusaka, and Mkushi Camp; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked.&lt;ref name=moorcraft155/&gt;

Led by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to [[Lusaka International Airport|Lusaka Airport]] tower as &quot;Green Leader&quot;, a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes (thereby avoiding Zambian radar) and took control of the country's [[airspace]] for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on Westlands Farm, informing Lusaka tower that the attack was against &quot;Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia&quot;, and that Rhodesian [[Hawker Hunter]]s were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader's instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic.&lt;ref name=moorcraft135144&gt;{{Harvnb
|Moorcraft
|McLaughlin
|2008
|pp=135–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Rufunsa District|Rufunsa]] airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three-day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors.&lt;ref name=moorcraft155/&gt;

Historians [[Paul Moorcraft]] and [[Peter McLaughlin]] write that this exaggerated considerably the number of guerrillas killed, as most of Nkomo's army, then numbering about 10,000 fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed [[refugee]]s often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been &quot;impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits.&quot;&lt;ref name=moorcraft155/&gt; Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as &quot;a refugee camp for boys&quot;,&lt;ref name=sibanda191912/&gt; and says &quot;351 boys and girls&quot; were killed.&lt;ref name=sibanda191912/&gt; He claims that the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN Refugee Agency]] &quot;confirmed ZAPU's claim that Smith's forces struck at defenseless, civilian trainees&quot;.&lt;ref name=sibanda191912/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and ZIPRA bases did much to restore white morale following the Viscount incident, though they had not made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns. Nkomo and the Zambian President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia's rural areas, and covered three-quarters of the country by the end of 1978.&lt;ref name=moorcraft155&gt;{{Harvnb
|Moorcraft
|McLaughlin
|2008
|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing {{nobreak|anti-Strela}} shielding for its Viscounts. Before this work was completed, ZIPRA shot down a second Viscount, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], on 12 February 1979. This time there were no survivors.&lt;ref name=petterbowyer331/&gt;

Following the second shootdown, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the Viscounts would be coated with {{nobreak|low-radiation}} paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the Strela's targeting system once it was over {{convert|2000|ft}}. There were no further Viscount shootdowns in Rhodesia.&lt;ref name=petterbowyer331/&gt;

In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by ZANU and ZAPU, Muzorewa won a majority, and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted, {{nobreak|majority-ruled}} state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979.&lt;ref name=hackland289&gt;{{Harvnb

The UK government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period.&lt;ref name=&quot;gb89&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb

In modern Zimbabwe, it is not the Viscount shootdowns but rather the retributory Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory. State media in Zimbabwe, prominently the ''Herald'' newspaper, often claim that Rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations.&lt;ref name=herald2013/&gt; ZIPRA's downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board.&lt;ref name=herald2013&gt;{{Harvnb

A British parliamentary motion put forward by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Kate Hoey]] in February 2013 to retrospectively condemn the Viscount attacks and memorialise the victims on the anniversary of the second shootdown prompted outcry in the Zimbabwean press, with the ''Herald'' branding it a racist &quot;[[Rhodie]] motion&quot; intended to antagonise the Mugabe administration and its supporters.&lt;ref name=herald2013/&gt; [[Dumiso Dabengwa]], a former ZIPRA commander, described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. Christopher Mutsvangwa, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling Hoey's proposed commemoration &quot;a provocation&amp;nbsp;... [that] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Herald|2013 b}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZAPU's official response to Hoey's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts &quot;civilians get caught up in cross-fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors&quot;, and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount shootdowns with those killed at Chikumbi.&lt;ref name=ZAPUps&gt;{{Harvnb
