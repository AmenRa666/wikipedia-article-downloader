[[Vice admiral (Australia)|Vice Admiral]] '''Sir Roy Russell Dowling''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|KCVO|KBE|CB|DSO}} (28&amp;nbsp;May 1901&amp;nbsp;– 15&amp;nbsp;April 1969) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). He served as [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Naval Staff]] (CNS), the RAN's highest-ranking position, from 1955 until 1959, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], from 1959 until 1961.

Born in northern [[New South Wales]], Dowling entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] in 1915. After graduating in 1919 he went to sea aboard various [[Royal Navy]] and RAN vessels, and later specialised in gunnery. In 1937, he was given command of the sloop {{HMAS|Swan|U74|6}}. Following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, he saw action in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]] as [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]] of the Royal Navy cruiser {{HMS|Naiad|93|6}}, and survived her sinking by a German [[U-boat]] in March 1942. Returning to Australia, he served as Director of Plans and later Deputy Chief of Naval Staff before taking command of the light cruiser {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} in November 1944. His achievements in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]].

Dowling took command of the RAN's first aircraft carrier, {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}}, in 1948. He became Chief of Naval Personnel in 1950, and [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet]] in 1953. Soon after taking up the position of CNS in February 1955, he was promoted to vice admiral and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]. As CNS he had to deal with shortages of money, manpower and equipment, and with the increasing role of the United States in Australia's defence planning, at the expense of traditional ties with Britain. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1957, Dowling was Chairman of COSC from March 1959 until May 1961, when he retired from the military. In 1963 he was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] and became Australian Secretary to [[Queen Elizabeth II]], serving until his death in 1969.

==Pre-war career==
[[File:Dowling1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Formal head-and-shoulders portrait of young man in winter naval uniform with peaked cap|Lieutenant Dowling, 1927]]
Roy Russell Dowling was born on 28&amp;nbsp;May 1901 in [[Condong, New South Wales|Condong]], a township on the [[Tweed River (New South Wales)|Tweed River]] in northern New South Wales. His parents were sugar cane inspector Russell Dowling and his wife Lily. The youth entered the [[Royal Australian Naval College]] (RANC) at [[Jervis Bay]], [[Australian Capital Territory|Federal Capital Territory]], in 1915. An underachiever academically, he excelled at sports, and became chief cadet captain before graduating in 1918 with the King's Medal, awarded for &quot;gentlemanly bearing, character, good influence among his fellows and officer-like qualities&quot;.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140028b.htm |title=Dowling, Sir Roy Russell|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ranc&gt;Eldridge, ''A History of the Royal Australian Naval College'', pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was posted to Britain as a [[midshipman]], undergoing training with the [[Royal Navy]] and seeing service on {{HMS|Ramillies|07|6}} and {{HMS|Venturous|D87|6}}.&lt;ref name=Dennis&gt;Dennis et al., ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1923 he was back in Australia, serving aboard the cruiser {{HMAS|Adelaide|1918|6}}. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in March.&lt;ref name=file&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=933160 |title=Personal Record&amp;nbsp;– Dowling, Roy R.|page= 2|publisher= [[National Archives of Australia]]|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1924, ''Adelaide'' joined the Royal Navy's [[Cruise of the Special Service Squadron|Special Service Squadron on its worldwide cruise]], taking in New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Panama, and the West Indies, before docking in September at [[Portsmouth]], England. There Dowling left the ship for his next appointment, training as a gunnery officer and serving in that capacity at {{HMS|Excellent|shore establishment|6}}.&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-adelaide-i |title=HMAS Adelaide (I) |publisher=[[Royal Australian Navy]] |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to Australia in December 1926, Dowling spent eighteen months on {{HMAS|Platypus|1917|6}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|G90|6}}, where he continued to specialise in gunnery. In July 1928, he took on an instructional role at the gunnery school in [[HMAS Cerberus (naval base)|Flinders Naval Depot]] on [[Western Port Bay]], Victoria. He married Jessie Blanch in [[Melbourne]] on 8&amp;nbsp;May 1930; the couple had two sons and three daughters.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legge&gt;Legge, ''Who's Who in Australia 1968'', p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Jessie accompanied him on his next posting to Britain commencing in January 1931. He was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] on 15&amp;nbsp;March, and was appointed gunnery officer on the light cruiser {{HMS|Colombo|D89|6}} in May. Dowling returned to Australia in January 1933, and was appointed squadron gunnery officer aboard the heavy cruiser {{HMAS|Canberra|D33|6}} that April.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=file/&gt; The ship operated mainly within Australian waters over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-canberra-i |title=HMAS Canberra (I) |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1935, Dowling took charge of the gunnery school at Flinders Naval Depot. He was promoted to [[commander]] on 31&amp;nbsp;December 1936.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=file/&gt; The following month, he assumed command of the newly commissioned [[Grimsby-class sloop|''Grimsby''-class]] sloop {{HMAS|Swan|U74|6}}, carrying out duties in the South West Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-swan-ii |title=HMAS Swan (II) |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his tenure on ''Swan'' in January 1939, he was briefly assigned to the Navy Office, Melbourne, before returning to Britain in March for duty at [[HMS Pembroke#Shore establishments|HMS ''Pembroke'']], where he awaited posting aboard the yet-to-be-commissioned anti-aircraft cruiser, {{HMS|Naiad|93|6}}.&lt;ref name=file/&gt;

==World War II==
Dowling became [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]] on HMS ''Naiad'' when the ship was commissioned in 1940. Following service with the British [[Home Fleet]], the cruiser transferred to the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Station]] in May 1941, where she took part in the [[Battle of Crete]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legge&quot;/&gt; She was involved in action against German [[torpedo boat]]s on the night of 20/21 May. On 22&amp;nbsp;May, after engaging a German destroyer with {{HMAS|Perth|D29|6}}, ''Naiad'' was severely damaged by air attack.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol1/awmohww2-navy-vol1-ch9.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 344–346]&lt;/ref&gt; Following repairs, she became [[flagship]] of the 15th Cruiser Squadron and conducted shore bombardments in support of Allied troops during the [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign|Syrian campaign]] in June and July.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol1/awmohww2-navy-vol1-ch10.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 379–382]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also escorted [[Malta Convoys|convoys resupplying Malta]]. In December, ''Naiad'' participated in the [[First Battle of Sirte]] against Italian naval forces. On 11&amp;nbsp;March 1942, she was torpedoed by a German [[U-boat]] off the Egyptian coast, and sank in just over twenty minutes.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Dowling remained in the water for an hour and a half before being rescued by a destroyer.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|title=Admiral will take orders from wife|work=[[The Age]]|location=Melbourne|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wzlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XJUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=admiral%20dowling&amp;pg=7167%2C242874|page=4|date=4 July 1962|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having survived ''Naiad''{{'}}s sinking, Dowling returned to Australia and was appointed Director of Plans at the Navy Office in July 1942.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; In September the following year he was made Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (DCNS) and raised to acting [[Captain (naval)|captain]]; his rank became substantive in June 1944.&lt;ref name=ranc/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legge/&gt; As DCNS, he was involved in planning the post-war Navy's composition, which for the first time was to include [[aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He defined the functions of maritime power in October 1943 as:&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

(iv) Defence of our bases.
&lt;!--—Captain R.R Dowling, DCNS, October 1943--&gt;}}

In November 1944, Dowling was given command of the light cruiser {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}}, which had been undergoing repair and refit in Sydney since being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] on 20&amp;nbsp;July 1943.&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hobart&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-hobart-i |title=HMAS Hobart (I)|publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowling took her on her shakedown cruise to Melbourne on 30&amp;nbsp;December, before embarking for the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]] in February 1945. The following month, ''Hobart'' supported the US forces that recaptured [[Cebu]] during the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|liberation of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol2/awmohww2-navy-vol2-ch9.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', p. 292]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol2/awmohww2-navy-vol2-ch22.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', pp. 600–603]&lt;/ref&gt; She bombarded [[Tarakan Island]] prior to the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Allied invasion]] on 1&amp;nbsp;May and, later that month, covered the [[6th Division (Australia)|Australian 6th Division]]'s [[Aitape–Wewak campaign|operations at Wewak]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol2/awmohww2-navy-vol2-ch23.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', pp. 619–623]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol2/awmohww2-navy-vol2-ch24.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', pp. 629–631]&lt;/ref&gt; The cruiser supported the [[Battle of North Borneo|Allied landings on Brunei]] in June, and on [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Balikpapan]] in July.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol2/awmohww2-navy-vol2-ch25.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', pp. 639–642]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol2/awmohww2-navy-vol2-ch26.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945'', pp. 649–652]&lt;/ref&gt; For his &quot;outstanding courage, skill and initiative&quot; during these operations, Dowling was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO), [[The London Gazette|gazetted]] on 6&amp;nbsp;November 1945.&lt;ref name=ranc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37338|supp=yes|startpage=5399|date=6 November 1945|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==

Dowling joined the Australian contingent at the [[surrender of Japan]] in Tokyo Bay on 2&amp;nbsp;September 1945. Following the cessation of hostilities, ''Hobart'' became flagship of HM Australian Squadron, and Dowling flag captain and chief of staff to Commodore [[John Augustine Collins|John Collins]], the squadron commander.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (October 1945)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1945.pdf|pages=8, 12|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had taken a toll on Dowling's health, and he required leave before commencing his next appointment in May 1946 as Director of Ordnance, Torpedoes and Mines at the Navy Office.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ranc/&gt; Rear Admiral [[James Goldrick]], in the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', observed that Dowling &quot;was thrust into the highest positions of the RAN largely as a result of the heavy casualties of World War&amp;nbsp;II&quot;. When John Armstrong—the only similarly qualified and more senior Navy captain—was pronounced unfit for seagoing duty, Dowling was given the chance to command Australia's first aircraft carrier, {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}}, commissioned in England on 16&amp;nbsp;December 1948. In April the following year, two months after the ship's belated acceptance into service due to teething troubles, Dowling embarked ''Sydney'' for Australia with two squadrons of fighters aboard.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-sydney-iii  |title=HMAS Sydney (III) |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1950, he was promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] and appointed Second Naval Member and Chief of Naval Personnel, serving in this capacity until the end of 1952. His term coincided with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], and resultant increased demands on manpower.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt; Dowling was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1953 [[New Year Honours]], before travelling to London to attend the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]].&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39734|supp=yes|startpage=39|date=1 January 1953|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised to [[rear admiral]] in July 1953, he returned home to take up the post of [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet]] that December, serving through the following year. He had  to preside over cutbacks to operations brought on by government stringency after the end of the Korean War.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt;

On 24&amp;nbsp;February 1955, Dowling succeeded Vice Admiral Sir John Collins as [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|First Naval Member, Australian Commonwealth Naval Board, and Chief of Naval Staff]] (CNS).&lt;ref name=RAN&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 310–312&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[vice admiral]] on 7&amp;nbsp;June, and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (July 1955)| location=Melbourne| url= http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-July-1955.pdf|page=20|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40498|supp=yes|startpage=3297|date=9 June 1955|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June, he joined fellow chiefs of staff Lieutenant General [[Henry Wells (general)|Henry Wells]] and Air Marshal [[John McCauley]], Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]], and senior government members in approving a draft directive for the role of the [[Far East Strategic Reserve]] (FESR); this made Commonwealth forces available for the fight against [[Malayan Emergency|communist insurgents in Malaya]], as well as for the security of Malaya and [[Singapore]] against external aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Crises and Commitments'', pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy's contribution to the FESR was to be at least two destroyers or frigates on an ongoing basis, as well as a yearly visit by an aircraft carrier. The destroyers {{HMAS|Arunta|I30|6}} and {{HMAS|Warramunga|I44|6}}, already in the region on an exercise, were immediately committed, and Dowling flew to Singapore to personally announce the plan and the reasons for it to the ships' crews.&lt;ref&gt;Pfennigwerth, ''Tiger Territory'', pp. 56–58, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowling was an early advocate for the establishment of an Australian submarine fleet; in 1963, after several false starts, the first of six [[Oberon-class submarine|''Oberon''-class submarines]] was ordered.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al., ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of a general Western trend that viewed with alarm the increasing capability of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s surface fleet, Dowling also worked to improve the offensive power of the [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]]. In March 1956, he went so far as proposing purchase of nuclear weaponry for the RAN's [[De Havilland Sea Venom]]s. During much of Dowling's remaining time as CNS, faced with the obsolescence of HMAS ''Sydney'' and in accordance with its two-carrier policy, the Navy tried unsuccessfully to acquire a new and larger aircraft carrier to augment {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; Believing in the maintenance of traditionally close ties between the RAN and the Royal Navy, he worked to coordinate his policies as CNS with those of Britain's [[First Sea Lord]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt; Taking into account the provisions of the [[ANZUS]] treaty and the absence of suitable supplies from Britain, the RAN began to turn reluctantly towards the United States in terms of strategy and equipment,&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt; as Dowling explained to Mountbatten:

{{quote|We now find ourselves at the crossroads because we very much doubt whether the United Kingdom can provide us with what we want in the future.

Our very telling reason is of course that, certainly in a global war, our salvation in the Pacific will depend chiefly on the aid of that country. For that we are not less loyal members of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other issues facing the RAN during Dowling's term as CNS were its relegation—since the beginning of the 1950s—to third place behind the other armed forces in terms of Federal budget allocations, its replacement by the RAAF as the country's first line of defence, and a shortage of manpower. Dowling himself considered &quot;separation from families, lack of houses, over employment, high wages and overtime payment in civvie street&quot; as the causes for the Navy's inability to attract and retain personnel; the Allison Report in 1958 resulted in various improvements to service conditions, which helped reduce wastage.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 189, 194&lt;/ref&gt; The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930, and Dowling was pleased to be able to oversee its return to Jervis Bay in 1958, the year before he relocated the office of the CNS to Canberra.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/establishments/hmas-creswell|title=HMAS ''Creswell''|publisher= Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowling was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in the 1957 New Year Honours,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40961|supp=yes|startpage=42|date=1 January 1957|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and completed his term as CNS on 23&amp;nbsp;February 1959.&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; On 23&amp;nbsp;March he took over from Sir Henry Wells as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), a role foreshadowing that of the latter-day [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]].&lt;ref name=CDF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/cdf/PreviousChiefs.asp |title=Chief of the Defence Force|publisher= [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navyhistory.org.au/research/on-this-day/on-this-day-date-lookup/ |title=Australian Naval History on 23 March 1959|publisher=[[Naval Historical Society of Australia]]|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral [[Henry Burrell (admiral)|Henry Burrell]].&lt;ref name=RAN/&gt; Happily surprised by his appointment as Chairman of COSC, Dowling hoped to transform the position such that it would exercise command authority over the service chiefs, but in this he was to be disappointed. The position's rank remained the same as the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and was only responsible for putting their views on military matters to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Making the Australian Defence Force'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Other setbacks during his tenure included the Defence Department's decision—rescinded after his term—to disband the Fleet Air Arm, and the Federal government's failure to back him when he announced at a [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] press conference in March 1961 that Australia was prepared to intervene militarily in the [[Laotian Civil War|second Laotian crisis]] should it become necessary.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt; In September 1959, during the first Laotian crisis, the Australian government had authorised Dowling to commit &quot;an infantry battalion, a squadron of RAAF fighters, air transport, and two RAN destroyers&quot; to support US and SEATO forces, but no intervention took place.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Crises and Commitments'',  pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Dowling retired from the military on 27&amp;nbsp;May 1961 and was succeeded as Chairman of COSC by Air Marshal [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]].&lt;ref name=CDF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=N&amp;veteranId=1189370 |title=Dowling, Roy Russell|work=World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though keen to secure a diplomatic appointment, nothing was offered to him and, as a practising [[Church of England|Anglican]], he instead busied himself with church affairs in Canberra. In July 1962, the government gave him responsibility for organising Queen Elizabeth II's upcoming royal tour.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; In this role he was required to liaise with the state governments to plan the Queen's itinerary, and to become a member of the royal household for the duration of the tour, the first time an Australian tour planner had been given such close access to a visiting monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Admiral to plan 1963 tour by Queen|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|location=Sydney|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nn1WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vOUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=admiral%20dowling&amp;pg=4491%2C1224018|page=1|date=6 July 1962|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rewarded with appointment as a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (KCVO) as of 27&amp;nbsp;March 1963, and became Australian Secretary to the Queen on 1&amp;nbsp;November the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=42969|startpage=3327|endpage=3328|date=16 April 1963|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=43148|startpage=8949|date=1 November 1963|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowling was also the [[Australian Red Cross|Australian Red Cross Society]]'s Canberra chairman from 1962 to 1967; at the time he took over the chairmanship, Lady Dowling was acting president of the organisation, in the absence of [[William Oliver (British Army officer)|Lady William Oliver]].&lt;ref name=Legge/&gt;&lt;ref name=age/&gt; Roy Dowling died of a [[coronary occlusion|heart attack]] on 15&amp;nbsp;April 1969 in [[Canberra Hospital]].
