The '''Sacramento Historic City Cemetery''' (or Old City Cemetery), located at 1000 Broadway, at 10th Street, is the oldest existing cemetery in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]]. The cemetery is located at the highest point in Sacramento. It was designed to resemble a Victorian garden and sections that are not located in level areas are surrounded by brick or concrete retaining walls to create level terraces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Old City Cemetery Committee, Inc., Sacramento, California| publisher=Old City Cemetery Committee, Inc.| url= http://www.oldcitycemetery.com/| date=2005| accessdate=March 17, 2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery grounds are noted for their roses which are said to be among the finest in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The cemetery was established in 1849 when Sacramento founder [[John Augustus Sutter, Jr.]] donated {{convert|10|acre|ha|abbr=on}} to the city for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;Sutter, John A., Jr. &amp; Ottley, Allan R. (Ed.). ''Statement: Regarding Early California Experiences''. Sacramento Book Collectors Club. 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; The grounds were landscaped in the Victorian Garden style popular at the time.  In 1850, 600 victims of the [[Cholera]] epidemic that swept the city were buried in mass graves in City Cemetery.  The remainder of the 800 to 1000 victims claimed by the epidemic were buried in the nearby New Helvetia Cemetery, also in mass graves.  Because the New Helvetia Cemetery was prone to flooding, these graves were later transferred to City Cemetery.  In 1852, a monument was erected to those who died. Howerer the exact location of either burial plot is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;committee&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=City Cemetery History| publisher=Old City Cemetery Committee, Inc.| url= http://www.oldcitycemetery.com/history.htm| date=2005| accessdate=January 19, 2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, the city engaged a cemetery superintendent and began to plan the grounds.  In 1857, the gatehouse and bell tower were constructed.  These were demolished in 1949 during the widening of Broadway.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Royston, Hanamoto, Alley &amp; Abey, Landscape Architects and Planners| title=Sacramento Historic Cemetery Master Plan| date=December 11, 2007| publisher=Old City Cemetery, Inc.| accessdate=December 5, 2014| url= http://oldcitycemetery.com/images/PDF/SHCC_MasterPlan.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several fraternal groups purchased sections for their members including the [[Freemasonry|Masons]] (1859), [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] (1861) and the Sacramento Pioneers Association (1862).  The city set aside a section for volunteer firemen in 1858 and members of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] in 1878.

The cemetery continued to acquire additional land through 1880 when Margaret Crocker, widow of [[Edwin B. Crocker]], donated {{convert|23|acre|ha|abbr=on}} to expand the grounds to {{convert|60|acre|ha|abbr=on}} total.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

It was declared a State Historic Landmark on May 5, 1957 by the State Historical Landmarks Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohp&quot;/&gt;

The City of Sacramento owns the cemetery, which today encompasses {{convert|44|acre|ha|abbr=on}}.  In 1986, a group of residents were concerned by the lack of maintenance and ongoing vandalism and formed the Old City Cemetery Committee.  In 1987, the committee became part of the Sacramento County Historical Society and in 2003, it became an independent organization dedicated to the preservation of the historic site.&lt;ref name=&quot;tour&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Self Guided Tour| publisher=Historic City Cemetery, Inc.| date=January 2006| accessdate=January 29, 2011| url= http://www.oldcitycemetery.com/images/PDF/SelfTour.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
