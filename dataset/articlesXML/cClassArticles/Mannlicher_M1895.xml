The '''Mannlicher M1895''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95}}, {{lang-hu|Gyalogsági Ismétlő Puska M95}}; &quot;Infantry Repeating-Rifle M95&quot;) is a [[Bolt action|bolt-action]] rifle, designed by [[Ferdinand Mannlicher|Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher]] that used a refined version of his revolutionary straight-pull action bolt, much like the [[Mannlicher M1890 carbine]]. It was nicknamed the ''Ruck-Zu(rü)ck'' (German slang for &quot;back and forth&quot;) by Austrian troops and &quot;Ta-Pum&quot; by Italian troops who even wrote a song about it during [[World War I]].

The M1895 is unusual in employing a straight-pull bolt action, as opposed to the more common rotating bolt-handle of other rifles. It consequently renowned for combining a high [[rate of fire]] (around 30–35 rounds per minute) with reliability and sturdiness, although this requires decent care and maintenance with an extractor that is vulnerable to breakage due to a lack of primary extraction.

Originally they were chambered for the round-nosed [[8×50mmR Mannlicher|8×50mmR]] cartridge, but almost all were rechambered to accept the more powerful spitzer [[8×56mmR]] cartridge in the 1930s.

== History ==
[[File:Isonzo front colorization.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Austro-Hungarian [[Stormtrooper#Austro-Hungarian Assault Units|Stormtroops]] armed with Mannlicher M95 Stutzens at the [[Isonzo front]] in 1917 (colorized).]]
It was initially adopted and employed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] throughout [[World War I]], and retained post-war by both the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] armies. The main foreign user was [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], which, starting in 1903, acquired large numbers and continued using them throughout [[Balkan Wars|both Balkan]] and World Wars. After Austria-Hungary's defeat in [[World War I]], many were given to other Balkan states as [[war reparations]]. A number of these rifles also saw use in [[World War II]], particularly by second line, reservist, and partisan units in Romania, Yugoslavia, Italy, and to lesser degree, Germany. Post war many were sold as cheap surplus, with some finding their way to the hands of African [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in the 1970s{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and many more being exported to the United States as sporting and collectible firearms.
The M1895 bolt also served as an almost exact template for the ill-fated Canadian M1905 [[Ross rifle]], though the later M1910 used a complicated [[interrupted screw|interrupted-thread]] instead of two solid [[Bolt (firearms)|lugs]].

The M1895 was originally chambered in the 8mm M.1893 scharfe Patrone ([[8×50mmR Mannlicher]]) cartridge. Between the world wars, both Austria and Hungary converted the majority of their rifles to fire the more powerful [[8×56mmR]] round.&lt;br&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hungariae.com/Mann95Se.htm |title=Yugoslavian Mannlicher M.95 Rifles and Carbines |publisher=Manowar's Hungarian Weapons &amp; History |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; converted at least some of their captured M1895s to [[7.92×57mm Mauser]], fed by [[stripper clip]]s instead of the original model's [[Clip (ammunition)#En bloc|en bloc clip]] system. This conversion was designated M95/24 and M95M. The M95/24 is often mistakenly attributed to Bulgaria, but [[8×57mm IS]] was never a standard cartridge of the Bulgarian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hungariae.com/Mann95Bu.htm |title=Bulgarian Mannlicher M.95 Rifles and Carbines |publisher=Manowar's Hungarian Weapons &amp; History |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conversions are prized by collectors for their relative scarcity and chambering in a commonly available round, but suffer from a fragile [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] and a lack of replacement parts.

== Variants ==
For the post World War I conversions see ''[[#Conversions|Conversions]]''.

=== Rifle ===
The ({{lang-de|link=no|Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M1895}}; &quot;Infantry Repeating-Rifle M1895&quot;) was the basic variant. It was chambered for the [[8×50mmR Mannlicher]] cartridge. Its iron sights were graduated 300–2600 [[Pace (unit)|paces]] (225–1950 m). It was used during [[World War I]] by majority of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] troops.

=== Stutzen ===
This stutzen or short rifle (official designation {{lang-de|link=no|Repetier-Stutzen M1895}}; &quot;Repeating-Stutzen M1895&quot;) was mainly used by special troops (i.e. [[Stormtrooper#Austro-Hungarian Assault Units|Storm troops]]) during World War I. It chambered the [[8×50mmR Mannlicher]] cartridge. Its sights were graduated 500–2400 [[Pace (unit)|paces]] (375–1800 m).

Weight: {{convert|3.09|kg|lb}}&lt;br&gt;
Length: {{convert|1003|mm|in}}&lt;br&gt;
Barrel length: {{convert|500|mm|in}}

=== Carbine ===
The carbine (official designation {{lang-de|link=no|Kavaliere Repetier-Carabiner M1895}}; &quot;Cavalry Repeating-Carbine M1895&quot;) was chambered [[8×50mmR Mannlicher]] and used by [[cavalry]] units of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a replacement of the [[Mannlicher M1890 carbine]]. The sights were graduated 500–2400 [[Pace (unit)|paces]] (375–1800 m). Although it originally didn't have [[bayonet lug]]s, during World War I it was fitted with stutzen-like front barrel band with bayonet lugs after mounted cavalry units were found ineffective.

=== Sniper rifle ===
[[File:Mannlicher M1895 sniper rifle.png|thumb|400px|Sniper rifle variant.]]
The main difference from the standard rifle and stutzen was the telescopic sight mount. The scope was mounted slightly to the left so the rifle could be fed by en bloc clip. Approximately 6,000 long and short barreled sniper rifles were made in the years 1915–1918.&lt;ref name=obramba&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=December 2003 |title=[The Mannlicher family] |journal=Revija Obramba |language=Slovenian |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages= |ISSN=0353-9628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conversions ===
[[File:1672 - Salzburg - Festung Hohensalzburg - Repetierstutzen M95-30.JPG|thumb|left|350px|The Mannlicher M95/30 conversion.]]
The '''M95/30''' was a conversion in the [[First Austrian Republic]] by [[Steyr-Mannlicher]] during 1930–1940. These rifles carry the letter '''S''' meaning [[Spitzer (bullet)|Spitzer]] stamped on the barrel. Main modification was the rechambering to [[8×56mmR]] cartridge. Other changes were the conversion of ladder sights from the older [[Pace (unit)|pace]] unit to meters and addition of a brass front sight protector. Many long rifles were cut down to Stutzen length. Most of M95/30s were sent to Bulgaria during 1938–40, where front sight protectors were removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hungariae.com/Mann9530.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1626 - Salzburg - Festung Hohensalzburg - Repetier.JPG|thumb|370px|Various Mannlicher rifles and carbines. The long rifle on far left is an [[Mannlicher M1888|1888 model]] and the carbine in the middle is an [[Mannlicher M1890 carbine|1890 model carbine]]. The rest are various 1895 models.]]

The '''31.M''' or M95/31 was a conversion done in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Rifles were converted 1931–1935 by [[FÉG]] in [[Budapest]] and carry the letter '''H''' meaning Hegyes Töltény (pointed bullet) stamped on top of the chamber. The conversion included rechambering to the new [[8×56mmR]] pointed bullet cartridge, new metric ladder sights and addition of a front-sight protector. Long rifles were cut down to carbine length and designated 31/a.M. They were not used for much time and were withdrawn to storage when the new [[35M rifle]] was introduced. Some were reissued during World War II. A small number were rechambered but were not cut down for the Hungarian Governmental Guards; these had special long bayonets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hungariae.com/Mann31.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''M95M''' or '''M95/24''' was a conversion to [[7.92×57mm]] cartridge by the [[Zastava Arms|Kragujevac Arsenal]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. These rifles feature Yugoslavian [[M24 series|M24 Mauser]] barrels, sights, similar handguards and are fed by five-round stripper clips. Their extractors are prone to breakage when being fired single-shot. Some of these rifles were found in the [[Kingdom of Greece]] by the German forces during World War II and were mistakenly attributed Greek origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hungariae.com/Mann95Se.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://candrsenal.com/rifle-yugoslavian-mannlicher-m95m-and-m9524/&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

There were two main variants of the [[bayonet]]; the first one was the standard bayonet, the second one was the [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] variant that featured a hooked quillion and a golden lanyard. The overall length was {{convert|360|mm|in}} and the blade was {{convert|248|mm|in}} long. The bayonet was unusual in that the edge faced upwards when mounted on the rifle. Majority of them were made by [[Steyr-Mannlicher|Œ.W.G.]] and [[FÉG|F.G.GY.]] Bayonets were originally not serial numbered.

Late in [[World War I]] resources were limited and they started manufacturing ''replacemet'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Ersatz}}) bayonets. These were fast to produce, cheap and made completely out of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-smithy.info/bayonets/HTNL%20DOCUMNETS/austrian%20ersatz.htm|title=Austrian Ersatz Bayonets|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Night sights ===

The front sight clamps around the rifle's front sight base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hungariae.com/Mann95a.htm|title= Mannlicher M95 Rifles and Carbines Accessories|year=2014|website=hungariae.com|access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wire destroyer ===
A ''Drahtzerstörer'' or &quot;wire destroyer&quot; device for Mannlicher type firearms was also sometimes issued with the rifle during World War I. During assaults, when soldiers would run into barbed wire obstacles, the &quot;wire destroyer&quot; would grab one of the wires and the soldier would shoot through it. It could only be used with a mounted bayonet.&lt;br&gt;
Various other improvised wire destroyers existed, some originally deisgned for the [[Mosin–Nagant]] rifle that were captured on the [[Eastern front (World War I)|Eastern front]] were easily modified to fit the M95. Some were also crafted by military blacksmiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ortner |first=Mario Christian |date=2006 |title=Storm Troops |publisher=Militaria Verlag |page= |access-date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
