{{History of Iran}}

The '''Parthian Empire''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|p|…ër|Œ∏|i|…ôn}}; 247&amp;nbsp;BC ‚Äì 224&amp;nbsp;AD), also known as the '''Arsacid Empire''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|…ër|s|…ô|s|…™|d}}),&lt;ref&gt;From [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|·ºàœÅœÉŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ}} ''Arsakƒìs'', from [[Parthian language|Parthian]] {{lang|xpr|ê≠Äê≠ìê≠îê≠ä}} ''Ar≈°ak''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a major [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] political and cultural power in [[ancient Iran]] and [[ancient Iraq|Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waters|1974|p=424}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its latter name comes from [[Arsaces I of Parthia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, as leader of the [[Parni]] tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of [[Parthia]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;roughly western [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]&quot; {{harvnb|Bickerman|1983|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Iran]]'s northeast, then a [[satrap]]y (province) in rebellion against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. [[Mithridates I of Parthia]] (r.&amp;nbsp;''c''.&amp;nbsp;171‚Äì138&amp;nbsp;BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing [[Media (region)|Media]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the [[Euphrates]], in what is now central-eastern [[Turkey]], to eastern [[Iran]]. The empire, located on the [[Silk Road]] trade route between the [[Roman Empire]] in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[Han Empire]] of [[China]], became a center of trade and commerce.

The Parthians largely adopted the art, architecture, religious beliefs, and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed [[Culture of Iran|Persian]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], and regional cultures. For about the first half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]], though it eventually saw a gradual revival of [[Religion and culture in ancient Iran|Iranian traditions]]. The Arsacid rulers were titled the &quot;[[King of Kings]]&quot;, as a claim to be the heirs to the [[Achaemenid Empire]]; indeed, they accepted many local kings as [[vassal]]s where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed, albeit largely autonomous, [[satrap]]s. The court did appoint a small number of satraps, largely outside Iran, but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. With the expansion of Arsacid power, the seat of central government shifted from [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisa]] to [[Ctesiphon]] along the [[Tigris]] (south of modern [[Baghdad]], Iraq), although several other sites also served as capitals.

The earliest enemies of the Parthians were the [[Seleucid‚ÄìParthian wars|Seleucids]] in the west and the [[Scythians]] in the east. However, as Parthia expanded westward, they came into conflict with the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], and eventually the late [[Roman Republic]]. Rome and Parthia competed with each other to establish the [[List of Armenian kings|kings of Armenia]] as their [[Client state|subordinate clients]]. The Parthians soundly defeated [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53&amp;nbsp;BC, and in 40‚Äì39&amp;nbsp;BC, Parthian forces captured the whole of the [[Levant]] except [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] from [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]]. However, [[Mark Antony]] led a [[Antony's Parthian War|counterattack]] against Parthia, although his successes were generally achieved in his absence, under the leadership of his lieutenant [[Publius Ventidius Bassus|Ventidius]]. Also, various Roman emperors or their appointed generals invaded Mesopotamia in the course of the several [[Roman-Parthian Wars]] which ensued during the next few centuries. The Romans captured the cities of [[Seleucia]] and Ctesiphon on multiple occasions during these conflicts, but were never able to hold on to them.

Frequent civil wars between Parthian contenders to the throne proved more dangerous to the Empire's stability than foreign invasion, and Parthian power evaporated when [[Ardashir I]], ruler of [[Estakhr]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, [[Artabanus V of Parthia|Artabanus V]], in 224&amp;nbsp;AD. Ardashir established the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Empire]], which ruled Iran and much of the Near East until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century AD, although the Arsacid dynasty lived on through the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]], the [[Arsacid dynasty of Iberia]], and the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania]]; all eponymous branches of the Parthian Arsacids.

Native Parthian sources, written in [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and other languages, are scarce when compared to Sassanid and even earlier [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] sources. Aside from scattered [[cuneiform]] tablets, fragmentary [[ostraca]], rock inscriptions, [[drachma]] coins, and the chance survival of some [[parchment]] documents, much of Parthian history is only known through external sources. These include mainly [[Greek historiography|Greek]] and [[Roman historiography|Roman histories]], but also [[Chinese historiography|Chinese histories]], prompted by the Han Chinese [[Han-Xiongnu War|desire to form alliances against the Xiongnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ball|2016|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Parthian art]]work is viewed by historians as a valid source for understanding aspects of society and culture that are otherwise absent in textual sources.

==History==

===Origins and establishment===

The one on the left bears the imprint of a man's head, while the one on the right a sitting individual.]]
{{further information|Parni conquest of Parthia}}
Before [[Arsaces I of Parthia]] founded the Arsacid Dynasty, he was chieftain of the [[Parni]], an ancient [[Central-Asia]]n tribe of [[Iranian peoples]] and one of several [[nomad]]ic tribes within the confederation of the [[Dahae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=24‚Äì27}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=83‚Äì84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parni most likely spoke an [[eastern Iranian language]], in contrast to the [[Western Iranian languages|northwestern Iranian language]] spoken at the time in [[Parthia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=24}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was a northeastern province, first under the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]], and then the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=24‚Äì27}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=83‚Äì84}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conquering the region, the Parni adopted [[Parthian language|Parthian]] as the official court language, speaking it alongside [[Middle Persian]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and other languages in the multilingual territories they would conquer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=7‚Äì8}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=83‚Äì84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Why the Arsacid court retroactively chose 247&amp;nbsp;BC as the first year of the Arsacid era is uncertain. [[Adrian David Hugh Bivar|A.D.H. Bivar]] concludes that this was the year the Seleucids lost control of Parthia to [[Andragoras (3rd century BC)|Andragoras]], the appointed [[satrap]] who rebelled against them. Hence, Arsaces I &quot;backdated his [[regnal year]]s&quot; to the moment when Seleucid control over Parthia ceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_28-29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=28‚Äì29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis asserts that this was simply the year Arsaces was made chief of the Parni tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis_2007_7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homa Katouzian&lt;ref name=&quot;katouzian 2009 41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gene Ralph Garthwaite&lt;ref name=&quot;garthwaite_2005_67&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim it was the year Arsaces conquered Parthia and expelled the Seleucid authorities, yet Curtis&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis_2007_7&quot;/&gt; and Maria Brosius&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_85&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that Andragoras was not [[Parni conquest of Parthia|overthrown by the Arsacids]] until 238&amp;nbsp;BC.

It is unclear who immediately succeeded Arsaces I. Bivar&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=29‚Äì31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Katouzian&lt;ref name=&quot;katouzian 2009 41&quot;/&gt; affirm that it was his brother [[Tiridates I of Parthia]], who in turn was succeeded by his son [[Arsaces II of Parthia]] in 211&amp;nbsp;BC. Yet Curtis&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis_2007_8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brosius&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_86&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that Arsaces II was the immediate successor of Arsaces I, with Curtis claiming the succession took place in 211&amp;nbsp;BC, and Brosius in 217&amp;nbsp;BC. Bivar insists that 138&amp;nbsp;BC, the last regnal year of Mithridates I, is &quot;the first precisely established regnal date of Parthian history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these and other discrepancies, Bivar outlines [[List of Parthian kings|two distinct royal chronologies]] accepted by historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_98-99&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=98‚Äì99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, some of the Parthian Kings would claim Achaemenid descent. The claim has recently received support from numismatic and other written evidence suggesting that both Achaemenid and Parthian kings suffered from the hereditary disease [[neurofibromatosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ashrafian, Hutan.|title=Limb gigantism, neurofibromatosis and royal heredity in the Ancient World 2500 years ago: Achaemenids and Parthians|journal= J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg|volume=64|year=2011|page=557|doi= 10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.025|url= http://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(10)00521-8/pdf%7C|issue=4|postscript=.|pmid=20832372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Arsaces consolidated his position in Parthia and [[Hyrcania]] by taking advantage of the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;246‚Äì222&amp;nbsp;BC) of [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]]. This conflict with Ptolemy, the [[Syrian Wars#Third Syrian War (246-241 BC)|Third Syrian War]] (246‚Äì241&amp;nbsp;BC), also allowed [[Diodotus I]] to rebel and form the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] in Central Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_85&quot;/&gt; The latter's successor, [[Diodotus II]], formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia by the forces of [[Seleucus II Callinicus]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;246‚Äì225&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_85-86&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=85‚Äì86}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time in exile among the nomadic [[Apasiacae]] tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, [[Antiochus III the Great]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;222‚Äì187&amp;nbsp;BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of [[Molon]] in [[Media (region)|Media]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_85-86&quot;/&gt;

Antiochus III launched a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209&amp;nbsp;BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II. The latter was granted the title of king ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''[[basileus]]'') in return for his submission to Antiochus III as his superior.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_29 brosius_2006_86 kennedy_1996_74&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=86}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the [[Roman Republic]] and the Seleucid [[Battle of Magnesia|defeat at Magnesia]] in 190&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_29 brosius_2006_86 kennedy_1996_74&quot;/&gt; [[Phriapatius of Parthia]] (''r''.

Phraates I ruled Parthia without further Seleucid interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=29‚Äì31}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Parthia and Greco-Bactria deteriorated after the death of Diodotus II, when Mithridates' forces captured two [[Eparchy|eparchies]] of the latter kingdom, then under [[Eucratides I]] (''r''.

Whereas [[Hecatompylos]] had served as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates established royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, [[Ctesiphon]] and his newly founded city, Mithradatkert ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan]]), where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=103, 110‚Äì113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of [[Gotarzes I of Parthia]] (''r''.

The Seleucids were unable to retaliate immediately as general [[Diodotus Tryphon]] led a rebellion at the capital [[Antioch]] in 142 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 140&amp;nbsp;BC [[Demetrius II Nicator]] was able to launch a counter-invasion against the Parthians in Mesopotamia. Despite early successes, the Seleucids were defeated and Demetrius himself was captured by Parthian forces and taken to Hyrcania.

[[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;138‚Äì129&amp;nbsp;BC), a brother of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife [[Cleopatra Thea]]. After defeating Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130&amp;nbsp;BC to retake Mesopotamia, now under the rule of [[Phraates II of Parthia]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;''c''.&amp;nbsp;138‚Äì128&amp;nbsp;BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the [[Great Zab]], followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed.

While the Parthians regained the territories lost in the west, another threat arose in the east. In 177‚Äì176&amp;nbsp;BC the nomadic confederation of the [[Xiongnu]] dislodged the nomadic [[Yuezhi]] from their homelands in what is now [[Gansu]] province in [[Northwest China]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torday|1997|pp=80‚Äì81}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Yuezhi then migrated west into Bactria and displaced the [[Saka]] (Scythian) tribes. The Saka were forced to move further west, where they invaded the Parthian Empire's northeastern borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=76}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=36‚Äì37}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=89, 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mithridates was thus forced to retire to Hyrcania after his conquest of Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_89&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Saka were enlisted in Phraates' forces against Antiochus. However, they arrived too late to engage in the conflict. When Phraates refused to pay their wages, the Saka revolted, which he tried to put down with the aid of former Seleucid soldiers, yet they too abandoned Phraates and joined sides with the Saka.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phraates II marched against this combined force, but he was killed in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=38‚Äì39}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] reports that his successor [[Artabanus I of Parthia]] (''r''.

Following the Seleucid withdrawal from Mesopotamia, the Parthian governor of Babylonia, Himerus, was ordered by the Arsacid court to conquer Characene, then ruled by [[Hyspaosines]] from [[Charax Spasinu]]. When this failed, Hyspaosines invaded Babylonia in 127&amp;nbsp;BC and occupied Seleucia. Yet by 122&amp;nbsp;BC, Mithridates II forced Hyspaosines out of Babylonia and made the kings of Characene [[vassal]]s under Parthian [[suzerainty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=40}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=11‚Äì12}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mithridates extended Parthian control further west, occupying [[Dura-Europos]] in 113&amp;nbsp;BC, he became embroiled in a conflict with the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=11‚Äì12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His forces defeated and deposed [[Artavasdes I of Armenia]] in 97&amp;nbsp;BC, taking his son Tigranes hostage, who would later become [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes II &quot;the Great&quot; of Armenia]] (''r''.

Following the [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|diplomatic venture]] of [[Zhang Qian]] into Central Asia during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;141‚Äì87&amp;nbsp;BC), the [[Han Dynasty|Han Empire]] of China sent a delegation to Mithridates II's court in 121&amp;nbsp;BC.

===Rome and Armenia===

The Yuezhi [[Kushan Empire]] in northern India largely guaranteed the security of Parthia's eastern border.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_92&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the mid-1st century BC onwards, the Arsacid court focused on securing the western border, primarily against Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_92&quot;/&gt; A year following Mithridates II's subjugation of Armenia, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], the Roman [[proconsul]] of [[Cilicia]], convened with the Parthian diplomat [[Orobazus]] at the [[Euphrates]] river. The two agreed that the river would serve as the border between Parthia and Rome, although several historians have argued that Sulla only had authority to communicate these terms back to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|pp=73‚Äì78}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Sheldon|2010|pp=12‚Äì16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this agreement, in 93 or 92&amp;nbsp;BC Parthia fought a war in Syria against the tribal leader Laodice and her Seleucid ally [[Antiochus X Eusebes]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;95‚Äì92?&amp;nbsp;BC), killing the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_1996_77‚Äì78&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|pp=77‚Äì78}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of the last Seleucid monarchs, [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]], attempted to besiege Beroea (modern [[Aleppo]]), Parthia sent military aid to the inhabitants and Demetrius was defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_1996_77‚Äì78&quot;/&gt;

Following the rule of Mithridates II, Gotarzes I ruled Babylonia, while [[Orodes I of Parthia|Orodes I]] (''r''.

This land would not be restored to Parthia until the reign of [[Sanatruces of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&amp;nbsp;78‚Äì71&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=91‚Äì92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the [[Third Mithridatic War]], [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;119‚Äì63&amp;nbsp;BC), an ally of Tigranes II of Armenia, requested aid from Parthia against Rome, but Sanatruces refused help.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_44-45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=44‚Äì45}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Roman commander [[Lucullus]] marched against the Armenian capital [[Tigranocerta]] in 69&amp;nbsp;BC, Mithridates VI and Tigranes II requested the aid of [[Phraates III of Parthia]] (''r''.

Phraates did not send aid either, and after the [[Battle of Tigranocerta|fall of Tigranocerta]] he reaffirmed with Lucullus the Euphrates as the boundary between Parthia and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=45‚Äì46}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tigranes the Younger, son of Tigranes II of Armenia, failed to usurp the Armenian throne from his father. He fled to Phraates III and convinced him to march against Armenia's new capital at [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artaxarta]]. When this siege failed, Tigranes the Younger once again fled, this time to the Roman commander [[Pompey]]. He promised Pompey that he would act as a guide through Armenia, but, when Tigranes II submitted to Rome as a [[Client state|client king]], Tigranes the Younger was brought to Rome as a hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=46‚Äì47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phraates demanded Pompey return Tigranes the Younger to him, but Pompey refused. In retaliation, Phraates launched an invasion into [[Corduene]] (southeastern Turkey) where, according to two conflicting Roman accounts, the Roman consul [[Lucius Afranius (consul)|Lucius Afranius]] forced the Parthians out by either military or diplomatic means.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=47}}; [[Cassius Dio]] writes that Lucius Afranius reoccupied the region without confronting the Parthian army, whereas [[Plutarch]] asserts that Afranius drove him out by military means.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], one of the [[First Triumvirate|triumvirs]] who was now proconsul of Syria, launched an invasion into Parthia in 53&amp;nbsp;BC in belated support of Mithridates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=49‚Äì50}}; {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|pp=42‚Äì43}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his army [[Battle of Carrhae|marched to Carrhae]] (modern [[Harran]], southeastern Turkey), Orodes II invaded Armenia, cutting off support from Rome's ally [[Artavasdes II of Armenia]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;53‚Äì34&amp;nbsp;BC).

When he returned in the spring of 38&amp;nbsp;BC, he faced Ventidius at the [[Battle of Mount Gindarus]], northeast of Antioch.

[[File:Phraatesiv.jpg|thumb|Drachma of [[Phraates IV of Parthia]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;''c''.&amp;nbsp;38‚Äì2&amp;nbsp;BC)]]
Upon assuming the throne, Phraates IV eliminated rival claimants by killing and exiling his own brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them, Monaeses, fled to Antony and convinced him to [[Antony's Parthian War|invade Parthia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=58‚Äì59}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony defeated Parthia's Judaean ally Antigonus in 37&amp;nbsp;BC, installing Herod as a client king in his place. The following year, when Antony marched to [[Erzurum]], Artavasdes II of Armenia once again switched alliances by sending Antony additional troops. Antony invaded Media [[Atropatene]] (modern [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]), then ruled by Parthia's ally [[Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene]], with the intention of seizing the capital Praaspa, the location of which is now unknown. However, Phraates IV ambushed Antony's rear detachment, destroying a giant [[battering ram]] meant for [[Siege engine|the siege]] of Praaspa; after this, Artavasdes abandoned Antony's forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=58‚Äì59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians pursued and harassed Antony's army as they fled to Armenia. Eventually, the greatly weakened force reached Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=60‚Äì63}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}; see also {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=81}} for analysis on Rome's shift of attention away from Syria to the Upper Euphrates, starting with Antony.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Antony lured Artavasdes II into a trap with the promise of a marriage alliance.

===Peace with Rome, court intrigue and contact with Chinese generals===
{{further information|Pax Romana}}
Following the defeat of Antony at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavian consolidated his political power and in 27&amp;nbsp;BC was named [[Augustus]] by the [[Roman Senate]], becoming the first [[Roman emperor]]. Around this time, [[Tiridates II of Parthia]] briefly overthrew Phraates IV, who was able to quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=65‚Äì66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20&amp;nbsp;BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost [[Aquila (Roman)|legionary standards]] taken at Carrhae in 53&amp;nbsp;BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=80}}; see also {{harvnb|Strugnell|2006|pp=251‚Äì252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians viewed this exchange as a small price to pay to regain the prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=66‚Äì67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the [[Forum of Augustus|building of a new temple]] to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the [[breastplate]] scene on his statue [[Augustus of Prima Porta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=96‚Äì97; 136‚Äì137}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=66‚Äì67}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=12‚Äì13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, who later became Queen [[Musa of Parthia]]. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa convinced Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=67}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=96‚Äì99}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Phraataces took the throne as [[Phraates V of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;BC ‚Äì 4&amp;nbsp;AD), Musa married her own son and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship and the notion of a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile in Roman territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=68}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=97‚Äì99}}; see also {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phraates' successor [[Orodes III of Parthia]] lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by [[Vonones I of Parthia]], who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, [[Artabanus III of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&amp;nbsp;10‚Äì38&amp;nbsp;AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile in Roman Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=68‚Äì69}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=97‚Äì99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Artabanus III, two Jewish commoners and brothers, [[Anilai and Asinai]] from [[Nehardea]] (near modern [[Fallujah]], Iraq),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=69‚Äì71}}&lt;/ref&gt; led a revolt against the Parthian governor of Babylonia. After defeating the latter, the two were granted the right to govern the region by Artabanus III, who feared further rebellion elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anilai's Parthian wife poisoned Asinai out of fear he would attack Anilai over his marriage to a [[gentile]]. Following this, Anilai became embroiled in an armed conflict with a son-in-law of Artabanus, who eventually defeated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=71‚Äì72}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Jewish regime removed, the native Babylonians began to harass the [[Iraqi Jews|local Jewish community]], forcing them to emigrate to Seleucia. When that city rebelled against Parthian rule in 35‚Äì36&amp;nbsp;AD, the Jews were expelled again, this time by the local [[Greeks]] and [[Aramaeans]]. The exiled Jews fled to Ctesiphon, Nehardea, and [[Nisibis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=72‚Äì73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at peace with Parthia, Rome still interfered in its affairs. The Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] (r.&amp;nbsp;14‚Äì37&amp;nbsp;AD) became involved in a plot by [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]] to place his brother [[Mithridates of Armenia|Mithridates]] on the throne of Armenia by assassinating the Parthian ally King Arsaces of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artabanus III tried and failed to restore Parthian control of Armenia, prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to [[Scythia]]. The Romans released a hostage prince, [[Tiridates III of Parthia]], to rule the region as an ally of Rome. Shortly before his death, Artabanus managed to force Tiridates from the throne using troops from Hyrcania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=73‚Äì74}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Artabanus' death in 38&amp;nbsp;AD, a long civil war ensued between the rightful successor [[Vardanes I of Parthia]] and his brother [[Gotarzes II of Parthia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=75‚Äì76}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Vardanes was assassinated during a hunting expedition, the Parthian nobility appealed to Roman emperor [[Claudius]] (''r''. 41‚Äì54&amp;nbsp;AD) in 49&amp;nbsp;AD to release the hostage prince Meherdates to challenge Gotarzes. This backfired when Meherdates was betrayed by the governor of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and [[Izates bar Monobaz]] of [[Adiabene]]; he was captured and sent to Gotarzes, where he was allowed to live after having his ears mutilated, an act that disqualified him from inheriting the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=76‚Äì78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 97&amp;nbsp;AD, the Chinese general [[Ban Chao]], the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions|Protector-General of the Western Regions]], sent his emissary [[Gan Ying]] on a diplomatic mission to reach the Roman Empire. Gan visited the court of [[Pacorus II of Parthia]] at Hecatompylos before departing towards Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;watson_1983_543-544&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1983|pp=543‚Äì544}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled as far west as the [[Persian Gulf]], where Parthian authorities convinced him that an arduous sea voyage around the [[Arabian Peninsula]] was the only means to reach Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1983|pp=543‚Äì544}}; {{harvnb|Y√º|1986|pp=460‚Äì461}}; {{harvnb|de Crespigny|2007|pp=239‚Äì240}}; see also {{harvnb|Wang|2007|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discouraged by this, Gan Ying returned to the Han court and provided [[Emperor He of Han]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;88‚Äì105&amp;nbsp;AD) with a detailed report on the Roman Empire based on oral accounts of his Parthian hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2002|pp=46‚Äì47}}; {{harvnb|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Watson speculates that the Parthians would have been relieved at the failed efforts by the Han Empire to open diplomatic relations with Rome, especially after Ban Chao's [[Han‚ÄìXiongnu War|military victories]] against the [[Xiongnu]] in [[Tarim Basin|eastern Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;watson_1983_543-544&quot;/&gt; However, Chinese records maintain that a [[Daqin|Roman embassy]], perhaps only a group of [[Roman commerce|Roman merchants]], [[Sino-Roman relations|arrived at the Han capital]] [[Luoyang]] by way of [[Jiaozhi]] (northern [[Vietnam]]) in 166&amp;nbsp;AD, during the reigns of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''r''. 161‚Äì180&amp;nbsp;AD) and [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (''r''. 146‚Äì168&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Y√º|1986|pp=460‚Äì461}}; {{harvnb|de Crespigny|2007|p=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it could be coincidental, [[Antonine]] Roman golden [[medal]]lions dated to the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his predecessor [[Antoninus Pius]] have been discovered at [[Oc Eo]], Vietnam (among other Roman artefacts in the [[Mekong Delta]]), a site that is one of the suggested locations for the port city of &quot;[[Cattigara]]&quot; along the ''[[Magnus Sinus]]'' (i.e. [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[South China Sea]]) in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2001|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Mawer|2013|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Ball|2016|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian king]] Pharasmanes I had his son [[Rhadamistus]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;51‚Äì55&amp;nbsp;AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, [[Vologeses I of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&amp;nbsp;51‚Äì77&amp;nbsp;AD) planned to invade and place his brother, the later [[Tiridates I of Armenia]], on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhadamistus was eventually driven from power, and, beginning with the reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia‚Äîwith brief interruptions‚Äîthrough the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=79‚Äì81}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the fall of the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=82}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=79‚Äì81}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] kings with the [[Arsacid dynasty of Iberia]], and for many centuries afterwards in [[Caucasian Albania]] through the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bausani|1971|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Vardanes II of Parthia]] rebelled against his father Vologeses I in 55&amp;nbsp;AD, Vologeses withdrew his forces from Armenia. Rome quickly attempted to fill the political vacuum left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 58‚Äì63]]&amp;nbsp;AD, the commander [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]] achieved some military successes against the Parthians while installing [[Tigranes VI of Armenia]] as a Roman client.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=81‚Äì85}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Corbulo's successor [[Lucius Caesennius Paetus]] was soundly defeated by Parthian forces and fled Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=83‚Äì85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a peace treaty, Tiridates I traveled to [[Naples]] and Rome in 63 AD. At both sites the Roman emperor [[Nero]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;54‚Äì68&amp;nbsp;AD) ceremoniously crowned him king of Armenia by placing the royal [[diadem]] on his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=99‚Äì100}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long period of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the invasion of [[Alans]] into Parthia's eastern territories around 72&amp;nbsp;AD mentioned by Roman historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern [[Fertile Crescent]], the heart of the Parthian Empire along the [[Tigris River|Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|pp=67, 87‚Äì88}}&lt;/ref&gt; To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially [[Nabataeans]]), but later established a permanent ''[[auxilia]]'' force to complement their heavy legionary infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_1996_87&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (''[[sagittarii]]'') and even mail-armored [[cataphract]]s in their eastern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|pp=87‚Äì88}}; see also {{harvnb|Kurz|1983|pp=561‚Äì562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Romans had no discernible [[grand strategy]] in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheldon|2010|pp=231‚Äì232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal glory and political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheldon|2010|pp=9‚Äì10, 231‚Äì235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostilities between Rome and Parthia were renewed when [[Osroes I of Parthia]] (''r''.

In the last months of 116&amp;nbsp;AD, Trajan captured the Persian city of Susa. When [[Sanatruces II of Parthia]] gathered forces in eastern Parthia to challenge the Romans, his cousin [[Parthamaspates of Parthia]] betrayed and killed him: Trajan crowned him the new king of Parthia.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_90-91&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=90‚Äì91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Never again would the Roman Empire advance so far to the east.

On Trajan's return north, the Babylonian settlements revolted against the Roman garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lightfoot|1990|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=90‚Äì91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan was forced to retreat from Mesopotamia in 117&amp;nbsp;AD, overseeing a failed siege of [[Hatra]] during his withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; His retreat was‚Äîin his intentions‚Äîtemporary, because he wanted to renew the attack on Parthia in 118 AD and &quot;make the subjection of the Parthians a reality,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mommsen|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Trajan died suddenly in August 117&amp;nbsp;AD.

During his campaign, Trajan was granted the title ''Parthicus'' by the Senate and coins were minted proclaiming the conquest of Parthia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=90‚Äì91}}; see also {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=137}} and {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only the 4th-century AD historians [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] and [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] allege that he attempted to establish a [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in lower Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lightfoot|1990|pp=120‚Äì124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;117‚Äì138&amp;nbsp;AD) reaffirmed the [[Roman-Parthian Wars|Roman-Parthian]] border at the Euphrates, choosing not to invade Mesopotamia due to Rome's now limited military resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=100}}; see also {{harvnb|Lightfoot|1990|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=81}}; and {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians revolted against him, yet the Romans made him king of [[Osroene]]. Osroes I died during his conflict with Vologases III, the latter succeeded by [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&amp;nbsp;147‚Äì191&amp;nbsp;AD) who ushered in a period of peace and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=92‚Äì93}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 161‚Äì166]]&amp;nbsp;AD began when Vologases invaded Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;161‚Äì180&amp;nbsp;AD) had co-ruler [[Lucius Verus]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;161‚Äì169&amp;nbsp;AD) guard Syria while [[Marcus Statius Priscus]] invaded Armenia in 163&amp;nbsp;AD, followed by the invasion of Mesopotamia by [[Avidius Cassius]] in 164&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans captured and burnt Seleucia and Ctesiphon to the ground, yet they were forced to retreat once the Roman soldiers contracted a [[Antonine Plague|deadly disease]] (possibly [[smallpox]]) that soon ravaged the Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=100}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=93‚Äì94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they withdrew, from this point forward the city of Dura-Europos remained in Roman hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=93‚Äì94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Roman emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;193‚Äì211&amp;nbsp;AD) invaded Mesopotamia in 197&amp;nbsp;AD during the reign of [[Vologases V of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&amp;nbsp;191‚Äì208&amp;nbsp;AD), the Romans once again marched down the Euphrates and captured Seleucia and Ctesiphon. After assuming the title ''Parthicus Maximus'', he retreated in late 198&amp;nbsp;AD, failing as Trajan once did to capture Hatra during a siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=100}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=94}}; {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 212&amp;nbsp;AD, soon after [[Vologases VI of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&amp;nbsp;208‚Äì222&amp;nbsp;AD) took the throne, his brother [[Artabanus V of Parthia]] (d.&amp;nbsp;224&amp;nbsp;AD) rebelled against him and gained control over a greater part of the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_94-95&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=94‚Äì95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;211‚Äì217&amp;nbsp;AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. He marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but‚Äîbecause the marriage was not allowed‚Äîmade war on Parthia and conquered [[Arbil]] east of the [[Tigris]] river.
[[File:Bas relief nagsh-e-rostam couronnement.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] relief at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] showing the [[investiture]] of [[Ardashir I]]]]

Caracalla was assassinated the next year on the road to Carrhae by his soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bivar_1983_94-95&quot;/&gt; After this debacle, the Parthians made a settlement with [[Macrinus]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;217‚Äì218) where the Romans paid Parthia over two-hundred million ''[[Denarius|denarii]]'' with additional gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=100‚Äì101}}; see also {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=44}}, who mentions this in passing&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Parthian Empire, weakened by internal strife and wars with Rome, was soon to be followed by the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Indeed, shortly afterward, [[Ardashir I]], the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern [[Fars Province]], Iran) from [[Estakhr]] began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_101 bivar_1983_95-96 curtis_2007_14 katouzian_2009_44&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=95‚Äì96}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=14}}; see also {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confronted Artabanus V at the [[Battle of HormozdgƒÅn]] on 28 April 224&amp;nbsp;AD, perhaps at a site near [[Isfahan]], defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_101 bivar_1983_95-96 curtis_2007_14 katouzian_2009_44&quot;/&gt; There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=95‚Äì96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sasanians would not only assume Parthia's legacy as Rome's Persian nemesis, but they would also attempt to restore the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602‚Äì628|briefly conquering]] the Levant, Anatolia, and Egypt from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Khosrau II]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;590‚Äì628&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1983|pp=173‚Äì174}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they would lose these territories to [[Heraclius]]‚Äîthe last Roman emperor before the [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquests]]. Nevertheless, for a period of more than 400 years, they succeeded the Parthian realm as Rome's principal rival.&lt;ref name=EIr-Sasanian&gt;{{harv|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman A.

The [[Greek historiography|Greek]] and [[Roman historiography|Latin histories]], which represent the majority of materials covering Parthian history, are not considered entirely reliable since they were written from the perspective of rivals and wartime enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=67, 75}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These external sources generally concern major military and political events, and often ignore social and cultural aspects of Parthian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=75}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=80‚Äì81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans usually depicted the Parthians as fierce warriors but also as a culturally refined people; recipes for Parthian dishes in the cookbook ''[[Apicius]]'' exemplifies their admiration for Parthian cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurz|1983|p=564}}; see also {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=138}} for further analysis: &quot;Curiously, at the same time as the Parthian was depicted as uncivilised, he was also 'orientalised' in traditional fashion, being described as luxury-loving, leading an effeminate lifestyle, and demonstrating excessive sexuality.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollodorus of Artemita]] and [[Arrian]] wrote histories focusing on Parthia, which are now lost and survive only as quoted extracts in other histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1983|pp=1261, 1264}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore of Charax]], who lived during the reign of Augustus, provides an account of Parthian territories, perhaps from a Parthian government survey.&lt;ref name=&quot;widengren_1983_1264&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1983|p=1264}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a lesser extent, people and events of Parthian history were also included in the histories of [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Strabo]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Cassius Dio]], [[Appian]], [[Josephus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Herodian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1983|pp=1265‚Äì1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parthian history can also be reconstructed via the [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese historical records]] of events.&lt;ref name=&quot;widengren_1983_1265, 1267&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1983|pp=1265, 1267}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Greek and Roman histories, the early Chinese histories maintained a more neutral view when describing Parthia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Posch|1998|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the habit of Chinese chroniclers to copy material for their accounts from older works (of undetermined origin) makes it difficult to establish a chronological order of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posch|1998|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese called Parthia ''[[:zh:ÂÆâÊÅØ|ƒÄnxƒ´]]'' (Chinese: [[Wiktionary:ÂÆâ|ÂÆâ]][[Wiktionary:ÊÅØ|ÊÅØ]]), perhaps after the Greek name for the Parthian city [[Merv|Antiochia in Margiana]] (Greek: ŒëŒΩœÑŒπœåœáŒµŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒúŒ±œÅŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒÆs).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1983|pp=541‚Äì542}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this could also have been a transliteration of &quot;Arsaces&quot;, after the dynasty's eponymous founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2007|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works and historical authors include the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'' (also known as the ''Records of the Grand Historian'') by [[Sima Qian]], the ''[[Book of Han|Han shu]]'' (Book of Han) by [[Ban Biao]], [[Ban Gu]], and [[Ban Zhao]], and the ''[[Book of Later Han|Hou Han shu]]'' (Book of Later Han) by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2007|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide information on the nomadic migrations leading up to the early [[Saka]] invasion of Parthia and valuable political and geographical information.&lt;ref name=&quot;widengren_1983_1265, 1267&quot;/&gt; For example, the ''Shiji'' (ch. 123) describes diplomatic exchanges, exotic gifts given by Mithridates II to the [[Han Dynasty|Han court]], types of agricultural crops grown in Parthia, production of wine using grapes, itinerant merchants, and the size and location of Parthian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2007|pp=89‚Äì90}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=90‚Äì91, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shiji'' also mentions that the Parthians kept records by &quot;writing horizontally on strips of leather,&quot; that is, parchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=118}}; see also {{harvnb|Wang|2007|p=90}} for a similar translation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and administration==

===Central authority and semi-autonomous kings===
[[File:650521.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Kamnaskires III]], king of [[Elymais]] (modern [[Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province]]), and his wife Queen [[Anzaze]], 1st century BC]]
Compared with the earlier Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian government was notably [[Decentralization|decentralized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=67‚Äì68}}&lt;/ref&gt; An indigenous historical source reveals that territories overseen by the central government were organized in a similar manner to the Seleucid Empire. They both had a threefold division for their provincial hierarchies: the Parthian marzbƒÅn, x≈°atrap, and dizpat, similar to the Seleucid [[satrapy]], [[eparchy]], and hyparchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;widengren_1983_1263&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1983|p=1263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthian Empire also contained several subordinate semi-autonomous kingdoms, including the states of [[Caucasian Iberia]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Atropatene]], [[Gordyene]], [[Adiabene]], [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], [[Hatra]], [[Mesene]], [[Elymais]], and [[Persis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lukonin_1983_701&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=701}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state rulers governed their own territories and minted their own coinage distinct from the royal coinage produced at the imperial mints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=701}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=19‚Äì21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not unlike the earlier Achaemenid Empire, which also had some city-states, and even distant satrapies who were semi-independent but &quot;recognised the supremacy of the king, paid tribute and provided military support&quot;, according to Brosius.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=113‚Äì114}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the satraps of Parthian times governed smaller territories, and perhaps had less prestige and influence than their Achaemenid predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=115‚Äì116}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Seleucid period, the trend of local ruling dynasties with semi-autonomous rule, and sometimes outright rebellious rule, became commonplace, a fact reflected in the later Parthian style of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=114‚Äì115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nobility===
{{further information|Seven Parthian clans}}

The King of Kings headed the Parthian government. He maintained [[polygamous]] relations, and was usually succeeded by his first-born son.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_103-104&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=103‚Äì104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Ptolemies of Egypt, there is also record of Arsacid kings marrying their nieces and perhaps even half-sisters; Queen Musa married her own son, though this was an extreme and isolated case.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_103-104&quot;/&gt; Brosius provides an extract from a letter written in Greek by King Artabanus II in 21&amp;nbsp;AD, which addresses the governor (titled &quot;[[archon]]&quot;) and citizens of the city of [[Susa]]. Specific government offices of Preferred Friend, Bodyguard and Treasurer are mentioned and the document also proves that &quot;while there were local jurisdictions and proceedings to appointment to high office, the king could intervene on behalf of an individual, review a case and amend the local ruling if he considered it appropriate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hereditary titles of the hierarchic nobility recorded during the reign of the first Sassanid monarch Ardashir I most likely reflect the titles already in use during the Parthian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|pp=699‚Äì700}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were three distinct tiers of nobility, the highest being the regional kings directly below the King of Kings, the second being those related to the King of Kings only through marriage, and the lowest order being heads of local clans and small territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|pp=700‚Äì704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1st century AD, the Parthian nobility had assumed great power and influence in the succession and deposition of Arsacid kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=99‚Äì100, 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the nobility functioned as court advisers to the king, as well as holy priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=104‚Äì105, 117‚Äì118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the great noble Parthian families listed at the beginning of the Sasanian period, only two are explicitly mentioned in earlier Parthian documents: the [[House of Suren]] and the [[House of Karen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|pp=704‚Äì705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Plutarch]] noted that members of the Suren family, the first among the nobility, were given the privilege of crowning each new Arsacid King of Kings during their coronations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=704}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, some of the Parthian kings would claim Achaemenid descent. This has recently been corroborated via the possibility of an inherited disease ([[neurofibromatosis]]) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ashrafian, Hutan.|title=Limb gigantism, neurofibromatosis and royal heredity in the Ancient World 2500 years ago: Achaemenids and Parthians|journal= J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg|volume=64|year=2011|pages=557|doi= 10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.025|url= http://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(10)00521-8/pdf|pmid=20832372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===

The Parthians, like their neighbors to the north on the steppes (the [[Scythians]]), were able to succeed in battle often due to their use of [[mounted archery|horse archers]]. Capable of shooting in virtually any direction while riding at speed, these archers could inflict heavy damage while maintaining a position of relative safety themselves. Even when fleeing, the archers could turn and fire backward at their enemies, a practice from which the term &quot;[[Parthian Shot]]&quot; emerged. The term has come to be used for sharp words dealt while taking leave; one can easily see that the negative connotations of this phrase suggest a Roman origin, as they would have been the ones getting hit by those shots.&lt;ref name=Parragon /&gt;

The Parthian Empire had no [[standing army]], yet were able to quickly recruit troops in the event of local crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=116, 122}}; {{harvnb|Sheldon|2010|pp=231‚Äì232}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king, comprising nobles, [[serf]]s and [[mercenaries]], but this royal retinue was small.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_1996_84&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts; Parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_1996_84&quot;/&gt; Military forces could also be used in diplomatic gestures. For example, when Chinese envoys visited Parthia in the late 2nd century BC, the ''[[Shiji]]'' maintains that 20,000 horsemen were sent to the eastern borders to serve as escorts for the embassy, although this figure is perhaps an exaggeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2007|pp=99‚Äì100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main striking force of the Parthian army was its [[cataphract]]s, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in [[Mail (armour)|mailed armor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_120 garthwaite_2005_78&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the cost of their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=116‚Äì118}}; see also {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=78}} and {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_120 garthwaite_2005_78&quot;/&gt; They used [[composite bow]]s and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Kurz|1983|p=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The heavy and light cavalry of Parthia proved to be a decisive factor in the [[Battle of Carrhae]] where a Parthian force defeated a much larger Roman army under Crassus.
Light infantry units, composed of [[Conscription|levied commoners]] and mercenaries, were used to disperse enemy troops after cavalry charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the Parthian army is unknown, as is the size of the empire's overall population. However, archaeological excavations in former Parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_1996_83&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense population centers in regions like Babylonia were no doubt attractive to the Romans, whose armies could afford to live off the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_1996_83&quot;/&gt;

===Currency===
Usually made of silver,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=9, 11‚Äì12, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Greek drachma]] coin, including the [[tetradrachm]], was the standard currency used throughout the Parthian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=7‚Äì25}}; {{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|pp=279‚Äì298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arsacids maintained [[Mint (coin)|royal mints]] at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_103&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis_2007_8&quot;/&gt; From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5&amp;nbsp;g or more than 4.2&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16&amp;nbsp;g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Hellenism and the Iranian revival===
[[Image:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|left|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]

Although [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] of the Seleucids was widely adopted by peoples of the [[Near East]] during the [[Hellenistic period]], the Parthian era witnessed an [[Culture of Iran|Iranian cultural revival]] in religion, the arts, and even clothing fashions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=14‚Äì15}}; see also {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious of both the Hellenistic and Persian cultural roots of their kingship, the Arsacid rulers styled themselves after the Persian King of Kings and affirmed that they were also ''[[Philhellenism|philhellenes]]'' (&quot;friends of the Greeks&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=14‚Äì15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;philhellene&quot; was inscribed on Parthian coins until the reign of Artabanus II.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis_2007_11&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discontinuation of this phrase signified the revival of Iranian culture in Parthia.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis_2007_16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vologases I was the first Arsacid ruler to have the [[Pahlavi script|Parthian script]] and [[Parthian language|language]] appear on his minted coins alongside the now almost illegible Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=80‚Äì81}}; see also {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=21}} and {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of Greek-alphabet legends on Parthian coins remained until the collapse of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ParthianWaterSpoutWithFaceOfIranianMan1-2ndCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|A ceramic Parthian water spout in the shape of a man's head, dated 1st or 2nd century AD]]
Greek cultural influence did not disappear from the Parthian Empire, however, and there is evidence that the Arsacids enjoyed [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. When the head of Crassus was brought to Orodes II, he, alongside Armenian king Artavasdes II, were busy watching a performance of ''[[The Bacchae]]'' by the playwright [[Euripides]] (''c''.&amp;nbsp;480‚Äì406 BC). The producer of the play decided to use Crassus' actual severed head in place of the [[Theatrical property|stage-prop]] head of [[Pentheus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his coins, Arsaces I is depicted in apparel similar to Achaemenid satraps. According to A. Shahbazi, Arsaces &quot;deliberately diverges from Seleucid coins to emphasize his nationalistic and royal aspirations, and he calls himself KƒÅrny/Karny (Greek: Autocratos), a title already borne by Achaemenid supreme generals, such as Cyrus the Younger.&quot;&lt;ref name=shahbazi525/&gt; In line with Achaemenid traditions, rock-relief images of Arsacid rulers were carved at [[Mount Behistun]], where [[Darius I of Persia]] (r. 522‚Äì486 BC) made [[Behistun Inscription|royal inscriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=128‚Äì129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Arsacids claimed familial descent from [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]] (''r''.&amp;nbsp;404‚Äì358 BC) as a means to bolster their legitimacy in ruling over former Achaemenid territories, i.e. as being &quot;legitimate successors of glorious kings&quot; of ancient Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=697}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artabanus III]] named one of his sons Darius and laid claim to [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]' heritage.&lt;ref name=shahbazi525&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1987|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arsacid kings chose typical Zoroastrian names for themselves and some from the &quot;[[Kayanian dynasty|heroic background]]&quot; of the [[Avesta]], according to V.G. Lukonin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=687}}; {{harvnb|Shahbazi|1987|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians also adopted the use of the [[Babylonian calendar]] with names from the Achaemenid [[Iranian calendar]], replacing the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Macedonian calendar]] of the Seleucids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1983|pp=867‚Äì868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:ParthianVotiveReliefIranKhuzestan2ndCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|Parthian votive relief from Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province, Iran, 2nd century AD]]
The Parthian Empire, being culturally and politically heterogeneous, had a variety of religious systems and beliefs, the most widespread being those dedicated to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Persian mythology|Iranian]] cults.&lt;ref name=&quot;katouzian_2009_45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from a minority of [[Judaism|Jews]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neusner|1983|pp=909‚Äì923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early [[Christianity|Christians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmussen|1983|pp=924‚Äì928}}&lt;/ref&gt; most Parthians were [[polytheistic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_125&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek and Iranian deities were often blended together as one. For example, [[Zeus]] was often equated with [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Hades]] with [[Angra Mainyu]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hera]] with [[Anahita]], [[Apollo]] with [[Mithra]], and [[Hermes]] with [[Shamash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=68, 83‚Äì84}}; {{harvnb|Colpe|1983|p=823}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the main gods and goddesses, each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_125&quot;/&gt; As with Seleucid rulers,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1983|pp=872‚Äì873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parthian art indicates that the Arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods; this [[Imperial cult|cult of the ruler]] was perhaps the most widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colpe|1983|p=844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of Arsacid patronism of [[Zoroastrianism]] is debated in modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=102‚Äì103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Zoroaster]] would have found the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable.&lt;ref name=&quot;katouzian_2009_45&quot;/&gt; However, there is evidence that Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian [[magi]] priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the [[Avesta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=85‚Äì86}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=80‚Äì81}}; {{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1983|p=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=67}}; {{harvnb|Asmussen|1983|pp=928, 933‚Äì934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (216‚Äì276 AD), the founding prophet of [[Manichaeism]], did not proclaim his first religious revelation until 228/229 AD, Bivar asserts that his new faith contained &quot;elements of [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] belief, Iranian cosmogony, and even echoes of Christianity&amp;nbsp;... [it] may be regarded as a typical reflection of the mixed religious doctrines of the late Arsacid period, which the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of the Sasanians was soon to sweep away.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is scant archaeological evidence for the spread of [[Buddhism]] from the [[Kushan Empire]] into Iran proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emmerick|1983|p=957}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is known from Chinese sources that [[An Shigao]] (fl. 2nd century AD), a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist monk, traveled to [[Luoyang]] in Han China as a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missionary]] and translated several [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist canons]] into [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Demi√©ville|1986|p=823}}; {{harvnb|Zhang|2002|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and architecture===
{{further information|Parthian art}}

[[File:Hatra (17).jpg|thumb|A [[barrel vault]]ed ''[[iwan]]'' at the entrance at the ancient site of [[Hatra]], modern-day [[Iraq]], built ''c''.&amp;nbsp;50 AD]]

Parthian art can be divided into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the [[Iranian plateau]]; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_127&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, combined elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_127&quot;/&gt; In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in [[Achaemenid art#Art and architecture|Achaemenid art]], as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_128&quot;/&gt; The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_128&quot;/&gt;

Common [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] of the Parthian period include scenes of royal hunting expeditions and the [[investiture]] of Arsacid kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=127}}; see also {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1041‚Äì1043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_127&quot;/&gt; Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, [[fresco]]s, and even [[graffiti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_127&quot;/&gt; Geometric and stylized plant patterns were also used on [[stucco]] and [[plaster]] walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_128&quot;/&gt; The common motif of the Sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances first appeared in the Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=129, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[portrait]]ure the Parthians favored and emphasized frontality, meaning the person depicted by painting, sculpture, or raised-relief on coins faced the viewer directly instead of showing his or her profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=127}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1049‚Äì1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although frontality in portraiture was already an old artistic technique by the Parthian period, [[Daniel Schlumberger]] explains the innovation of Parthian frontality:&lt;ref name=&quot;schlumberger_1983_1051&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Parthian frontality', as we are now accustomed to call it, deeply differs both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for a small number of traditional characters of cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is really nothing but the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even at the expense (as it seems to us moderns) of clearness and intelligibility. So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment ''de facto'' of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of things seems to have become established in the course of the 1st century A.D.&lt;ref name=&quot;schlumberger_1983_1051&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|left|thumb|A wall mural depicting a scene from the [[Book of Esther]] at the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], dated 245 AD, which Curtis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Schlumberger&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1052‚Äì1053}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe as a fine example of 'Parthian frontality']]
Parthian art, with its distinct use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound cultural and political changes brought by the Sassanid Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1053}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], a temple in the same city dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local [[Mithraeum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1052‚Äì1053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parthian architecture adopted elements of [[Iranian architecture|Achaemenid]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], but remained distinct from the two. The style is first attested at Mithridatkert/Nisa.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_111-112&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=111‚Äì112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Round Hall of Nisa is similar to Hellenistic palaces, but different in that it forms a circle and [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] inside a square space.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_111-112&quot;/&gt; However, the artwork of Nisa, including marble statues and the carved scenes on ivory [[rhyton]] vessels, is unquestionably influenced by Greek art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=111‚Äì112, 127‚Äì128}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1037‚Äì1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A signature feature of Parthian architecture was the ''[[iwan]]'', an audience hall supported by arches or [[barrel vault]]s and open on one side.&lt;ref name=&quot;garthwaite_2005_84 brosius_2006_128 schlumberger_1983_1049&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=128}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the barrel vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_128&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''iwan'' was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;garthwaite_2005_84 brosius_2006_128 schlumberger_1983_1049&quot;/&gt; The earliest Parthian ''iwans'' are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_128&quot;/&gt; Monumental ''iwans'' are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_134-135&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=134‚Äì135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Parthian ''iwans'' at that site have a span of 15&amp;nbsp;m (50&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing and apparel===
[[File:YoungManWithParthianCostume.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of a young Palmyran in fine Parthian trousers, from a funerary [[stele]] at [[Palmyra]], early 3rd century AD]]

The typical Parthian riding outfit is exemplified by [[Statue, National Museum of Iran 2401|the famous bronze statue]] of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped [[tunic]] fastened in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=132‚Äì134}}&lt;/ref&gt; His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis_2007_16&quot;/&gt;

Examples of clothing in Parthian inspired sculptures have been found in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (''qamis''), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=91‚Äì92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_134-135&quot;/&gt; The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in [[Palmyra]], Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=108, 134‚Äì135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their many-folded dresses were fastened by a [[brooch]] at one shoulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_134-135&quot;/&gt; Their headdresses also featured a veil which was draped backwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_134-135&quot;/&gt;

As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses worn by the Parthian kings changed over time. The earliest Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the [[bashlyk]] (Greek: ''kyrbasia'').&lt;ref name=&quot;brosius_2006_101&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the [[pointy hat]]s depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=8}}; see also {{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|pp=279‚Äì280}} for comparison with Achaemenid satrapal headdresses&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from the latter part of his reign show him for the first time wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=101‚Äì102}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian [[tiara]], embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=101‚Äì102}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
As culturally and religiously tolerant the Parthians were, they adopted [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] as their [[official language]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 1992 45&quot;/&gt; while [[Old Aramaic language|Aramaic]] remained the ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 1992 45&quot;/&gt; The native [[Parthian language]], [[Middle Persian]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] were also used.

===Writing and literature===
[[File:Sarbaz Nysa.jpg|thumb|150px|A sculpted head (broken off from a larger statue) of a Parthian soldier wearing a [[Hellenistic armies|Hellenistic-style helmet]], from the Parthian royal residence and necropolis of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan]], 2nd century BC]]
It is known that during the Parthian period the court [[minstrel]] (''g≈çsƒÅn'') recited poetic [[oral literature]] accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed in verse form, were not written down until the subsequent Sasanian period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form, since it was written down in the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1151}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale ''[[Vis and RƒÅmin]]'' and [[Epic poetry|epic cycle]] of the [[Kayanian dynasty]] were part of the corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|pp=1158‚Äì1159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although literature of the Parthian language was not committed to written form, there is evidence that the Arsacids acknowledged and respected written [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|pp=1154‚Äì1155}}; see also {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurdish and Parthian hypothesis===
Some linguists see the Kurdish language as the contemporary equivalent of the Parthian language. Professor Gernot Windfuhr recognized the Kurdish language as a derivation of the Parthian language.&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr, Gernot (1975), &quot;Isoglosses: A Sketch on Persians and Parthians, Kurds and Medes&quot;, Monumentum H.S.
