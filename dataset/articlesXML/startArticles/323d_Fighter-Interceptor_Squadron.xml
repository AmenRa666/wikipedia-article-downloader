The '''323d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' is an inactive [[United States Air Force]] unit.  Its last assignment was with [[Air Defense Command]] at [[Ernest Harmon Air Force Base]], Newfoundland, where it was inactivated on 1 July 1960.

The squadron was first activated as the '''323d Fighter Squadron''' during [[World War II]].  The unit served as a crew training unit until it was disbanded in a major reorganization of [[Army Air Forces]] units in the United States in 1944.

The squadron was reconstituted in 1953 as [[Air Defense Command]] expanded in the early 1950s. It initially provided defense for the Northwestern United States, but in 1957 moved to Newfoundland where it performed the same mission until inactivated in 1960.

==History==

===World War II===
The squadron was first activated in August 1942 at [[Mitchel Field]], New York&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS&gt;{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_sq_of_the_af_wwii.pdf |edition= reprint|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the original three squadrons of the '''327th Fighter Group'''.&lt;ref name=Maurer327FG&gt;{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/af_combat_units_wwii.pdf |edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|pages=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month it moved to its permanent home at [[Richmond Army Air Base]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt;  The squadron initially performed acted as an operational training unit with [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]s&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt; as part of the [[I Fighter Command]] of [[First Air Force]] for single-engine pilots who had just graduated from [[Army Air Forces Training Command]] advanced flying schools.  It was an oversized unit providing [[en cadre|cadres]] to newly organized &quot;satellite groups&quot;.&lt;ref name=CCV6&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Craven, Wesley F |editor2=Cate, James L |title=The Army Air Forces in World War II|volume=VI, Men &amp; Planes|year=1955|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|lccn=48-3657|page=xxxvi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After February 1944, the squadron became a replacement training unit training pilots in the [[Republic P-47D Thunderbolt]]&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt; before they were sent overseas to combat units as replacement pilots.

However, the [[Army Air Forces]] (AAF) was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were proving less well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.&lt;ref&gt;Craven &amp; Cate, p. 75, The Organization and its Responsibilities, Chapter 2 The AAF&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron was disbanded in 1944 as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt; and replaced by the '''390th Army Air Forces Base Unit''', Squadron &quot;A&quot;,{{citation needed|reason=390 Base unit was 3 AF organization not 1 AF|date=November 2013}} which assumed its mission, personnel and equipment.

===Cold War Air Defense===
The 323d was reconstituted as the '''323d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' under the [[25th Air Division]] of [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC) at [[Larson Air Force Base]], Washington in November 1952&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt; as part of the buildup of air defense interceptor units in the United States during the early years of the [[Cold War]].   The squadron was temporarily attached to the [[4702d Defense Wing]], until the [[4704th Defense Wing]] became operational following its move from California to Washington.&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt;  The squadron mission was [[air defense]] of the Pacific Northwest, particularly the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] and the [[Hanford Nuclear Reservation]].  The squadron was temporarily equipped with [[World War II]] era [[North American F-51 Mustang]]s, but upgraded to [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|Mighty Mouse rocket]] armed and airborne intercept [[radar]] equipped [[North American F-86D Sabre]] jet interceptors in 1953.&lt;ref name=CJ125&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornett|first=Lloyd H|author2=Johnson, Mildred W|title=A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization, 1946-1980|url = http://www.usafpatches.com/pubs/handbookofadcorg.pdf|year=1980|publisher=Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center|location=Peterson AFB, CO|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1955 ADC implemented Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.&lt;ref name=buss&gt;Buss, Lydus H.(ed), Sturm, Thomas A., Volan, Denys, and McMullen, Richard F., History of Continental Air Defense Command and Air Defense Command July to December 1955, Directorate of Historical Services, Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, CO, 1956., p.6&lt;/ref&gt;   As part of this project, the '''327th Fighter Group''' was activated to replace the [[520th Air Defense Group]] at [[Truax Field Air National Guard Base|Truax Field]], Wisconsin&lt;ref name=Maurer327FG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornett &amp; Johnson, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Project Arrow also reunited squadrons with their traditional group [[headquarters]], the 323nd moved on paper to Truax, where it assumed the mission, personnel and aircraft of the [[432d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], which moved on paper to another ADC base.&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;   The unit's new mission was air defense of the upper Great Lakes region.  In November 1956, the squadron upgraded to supersonic [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]]s equipped with [[data link]] to communicate directly with [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) [[analog computer|computers]] located in combat control centers and armed with the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] Missile.&lt;ref name=CJ125/&gt;

The squadron transferred in 1957 to [[Ernest Harmon AFB]], Newfoundland, swapping stations with the [[61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], which moved to Truax from Harmon.&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;  Its mission became air defense of the Newfoundland Straits and the Great Circle polar route from the Soviet Union over Greenland to Canada and the United States.   In 1960 it was assigned directly to the [[Goose Air Defense Sector]], but was inactivated later that year&lt;ref name=Maurer323FS/&gt; due to the emerging threat of missiles rather than manned aircraft.
