The '''Royal Australian Air Force''' ('''RAAF'''), formed March 1921, is the aerial warfare branch of the [[Australian Defence Force]]. It directly continues the traditions of the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC), formed on 22 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.raaf.gov.au/history/ww1.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930134309/http://www.raaf.gov.au/history/ww1.aspx | title=Australian Military Aviation and World War One| publisher=Royal Australian Air Force| accessdate=23 April 2010 |archivedate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF provides support across a spectrum of operations such as air superiority, precision strikes, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, air mobility, and humanitarian support.

The RAAF has taken part in many of the 20th century's major conflicts. During the [[Second World War]] a number of RAAF bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and other squadrons served initially in Britain, and with the [[Desert Air Force]] located in North Africa and the [[Mediterranean]], while the majority were later primarily deployed in the [[South West Pacific Area]]. Thousands of Australians also served with other Commonwealth air forces in Europe.&lt;ref name=Barnes3/&gt; By the time the war ended, a total of 216,900 men and women served in the RAAF, of whom 10,562 were killed in action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather 1995, p. 18&quot;&gt;Eather 1995, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the RAAF served in the [[Berlin Airlift]], [[Korean War]], [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Indonesia–Malaysia Confrontation]] and [[Vietnam War]]. More recently, the RAAF has participated in operations in [[Operation Astute|East Timor]], the [[Iraq War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], and the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)]].

The RAAF has 259 aircraft, of which 110 are combat aircraft.

{{Main article|History of the Royal Australian Air Force}}

===Formation, 1912===
The RAAF traces its history back to the [[Imperial Conference]] held in London in 1911, where it was decided aviation should be developed within the armed forces of the [[British Empire]]. Australia implemented this decision, the first dominion to do so, by approving the establishment of the &quot;Australian Aviation Corps&quot;, which initially consisted of the [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] at [[Point Cook, Victoria]], on 22 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.raaf.gov.au/history/ww1.aspx| title=Australian Military Aviation and World War One| publisher=Royal Australian Air Force| accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914 the corps was known as the &quot;Australian Flying Corps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10831.asp |publisher=Australian War Memorial |title=Australian Flying Corps |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
{{Main article|Australian Flying Corps}}
{{See also|Military history of Australia during World War I}}
Soon after the outbreak of war in 1914, the Australian Flying Corps sent aircraft to assist in capturing [[German New Guinea|German colonies]] in what is now north-east [[New Guinea]]. However, these colonies surrendered quickly, before the planes were even unpacked. The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]] was called upon to assist the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] in protecting British oil interests in what is now [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al 2008, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corps later saw action in [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] throughout the remainder of the First World War. By the end of the war, four squadrons—[[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|Nos. 1]], [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|2]], [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|3]] and [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|4]]—had seen operational service, while another four training squadrons—[[No. 5 Squadron RAAF|Nos. 5]], [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|6]], [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF|7]] and [[No. 8 Squadron RAAF|8]]—had also been established. A total of 460 officers and 2,234 other ranks served in the AFC, whilst another 200 men served as aircrew in the British flying services.&lt;ref&gt;Grey 1999, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Casualties included 175 dead, 111 wounded, 6 gassed and 40 captured.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont 2001, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war period===
The Australian Flying Corps remained part of the [[Australian Army]] until 1919, when it was disbanded along with the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF). Although the Central Flying School continued to operate at Point Cook, military flying virtually ceased until 1920, when the Australian Air Corps (AAC) was formed. The Australian Air Force was formed on 31 March 1921. [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] approved the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in June 1921 and became effective on 31 August 1921. The RAAF then became the second Royal air arm to be formed in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], following the British [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/| title=RAAF Museum Point Cook| publisher=Royal Australian Air Force| accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When formed the RAAF had more aircraft than personnel, with 21 officers and 128 other ranks and 153 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/History/interwar.aspx| title=RAAF – The Inter-war years 1921 to 1939| publisher=Royal Australian Air Force| accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
{{See also|Military history of Australia during World War II}}

====Europe and the Mediterranean====
In September 1939, the RAAF's Air Board directly controlled the Air Force via [[RAAF Station Laverton]], [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF]] at Point Cook, [[RAAF Base Rathmines|RAAF Station Rathmines]] and five smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Leo Niehorster |url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_raf/RAAF/_raaf.html |title=Royal Australian Air Force, 03.09.1939 |publisher=Orbat.com |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, just after the outbreak of the Second World War, Australia joined the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]], under which flight crews received basic training in Australia before travelling to Canada for advanced training. A total of 17 RAAF bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and other squadrons served initially in Britain and with the [[Desert Air Force]] located in North Africa and the [[Mediterranean]]. Thousands of Australians also served with other Commonwealth air forces in Europe during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Barnes3/&gt; About nine percent of the personnel who served under British RAF commands in Europe and the Mediterranean were RAAF personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/raaf/explore.html|title=Explore: 'The Angry Sky'|publisher=[[Department of Veterans' Affairs]]|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With British manufacturing targeted by the German [[Luftwaffe]], in 1941 the Australian government created the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP; later known as the [[Government Aircraft Factories]]) to supply Commonwealth air forces,&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al 2008, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; and the RAAF was eventually provided with large numbers of locally built versions of British designs such as the [[Bristol Beaufort|DAP Beaufort]] [[torpedo bomber]], Beaufighters and Mosquitos, as well as other types such as Wirraways, Boomerangs, and Mustangs.&lt;ref name=Barnes3&gt;Barnes 2000, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]] of the war, RAAF personnel were especially notable in [[RAF Bomber Command]]: although they represented just two percent of all Australian enlistments during the war, they accounted for almost twenty percent of those killed in action. This statistic is further illustrated by the fact that [[No. 460 Squadron RAAF]], mostly flying [[Avro Lancaster]]s, had an official establishment of about 200 aircrew and yet had 1,018 combat deaths. The squadron was therefore effectively wiped out five times over.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Total RAAF casualties in Europe were 5,488 killed or missing.&lt;ref name=Barnes3/&gt;

[[File:Kittyhawk IA RAAF.jpg|thumb|Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk IA of 75th Squadron RAAF, which F/O Geoff Atherton flew over New Guinea in August 1942.]]

====Pacific War====
[[File:BrewsterBuffalosMkIRAAFSingaporeOctober1941.jpg|thumb|[[Brewster Buffalo]] fighters, flown by many RAAF fighter pilots in the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Netherlands East Indies|Dutch East Indies campaigns]], as seen here being inspected at [[Sembawang Airbase|RAF Sembawang]], Singapore.]]

The beginning of the [[Pacific War]]—and the rapid advance of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese forces—threatened the Australian mainland for the first time in its history. The RAAF was quite unprepared for the emergency, and initially had negligible forces available for service in the Pacific. In 1941 and early 1942, many RAAF airmen, including Nos. 1, 8, [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|21]] and [[No. 453 Squadron RAAF|453 Squadron]]s, saw action with the [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Command]] in the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Netherlands East Indies|Dutch East Indies campaigns]]. Equipped with aircraft such as the [[Brewster Buffalo]], and [[Lockheed Hudson]]s, the Australian squadrons suffered heavily against Japanese Zeros.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|fighting for Rabaul]] in early 1942, [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF]] fought a brief, but ultimately futile defence as the Japanese advanced south towards Australia.&lt;ref name=Armstrong45&gt;Armstrong, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The devastating [[Bombing of Darwin (February 1942)|air raids on Darwin]] on 19 February 1942 increased concerns about the direct threat facing Australia. In response, some RAAF squadrons were transferred from the [[northern hemisphere]]—although a substantial number remained there until the end of the war. Shortages of fighter and [[close air support|ground attack]] planes led to the acquisition of US-built [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks]] and the rapid design and manufacture of the first Australian fighter, the [[CAC Boomerang]]. RAAF Kittyhawks came to play a crucial role in the [[New Guinea]] and [[Solomon Islands]] campaigns, especially in operations like the [[Battle of Milne Bay]]. As a response to a possible Japanese chemical warfare threat the RAAF imported hundreds of thousands of chemical weapons into Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustardgas.org|title=Chemical Warfare in Australia|publisher=Geoff Plunkett|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StateLibQld 1 100268.jpg|thumb|200px|RAAF volunteers from Brisbane leaving for training]]

In the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], imported [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s proved to be highly effective ground attack and maritime strike aircraft. Beaufighters were later made locally by the DAP from 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al 2008, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was much bigger than Japanese fighters, the Beaufighter had the speed to outrun them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Taylor 1978, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF's [[heavy bomber]] force was predominantly made up of 287 [[B-24 Liberator]]s, equipping seven squadrons, which could bomb Japanese targets as far away as [[Borneo]] and the Philippines from airfields in Australia and New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/subject_689.asp |title=Consolidated B24 Liberator |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1945, the RAAF had received or ordered about 500 [[P-51 Mustang]]s, for fighter/ground attack purposes. The [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] initially assembled US-made Mustangs, but later manufactured most of those used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/subject_709.asp |title=North American P51 Mustang |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1945, the RAAF's main operational formation in the Pacific, the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|First Tactical Air Force]] (1st TAF), consisted of over 21,000 personnel, while the RAAF as a whole consisted of about 50 squadrons and 6,000 aircraft, of which over 3,000 were operational.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler 2001, pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st TAF's final campaigns were fought in support of Australian ground forces in [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo]],&lt;ref name=Sandler22&gt;Sandler 2001, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; but had the war continued some of its personnel and equipment would likely have been allocated to the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese mainland]], along with some of the RAAF bomber squadrons in Europe, which were to be grouped together with British and Canadian squadrons as part of the proposed [[Tiger Force (air)|Tiger Force]]. However, the war was brought to a sudden end by the US [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear attack]]s on Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11175.asp |publisher=Australian War Memorial |title= 467 Squadron RAAF |work=Second World War, 1939&amp;ndash;1945 units |accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF's casualties in the Pacific were around 2,000 killed, wounded or captured.&lt;ref name=Sandler22/&gt;

By the time the war ended, a total of 216,900 men and women served in the RAAF, of whom 10,562 were killed in action; a total of 76 squadrons were formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eather 1995, p. 18&quot;/&gt; With over 152,000 personnel operating nearly 6,000 aircraft it was the world's fourth largest air force.&lt;ref&gt;Eather 1996, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service since 1945===
During the [[Berlin Airlift]], in 1948–49, the [[RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift]] aided the international effort to fly in supplies to the stricken city; two RAF [[Avro York]] aircraft were also crewed by RAAF personnel. Although a small part of the operation, the RAAF contribution was significant, flying 2,062 sorties and carrying 7,030 tons of freight and 6,964 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;Eather 1996, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Korean War]], from 1950–53, [[North American P-51 Mustang|North American Mustangs]] from [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF]], stationed in Japan with the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], were among the first United Nations aircraft to be deployed, in ground support, combat air patrol, and escort missions. When the UN planes were confronted by North Korean [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] jet fighters, 77 Sqn acquired [[Gloster Meteor]]s, however the MiGs remained superior and the Meteors were relegated to ground support missions as the North Koreans gained experience. The air force also operated transport aircraft during the conflict. No. 77 Squadron flew 18,872 sorties, claiming the destruction of 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, 16 bridges, 98 railway carriages and an unknown number of enemy personnel. Three MiG-15s were confirmed destroyed, and two others probably destroyed. RAAF casualties included 41 killed and seven captured; 66 aircraft – 22 Mustangs and 44 Meteors – were lost.&lt;ref&gt;Eather 1996, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two Mirage III of the Royal Australian Air Force 1.JPEG|thumb|left||Two RAAF [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] fighters in 1980]]

In July 1952, [[No. 78 Wing RAAF]] was deployed to [[Malta]] in the Mediterranean where it formed part of a British force which sought to counter the Soviet Union's influence in the Middle East as part of Australia's Cold War commitments. Consisting of No. 75 and 76 Squadrons equipped with [[de Havilland Vampire]] jet fighters, the wing provided an air garrison for the island for the next two and half years, returning to Australia in late 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Eather 1996, pp. 172–183&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, a [[Royal Air Force]] officer, Air Marshal Sir [[Donald Hardman]], was brought out to Australia to become Chief of the Air Staff.&lt;ref&gt;Millar 1969, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; He reorganised the RAAF into three commands: [[RAAF Home Command|Home Command]], [[RAAF Maintenance Command|Maintenance Command]], and [[RAAF Training Command|Training Command]]. Five years later, Home Command was renamed [[RAAF Operational Command|Operational Command]], and Training Command and Maintenance Command were amalgamated to form [[RAAF Support Command|Support Command]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al 2008, pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Malayan Emergency]], from 1950–60, six [[Avro Lincoln]]s from [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF]] and a flight of [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakotas]] from [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF]] took part in operations against the communist guerrillas (labelled as &quot;Communist Terrorists&quot; by the British authorities) as part of the [[RAF Far East Air Force]]. The Dakotas were used on cargo runs, in troop movement and in paratroop and leaflet drops within Malaya. The Lincolns, operating from bases in Singapore and from Kuala Lumpur, formed the backbone of the air war against the CTs, conducting bombing missions against their jungle bases. Although results were often difficult to assess, they allowed the government to harass CT forces, attack their base camps when identified and keep them on the move. Later, in 1958, Canberra bombers from [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF]] were deployed to Malaya and took part in bombing missions against the CTs.&lt;ref&gt;Eather 1996, pp. 40–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], from 1964–72, the RAAF contributed Caribou [[STOL]] transport aircraft as part of the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam, later redesignated [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF]], [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters from [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF]], and [[English Electric Canberra]] bombers from [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF]]. The Canberras flew 11,963 bombing [[sortie]]s, and two aircraft were lost. One went missing during a bombing raid. The wreckage of the aircraft was recovered in April 2009, and the remains of Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver were found in late July 2009. The other was shot down by a [[surface-to-air missile]], although both crew were rescued. They dropped 76,389 bombs and were credited with 786 enemy personnel confirmed killed and a further 3,390 estimated killed, 8,637 structures, 15,568 bunkers, 1,267 sampans and 74 bridges destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF transport aircraft also supported [[anti-communist]] ground forces. The UH-1 helicopters were used in many roles including [[medical evacuation]] and close air support. RAAF casualties in Vietnam included six killed in action, eight non-battle fatalities, 30 wounded in action and 30 injured.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark 1995, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of RAAF pilots also served in United States Air Force units, flying [[F-4 Phantom]] fighter-bombers or serving as forward air controllers.&lt;ref name=Barnes5&gt;Barnes 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military airlifts were conducted for a number of purposes in the intervening decades, such as the peacekeeping operations in [[East Timor]] from 1999. Australia's combat aircraft were not used again in combat until the [[Operation Falconer|Iraq War]] in 2003, when 14 F/A-18s from [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF]] operated in the escort and ground attack roles, flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser-guided bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Holmes, 'RAAF Hornets at War' in ''Australian Aviation'', January/February 2006, No. 224. pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; A detachment of [[Lockheed AP-3C Orion|AP-3C Orion]] maritime patrol aircraft were deployed in the Middle East between 2003 and 2012. These aircraft conducted maritime surveillance patrols over the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea in support of Coalition warships and boarding parties, as well as conducting extensive overland flights of Iraq and Afghanistan on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and supporting counter-piracy operations in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mission complete on wings of a dream craft|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/orion-crews-end-10-year-middle-east-mission-with-last-plane-touching-down-at-edinburgh-raaf-base/story-e6frea6u-1226526827264|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Adelaide Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranks and uniform==
[[File:Leading Aircraft Woman Patricia Entwistle RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|A leading aircraftwoman from No. 75 Squadron wearing Auscam DPCU, 2008]]
{{Main article|Ranks of the Royal Australian Air Force}}

The rank structure of the nascent RAAF was established within the context of the desire to ensure that the service remained separate from both the Army and Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Grey 2008, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; While the service's predecessor formations, the AFC and the AAC, had used the Army's rank structure, in November 1920, just prior to the RAAF's foundation, it was decided by the Air Board that the RAAF would adopt the rank structure that had been implemented in the RAF the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mhhv.org.au/?p=1539 |title=The Australian Air Corps |publisher=Military History and Heritage Victoria |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the RAAF's rank structure came to be: Aircraftsman, Leading Aircraftsman, Corporal, Sergeant, Flight Sergeant,  Warrant Officer, Officer Cadet, Pilot Officer, Flying Officer. Flight Lieutenant, Squadron Leader, Wing Commander, Group Captain,  Air Commodore, Air Vice Marshal,  Air Marshal, Air Chief Marshal,  Marshal of the RAAF.&lt;ref name=ranks/&gt;

In 1922, the colour of the RAAF winter uniform was determined by Williams on a visit to the Geelong Wool Mill.  He asked for one dye dip fewer than the RAN blue (three indigo dips rather than four). There was a change to a lighter blue when an all-seasons uniform was introduced in the 1970s. The original colour and style were re-adopted around 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Air Marshal Sir Richard, ''These are the Facts'', Australian War Memorial, Canberra, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=54 |title='Air Force blue' uniform re-introduced into the RAAF |publisher= Royal Australian Air Force |work=Air Power Development Centre |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slip-on rank [[epaulette]]s, known as &quot;Soft Rank Insignia&quot; (SRI), displaying the word &lt;small&gt;&quot;AUSTRALIA&quot;&lt;/small&gt; are worn on the shoulders of the service dress uniform.&lt;ref name=ranks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/About-the-RAAF/Air-Force-Ranks/?RAAF-ds28ntGZ3Zf5LVCVNMNlzxkNss9skbgX |title=Air Force Ranks |work=About the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not in the service dress or &quot;ceremonial&quot; uniform, RAAF personnel wear the [[Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform|Auscam DPCU]] as a working dress. Commencing in mid-2014 DPCU began to be replaced, only in the non-deployed environment, with the General Purpose Uniform (GPU) which is a blue version of the Australian Multicam Pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/About-the-RAAF/Air-Force-General-Purpose-Uniform/?RAAF-4U4d0xqin/tKoDM01/dIeUFheHnCWT8Q |title=Air Force General Purpose Uniform |work=About the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roundel==
Originally, the air force used the existing red, white and blue roundel of the [[Royal Air Force]]. However, during the Second World War the inner red circle, which was visually similar to the Japanese [[Hinomaru]], was removed after a [[No. 11 Squadron RAAF|No. 11 Squadron]] Catalina was mistaken for a Japanese aircraft by a [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|US Navy Wildcat]] in the Pacific Theatre.&lt;ref name=roundel/&gt;

After the war, a range of options for the RAAF roundel were proposed, including the Southern Cross, a boomerang, a sprig of wattle, and the red kangaroo. On 2 July 1956, the current version of the roundel was formally adopted. This consists of a white inner circle with a [[red kangaroo]] surrounded by a royal blue circle. The kangaroo faces left, except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face in the direction of travel.&lt;ref name=roundel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/About-the-RAAF/Air-Force-Roundel/?RAAF-19j/ms/wfJI7szJiav0qS4757UzFI9b7 |title=Air Force Roundel |work=About the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low visibility versions of the roundel exist, with the white omitted and the red and blue replaced with light or dark grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Australia---Air/McDonnell-Douglas-F-A-18A/2406497/L/&amp;sid=8e33aaf09329803b1ab7f1a88bed01f2 |title=Picture of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet aircraft |author=Austin, Steven |publisher=Airliners.net |accessdate=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Badge==
The RAAF badge was accepted by the [[Chester Herald]] in 1939. The badge is composed of the imperial crown mounted on a circle featuring the words Royal Australian Air Force, beneath which scroll work displays the Latin motto ''[[Per Ardua Ad Astra]]'', which it shares with the Royal Air Force. Surmounting the badge is a [[wedge-tailed eagle]]. ''Per Ardua Ad Astra'' is attributed with the meaning &quot;Through Adversity to the Stars&quot; and is from [[H. Rider Haggard|Sir Henry Rider Haggard's]] novel ''[[The People of the Mist]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Australian Air Force Badge|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Australian Department of Defence]]|url=http://www.raaf.gov.au/aboutus/badge.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701102743/http://www.raaf.gov.au/AboutUs/badge.aspx |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archivedate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current strength==

As of 2014, the RAAF had 13,991 permanent full-time personnel and 4,316 part-time active reserve personnel.&lt;ref name=DefenceIssues2014/&gt;

In a first stage not fewer than 72 aircraft will be acquired to equip three operational squadrons. The remaining aircraft will be acquired in conjunction with the withdrawal of the F/A-18F Super Hornets after 2020 to ensure no gap in Australia's overall air combat capability occurs. On 25 November 2009, Australia committed to placing a first order for 14 aircraft at a cost of [[Australian dollar|A$]]3.2&amp;nbsp;billion with deliveries to begin in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus order 14 F-35&quot;&gt;Walters, Patrick.[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/kevin-rudd-signs-off-on-purchase-of-14-f-35-joint-strike-fighters/story-e6frg8yo-1225803790418 &quot;Kevin Rudd signs off on purchase of 14 F-35 joint strike fighters.&quot;] ''The Australian'', 25 November 2009.

* Twelve [[Boeing EA-18G Growler|EA-18G Growlers]], in 2010 the two-seat F/A-18Fs were acquired as an interim measure until the introduction of the F-35As; avoiding a strike capability gap with the retirement of the F-111s and to cover for any fatigue issues related to the legacy F/A-18 fleet. US Navy production slots were used with the first batch of five Super Hornets arriving at RAAF Base Amberley on 26 March 2010; a second batch of six arriving on 6 July 2010; and a third batch of four arriving on 7 December 2010.
