The 20-gun French corvette '''''Hussard''''' (or '''''Hussar''''') was launched in 1799 and the British captured her that same year when they captured [[Suriname]]. The [[Royal Navy]] took her into service as HMS ''Surinam'', as there was already an {{HMS|Hussar|1798|6}}. The Dutch captured her in 1803, naming her ''Suriname'', but the British recaptured her in 1807 and sent her to Britain. Thereafter she never again served on active duty. She disappeared from the Navy lists in 1809, but her fate is unknown.

==Capture==
On 20 August 1799, a British force under the command of Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge and Vice Admiral the Right Honourable [[Lord Hugh Seymour]] captured the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]]. Among the various items of booty was the French corvette ''Hussar''.  The American ships {{USS|Portsmouth|1798|6}} (24) and {{USS|Scammel|1798|6}} (12), searching for French vessels that had been preying on American merchantmen, had blockaded ''Hussar'' for two months in the Suriname River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/s/scammel.html [[DANFS]]: '&quot;Scammel''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, ''Hussar'' surrendered to the Americans, who removed her crew. Shortly thereafter the British arrived and captured Suriname. The Americans agreed that the British had rights to ''Hussar'' herself as she had been in inland waters upon the surrender of Suriname. (The British also captured the Dutch brig-sloop [[Dutch cutter Kemphaan (1781)|''Kemphaan'']], which they took into service under the name ''Camphaan''.) The letter reporting the corvette's capture describes her as &quot;The French Corvette L'Hussar, a very fine Vessel, only Seven Months old; mounts Twenty Nine-Pounders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1049|endpage=1053|issue=15194|date=12 October 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British renamed her ''Surinam'' and Lieutenant [[Christopher Cole (Royal Navy officer)|Christopher Cole]], of {{HMS|Prince of Wales|1794|2}} was appointed to command her.

==British service==
''Surinam'' then served on the Leeward Islands station. Over the period from late March to early April 1800 Cole captured two French privateers and recaptured a merchant schooner. First, on 24 March, he captured the sloop ''Consolateur'', of one gun and 35 men. She too left Point-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe on a cruise.&lt;ref name=LG15295&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15295|startpage=1084|date=20 September 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, two days later he captured the sloop ''Renard'', of three guns and 15 men. She two had left Point-à-Pitre.&lt;ref name=LG15295/&gt; Lastly, on 3 April re recaptured the schooner ''Lack''.&lt;ref name=LG15295/&gt;

Cole also introduced new regulations aboard his ship that kept his men in good health in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. In 1801, Seymour died from a fever, but Cole's activities had already been noticed by [[John Thomas Duckworth|Sir John Thomas Duckworth]] who replaced Seymour and Cole was made a [[post captain]] on 30 June 1801 in Duckworth's flagship {{HMS|Leviathan|1790|2}}.
Cole's replacement was Lieutenant Randall MacDonnell. His replacement, in 1803, was Commander Robert Tucker (acting).&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodore Sir [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]] sent Tucker and Surinam on a mission to [[Saint-Domingue]] to try to secure the release of two British officers reportedly in the hands of the rebels at [[Gonaïves]]. On discovering that one of the officers had already been executed and that the other had escaped, Tucker then sailed to [[Jacmel]], where he assisted the besieged French garrison. Two days after leaving Jacmel, ''Surinam'' sustained damage and Tucker then put in at [[Curaçao]] for repairs.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp.385-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture by the Dutch==
While Tucker was at St Anna Bay, Curaçao,&lt;ref name=Hepper/&gt; the Dutch found out, from a prize that Tucker had sent to Jamaica for news and that had returned, that war had been declared between Britain and Holland. The Dutch then seized Tucker and ''Surinam'' on 23 June,&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; despite Tucker's best efforts to escape.{{#tag:ref|James has an account that has [[Michael Fitton]] of ''Gipsey'' warning Tucker and Tucker acting imprudently.&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.283-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitton later repudiated James's report.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;|group=Note}} The Dutch first released ''Surinam{{'}}''s crew, and then Tucker and his officers, in hopes of an exchange of prisoners. Tucker himself spent some four months in close confinement in a dungeon. At his subsequent court-martial, Tucker was acquitted of all blame for the loss.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; However, the court-martial did reprimand Tucker for unofficerlike conduct in his dealings with the Dutch authorities. It ordered him to be put at the bottom of the list of Commanders; thereafter he never again was employed in the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=Hepper&gt;Hepper (1994), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dutch took ''Surinam'' into service as ''Suriname''.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Recapture and fate==
[[File:Capture of Curacoa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The capture of Curaçao, depicted by [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]
On 1 January 1807 {{HMS|Arethusa|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Latona|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Anson|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Fisgard|1797|2}}, and {{HMS|Morne Fortunee|1804|2}} captured Curaçao, and with it ''Suriname''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16003|startpage=241|endpage=243|date=22 February 1807}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch resisted, and ''Suriname'' suffered five men wounded, including her captain, Jan Van Ness; one of the wounded died later. The British described her as having 22 guns. The British also captured the Dutch frigate &quot;Kenau Hasselaar&quot;, which they took into service as {{HMS|Halstarr|1807|2}} (or ''Halstaar''). Her captain, Cornelius J. Evertz, had also commanded the Dutch naval force in Curaçao. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]] with clasp &quot;Curacoa 1 Jany. 1807&quot; to the 65 surviving claimants from the action. Captain [[Charles Brisbane]], captain of ''Arethusa'' and commander of the squadron, also received a [[Naval Gold Medal|gold medal]].

In February 1807 Commander Henry Higman was appointed to command ''Surinam'' on the [[Jamaica Station (Royal Navy)|Jamaica station]]. Towards the end of the year he sailed her back to Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-376870&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_iv.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 376870|work=Warship Histories, vol iv|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=30 July 2011}} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In 1806, Higman had briefly been captain of another {{HMS|Surinam|1805|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some records suggest that ''Suriname'' was later renamed ''Sasnarang'', the Navy having already commissioned another ''Surinam''.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; A more likely name is ''Samarang'', Sir [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Edward Pellew]] in [[French frigate Psyche (1804)|''Psyche'']] having captured several Dutch vessels at [[Samarang]] in August. ''Surinam'' (or ''Samarang'' or ''Sasnarang'') saw no further active service. She remained on the Navy lists until 1809, but her eventual disposition is unknown.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;
