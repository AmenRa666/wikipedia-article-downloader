'''Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Wurmheller''' (4 May 1917 – 22 June 1944) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' pilot during [[World War II]], a [[fighter ace]] credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down in over 300 combat missions. He claimed the majority of his aerial victories over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], and nine over the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Of his 93 victories over the [[Western Allies]], at least 18–20 were [[Heavy bomber|four-engined bombers]] and 56 were against [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters.

Born in [[Hausham]], Wurmheller was a [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] pilot in his youth, and volunteered for military service in the ''Luftwaffe'' of the [[Third Reich]] in 1937. Following flight training he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing) in 1939. He claimed his first aerial victory on the Western Front on 30 September 1939, a phase of World War II dubbed the [[Phoney War]]. He then served as a flight instructor before returning to JG 53 for the [[Battle of Britain]]. In June 1941 he participated in [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 4 September 1941 after 32 victories. Following another tour as fighter pilot instructor, he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] &quot;Richthofen&quot; (JG 2—2nd Fighter Wing) operating on the Channel Front. Wurmheller claimed seven aerial victories during the [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942 and after his 67th victory was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 1 October 1942.

In April 1943, Wurmheller was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of 9. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (9th squadron) of JG&amp;nbsp;2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;. On 8 June 1944, two days after the Allied [[Invasion of Normandy]], he was given command of III. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (3rd group) of JG&amp;nbsp;2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;. He and his wingman were killed in a [[mid-air collision]] during combat near [[Alençon]], France on 22 June 1944. Wurmheller was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major) and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] on 24 October 1944.

==Early life and career==
Wurmheller was born on 4 May 1917 in [[Hausham]] in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], a [[federated state]] of the [[German Empire]]. After growing up on his uncle's farm at [[Schliersee]], he spent four years working as a [[miner]] like his father. He was also an enthusiastic [[gliding|glider pilot]] and in 1937 he volunteered for military service in the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. Following training as a fighter pilot, Wurmheller, holding the rank of ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' (sergeant), was posted to 2. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (2nd squadron) of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing) in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p184&quot;&gt;Stockert 2012, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations, see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)|Organization of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. On 30 September, elements of I. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (1st group) of JG 53 encountered a formation of five [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Fairey Battle]] single-engined bombers in the vicinity of [[Saarbrücken]] during the early [[Phoney War]] period. Wurmheller claimed his first victory during this encounter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p184&quot;/&gt; The Fairey Battle ''K9283, ''of [[No. 150 Squadron RAF|No. 150 Squadron]] flown by [[Squadron Leader]] William MacDonald, was on an [[aerial reconnaissance]] mission in the area from [[Metzing]] to Saarbrücken and crash-landed at [[Écury-sur-Coole]].&lt;ref&gt;Air Pictorial 1989, vol. 51, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shores, Foreman &amp; Ehrengardt 1992, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodrum 2013, ch. 5 &quot;[https://books.google.de/books?id=3JU7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT184&amp;dq=No.+150+Squadron++Macdonald&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TvKsVJ3eJuX4yQOb74KYDw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=No.%20150%20Squadron%20%20Macdonald&amp;f=false Blitzed, Burned But Unbroken]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For this victory, Wurmheller received the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{Lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz 2. Klasse''}}) on 19 October 1939. He was posted to the ''[[Jagdfliegerschule]]'' (fighter pilot school) at [[Werneuchen]] as an instructor in November 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p184&quot;/&gt;

===Battle of Britain and Eastern Front===
Following a tour as an instructor at the ''Luftwaffe'' fighter pilot school, Wurmheller returned to 5. ''Staffel'' of JG 53 in June 1940. During the [[Battle of Britain]], he flew combat missions as a fighter pilot and as a [[fighter-bomber]] pilot. He claimed four further victories in this campaign and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{Lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz 1. Klasse''}}) on 16 October 1940. He was shot down three times himself by RAF fighters and each time had to [[parachute|bail out]]. On the third occasion, he was shot down in [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] E-4 (''Werknummer'' 5242—factory number) at approximately 5:10 pm on 23 November over the [[English Channel]] and had to swim for four-and-a-half hours before he was rescued by a ''[[Schnellboot]]'' (E-boat) of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (Navy).&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1997, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitalized until March 1941, he returned to combat duty and claimed two [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s shot down on 7 May 1941, his 9th and 10th victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p184&quot;/&gt;

Wurmheller's unit was subsequently transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War 2)|Eastern Front]] in preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941. During Barbarossa he was deployed in the southern sector of the German advance. He added nine victories—eight bombers and one [[Polikarpov I-16]] &quot;Rata&quot; fighter—in this theater of operations. His last victory on the Eastern Front, his 19th overall, was claimed on 15 July 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p184&quot;/&gt;

===Channel Front===
[[File:JG 2.svg|thumb|right|upright|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; Emblem]]
Wurmheller was transferred back to the Channel Front on 20 July 1941. He was assigned to the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stab]]'' (headquarters unit) of II. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 2]] &quot;Richthofen&quot; (JG 2—2nd Fighter Wing), named after the [[World War I]] fighter ace [[Manfred von Richthofen]]. He claimed his 20th aerial victory on 24 July 1941 and over a period of four weeks claimed a further 12 victories, all over Spitfires, including five in one day, making him an &quot;[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p184&quot;/&gt;

On 30 August 1941, Wurmheller was awarded the [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe]] ({{Lang|de|''Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe''}}), and on 4 September he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes''}}) for 32 aerial victories. His former unit, 5. ''Staffel'' of JG 53, had nominated him for the Knight's Cross, but the nomination was not approved until he was assigned to JG&amp;nbsp;2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p184&quot;/&gt; On the same day, his fellow II. ''Gruppe'' pilot ''Oberfeldwebel'' [[Kurt Bühligen]] also received the Knight's Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Wurmheller flew a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#F-0, F-1, F-2|Bf 109 F-2]] from the airbase at [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise|St Pol-Bryas]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 1999, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a minor injury, Wurmheller was again posted to the fighter pilot school in Werneuchen as an instructor. Upon his return to front line duty in May 1942, he was posted to 1. ''Staffel'' and claimed 10 victories during May 1942 and a further 12 victories the following month. Among these claims were four Spitfires shot down on 31 May and five on 5 June 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p185&quot;&gt;Stockert 2012, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these missions were flown with [[Rudolf Pflanz]] as his [[wingman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier p38&quot;&gt;Obermaier 1986, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wurmheller's most successful day as a fighter pilot was during the [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942. On that day, the Allies unsuccessfully attacked the German-occupied port of [[Dieppe]]. Over 6,000 [[infantry]]men, predominantly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armored]] regiment and a strong force of [[Royal Marines]] and smaller RAF landing contingents. Wurmheller, whose right foot was plastered in an [[orthopedic cast]], claimed seven victories during the course of four combat missions that day, six Spitfires and a [[Bristol Blenheim]] bomber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p185&quot;/&gt; The Blenheim most likely was a misidentified [[Martin Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; He had to abort his first mission due to engine trouble, suffering a minor concussion in the forced landing. He returned from his second mission claiming two Spitfires and a Blenheim shot down. His third mission resulted in the destruction of three more Spitfires, his 56th to 58th victories. Wurmheller claimed another Spitfire shout down on his fourth combat mission. The next day, 20 August, he claimed his 60th aerial victory, which earned him the [[German Cross]] in Gold ({{Lang|de|''Deutsches Kreuz in Gold''}}); it was awarded on 21 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p185&quot;/&gt;

Wurmheller was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) for bravery in the face of the enemy on 1 October 1942. Following his 67th aerial victory, achieved in about 150 combat missions, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub''}}) on 14 November 1942. He was the 146th officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p185&quot;/&gt;

The [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), in particular the [[Eighth Air Force]], began regular combat when the [[VIII Bomber Command]] attacked the [[Rouen]]–Sotteville [[marshalling yards]] in France on 17 August 1942. Wurmheller claimed four [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers shot down on 3 January 1943. On 1 April 1943 he was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of 9. ''Staffel'' of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p186&quot;&gt;Stockert 2012, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding ''Hauptmann'' (Captain) [[Siegfried Schnell]], who was transferred to III. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]] (JG 54—54th Fighter Wing).&lt;ref&gt;Weal 1996, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Wurmheller claimed his 70th victory on 17 May, when he shot down a B-17.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p186&quot;/&gt;

On 23 September, Wurmheller was wounded by bomb splinters while making an emergency landing in his [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-6]] during a bombing raid at [[Vannes]]–[[Meucon]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2000, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sepp&quot;, as he was named by his comrades, was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (first lieutenant) on 1 August 1943 and to ''Hauptmann'' on 1 November 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p186&quot;/&gt; He claimed his first [[heavy bomber]] in the [[Defense of the Reich]] campaign on 8 February 1944 in the vicinity of [[Le Tréport]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2011, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 1944, he claimed his 90th victory overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p186&quot;/&gt;

===Group commander and death===
Wurmheller claimed further aerial victories following the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] on 6 June 1944. He was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of III. ''Gruppe'' of JG 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; on 8 June, succeeding ''Hauptmann'' [[Herbert Huppertz]] who was [[killed in action]] near [[Caen]] earlier that day. Wurmheller claimed the last three victories of his total of 102 on 16 June 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockert p186&quot;/&gt; He was the 80th ''Luftwaffe'' pilot to achieve the century mark.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wurmheller was killed in his [[List of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 variants#A-8|Fw 190 A-8]] (''Werknummer'' 171 053) on 22 June 1944, when he collided with his wingman, ''[[Feldwebel]]'' (Staff Sergeant) Kurt Franzke, during aerial combat with USAAF [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) Spitfire fighters near [[Alençon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Florian Berger&quot;&gt;Berger 2000, pp. 386, 387.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''}}) and promoted to the rank of ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major) on 24 October 1944, which was back-dated to 1 June 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier p38&quot;/&gt; Wurmheller and Franzke were buried side by side at the War Cemetery Champigny-St. André, near [[Saint-André-de-l'Eure]], in plot 9, graves 1704 and 1705 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Stockert 2012, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;
