[[File:First F-4K Phantom FG.1 landing at McDonnell plant 1966.jpg|thumb|300px|The first British Phantom lands at the McDonnell plant in [[St Louis, Missouri]] in 1966]]
The United Kingdom operated the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] as one of its principal combat aircraft from the 1960s to the early 1990s. The UK was the first export customer for the Phantom, which was ordered in the context of political and economic difficulties around British designs for the roles that it  eventually undertook. The Phantom was procured to serve in both the [[Fleet Air Arm]] and [[Royal Air Force]] in several roles including [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]], [[close air support]], [[Attack aircraft|low-level strike]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|tactical reconnaissance]].

Although assembled in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing a significant amount of British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spirit&quot;&gt;Lake 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the [[Royal Navy]]'s aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the [[Falklands War]].

The Phantom entered service with both the Fleet Air Arm and the RAF in 1969. In the Royal Navy it had a secondary strike role in addition to its primary use for fleet air defence, while in the RAF it was soon replaced in the strike role by other aircraft designed specifically for strike and close air support. By the mid-1970s it had become the UK's principal interceptor, a role in which it continued until the late 1980s.

In the late 1950s, the British Government began the process of replacing its early [[Second-generation jet fighter|second-generation]] jet combat aircraft  in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm (FAA). At the time, the [[Aerospace industry in the United Kingdom|British aerospace industry]] was still a major source of equipment, and designs from several companies were in service. The [[1957 Defence White Paper]] brought about a significant change in the working practices, the Government compelling major aerospace manufacturers to amalgamate into two large groups: [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (formed from the merger of [[English Electric]], [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] and [[Hunting Aircraft|Hunting]]) and [[Hawker Siddeley]] (formed from the merger of Hawker Siddeley Aviation, [[Folland Aircraft|Folland]], [[de Havilland]] and [[Blackburn Aircraft|Blackburn]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1960 |title=An Industry Regrouped |journal=Flight |volume=78 |issue=2686 |pages=367–373 |publisher=Royal Aero Club |doi= |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%201649.html |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention was to rationalise the industry to cut costs, and the government offered incentives for amalgamation through promises of contracts for new aircraft orders for the armed forces. At the time, the RAF were looking to replace the [[English Electric Canberra]] light bomber in the long-range [[interdictor]] role, and the [[Hawker Hunter]] in the [[close air support]] role, while the Royal Navy sought an aircraft to assume the fleet [[air defence]] role from the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. BAC, through its English Electric subsidiary, had begun developing a new high-performance strike aircraft, the [[BAC TSR-2|TSR-2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1969 |title=Lessons of the TSR.2 Story |journal=Flight |volume=96 |issue=3161 |pages=570–571 |publisher=Royal Aero Club |doi= |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%202952.html |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended for long-range, low-level strike missions with conventional and tactical nuclear weapons, as well as tactical reconnaissance. Hawker Siddeley was also developing a new aircraft, based on its [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|P.1127]] [[V/STOL]] demonstrator. The [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154|P.1154]] was proposed as a [[supersonic]] version that could be marketed to both the RAF and Royal Navy to fulfil a number of roles: close air support, air superiority and fleet air defence.&lt;ref name=buttler_118-119&gt;Buttler 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hawker P1154 RAF and FAA.png|thumb|left|The RAF and RN variants of the P.1154]]
During the early 1960s, aircraft development became increasingly expensive, resulting in major projects often becoming mired in political and economic concerns. The development of TSR-2 saw increasing cost overruns, combined with the presence of a potentially cheaper alternative then under development in the United States, the [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke 2010, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The P.1154 was subject to the ongoing inter-service rivalry between the Royal Navy and RAF, which led to two wildly differing specifications being submitted for the aircraft that were impossible to fulfill with a single airframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Rise and Fall of the P.1154 |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/hawkerassociation/hanewsletters/hanewsletterpdf/hanewsletter036.pdf |journal=Hawker Association Newsletter |pages=4–5 |location= |publisher=Hawker Association |date=Summer 2013 |access-date=29 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:British carriers Victorious (R38), Ark Royal (R09) and Hermes (R12) underway c1961.jpg|thumb|A trio of British aircraft carriers in line astern in 1962; in spite of several receiving major upgrades, all of the Royal Navy's carriers were much smaller than those operated by the United States, which meant the Phantom had to undergo significant modifications to operate successfully from them.]]
In 1964, the Royal Navy withdrew from the P.1154 project, and moved to procure a new fleet air defence interceptor. It eventually selected the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], then in service with the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] as its primary air defence aircraft, intended to be operated from both existing and planned aircraft carriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thetford Naval&quot;&gt;Thetford 1994, pp. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; This better suited the Royal Navy, as the Phantom had two engines (providing redundancy in the event of an engine failure), was cheaper than the P.1154, and was immediately available.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; The P.1154 was thus left as a wholly RAF project. Later the same year, a [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|general election]] brought the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] back into power. The new government undertook a defence review, which led to the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] that cancelled several projects, including both the P.1154 and TSR-2. As a consequence, the government was forced to order new aircraft to replace the Canberra and Hunter for the RAF, and eventually chose two types. To replace the Canberra in the long-range role (which was intended for TSR-2), the F-111 was selected, with plans for a [[General Dynamics F-111K|redesigned variant]], while the roles undertaken by the Hunter (for which P.1154 was to be procured) would be undertaken by a further purchase of F-4 Phantoms. As the Phantom had been developed primarily for fleet air defence, the Royal Navy was happy with the choice of the aircraft as its Sea Vixen replacement, given that the type had been operational in that role with the US Navy since 1961, whilst US aircraft had successfully undertaken [[touch-and-go landing]]s on both {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thorn260&quot;&gt;Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axfordsabode.org.uk/pdf-docs/hermes14.pdf |title=HMS Hermes 1962–1964 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1964 |website=Axford's Abode |publisher= |access-date=2 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs280&quot;&gt;Hobbs 2014, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF was less enthusiastic, as the Phantom was primarily designed to operate in the air defence rather than the close air support role, and had been selected as its Hunter replacement more as a way of decreasing the per-unit cost of the overall UK order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avf4_3.html |title=Phantom In Foreign Service |last1=Goebel |first1=Greg |last2= |first2= |date=1 February 2014 |website=The McDonnell DOuglas F-4 Phantom |publisher= |access-date= 1 June 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vicflintham.co.uk/post-war-military-aircraft/phantom/phantom.html |title=McDonnell Phantom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619160419/http://www.vicflintham.co.uk/post-war-military-aircraft/phantom/phantom.html |archivedate=19 June 2015 |last1=Flintham |first1=Vic |last2= |first2= |date=2011 |website=vicflintham.co.uk |publisher= |access-date=1 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly as a means of guaranteeing employment in the British aerospace industry, agreement was reached that major portions of the UK's Phantoms would be built domestically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spirit&quot; /&gt; The F-4J variant, which was then the primary version in service with the US Navy, was taken as the basis for the UK aircraft, subject to major redesign. The most significant change was the substitution of the larger and more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] [[turbofan]] for the [[General Electric J79|GE J79]] [[turbojet]] to allow operations from the Royal Navy's carriers. Although several had received major upgrades, all of the UK carriers were smaller than the US carriers from which the J79-GE-8 and −10 powered Phantoms operated.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the larger engines, BAC redesigned and built the entire rear fuselage section. The [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] [[AN/APQ-120#AN/AWG-10|AN/AWG-10]] radar carried by the F-4J was to be procured and built under licence by [[Ferranti]] as the AN/AWG-11 for FAA aircraft and AN/AWG-12 for those of the RAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/phantom/history.php |title=Phantom History |last1=Burke |first1=Damien |last2= |first2= |date=12 April 2012 |website=Thunder &amp; Lightnings |publisher= |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtnage&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Courtnage |first= Paul|authorlink= |title=Vox Clamantis in Deserto |chapter= Chapter 5: The Phantom |chapterurl=http://www.projectoceanvision.com/vox-05.htm |accessdate=19 June 2013 |year=2006 |publisher=Project Ocean Vision |location= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes to the aircraft led to the two variants being given their own [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|separate series letters]], with the FAA version being designated as the F-4K and the RAF version as the F-4M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warbirdalley.com/phantom.htm |title=McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Warbird Alley |publisher=Doublestar Group |access-date=28 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, there was an intention to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development cost for the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. Because the government then had a policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large production run, which left the total order at 170.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hobbs |first1=David |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=British F-4 Phantoms |journal=Air International |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=30–37 |publisher=Key Publishing |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prototypes===
The British Government ordered a total of four prototypes (two F-4K and two F-4M), together with a pair of pre-production F-4K aircraft. The first UK Phantom, a prototype F-4K (designated YF-4K), first flew on 27 June 1966 at the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis. The second made its first flight on 30 August 1966. The two pre-production F-4K aircraft were constructed alongside the prototypes, and were initially used for [[Acceptance testing|fit check trials]] of the various systems to be fitted – the first was used for catapult/arrestor and deck landing trials, and the second was primarily for testing the radar and missile systems. All four were delivered to the UK from 1969 to 1970 for continued test work by both the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment and British Aerospace. One of the pre-production examples was subsequently delivered to the RAF for operational use, but was lost in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;Sturtivant 2004, pp. 470–471&lt;/ref&gt; The first F-4M prototype (designated YF-4M) first flew on 17 February 1967, and was also used for fit checks before delivery to the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;barg&quot;&gt;Petit et al 1983, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal Navy====
In 1964, 140 new-build Phantoms were ordered for the Fleet Air Arm to serve as the Royal Navy's primary fleet air defence aircraft, with a secondary strike capability. These were procured to replace the Sea Vixen then in service in the role, with the intention that they operate from the decks of four brand new or modernised [[aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;F-4K&quot; /&gt; At the time, the Royal Navy's carrier force consisted of five fleet or light fleet carriers of differing sizes and ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hobbs |first=David |date=2014 |title=British Aircraft Carriers: Design, Development &amp; Service Histories |url= |location= |publisher=Seaforth Publishing |page= |isbn=9781848321380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the five in service, only {{HMS|Eagle|R05|2}} and {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|2}}, each displacing approximately 50,000 tons, were big enough to accommodate the Phantom in sufficient numbers,{{efn-lr|''Victorious'' departed on her final commission with a total of 10 Sea Vixens and 7 Buccaneers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hampshireairfields.co.uk/britcar.html |title=British Carriers at Portsmouth 1954-2011 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Hampshire Airfields |publisher= |access-date=7 July 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by contrast, ''Ark Royal'' was able to accommodate an air group including up to 12 Phantoms and 14 Buccaneers,&lt;ref&gt;Benbow, 2011, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;}} so plans were put in place to rebuild the two ships to enable the operation of the aircraft.{{efn-lr|Although ''Eagle'' and ''Ark Royal'' were the largest ships in the UK's carrier fleet, some sources have stated that the plan for Phantom operation was to see aircraft obtained for use aboard ''Ark Royal'' and ''Victorious''&lt;ref name=davies31&gt;Davies, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beedle, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same time, plans were in place to construct two aircraft carriers to a new design, termed as &quot;[[CVA-01]]&quot;; the requirements for the intended force of four carriers meant that up to five squadrons of Phantoms could be purchased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs&quot;/&gt; However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper the Government decided to cancel CVA-01 (as well as cancelling TSR-2), which led to reductions in the total order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms; initially, 143 were ordered, which then went down to 110, and finally 50, with options for another seven.&lt;ref  name=phabulousf4k&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f-4.nl/f4_22.html|title=McDonnell F-4K Phantom FG.Mk.1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 December 1999|website=Phabulous Phantom|publisher= |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers, while the remaining aircraft served as a reserve and for training.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F-4K&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phantomf4k.org/history |title=History |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 May 2013 |website=Phantom F4K Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm |publisher= |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Navy received its first F-4K Phantoms, which carried the [[British military aircraft designation systems|British designation]] FG.1, in April 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; These were assigned to [[700 Naval Air Squadron|700P Naval Air Squadron]] (NAS), which was to serve as the Intensive Flying Trials Unit. Upon completion of the successful flight trials, [[767 Naval Air Squadron]] was commissioned in January 1969 as the FAA's [[Operational conversion unit|training squadron]]. This was followed at the end of March 1969 by [[892 Naval Air Squadron]], which was commissioned as the Royal Navy's first operational Phantom unit, intended to embark in ''Ark Royal'' once her three-year refit had completed in 1970.&lt;ref name=RNsquadrons&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phantomf4k.org/royal-navy-squadrons |title=Royal Navy Squadrons |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 May 2013 |website=Phantom F4K Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm |publisher= |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Fleet Air Arm was receiving its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for [[flight deck|flight deck trials]] aboard ''Eagle''.

''Ark Royal'' had entered refit to accommodate the Phantom in 1967; this involved a major reconstruction, including several elements to allow the ship to operate the aircraft – the flight deck was increased in area and fully angled to 8½°, the [[arresting gear]] was replaced with a new water-spray system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=9 August 1962 |title=Spray-type Arresting Gear |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201369.html |journal=Flight International |publisher=Hiffe Transport Publications |volume=82 |issue=2787 |pages=183 |doi= |access-date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to accommodate the Phantom's higher weight and landing speed, and [[Aircraft catapult#Bridle catchers|bridle catchers]]{{efn-lr|The launch bridle for the Phantom could only be used on that type, and was thus considerably more expensive than those used for other types.

In 1970, ''Ark Royal'' embarked 892 NAS as part of her [[Carrier Air Wing|air group]] for the first time, with a total of 12 aircraft. The first operational use of the Royal Navy's Phantoms had come in 1969, when 892 NAS had embarked for training with the US aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}} in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and had undertaken air defence missions alongside the ship's own F-4Js.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvHistory McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II&quot; /&gt; This deployment showed the necessity for the modifications fitted to ''Ark Royal'', as the heat from the afterburners of the Spey, combined with the increased [[angle of attack]] resulting from the extendable nosewheel, during the initial launches from ''Saratoga'' caused the deck plates to distort, leading to subsequent catapult launches being undertaken at reduced weight without the use of re-heat.&lt;ref name=davies31 /&gt; During ''Ark Royal'''s first three-year commission, 892 NAS, which had initially used [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]] in [[Somerset]] as its home base, moved to [[RAF Leuchars]] in [[Fife]] where, during the periods when it was not embarked, it undertook [[Quick Reaction Alert]] (QRA) duties alongside the RAF's 43 Squadron. The Phantom served in the Fleet Air Arm until 1978, when ''Ark Royal'' was finally withdrawn from service, leaving no ship in the Royal Navy capable of operating the type. The final catapult launch from ''Ark Royal'' was a Phantom of 892 NAS on 27 November 1978 during the disembarkation of the air group following the ship's final deployment; the squadron's aircraft were delivered to [[RAF St Athan]] in [[Wales]], where they were handed over to the RAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phantomf4k.org/892-squadron-record-of-service |title=892 Squadron record of service|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 May 2013 |website=Phantom F4K Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm |publisher= |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the type's service with the Royal Navy, 10 of the total FAA fleet of 28 were lost in crashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;losses&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/aircraft_by_type/f-4_phantom_raf.htm |title=F-4 Phantom – UK |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 November 2012 |website=ejection-history.org.uk |publisher= |access-date= 7 July 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hidden end}}

Upon the withdrawal of HMS ''Ark Royal'' in 1978, the Phantoms of the Fleet Air Arm were turned over to the RAF and used to form a second squadron at Leuchars. At the time, [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|111 Squadron]] was stationed there operating the FGR.2 version of the Phantom, having been there since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RAF Leuchars saying farewell to Treble One's Tornado F3s |first= |last= |url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/fife/130693/raf-leuchars-saying-farewell-to-treble-ones-tornado-f3s/ |newspaper=The Courier |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, to save costs resulting from the differences between the FG.1 and FGR.2, the squadron converted to the ex-Navy aircraft and the FGR.2 airframes were distributed to other Phantom units. Both 43 and 111 Squadrons retained the FG.1 until 1989, when they converted to the new [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F.3]]. Following the standing down of the two operational squadrons and the final withdrawal of the type from service, the bulk of the RAF's FG.1 Phantoms were scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2013/08/scrapped-raf-leuchars-phantom-f-4k-glasgow/ |title=Clydeside Carnage: The Battered Remains of RAF Leuchars' Phantom Fleet |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 August 2013 |website=Urban Ghosts |publisher= |access-date=1 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shrine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;survivors&quot; /&gt; The RAF lost eight of their FG.1s in crashes throughout the type's twenty year service.&lt;ref name=&quot;losses&quot; /&gt;

====Close air support====
Following the cancellation of both the TSR-2 and P.1154 programmes, the RAF were still left with a requirement to replace both the [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] and [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter]] in the long-range strike, close air support and reconnaissance roles. This resulted in the procurement of two aircraft, the [[General Dynamics F-111K]], intended for the long-range [[Interdictor|interdiction]] roles carried out by the Canberra, and the F-4M Phantom, which would be used in the close air support role undertaken by the Hunter. The F-111K was cancelled within a year of being ordered, but the order for 150 Phantoms went ahead alongside the Phantom order for the Royal Navy; the final 32 units of the RAF order were eventually cancelled.&lt;ref name=phabulousf4m&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f-4.nl/f4_24.html|title=McDonnell F-4M Phantom FGR.Mk.2 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 December 1999|website=Phabulous Phantom|publisher= |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF Phantom, given the [[British military aircraft designation systems|designation]] FGR.2, was broadly similar to the naval version, with some minor variations in terms of engines, [[avionics]] and structure, which related to its use as a land-based, rather than carrier-based aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

The first RAF Phantom unit was [[No. 228 Operational Conversion Unit RAF|228 Operational Conversion Unit]], which was stood up in August 1968. The Phantom entered operational service in May 1969, when [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|6 Squadron]] was formed at [[RAF Coningsby]] in the tactical strike role. [[No. 54 Squadron RAF|54 Squadron]] was formed in September the same year, followed by [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|41 Squadron]] in 1972 as a tactical reconnaissance unit. A further four squadrons were formed under [[RAF Germany]] in 1970 and 1971: [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|2]], [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|14]], [[No. 17 Squadron RAF|17]] and [[No. 31 Squadron RAF|31 Squadrons]], all at [[RAF Bruggen|RAF Brüggen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; Along with their conventional strike role, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons were assigned a tactical nuclear strike role under [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SACEUR]], using weapons supplied by the United States.&lt;ref name=defe-11-470-e30-p5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclear-weapons.info/images/tna-defe-11-470-e30-p5.jpg |title=Tactical Nuclear Weapons. 1971–1972. |publisher=The National Archives |id=DEFE 11/470 E30 |page=5 |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;Norris, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; After initial work-up, 2 Squadron moved to and operated from RAF Laarbruch in the tactical reconnaissance role. The aircraft assigned to the two tactical reconnaissance units were fitted with a pod containing four optical cameras, an [[Thermographic camera|infrared linescan]] and a [[side looking airborne radar|sideways looking radar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airrecce.co.uk/postww2/ac/Phantom/Phantom.html |title=McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR-2 EMI Reconnaissance Pod |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Post WW2 |publisher= |access-date=13 July 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, the RAF was developing a new aircraft specifically for the tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] was introduced into service in 1974, and led to a re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], meant that it was possible to begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

====Air defence====
In October 1974, [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|111 Squadron]] converted from the Lightning to the Phantom FGR.2, becoming the first unit to operate the type in the air defence role (notwithstanding 43 Squadron, which had used the FG.1 version since 1969). As more Jaguars were delivered, more Phantoms were released enabling existing Lightning squadrons to be converted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braybrook |first=Ray |date=1981 |title=Lightning |url= |journal=RAF Yearbook |location=Leicester |publisher=WM Caple |access-date=30 May 2016|pages=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|19 Squadron]] and [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]], the forward deployed air defence units in Germany, converted in 1976 and 1977 respectively, at the same time moving from [[RAF Gütersloh]], which was the closest RAF base to the [[Inner German border|East German border]], to [[RAF Wildenrath]], taking advantage of the Phantom's superior range over the Lightning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs&quot; /&gt; Three further UK based squadrons, [[No. 23 Squadron RAF|23]], [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|29]] and [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56]], were also converted between 1974 and 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs&quot; /&gt; 111 Squadron, which had been the first unit to use the FGR.2 as an interceptor, converted to the FG.1 version in 1979 following the transfer of the Royal Navy's remaining airframes to the RAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; The Phantom subsequently served as the RAF's primary interceptor for over a decade until the introduction into service of the Panavia Tornado F.3 in 1987.&lt;ref name=fricker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectoceanvision.com/vox-10.htm |title=Tornado |last1=Courtnage |first1=Paul |last2= |first2= |date=2016 |website=Vox Clamantis in Deserto |publisher= |access-date=29 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalaviationresource.com/reports/2011/f3retirement.php |title=Tornado F.3: Tremblers' Farewell – the end of the Tornado F.3 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 March 2011 |website=Global Aviation Resource |publisher= |access-date=29 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Phantoms were first delivered to interceptor squadrons, they remained in the grey-green [[aircraft camouflage|camouflage colour scheme]] more associated with the strike and close air support missions they had undertaken. During the late 1970s, the RAF began experimenting with new colours for its air defence units, with 56 Squadron tasked with trialling proposed new schemes. In October 1978, a Phantom FGR.2 of 56 Squadron became the first to be painted in the new air superiority grey colour, combined with small, low visibility [[RAF roundels|roundels]] and markings.

In May 1982, three Phantoms from [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|29 Squadron]] were forward deployed to [[RAF Wideawake]] on [[Ascension Island]] to provide air cover for the RAF's operations during the [[Falklands War]], replacing [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harriers]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|1 Squadron]], which were transiting to the war zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/F25-Falklands-Royal_Air_Force.htm |title=Part 15.

To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK Air Defence Region, the RAF procured 15 second-hand F-4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy. These aircraft were operated by [[No. 74 Squadron RAF|74 Squadron]] from 1984 until 1991, when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunset&quot; /&gt; Initially, it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other. A total of 152 Tornado F.3s were ordered for the RAF, enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of Lightnings, but insufficient to completely convert every air defence squadron. Both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988, alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons. The intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at [[RAF Wattisham]], alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide air defence cover for the southern half of the UK Air Defence Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peacock |first=Lindsay |date=1990 |title=For F4 Read F3 |url= |journal=RAF Yearbook |location=Fairford |publisher=IAT Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another two squadrons stationed in Germany would also be retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Paul |date=1988 |title=Farewell Lightning, Welcome Tornado |url= |journal=RAF Yearbook |location=Fairford |publisher=IAT Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling&quot; /&gt; The end of the [[Cold War]] however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned; under the [[Options for Change]] defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service, with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF's presence, and a reduction in the number of air defence squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |title=Defence (Options for Change) |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1990/jul/25/defence-options-for-change |house=House of Commons |date=25 July 1990 |column_start=468 |column_end=486 |speaker=Tom King |position=Secretary of State for Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just prior to the final withdrawal of the Phantom, it was recalled operationally as a result of [[Operation Granby]], the UK's participation in the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]], when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward deployed to provide air defence cover at [[RAF Akrotiri]]; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise, and were subsequently sent to the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rafakrotiri.co.uk/history.html |title=RAF Akrotiri – History |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= RAF Akrotiri Revisited|publisher= |access-date=2 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their final withdrawal from service, with a few exceptions, the bulk of the RAF's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;shrine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;survivors&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/phantom/survivors.php |title=Survivors |last1=Burke |first1=Damian |last2= |first2= |date=12 April 2012 |website=Thunder &amp; Lightnings |publisher= |access-date=2 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over its service life, 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;losses&quot; /&gt;

After the [[Falklands War]], the UK government began upgrading the defences of the [[Falkland Islands]] to guard against any further aggression from Argentina. One of the measures taken was the deployment of an interceptor squadron to the islands, with 23 Squadron forming at RAF Stanley in October 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thunder &amp; Lightnings - McDonnell-Douglas/BAC F-4K/M Phantom II - History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Damien Burke|title=McDonnell-Douglas/BAC F-4K/M Phantom II - History|url=http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/phantom/history.php|website=www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[Panavia Tornado ADV|air defence variant]] of the [[Panavia Tornado]] was still in development, meaning that the Phantom was the UK's primary air defence aircraft (supported by two remaining squadrons of Lightnings). The removal of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands left a gap in the UK's air defences and nothing immediately available to fill it, given that the Tornado was still some years from service. As a result, the UK government decided to purchase another squadron of Phantoms. Because the aircraft in RAF service were a special production batch built to UK specifications, it would not be possible to obtain identical aircraft, so 15 [[Used good|second-hand]] airframes were procured from among the best of the ex-US Navy F-4Js stored at the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center]] at [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]] in [[Arizona]] and the Naval Air Rework Facility at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://74squadron.org.uk/Photo_Modern.htm |title=The Modern Era: Hawks &amp; Phantoms|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=No 74 Squadron Association|publisher= |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davies30 /&gt; The F-4J was chosen because it was the variant from which the RAF's F-4Ks and F-4Ms were developed, and was thus the closest available to the British aircraft. The 15 that were selected were extensively refurbished and brought to a standard almost equivalent to the F-4S, which was the last variant in service with the US Navy, the only differences being the absence of [[leading-edge slats]] and a helmet gun sight.&lt;ref name=&quot;yearbook&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rawlings |first1=John |last2= |first2= |year=1985 |title=The Tigers Are Back |journal=RAF Yearbook |volume= |issue= |pages=33 |publisher=ABC |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major difference between the F-4J and the British Phantoms was the absence of the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, the former being fitted with the [[General Electric J79|GE J79-10B]]. This produced less power than the British engine, but had a faster [[afterburner]] light up, giving it better performance at high altitude, at the expense of slightly poorer acceleration at low level. The high-altitude performance was helped by the reduced drag from its smaller air intakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;yearbook&quot; /&gt; Initially delivered capable of carrying the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] and [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s (AAM), they were soon made compatible with the [[Skyflash]] and SUU-23A gun pod, bringing them into line with the rest of the RAF's Phantoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;yearbook&quot; /&gt; Despite modifications to allow them to operate with the rest of the fleet, the F-4Js retained the vast bulk of the equipment they were originally fitted with, even requiring their crews to use American [[Flight helmet|flying helmets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs&quot; /&gt;

Although the new Phantoms were assigned a British designation as the F.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/rafhistorytimeline198089.cfm |title=RAF Timeline 1980–1989 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Royal Air Force |publisher= |access-date=23 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831111613/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/rafhistorytimeline198089.cfm|archive-date=31 August 2013|quote=&quot;No 74 Squadron reforms at Wattisham with the delivery of the first of the F4J Phantoms, given the RAF designation Phantom F3&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F.3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/research/squadrons/74/|title=No 74 Squadron|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=National Cold War Exhibition |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |access-date=17 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517220346/http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/research/squadrons/74/|archive-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were generally referred to as the F-4J(UK).&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; They were assigned to [[No. 74 Squadron RAF|74 Squadron]] at RAF Wattisham, which stood up in October 1984, two months after the first flight.

In 1990, thanks to the conversion of F-4M squadrons to the Tornado, the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron, which meant that the F.3 was able to be withdrawn in January 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunset&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Archer|first1=Bob |last2= |first2= |year=1992 |title=Sunset for the Phantom |journal=RAF Yearbook |volume= |issue= |pages=14 |publisher=IAT Publishing |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a couple of exceptions, all of the RAF's F-4Js were broken up for scrap.&lt;ref name=&quot;shrine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;survivors&quot; /&gt; One of the 15 airframes was lost in a crash in 1987, killing both crew members.&lt;ref name=&quot;losses&quot; /&gt;

==Variations==

===FG.1 and FGR.2===
The Phantom FG.1 and FGR.2 as built were similar, being fitted with broadly the same engines and avionics, although there were minor differences. The FGR.2 was fitted with the Mark 202 version of the [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofan, while the FG.1 had the Mark 203; this was fundamentally the same, but the 203 had a modified control system for the [[afterburner]], allowing it to light faster and enable power to be applied quickly in the event of a [[Bolter (aviation)|bolter]] on the small decks of the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Engineering/Development_of_the_Spey.html |title=Development of the Rolls-Royce Military Spey Mk202 Engine |last1=Bourne |first1=Nigel |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Thrust SSC |publisher= |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both variants were fitted with a [[Licensed production|licence built]] version of the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] [[AN/APQ-120#AN/AWG-10|AN/AWG-10]] avionics package; the FG.1 was fitted with the AN/AWG-11, which differed primarily in having a [[radome|nose radome]] that was hinged and able to fold backwards against the aircraft's fuselage to allow for storage in the [[hangar]] of an aircraft carrier; the system was designed to be integrated with both the [[AGM-12 Bullpup]] missile and [[WE.177]] as required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtnage&quot; /&gt; The AN/AWG-12 fitted to the FGR.2 was not foldable, and featured a better ground mapping mode, to take into account the strike role for which the type was originally procured; allied to this was a Ferranti [[inertial navigation]]/attack system (removed when the type converted to the air defence role).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs&quot; /&gt; It was also configured to be able to control the SUU-23A gun pod, which the Royal Navy's FG.1s lacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtnage&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=ColdWarWeaponry&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/research/collections/mcdonnell-douglas-phantom-fg1-nose-section-only/weaponry/ |title=Weaponry |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=National Cold War Exhibition |publisher=RAF Museum |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Phantoms and other Phantoms===
[[File:F-4J F-4K CV-62 NAN6-75.jpg|thumb|An F-4K of [[892 Naval Air Squadron]] lines up alongside an F-4J of [[VF-101|VF-101 ''Grim Reapers'']] aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}} in 1975. This shows the extended nosewheel [[Oleo strut|oleo]] of the British aircraft, fitted to increase the take-off attitude for operation on the Royal Navy's carriers.]]
Although there were minor differences between the two types of Phantom built for the UK, there were many significant ones between the British Phantoms and those built for the United States. The most obvious was the substitution of the Rolls-Royce Spey [[turbofan]] for the [[General Electric J79]] [[turbojet]]. The Spey was shorter but wider than the J79, which meant that the British Phantoms' [[intake]]s had to be redesigned for a higher airflow, making them 20% larger (with a consequent increase in [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]), while the fuselage was widened by {{convert|152|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The position of the [[afterburner]] also meant that the rear of the fuselage had to be made deeper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendon&quot;&gt;{{Cite sign |title=The Phantom and the Spey |year=2003 |type=Information plaque in museum |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |location=[[Royal Air Force Museum London|RAF Museum, Hendon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auxiliary intake doors were fitted on the rear fuselage.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

Performance estimates of the Spey-engined Phantom contrary to its American equivalent indicated that the former had a 30% shorter take-off distance, 20% faster climb to altitude, higher top speed and longer range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendon&quot; /&gt; The Spey was more efficient at lower altitudes, and had better acceleration at low speed, giving British Phantoms better range and acceleration, which was shown during the deployment of 892 NAS to the Mediterranean aboard USS ''Saratoga'' in 1969, when the F-4K was repeatedly quicker [[Aircraft catapult|off the deck]] than the F-4J used by the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avf4_3.html |title=Phantom In Foreign Service |last1=Goebel |first1=Greg |last2= |first2= |date=1 February 2014 |website=The McDonnell F-4 Phantom |publisher=airvectors.net |access-date=25 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was less efficient at higher altitudes, the British Phantoms lacking speed compared to J79-powered versions owing to the increased drag of the re-designed fuselage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtnage&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendon&quot; /&gt; This discrepancy became apparent when the F-4J was obtained by the UK in 1984; it was regarded as being the best of the three variants to serve in the RAF.&lt;ref name=davies30&gt;Davies, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airsceneuk.org.uk/wattisham/partfive/partfive.htm |title=Part Five:Phantastic Phantom's Arrival |last1=Eade |first1=Dave |last2= |first2= |date= |website=The Wattisham Chronicles |publisher=Air Scene UK |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small size of the aircraft carriers ''Eagle'' and ''Ark Royal'', from which the Royal Navy's Phantoms were intended to operate, compared to the US Navy carriers of the period, meant that the F-4K version required significant structural changes compared to the F-4J, from which it was descended, and which performed a similar role. As well as the folding nose radome to allow for storage in the smaller hangars of the British ships, it had to have a significantly strengthened undercarriage to account for the higher landing weight (British policy was to bring back unused ordnance). It had a telescopic nosewheel [[Oleo strut|oleo]] that extended by {{convert|40|in|cm}} to provide an increased take-off attitude (the extension of the nosewheel put the Phantom at a 9° attitude&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burns |first=J.G. |last2=Edwards |first2=M. |date=14 January 1971 |title=Blow, Blow Thou BLC Wind |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200061.html |journal=Flight International |publisher=Flight Global |volume=99 |issue=3227 |pages=56–59 |doi= |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) due to the shorter and less powerful [[Aircraft catapult|catapults]]. It was also fitted with drooping [[aileron]]s, enlarged [[leading edge]] [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] and a slotted [[tailplane]], and increased flap and leading edge blowing, all to improve the lift and handling characteristics of operation from the much smaller carriers of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvHistory McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|url=http://www.aviation-history.com/mcdonnell/f4.html|website=www.aviation-history.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Phantom continued in service, other changes were made, most notably the [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] ARI.18228 [[Radar Warning Receiver]] (RWR) fitted  on top of the [[Vertical stabilizer|vertical stabiliser]], exclusively on British models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/research/collections/mcdonnell-douglas-phantom-fg1-nose-section-only/equipment-fit/ |title=Equipment Fit |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=National Cold War Exhibition |publisher=RAF Museum |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RWR was fitted in the mid-1970s to the FG.1 and FGR.2 Phantoms, but not to the F.3. From 1978, the Skyflash AAM, derived from the AIM-7 Sparrow, began to be delivered to RAF Phantom units, and was used concurrently with the Sparrow; all three UK Phantom variants were eventually fitted to operate the Skyflash.&lt;ref name=ColdWarWeaponry/&gt;

===Phantom locations===
The RAF operated the Phantom from a number of bases in the UK, Germany and the Falkland Islands during its operational service, while the Royal Navy initially based its Phantom units at its main air station at Yeovilton; following the disbanding of the Fleet Air Arm's dedicated training squadron, its sole operational Phantom squadron was subsequently moved to take up residence at the RAF's base at Leuchars.

===Other UK Phantom proposals===
Although the Phantom was ordered in 1966, the variants that were eventually constructed were not the first to be offered to the UK. [[McDonnell Aircraft]] had been conducting studies into the possibility of the Royal Navy using the Phantom on its carriers since 1959. The company concluded that more power was needed than the J79 turbojet could provide to operate from the smaller decks of British carriers. The company spoke to Rolls-Royce about whether the RB-168 Spey turbofan, then in development for use in the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], could be fitted to the aircraft.&lt;ref name=davies14&gt;Davies 2016, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, McDonnell approached the RAF with its model number 98CJ, which was an F4H-1 (later F-4B) with various modifications, including the installation of the Rolls-Royce Spey Mk.101 turbofan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date=1 July 1974 |title=McDonnell model numbers |url=http://aviationarchives.net/McDonnell%20Project%20Numbers%20Lists.pdf |publisher=McDonnell Douglas Aviation |page=66 |docket= |access-date=9 June 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell continued studies, proposing afterburning Spey 101 engines in 1962, while trials of an F-4B fitted with an extendable nosewheel oleo took place aboard {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}} in 1963.&lt;ref name=davies14 /&gt; In 1964 the company proposed the model 98FC, which was identical to the F-4D variant but would have been fitted with the RB.168-25R version of the Spey engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date=1 July 1974 |title=McDonnell model numbers |url=http://aviationarchives.net/McDonnell%20Project%20Numbers%20Lists.pdf |publisher=McDonnell Douglas Aviation |page=83 |docket= |access-date=9 June 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====RF-4M====
A further proposal came after the order for the F-4M was being finalized, and was a result of the UK's need for an aircraft to perform the tactical reconnaissance role. For this, McDonnell offered two options:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date=1 August 1966 |title=The Royal Air Force Phantom II |url=http://www.f4phantomeers.org.uk/McDonnell%20Report%20B617%20small2.pdf |publisher=McDonnell Aircraft |pages=44–49 |docket= |access-date=9 June 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The standard F-4M fitted with a reconnaissance pod in place of the centerline fuel tank
*A modified airframe, designated as RF-4M, with the reconnaissance equipment carried internally

Although the RF-4M would have had some advantages, it was discounted as the cost would have been greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while only those that had been modified would have been able to undertake the reconnaissance mission. Ultimately, the RAF chose the standard F-4M and external pod, which allowed all of its aircraft to perform all designated roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phantomphacts.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/phantoms-that-never-were-built-rf-4m-in.html |title=Phantoms that never were built… RF-4M  |last1=Simmelink |first1=Kim |last2= |first2= |date=20 November 2013 |website=Phantom Phacts |publisher= |access-date=9 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====F-4(HL)====
Another idea that McDonnell proposed was a variation of a carrier-based Phantom, with the goal of improving catapult performance and lowering approach speeds. The F-4(HL) would have had a longer fuselage and wingspan, with less [[swept wing|sweep]], [[stabilator]]s with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors to increase airflow at low speeds. This proposal was not taken forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f-4.nl/f4_31.html |title=McDonnell F-4(HL) Phantom II |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 December 1999 |website=Phabulous Phantoms |publisher= |access-date=10 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, the RAF issued an Air Staff Requirement for the development of a new interceptor intended to replace both the Phantom and the Lightning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling&quot;&gt;Darling 2012, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; An early proposal was McDonnell Douglas's plan for a Phantom with a [[variable-geometry wing]]. This was rejected by the RAF owing to the fact that there was little apparent improvement in performance over the existing Phantom, and that it might affect the development of the [[Panavia Tornado|&quot;Multi-Role Combat Aircraft&quot; (MRCA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f-4.nl/f4_33.html|title=McDonnell F-4(FV)S Phantom II |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 December 1999 |website=Phabulous Phantoms |publisher= |access-date=17 May 2016 |quote=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-f-4-phantom-could-have-had-swing-wings-1737201833|title=The F-4 Phantom's Manufacturer Wanted To Give It Swing-Wings |author=Rogoway, Tyler |date=18 October 2015|website=Foxtrot Alpha |publisher= |access-date=18 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another idea that the MRCA concept, which eventually evolved into the Panavia Tornado, could be used in the interceptor role, was ruled out, as both its avionics and engines were optimised for low-level [[interdiction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling&quot; /&gt; The UK's partners in the MRCA project displayed no enthusiasm for the idea of developing an air defence version of the Tornado, so the UK alone began the process, and the authorisation for what came to be known as the [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado ADV]] was issued in March 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling&quot; /&gt; The initial plan was for the Tornado to replace the remaining two squadrons of Lightnings, as well as all seven squadrons of Phantoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=R.C. |date=1978 |title=Tornado means trouble...for WARPAC! |url= |journal=RAF Yearbook |location=Leicester |publisher=Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tornado was in development, the RAF looked at interim measures to replace the Phantom, which had been in service for over a decade by 1980, and was beginning to suffer from [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=2 September 1978 |title=RAF faces the Fighter Gap |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1978/1978%20-%201787.PDF |journal=Flight International |publisher=IPC Transport Press |volume=114 |issue=3624 |pages=727 |doi= |access-date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one proposal considered was the possibility of leasing or purchasing [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagles]] to re-equip 19 and 92 Squadrons, the units stationed in Germany.&lt;ref name=fricker&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fricker|first=John |date=1980 |title=The RAF Looks Ahead |url= |journal=RAF Yearbook |location=Leicester |publisher=Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further suggestions were that up to 80 F-15s be procured, to replace the Phantom and Lightning squadrons then in service, or even cancel the Tornado entirely and purchase the F-15 with UK adaptations (specifically to be fitted with the [[AI.24 Foxhunter]] radar developed for the Tornado, and capable of carrying the Skyflash air-to-air missile).&lt;ref name=f-15&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=9 September 1978 |title=F-15s for the Royal Air Force?|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1978/1978%20-%201979.PDF |journal=Flight International |publisher=IPC Transport Press |volume=114 |issue=3625 |pages=935 |doi= |access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the F-15 option was not seriously considered, as it was felt there would not be time or cost savings over the Tornado ADV.&lt;ref name=f-15 /&gt; It was later decided that the Tornado, once it had entered service, would only re-equip three of the Phantom squadrons; two Phantom units would be retained in the UK, and two in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson|first=Paul |date=1985 |title=A Refurbished Umbrella |url= |journal=RAF Yearbook |location=Leicester |publisher=Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Tornado accounted for the two FG.1 squadrons at RAF Leuchars (43 and 111 Squadrons), plus two FGR.2 units (23 Squadron and 29 Squadron), while 56 and 74 Squadrons continued with the Phantom.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunset&quot; /&gt;

In 1963, the prototype [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]] [[STOVL]] aircraft undertook initial landings aboard ''Ark Royal'', while three years later pre-production Hawker Siddeley Kestrel (which subsequently became the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]]), conducted a series of extensive trials from {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|6}}, which proved the concept of using vertical landing aircraft aboard aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= |year=1988 |title=Harrier - 1988 Documentary |trans-title= |type=Television production |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxzpKtbNKQ0 |access-date=22 November 2016 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= |timecaption=20:56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Royal Navy at the same time, the withdrawal of the [[CATOBAR|conventional aircraft carrier]] was envisaged to see the end of fixed-wing aviation at sea. Because of this policy, 892 Naval Air Squadron used a black [[Capitalization|capital]] [[Omega|Omega (Ω)]] letter on the tailfins of their aircraft, as it was believed they would be the final fixed-wing squadron to be commissioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;camouflage&quot; /&gt; However, in the 1970s the Royal Navy was developing what was known as the [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|&quot;Through Deck Cruiser&quot;]], a 20,000 ton ship with a full-length flight deck intended to embark a squadron of large [[anti-submarine warfare]] helicopters. Almost as soon as the first ship, {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}, was ordered, another specification was added to the design: as well as the helicopters, a small squadron of [[STOVL]] aircraft would form part of the air group to act as a deterrent to long-range reconnaissance aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Harold |last2= |first2= |date=7 October 1975 |title=Up, Up and Almost Away |url=http://www.naval-review.com/issues/1970s/1976-4.pdf |journal=Naval Review |publisher= |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=291–298 |doi= |access-date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, a [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|navalised version]] of the Harrier was developed – over the life of the design process, the Sea Harrier's air defence role was augmented by responsibility for reconnaissance and maritime strike missions. In March 1980, 14 months after 892 Naval Air Squadron was decommissioned and its Phantoms turned over to the RAF, [[800 Naval Air Squadron]] was formed as the first operational Sea Harrier squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.targetlock.org.uk/seaharrier/service.html |title=Squadron Service |last1=Hastings |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=12 January 2012 |website=Target Lock |publisher= |access-date=3 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft replaced by and replacing the Phantom===
[[Sydney Camm|Sir Sydney Camm]], the Chief Designer at [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]] for many years, once said that no British aircraft could be considered a success until it was able to match the capabilities of the Phantom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbs&quot; /&gt; The Phantom's versatility was such that, in the RAF and Royal Navy, it was the direct replacement in squadron service for a total of four different aircraft types, comprising nine separate variants. In turn, when the Phantom was replaced, its major roles required three separate aircraft (see table):
