== Baillie Vass - nickname ==
Baillie Vass (a Baillie being an older version of a magistrate/JP) was actually Simon Vass of Nairn, Moray-shire. A family nickname of PM did not arise from this. KS Vass

== Inept section heading ==
A featured article, approved by numerous reviewers, does not need a 95-word section arbitrarily broken off from the main narrative. I have reverted, accordingly, '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:1.05em;&quot;&gt;[[User:Tim riley|&lt;font color=&quot;#0A0A2A&quot;&gt;Tim riley&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Tim riley|&lt;font color=&quot;#848484&quot;&gt; talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;'''  21:20, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

*Dichtung, I strongly advise you not to revert again, but to discuss ''why'' you feel such a section is needed. It is not a requirement, nor does it appear in the overwhelming majority of FA-grade articles. If you think otherwise, the process ''has'' to be open discussion to come to a [[WP:consensus]]. – [[User:SchroCat|SchroCat]] ([[User talk:SchroCat|talk]]) 22:02, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

== Removal of idiom ==
I have attempted to remove an idiom from the text without success.  The line reads: &quot;some commentators have maintained that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber dealt a fatal blow to the economic success of the Heath government.&quot;  I'm not sure how the economic success of a government can suffer a &quot;fatal blow&quot;?  Economic success can be undermined, eroded, impaired, ruined, and so forth, but how can it suffer a &quot;fatal blow&quot;?  It's not even a living thing?  [[WP:IDIOM]] states that &quot;clichés and idioms are generally to be avoided in favor of direct, literal expressions&quot;, yet my attempts to remedy this poorly worded statement have fallen through the cracks.  See them down there, between the cracks?  [[User:Magnolia677|Magnolia677]] ([[User talk:Magnolia677|talk]]) 04:10, 4 February 2016 (UTC)
:The recent change seriously watered down what the sources say. If it would soothe Magnolia's outraged feelings I  could dig out the ''ipsissima verba'' and put them in quotes. They will say that IM's death dealt a fatal blow to H's government's economic success. '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:1.05em;&quot;&gt;[[User:Tim riley|&lt;font color=&quot;#0A0A2A&quot;&gt;Tim riley&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Tim riley|&lt;font color=&quot;#848484&quot;&gt; talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;'''  08:30, 4 February 2016 (UTC)
::Please do that.  Until then I will revert the edit.  Thank you.  [[User:Magnolia677|Magnolia677]] ([[User talk:Magnolia677|talk]]) 00:17, 5 February 2016 (UTC)
:::You have no consensus to do any such thing. Until Tim returns with the quote he is seeking, the article should stay as it was before you made your first change. Why don't you do the right thing and self-revert now? Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 00:28, 5 February 2016 (UTC)
::::Why don't you read [[WP:IDIOM]] and stop defending a sloppy edit?  [[User:Magnolia677|Magnolia677]] ([[User talk:Magnolia677|talk]]) 00:42, 5 February 2016 (UTC)
:::::I see Magnolia had a brief go with &quot;undermined&quot; rather than &quot;dealt a blow&quot;. That will do just as well, I think, and will save me a trip to the British Library over such a small matter. It is true that the OED marks this usage as &quot;figurative&quot; but I can live with that if other editors can, and I don't think it breaches WP:IDIOM any more than &quot;dealt a blow&quot; does. I'll change to &quot;fatally undermined&quot;. (The misconception that &quot;fatal&quot; applies only to animate beings is contradicted by the OED: ''cf'' a Fatal Error message on one's computer.) '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:1.05em;&quot;&gt;[[User:Tim riley|&lt;font color=&quot;#0A0A2A&quot;&gt;Tim riley&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Tim riley|&lt;font color=&quot;#848484&quot;&gt; talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;'''  08:37, 5 February 2016 (UTC)
::::::Works for me Tim. Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 09:53, 5 February 2016 (UTC)

== Territorial Army service reference removed, corrected and reinstated ==
Last year I placed under the section &quot;Early years&quot; a paragraph giving his service promotions as an officer in the Ayrshire Yeomanry during the Interwar years but this appears to have been removed (by whom I could not trace). The information was sourced to his biography in the annual Kelly's Handbook (and, if I remember rightly, other contemporary sources). This would have been useful as an illustration of his physical fitness, an added interest to his cricket, and would have given context to his later medical rejection for active service in WWII. I also mentioned his service in the article on the Ayrshire Yeomanry (but this sentence is still there).[[User:Cloptonson|Cloptonson]] ([[User talk:Cloptonson|talk]]) 20:44, 31 March 2016 (UTC)
:I now realize I had the regiment wrong - it was the Lanarkshire Yeomanry (I am not Scots but am aware that and Ayrshire are counties in same region). I will reinstate the corrected reference to his TA service.  To the user who removed it, thank you for removing an error, although removal is better understood when reason is given in the Edit summary.[[User:Cloptonson|Cloptonson]] ([[User talk:Cloptonson|talk]]) 13:36, 8 April 2016 (UTC)
::I have now added the information - it was not until I edited that I discovered it had been hidden on grounds of a violation, having been cited to one book.  I have cited his promotions to the next Kelly's Handbook published following the promotion year, in place of relying on one reference book. Those with access to the London Gazette can cite them to the LG to enhance their veracity.[[User:Cloptonson|Cloptonson]] ([[User talk:Cloptonson|talk]]) 13:51, 8 April 2016 (UTC)

== Recent IB changes ==

{{u|Therequiembellishere}}, as per the note I left on your talk page, can I ask you to explain the rationale behind your changes. It may be very good and the right way to go, but the edit summary box isn't the right place for a proper explanation - particularly after so many reverts. We are all rationale beings here and open to good constructive changes to the article, so if you could perhaps explain 'what and why', it can be considered here a little better than in the heat of ongoing reversions. Thanks - [[User:SchroCat|SchroCat]] ([[User talk:SchroCat|talk]]) 08:21, 6 July 2016 (UTC)</text>
