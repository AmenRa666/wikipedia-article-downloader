The '''Wuchang Uprising''' was the Chinese uprising that served as the [[catalyst]] to the [[Xinhai Revolution]], ending the [[Qing Dynasty]] – and two millennia of imperial rule – and ushering in the [[Republic of China]] (ROC). It began with the dissatisfaction of the handling of a railway crisis.  The crisis then escalated to an uprising where the revolutionaries went up against [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] government officials.  The uprising was then assisted by the [[New Army]] in a [[Coup d'état|coup]] against their own authorities in the city of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], [[Hubei province]] on October 10, 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot;&gt;戴逸, 龔書鐸. [2002] (2003) 中國通史. 清. Intelligence press. ISBN 962-8792-89-X. p 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Battle of Yangxia]] led by [[Huang Xing]] would be the major engagement in the uprising. 

==Canton and Sichuan railway crisis==
{{main|Railway Protection Movement}}
After the [[Boxer Rebellion]], many Western countries saw China as a good location for railway building and investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;spence&quot;&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. [1990] (1990). The Search for Modern China. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. ISBN 0-393-30780-8, ISBN 978-0-393-30780-1. pg 250-256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having carved out their individual [[spheres of influence]], countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] built numerous railways over the Qing government's protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;spence&quot; /&gt;  [[Germany]] began building lines in [[Shandong]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Yangtze Valley]], [[France|French]] in [[Kunming]], [[Russians]] in [[Heilongjiang]] and the [[Japan]]ese had the [[Southern Manchuria Railway]] company.&lt;ref name=&quot;spence&quot; /&gt;

The Qing government began to allow the provincial governments to set up their own railway construction ventures.  By 1905, the [[Canton-Hankou Railway]] and the Sichuan-Hankou railway (川漢鐵路) were being locally managed in [[Guangdong]], [[Hunan]], [[Hubei]] and [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reilly&quot;&gt;Reilly, Thomas. [1997] (1997). Science and Football III, Volume 3. Taylor &amp; Francis publishing. ISBN 0-419-22160-3, ISBN 978-0-419-22160-9. pg 277-278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot;&gt;Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. ISBN 978-0-7139-9832-0. pg 107, pg 116, pg 119.&lt;/ref&gt;  The railways were meant to link those provinces with the rest of China.

In May 1911 the Qing government ordered the nationalization of railway lines, previously paid for by local private investors,&lt;ref name=&quot;reilly&quot; /&gt; in order to pay for the indemnities imposed by the [[Boxer Protocol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spence&quot; /&gt;  The announcement to nationalize the railways in order to pay back debts to the antagonistic victors of the [[Boxer Rebellion]]—mainly [[Great Britain]], Germany, France and the [[US]]—was met with much opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reilly&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot;&gt;王恆偉. (2005) (2006) 中國歷史講堂 #6 民國. 中華書局. ISBN 962-8885-29-4. pg 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Protests were held in [[Changsha]] and people in Guangdong boycotted government banknotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;reilly&quot; /&gt;  By July the Qing government compensated the investors, but the amount offered to Sichuan was much lower than all other provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;reilly&quot; /&gt; 

By August 11 there were massive strikes and rallies at [[Chengdu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reilly&quot; /&gt;  On September 7, Governor-General [[Zhao Erfeng]] arrested key leaders of the Railway Protection League, and when a crowd formed to protest this, ordered troops to fire into the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;reilly&quot; /&gt;  New Army units in Wuhan were stationed in Wuchang, [[Hankou]] and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot;&gt;Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture and Nationalism. Taylor &amp; Francis Publishing. ISBN 0-8153-0720-9, ISBN 978-0-8153-0720-4. pg 390-391.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Meanwhile, the press and radical students in both Hunan and Hubei were already harshly criticizing local elites for their relative lack of outrage in response to the railway nationalization (as compared to their counterparts in Sichuan).&lt;ref name=&quot;Esherick&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esherick|first1=Joseph W.|title=Reform and Revolution in China: The 1911 Revolution in Hunan and Hubei|date=1976|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-05734-1|pages=166-168|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this atmosphere of heated rhetoric, the public mood began to shift away from the vague belief that the Qing dynasty was going to end and towards the concrete wish that it should end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Esherick&quot; /&gt;

==The Uprising==
[[File:wuchangmilitary9star.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Wuchang military 9-star flag with the [[Taijitu]] symbol in the middle.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;]]

===Revolutionary groups and a bombing incident===
The uprising itself broke out by accident. At the time there were two local revolutionary groups in Wuhan, the Literary Society (文學社) and the Progressive Association (共進會).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot; /&gt;  The two groups worked together, led by Jiang Yiwu (蔣翊武) and Sun Wu (孫武).&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;  In September 1911 they began collaborating with the [[Tongmenghui]] (同盟會).&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;  The original uprising date was set for October 6 on [[Mid-Autumn festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;  However, some people were not ready on that date, and so it was postponed.&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;  On October 9 Sun Wu was at the [[List of foreign enclaves in China#Russian|Russian concession]] of [[Hankou]] where bombs were being built.  A bomb accidentally exploded, causing Sun Wu serious injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;  When he was sent to the hospital, the staff discovered the group were revolutionaries and alerted the [[Qing]] government.&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;

===New Army mutiny===
Facing arrest and certain execution with their identities now revealed, the revolutionaries had no choice but to stage a coup.  Qing [[Viceroy of Huguang]] Duan Zheng (瑞澂) tried to track down the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;  Jiang Yiwu of the Literary Society decided to launch an attack that night, but the plot was discovered by Qing agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;  Several members were arrested and executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;

Xiong Bingkun (熊秉坤) then decided to revolt on the evening of October 10 at 7pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;  The modernized [[New Army]] in Wuchang staged a [[mutiny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot; /&gt;  While the New Army belonged to the Qing government, many of its soldiers were ready to switch their allegiance to the then-exiled anti-Qing revolutionary leader [[Sun Yat-sen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spence&quot; /&gt;  The revolutionaries took over the government office of Duan Zheng, who managed to avoid capture by escaping through a tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;  After fierce fighting, the army captured strategic points in the city.  More revolutionaries joined the insurrectionists and the government troops were defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot; /&gt;

===Sacrificial ceremony===
Just one week after the start of the Wuchang uprising, [[Li Yuanhong]] (黎元洪) made a sacrifice to [[Tian|Heaven]], [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] and the [[Yellow Emperor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;Harrison Henrietta. [2000] (2000). The Making of the Republican Citizen: Political Ceremonies and Symbols in China, 1911-1929. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-829519-7, ISBN 978-0-19-829519-8. pg 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide earthen platform was constructed on a military parade ground near the government offices.  Five sacrificial offerings were made on an [[altar]] for [[incense]], [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|wine]] and an [[ox]], according to tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot; /&gt;  Li and the officers [[kowtow]]ed four times, while a prayer was read that told of the persecution of the Han by the Manchus and called the Yellow Emperor to assist in the establishment of the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot; /&gt;  At the end, the soldiers raised their guns and shouted ''&quot;[[Ten thousand years]]!&quot;'' three times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Chinese-Army-Wuhan-Flag-1911-1928 dots18.svg|thumb|The Iron Blood 18-star flag of the Wuchang Uprising]]

===Establishment of Hubei military government===
On October 11 the New Army established a military government in [[Hubei]] and [[Li Yuanhong]] was forced to become the new governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot; /&gt; It took some persuading to get him to &quot;accept&quot; the post, as one report said that he was hiding under a bed to avoid the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot; /&gt; 

Once the army had taken the city it went to the [[Yellow Crane Tower]] to raise the &quot;Iron Blood 18-star flag&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;  This new military government called for other provinces to support the revolution and declared the founding of the [[Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot; /&gt;  This temporary government was referred to as the &quot;Military Government of Hubei of the Republic of China&quot; (湖北軍政府).&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi86&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong6-3&quot; /&gt;  By October 12 [[Hankou]] and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] also fell into the hands of the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot; /&gt;

===Battle of Yangxia===
{{main|Battle of Yangxia}}
The Qing government responded in October by ordering commander-in-chief [[Yuan Shikai]] (袁世凱) and the [[Beiyang Army]] to suppress the uprising in Wuchang.  [[Huang Xing]] (黃興) would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke&quot; /&gt;  The revolutionaries and the loyalists fought a protracted battle in Hankou and Hanyang known as the Battle of Yangxia that would last until December 1.  Although the loyalists eventually captured both towns, [[Yuan Shikai]] halted the advance of the Beiyang Army and agreed to a ceasefire. Negotiations began on December 1.

==Aftermath==
[[File:WuchangUprising.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sun Yat-sen]]'s statue stands on the First Uprising Plaza of [[Wuhan]] in front of the office building of the Hubei Military Government, the organization of revolutionaries established one day after the uprising.]]
[[Sun Yat-sen]] himself played no direct part in the uprising in Wuchang. He was traveling in the [[United States]], trying to drum up financial support from [[overseas Chinese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergere&quot;&gt;Bergere, Marie-Claire. Lloyd Janet. [2000] (2000). Sun Yat-sen. Stanford University Press. ISBN 0-8047-4011-9, ISBN 978-0-8047-4011-1. p 207.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time he was in [[Denver]] at the foot of the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergere&quot; /&gt;  He received a telegram from [[Huang Xing]] that was one week old, but he could not decipher it because he did not have the secret key with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergere&quot; /&gt;  The next morning he read in the newspaper that the city of Wuchang was occupied by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergere&quot; /&gt;  After the Wuchang Uprising, the revolutionaries telegraphed the other provinces asking them to declare their independence, and 15 provinces in [[Southern China]] and [[Central China]] did so.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Haiming. [2005] (2005). The Transnational History of a Chinese Family: Immigrant Letters, Family Business and Reverse Migration. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. ISBN 0-8135-3597-2, ISBN 978-0-8135-3597-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from the seceding provinces met and declared the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] on January 1, 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Welland, Sasah Su-ling. [2007] (2007). A Thousand Miles of Dreams: The Journeys of Two Chinese Sisters. Rowman Littlefield Publishing. ISBN 0-7425-5314-0, ISBN 978-0-7425-5314-9. pg 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Yat-sen would return to China in December 1911 to [[Republic of China provisional presidential elections, 1911|be elected provisional president]] of the Republic of China.  He eventually agreed to cede his provisional presidency to [[Yuan Shikai]], in exchange for Yuan's help in pressuring the Last Emperor to abdicate.  On February 12, 1912, [[Puyi]], the Last Emperor, stepped down from the throne.  The Qing dynasty could no longer govern itself, as it seemed to have forfeited the [[mandate of heaven]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot; /&gt; This brought an end to the imperial era.

==Culture==
The date of the uprising, October 10, widely known as [[Double Ten Day]] ({{zh|t=雙十節}}), is celebrated as the [[National Day]] ({{zh|t=國慶日}}) of the Republic of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvbs&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvbs.com.tw/news/news_list.asp?no=yehmin20101010132707 雙十節是？ 陸民眾：「國民黨」國慶]. Tvbs.com.tw. Retrieved on 2011-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most important national holidays in [[Taiwan]].

October 10 is not the National Day of the [[People's Republic of China]], but there may also be memorial activities in [[mainland China]], usually referring to the day as the ''Anniversary for the Wuchang Uprising'' ({{zh|s=武昌起义纪念日}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;tvbs&quot; /&gt;  The equivalent celebration is usually done on October 1 on the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tvbs&quot; /&gt;
