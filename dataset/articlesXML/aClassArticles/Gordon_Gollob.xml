'''Gordon Mac Gollob''' (16 June 1912&amp;nbsp;– 7 September 1987) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' military aviator during [[World War II]], a [[fighter ace]] credited with 150 enemy aircraft shot down in over 340 combat missions. Originally from Austria, he claimed the majority of his victories over the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and six over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]],  five of which he claimed as a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighter pilot.

Gollob volunteered for military service in the Austrian [[Austrian Armed Forces]] in 1933. In March 1938, following the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the annexation of Austria into [[Nazi Germany]], Gollob was transferred to the ''Luftwaffe''. In 1939, Gollob was posted to [[Zerstörergeschwader 76|''Zerstörergeschwader'' 76]] (ZG&amp;nbsp;76—76th Destroyer Wing), a twin-engined heavy fighter wing. Following the outbreak of World War II, he claimed his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 during the [[invasion of Poland]]. Gollob claimed one victory during the [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] and two victories during the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. He then transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 3|''Jagdgeschwader'' 3]] (JG&amp;nbsp;3—3rd Fighter Wing), flying the single-engined [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Britain]] on the Channel Front, he claimed his sixth and final victory on the Western Front.

Gollob then fought in the aerial battles of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. On 27 June 1941, Gollob was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the II. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (2nd group) of JG&amp;nbsp;3. He claimed 18 aerial victories in August, and following his 42nd victory was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 18 September. He claimed 37 victories in October, including nine on 18 October and six on 22 October. On 26 October 1941, his total then at 85 aerial victories, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]]. In December 1941, Gollob was temporarily transferred to a ''Luftwaffe'' test facility at [[Rechlin]]. Following a commander-in-training assignment to the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stabsschwarm]]'' (headquarters unit) of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]] (JG&amp;nbsp;54—54th Fighter Wing) on 13 March 1942, Gollob was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG&amp;nbsp;77—77th Fighter Wing) on 16 May 1942. He claimed his 100th victory on 20 May, and on 23 June he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] following his 107th aerial victory. On 29 August, Gollob became the first fighter pilot to claim 150 enemy aircraft destroyed and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] the next day. At the time of its presentation to Gollob it was Germany's highest military decoration.{{refn|In 1942, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds was second only to the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]], which was awarded only to senior commanders for winning a major battle or campaign, in the military order of the Third Reich. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds as the highest military order was surpassed on 29 December 1944 by the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds.{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=3, 7}}|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}

Due to concerns that he would be killed in action, Gollob was prohibited from flying further combat missions. On 15 October 1942, he was appointed as [[Jagdfliegerführer 3|''Jagdfliegerführer'' 3]] on the Western Front, then on 6 September 1943 he was appointed as [[Jagdfliegerführer 5|''Jagdfliegerführer'' 5]], responsible for the tactical fighter command of northwestern France. In April 1944, he was transferred to the staff of the [[Inspector of Fighters]]. In January 1945, he succeeded ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' (Major General) [[Adolf Galland]] as Inspector of Fighters, a position he held until the end of hostilities. Following World War II, he became [[Secretary (title)|General Secretary]] of the [[Federation of Independents]], a political party in Austria. He then worked in a sales position for the [[Deutz AG]]. Gollob, married and father of three children, died on 7 September 1987.

==Early life and career==
Gollob was born on 16 June 1912 in Vienna, the capital of [[Austria-Hungary]].{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}} His father, Heinrich Gollob, worked as an academic painter. His mother, Johanna (''[[née]]'' Reininghaus), was the daughter of Zoe von Karajan, a distant relative of [[Herbert von Karajan]] and wife of Carl Reininghaus. Gollob was the first of five children. Both his parents had studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], where they mutually befriended Gordon Mallet McCouch, an American artist of Scottish descent. McCouch was his [[Godparent|godfather]] and the [[namesake]] for his first and middle names, Gordon Mac.{{sfn|Nekolar|1996|pp=4–11}}{{sfn|Fraschka|1994|p=40}} In his youth, Gollob already wanted to become an engineer and pilot. In 1930, as a student at an ''[[Realschule|Oberrealschule]]'', a [[secondary school]], he built his first [[primary glider]] in [[Tirol, Austria|Tirol]], experimenting with it at the old airfield at [[Innsbruck]]. He also completed his A- and B-license to fly [[Glider (aircraft)|glider aircraft]] and became an instructor as well as a construction and airframe inspector.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}}

[[File:Theresianische Militaerakademie DSC 6487w.jpg|thumb|right|Main building of the Theresian Military Academy|alt=A color photo of a large building, the Theresan Military Academy, as seen from the outside]]
Following four semesters of [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Graz]], Gollob joined the Austrian ''[[Austrian Armed Forces|Bundesheer]]'' (Austrian Armed Forces) in 1933 as an officer cadet in the [[artillery]]. For three years he was trained at the [[Theresian Military Academy|Maria Theresia Military Academy]] at [[Wiener Neustadt]] and was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) on 1 September 1936. He then served as an instructor in the [[Austrian Air Force|''Luftstreitkräfte'']] (Austrian Air Force) and commander of ''Schulstaffel A'' (Training Squadron A). Following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in March 1938, the forced incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany, Gollob was transferred to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (the Nazi German Air Force). There, he was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (first lieutenant) on 1 June 1938.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}}{{sfn|Feist|McGuirl|2014|p=144}} On 15 March 1939, Gollob was posted to the 3. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (3rd squadron) of [[Zerstörergeschwader 76|''Zerstörergeschwader'' 76]] (ZG&amp;nbsp;76—76th Destroyer Wing) flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] twin-engined [[heavy fighter]].{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=19}}&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)|Organization of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. ZG&amp;nbsp;76 had been stationed at the [[Poland|Polish]] border prior to the invasion. Gollob scored the first of his aerial victories over Poland on 5 September 1939, shooting down a PWS&amp;nbsp;56 ([[Podlaska Wytwórnia Samolotów]]—Podlasie Aircraft Factory) [[biplane]].{{sfn|Fraschka|1994|p=41}} He also flew a number of [[ground support]] missions, attacking an airfield and destroying a number of aircraft on the ground. On 21 September 1939, Gollob was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse''}}) for his service in Poland. Following the campaign in Poland, ZG&amp;nbsp;76 was moved to Germany to [[defense of the Reich|defend the Reich]]. The 1. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' of ZG&amp;nbsp;76 first relocated to the [[Stuttgart]] area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had declared war with Germany on 3 September 1939.{{sfn|Hinchliffe|2003|p=42}} From early October to middle December, I. ''Gruppe'' operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and [[Ruhr region|Ruhr]] regions before relocating north to [[Jever]] on 16 December 1939.{{sfn|Hinchliffe|2003|p=46}} There, on 18 December 1939, Gollob claimed his second aerial victory over a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber in what became to be known as the [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]].{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}} During the battle, he shot down and killed [[Squadron Leader]] Archibald Guthrie, of [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]].{{sfn|Holmes|2009|pp=76–77}}

===Norwegian Campaign and Battle of Britain===
On 8 April 1940, Gollob was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of 3. ''Staffel'' of ZG&amp;nbsp;76.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=19}} The unit took part in [[Operation Weserübung|Operation ''Weserübung'']], Germany's assault on Denmark and Norway in the opening operation of the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. In June 1940, I. ''Gruppe'' was based at [[Trondheim Airport, Værnes|Trondheim-Værnes]], when the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] expeditionary force composed of British, French, and [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Free Polish]], were being evacuated from [[Narvik]]. In support of the evacuation, the RAF was targeting German shipping in Norwegian waters and ''Luftwaffe'' occupied airfields along the coast. On 13 June, fifteen [[Blackburn Skua]] [[dive bomber]]s, six from [[800 Naval Air Squadron]] and nine from [[803 Naval Air Squadron]], launched from the [[Royal Navy]] [[aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|''Ark Royal'']] attempted to attack the [[battleship]] [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] in the [[Trondheimsfjord]]. The flight was intercepted by the ''Luftwaffe'' and in the resulting aerial encounter, eight Skuas were shot down, the first by Gollob.{{sfn|Weal|2012|pp=29–30}}{{sfn|Rossiter|2007|pp=124–125}} That day, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse''}}).{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}}

Gollob then received [[night fighter]] training.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=19}} At the time, he made a few recommendations for technical improvement of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] single-engined fighter. Based on these recommendations, he was transferred to the ''[[Rechlin–Lärz Airfield|Erprobungstelle Rechlin]]'', the ''Luftwaffe'' test facility at [[Rechlin]] in June 1940.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}} At 14:47 on 9 July 1940, Gollob intercepted and shot down [[Short Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] &quot;Y&quot; (''N6133'') from [[No. 201 Squadron RAF|No. 201 Squadron]]. The Sunderland, piloted by [[Flight Lieutenant]] J.D. Middleton, was on patrol off Norway and crashed {{convert|140|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us}} southwest of [[Sumburgh Head]].{{refn|According to Donnelly, the Sunderland was shot down by Böhmel.{{sfn|Donnelly|2004|p=27}}|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} That same day at 17:20, Gollob, together with ''Oberfeldwebel'' (Staff Sergeant) [[Herbert Schob]] and ''Oberleutnant'' Gerhard Böhmel, shot down a patrolling [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] &quot;J&quot; (''N7377'') from [[No. 233 Squadron RAF|No. 233 Squadron]] off [[Shetland]].{{sfn|Shores|Foreman|Ehrengardt|1992|p=352}}{{refn|According to Donnelly, the Hudson was shot down by Schob.{{sfn|Donnelly|2004|p=27}}|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}

On 7 September 1940 during the [[Battle of Britain]], Gollob was transferred to the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Gruppenstab]]'' (headquarters unit) of II. ''Gruppe'' [[Jagdgeschwader 3|''Jagdgeschwader'' 3]] (JG&amp;nbsp;3—3rd Fighter Wing) based at [[Arques, Pas-de-Calais|Arques]] in northern France. On 8 October, ''Oberleutnant'' Werner Voigt, ''Staffelkapitän'' of 4. ''Staffel'' was shot down over England and taken [[prisoner of war]]. Four days later, Gollob took command of 4. ''Staffel''.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=26, 29}} In February 1941, the entire II. ''Gruppe'' returned to Germany for a period of rest. The pilots went on a ski vacation in [[Kitzbühel]] from 9 to 28 March 1941. 4. ''Staffel'' was housed at the foot of the Ehrenbachhöhe, the highest point of the [[Hahnenkamm, Kitzbühel|Hahnenkamm]]. The ''Gruppe'' then reassembled at [[Griesheim Airport|Darmstadt-Griesheim]] where they received a complement of the new Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;F-2 fighter aircraft. On 25 April 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' began relocating back to the [[English Channel|English Channel Front]] at [[Monchy-Breton]]. The ''Gruppe'' completed relocation on 4 May and flew its first mission on  7 May 1941. That day, the RAF flew several fighter sweeps over the French coast and Gollob was credited with shooting down a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter, his sixth of the war and last on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=66–67}} On 1 June 1941, Gollob was promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (captain) and II. ''Gruppe'' began its relocation to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The ground elements moved immediately while the air elements followed on 8 June. On that day, they flew to [[Saint-Dizier]] and then to [[Böblingen]]. On the following day, they continued to [[Wrocław–Copernicus Airport|Breslau-Gandau]], now the Wrocław–Copernicus Airport in Poland, via [[Straubing]].{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=67}}

===War against the Soviet Union===
In preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa|Operation ''Barbarossa'']], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, II. ''Gruppe'' headed further east on 18 June. Following a stopover at [[Kraków]], the unit was moved to [[Hostynne]]. At the start of the campaign, JG&amp;nbsp;3 under the command of ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (Major) [[Günther Lützow]] was subordinated to the [[5th Air Corps (Germany)|V. ''Fliegerkorps'']] (5th Air Corps), under the command of ''[[General der Flieger]]'' (General of the Aviators) [[Robert Ritter von Greim]], itself part of [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' 4]] (4th Air Fleet), under the command of ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (Colonel General) [[Alexander Löhr]]. These air elements supported ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' (Field Marshal) [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]'s [[Army Group South|''Heeresgruppe Süd'']] (Army Group South), with the objective of capturing Ukraine and its capital [[Kiev]]. At 17:00 on 21 June 1941, V. ''Fliegerkorps'', based at [[Lipsko]], briefed the various unit commanders of the upcoming attack.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;All times used in this section are [[Central European Time]] unless otherwise noted.&lt;/ref&gt; That evening, ''Hauptmann'' [[Lothar Keller]], ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of II. ''Gruppe'', informed his subordinates of the attack.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=70}}

[[File:Operation Barbarossa corrected border.png|thumb|left|Map indicating Operation ''Barbarossa'''s attack plan|alt=A map of Eastern Europe depicting the movement of military units and formations.]]
The invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941. II. ''Gruppe'' flew its first missions on the Eastern Front shortly before 04:00, flying low attacks against Soviet airfields in the vicinity of [[Lvov]], now Lviv in Ukraine. At 06:30 the ''Gruppe'' fought its first aerial battles. 4. ''Staffel'' claimed three victories and the ''Gruppenstab'' four.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=70}} One of these victories was credited to Gollob, who claimed a [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighter shot down at 07:00.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=330}} On 25 June, II. ''Gruppe'' claimed 17 victories, 6 of which were credited to 4. ''Staffel''. The ''Staffel'' engaged [[Ilyushin DB-3]] bombers escorted by I-16 &quot;Ratas&quot; on a free chase mission west of [[Lutsk]]. The Soviet bombers targeted the German advance roads from [[Hrubieszów]] through [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] to Lusk. Gollob was credited with two victories over DB-3s in this encounter.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=72, 371}} On 26 June 1941, ''Gruppenkommandeur'' Keller was killed in a [[mid-air collision]]. The next day, Gollop succeeded Keller in this position and turned over command of 4. ''Staffel'' to ''Oberleutnant'' Karl Faust.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=73}} In the beginning of July 1941, the front in the vicinity of the northern sector of ''Heeresgruppe Süd'' became increasingly fluid. This necessitated the relocation of II. ''Gruppe'' to Volodymyr-Volynskyi. By this time the war of attrition had reduced the ''Gruppe'' to 50 percent of its authorized strength. One reason for this was the almost complete lack of new aircraft or of engines and other spare parts. Another factor was overwork of the ground crews and signs of exhaustion were apparent. Flying [[combat air patrol]]s over [[Berdychiv]] and [[Zhytomyr]] on 1 July, II. ''Gruppe'' claimed four victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=73–74}} On this day at 19:42, Gollob claimed his tenth aerial victory over a [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] light bomber.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=371}} The following day, the ''Gruppe'' claimed 23 aerial victories for the loss of one in combat.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=74}} The first victory of the day was claimed by Gollob who shot down a ZKB-19—a German alias for the [[Polikarpov I-17]] fighter, possibly a misidentified [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1]] or [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3]]—at 05:52 in the morning. On another mission that day, he claimed two [[Vultee V-11]] attack aircraft shot down at 11:30 and 11:43.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=371}}

The rapid advance of German ground forces required II. ''Gruppe'' to move to Lutsk on 5 July, then to [[Dubno]] that evening and to [[Myropil (urban-type settlement)|Miropol]] on 10 July. Flying missions east of Zhytomyr, Gollob claimed his 14th victory over a [[Polikarpov I-153]] at 06:30 on 13 July 1941.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=74, 372}} A victory over a DB-3 at 11:42 and a further victory over a [[Tupolev SB]]-2 bomber at 11:44, both claimed on 16 July, took his total to 16 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=372–373}} On 20 July 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' relocated from Miropol to Berdychiv.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=76}} One day later, Gollob was awarded the [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe]] ({{lang|de|''Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe''}}) for 16 aerial victories.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}} On 23 July 1941 at 16:35, Gollob claimed a [[Polikarpov R-5]] reconnaissance bomber, his 17th aerial victory.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=373}} That day, II. ''Gruppe'' received orders to turn over its remaining aircraft to I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG&amp;nbsp;53—53rd Fighter Wing). Gollob's ''Gruppe'' was re-equipped with the Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;F-4. On 28 July, the pilots were flown to [[Krosno]] on a [[Junkers Ju 52]] where they received a full complement of Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;F-4s. After a single familiarization flight, they departed to Berdychiv and on the following morning they were transferred to [[Bila Tserkva]]. During the first days in August 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' flew missions over the combat areas along the [[Dnieper]] in support of the main German attack to encircle Soviet forces near [[Uman]], approximately {{Convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Kiev. Most II. ''Gruppe'' missions were subsequently in the greater Kiev area and to the north near [[Malyn]], where Soviet forces were still holding onto the west bank of the Dnieper. Until 6 August 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' claimed five victories without loss.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=76}} Two victories claimed on 5 August took Gollob's total to 20 aerial victories. He was victorious over a I-153 at 17:46 and a I-17 at 18:22.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=373}}

On 7 August, II. ''Gruppe'' moved again, from Bila Tserkva the ''Gruppe'' moved to Signajewka, a forward airfield near [[Shpola]]. In the days to come, the ''Gruppe'' flew combat missions over the Dnieper, between [[Kaniv]] and [[Kremenchuk]] as well to the south. Flying from Signajewka for the next 10 days, II. ''Gruppe'' claimed 64 aerial victories, including 11 on 8 August, 7 on 9 August, 8 on 12 August and 27 on 17 August 1941, the ''Gruppe''{{'}}s most successful day of the entire 1941 summer campaign.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=77}} In the same timeframe, Gollob increased his number of aerial victories to 26.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=373}} II. ''Gruppe'' had to relocate again in order to keep up with the German advance. On the afternoon of 17 August parts of the air elements flew to [[Kirovohrad]]-North airfield. Their primary mission was to protect the armored spearheads in the [[Dnipropetrovsk]] area.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=77}} On 21 August 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' claimed 17 victories, five of which were by Gollob. This &quot;[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]&quot; achievement, the first of six during his combat career, took his total to 33 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=77, 374}} On 25 August, [[III Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|III. ''Armeekorps'']] (3rd Army Corps) took Dnipropetrovsk and captured the first bridgehead across the Dnieper. Until the end of August 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' primary objective was to help secure the bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=77}} In support of these battles, Gollob scored a I-17 on 22 August, a [[Polikarpov I-180]] fighter aircraft on 24 August and a [[Tupolev TB-3]] heavy bomber on 31 August 1941, taking his total to 36 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=374–375}} On 1 September 1941, the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17. ''Armee'']] (17th Army) began crossing the Dnieper in force and II. ''Gruppe'' was moved to [[Myronivka]]. Flying from Myronivka was characterized by poor weather conditions with rain and fog, as a result operations were kept to a minimum. At the time, II. ''Gruppe''{{'}}s primary objective was the defense of the Dnieper crossing.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=78}} In these defensive battles, Gollob score his 37th victory on 8 September. His opponent was classified as an I-26 fighter aircraft, later referred to as [[Yakovlev Yak-1]]. One day later, he claimed a [[Ilyushin Il-2]] [[ground-attack aircraft]].{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=375}} On 12 September weather conditions improved and flight operations increased. II. ''Gruppe'' flew missions in support of the armored spearheads as well as fighter escort missions for [[Junkers Ju 87]] dive bombers.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=78}} That day, Gollob claimed two victories, an Il-2 and a I-26, taking his total to 40 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=375}} On 13 September, the ''Gruppe'' claimed 20 victories over Soviet bombers and ground-attack aircraft, including a V-11 shot down by Gollob at 17:19. On 14 September 1941, the German airfield at Myronivka came under Soviet air attack. Following the attack, Gollob and his [[wingman]] ''Oberleutnant'' [[Walther Dahl]] managed to pursue the attackers, and both shot down one of them. This victory over an I-153 claimed at 05:47 in the morning took his total to 42 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=78, 375}} II. ''Gruppe'' was again forced to relocate, on 15 September it moved to an airfield at Kremenchuk.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=79}} On 18 September, Gollob was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes''}}) for 42 victories.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=19}} On 19 September 1941, II.

===Battle of Moscow and Crimean Campaign===
On 30 September 1941, the ''Gruppe'' was temporarily transferred from the southern sector of the Eastern Front. Their new area of operation was Sechtschinskaja, approximately {{Convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Roslavl]]. The ''Gruppe'' was then subordinated to the [[2nd Air Corps (Germany)|II. ''Fliegerkorps'']] (2nd Air Corps) under the command of ''General der Flieger'' [[Bruno Loerzer]] and was part of the preparations for [[Battle of Moscow|Operation Taifun]], the planned assault on [[Moscow]]. All available German forces were concentrated under the command of ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Fedor von Bock]]'s [[Army Group Centre|''Heeresgruppe Mitte'']] (Army Group Centre) for the attack which began on 2 October 1941. In the first days of this campaign, II. ''Gruppe'' supported the advance northeast by [[Panzergruppe 4|''Panzergruppe'' 4]] (4th Panzer Group) and the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4. ''Armee'']] (4th Army) towards [[Vyazma]] and [[Yukhnov]].{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=79}} Predominantly flying escort missions for Ju&amp;nbsp;87 dive bombers and combat air patrols over the battle zone east of Desna, Gollob claimed one enemy aircraft shot down on 4 October and two more the following day, including his 50th aerial victory over a I-61.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=80, 376}}

Gollob claimed two Pe-2s shot down on 6 October, the first at 10:15 and the second two hours later. The following day, he was victorious over two further Pe-2s and one Il-2, taking his total to 56 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=376}} On that night, the first snow fell, worsening road conditions. By 9 October German units had encircled major Soviet forces in two separate pockets at Vyazma and [[Bryansk]]. In support of German ground forces, II. ''Gruppe'' detached a ''[[Schwarm|Schwärme]]''—two pairs of two fighter aircraft—to a forward airfield at Syevsk, approximately {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Bryansk. From 9 to 11 October the air elements operated from the [[Kirov, Kaluga Oblast|Kirov]] and [[Oryol]] airfields, which had been captured by German forces on 3 October.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=80}} Operating from these airfields, Gollob claimed his 57th and 58th victories on 10 October, both aircraft were I-61s shot down at 12:40 and 12:43.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=376}} The missions on 11 October 1941 were II. ''Gruppe''{{'}}s last in support of Operation Taifun. Orders had been received to transfer the air element and a small technical ground crew detachment, which was airlifted by several Ju&amp;nbsp;52s to [[Chaplynka]]. From there, the ''Gruppe'' participated in the [[Crimean Campaign]], the conquest of the [[Crimea]]n peninsula. The transfer began on 13 October, but due to bad weather conditions, it was only completed on 16 October. At Chaplynka, the ''Gruppe'' was placed under the command of the ''Geschwaderstab'' (headquarters unit) of [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG&amp;nbsp;77—77th Fighter Wing).{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=80}}

The first missions over the battle zone in front of [[Perekop]] and over the Crimea were flown on 17 October 1941, either flying Ju&amp;nbsp;87 escort missions or combat air patrols.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=80}} On two separate missions that day, Gollob claimed two I-61s and one I-16 shot down.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=376}} On 18 October 1941, the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11. ''Armee'']] (11th Army) began its attack on the [[Isthmus of Perekop]] and Ishun. II. ''Gruppe'' flew a number of combat air patrols that day and reported 16 aerial victories for the loss of two Bf&amp;nbsp;109s damaged in combat. Gollob alone accounted for nine of these 16 claimed victories. This was the third time he had become an &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; and was the most successful day of his combat career.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=80}} During the course of three combat missions, he increased his personal score to 70. That day he filed a claim for nine I-61s shot down, two at 07:18 and 07:20, five more at 10:05, 10:07, 10:19, 10:20 and 10:29 and two more at 14:46 and 14:48.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=376}} On 19 October, Gollob again achieved &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; for the fourth time, claiming a I-61 at 08:55, three P-2s at 12:36, 12:37 and 12:42, and another I-61 at 15:35. The next day, he was credited with one further I-61, taking his total to 76 victories.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=376–377}} Two days later, on 22 October, Gollob made &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; for the fifth time and surpassed eighty victories. That day he claimed three I-16s, one Pe-2 and one I-61. One day later, he claimed three aerial victories, all I-61s, and on 24 October, he was credited with his 85th victory after he shot down a I-153.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|p=377}} Following this streak of 37 aerial victories in October 1941, he was mentioned in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'', a [[propaganda]] radio report, the first of three such mentions, on 25 October 1941. The following day, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub''}}) after reaching 85 victories. He was the 38th member of the German armed forces to be so honored. Gollob, together with ''Oberleutnant'' [[Erbo Graf von Kageneck]], received the Oak Leaves from [[Adolf Hitler]] personally at the [[Wolf's Lair]], Hitler's headquarters in [[Rastenburg]], present-day Kętrzyn in Poland, on 5 November 1941.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|pp=213, 218}}

On 31 October 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' flew its last combat missions over the northern Crimea. The ''Gruppe'' was then ordered to return to Germany, to be stationed at the [[Wiesbaden-Erbenheim]] airfield where it arrived in early November. Prior to departure, all of the remaining aircraft where handed over to III. ''Gruppe'' of JG&amp;nbsp;77. Since the start of Operation ''Barbarossa'' on 22 June 1941, II. ''Gruppe'' had claimed 504 aerial victories for the loss of ten pilots [[killed in action|killed]] or [[missing in action]], and a further nine pilots who had been injured. In addition, 27 aircraft were lost or damaged beyond repair, a further 21 aircraft received heavy damaged and another 27 were lightly damaged.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=81–82}} On 20 November 1941, Gollob was again posted to the test facility ''Erprobungstelle Rechlin''. Gollob was replaced by ''Hauptmann'' [[Karl-Heinz Krahl]] as commander of II. ''Gruppe'' of JG&amp;nbsp;3.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|2003|pp=102, 328}} At Rechlin, he flew numerous test and comparison flights with the latest version of the Bf&amp;nbsp;109 and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] fighter aircraft, as well as a variety of types which never went beyond a [[prototype]] variant.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}}

===Wing Commander===
In early 1942, the ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' (General of Fighters), ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) [[Adolf Galland]] recommended Gollob for the ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) position of JG&amp;nbsp;77. Subsequently, Gollob was sent to the ''Geschwaderstab'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]] (JG&amp;nbsp;54—54th Fighter Wing) as a commander-in-training under ''Major'' [[Hannes Trautloft]]. On 1 May 1942, Gollob was officially appointed ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of JG&amp;nbsp;77, replacing ''Major'' [[Gotthard Handrick]]. He took operational command of the ''Geschwader'' after he arrived on 16 May 1942.{{sfn|Bergström|Mikhailov|2001|p=159}}{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=982}} On the same day of his arrival, Gollob flew his first combat mission as ''Geschwaderkommodore''. That day, he claimed his aerial victories 87 to 89, shooting down three [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3]] fighter aircraft.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1010}} Gollob's success continued the following day, when he was credited with three R-5s and one LaGG-3 destroyed.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1014}}

[[File:Geschwaderwappen Jagdgeschwader 77.png|thumb|left|upright|''Herzas'' (Ace of Hearts) emblem of JG 77|alt=red heart in black square]]
JG&amp;nbsp;77 had been given the task of supporting the German ground forces in the Crimean Campaign over the [[Kerch Strait]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. An anonymous JG&amp;nbsp;77 pilot described Gollob's methods; &quot;Gollob flew from Kerch together with his wingman. They positioned themselves at a low altitude beneath a Soviet formation. Then they started climbing in spirals, carefully maintaining their position beneath the enemy formation. Before the peacefully flying Soviets had even suspected any mischief, the two planes at the bottom of their formation had been shot down and the two Germans were gone.&quot; On 18 May 1942, Gollob claimed his 94th to 96th aerial victories over [[Kerch]] and the [[Caucasus]] coast; all three were Polikarpov R-5 reconnaissance bombers.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1018}} JG&amp;nbsp;77, led by Gollob, and its I. ''Gruppe'', led by ''Hauptmann'' [[Heinrich Bär]], were engaged in an intense rivalry, each striving to outperform the other, and both eager to achieve the century mark first.{{sfn|Bergström|Mikhailov|2001|p=159}} Bär claimed his 100th aerial victory on 19 May. That day, Gollob claimed three more R-5 shot down, taking his total to 99 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1021}} One day later, on 20 May 1942, Gollob shot down two aircraft, a DB-3 and a LaGG-3, and thereby exceeded 100 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1023}} He was the 10th ''Luftwaffe'' pilot to achieve the century mark.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=243}} This achievement earned him his second mention in the ''Wehrmachtbericht'' radio report on Saturday 20 June 1942.{{sfn|Die Wehrmachtberichte 1939–1945 Volume 2|p=168}}

On 7 June 1942, German and Romanian forces began [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Operation ''Störfang'']] (Sturgeon Catch), the second assault on the port city [[Sevastopol]], which resulted in its capture on 4 July 1942.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1046}} On the first day of this operation, Gollob claimed his 102nd victory, a LaGG-3 shot down over Sevastopol.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1048}} The attack on Sevastopol was still making slow progress on 9 June, largely due to the artillery deployed within the fortress. Over the battle zone, Gollob claimed a I-153 shot down that day.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1054}} Gollob did not claim any further victories until 18 June. The fighting over Sevastopol was still ongoing and Gollob claimed an Il-2 and a LaGG-3 over the southern sector of Sevastopol. These two victories took his total to 105.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1067}} On 21 June 1942, Gollob was credited with two victories over LaGG-3 fighter aircraft.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1072}} For this achievement, on 23 June, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''}}), after his score had increased to 107 aerial victories. This was the 13th presentation of this award. On 1 July 1942, he was promoted to ''Major''.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=38}}

On 22 July 1942, the ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG&amp;nbsp;52—52nd Fighter Wing), ''Major'' [[Herbert Ihlefeld]], was severely injured in a flight accident and had to surrender command during his convalescence. At the time, all three Gruppen of JG&amp;nbsp;77 were lent out to other units, and Gollob had time to spare, so temporarily took over command of JG&amp;nbsp;52 as acting ''Geschwaderkommodore''. On this or one of the following days, he departed and flew to the ''Geschwaderstab'' of JG&amp;nbsp;52.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1099}} On 28 June 1942, the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' had initiated [[Case Blue|''Fall Blau'']] (Case Blue), the 1942 strategic summer offensive in southern Russia. The objective was to secure the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|oil fields]] of [[Baku]] as well as an advance in the direction of [[Stalingrad]] along the [[Volga River]], to cover the flanks of the advance towards Baku. Tasked with aerial support of this offensive was ''Luftflotte'' 4 to which JG&amp;nbsp;52 was subordinated.{{sfn|Weal|2004|pp=77–78}} By the time Gollob joined the ''Geschwader'' in late July 1942, the offensive had been renamed [[Operation Braunschweig|Operation ''Braunschweig'']] and JG&amp;nbsp;52 was located at [[Rostov-on-Don]].{{sfn|Weal|2004|p=81}} Gollob claimed his first victory with the ''Stab'' of JG&amp;nbsp;52 on 26 July 1942, a I-16 and his 108th in total. The next day, he shot down two I-153 biplane fighters. He claimed the first aerial victory of August 1942, his last month of combat operations, on 4 August over a Yakovlev Yak-1 fighter aircraft. He was then credited with four victories on 6 August, two Il-2, one Yak-1 and one R-5 took his score to 115 aerial victories. He claimed one Yak-1 on each of the next two days. On 14 August, he was credited with two LaGG-3 and one [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]], referred to as a Boston. For the last time in his combat career, Gollob achieved &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; for the sixth time on 16 August 1941. That day he claimed two LaGG-3, two I-16 and one Il-2. His success as a fighter pilot continued, as he shot down two LaGG-3 on 17 August, three I-16 on 18 August, and two Il-2 and a I-153 on 19 August, taking his overall total to 133 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|1995|p=2419}}

Following three victories on 20 August, two I-153 and a I-16, Gollob shot down two Bostons on 22 August. On 24 August 1941, he took his total to 142 aerial victories by claiming three LaGG-3 and one Boston. Over the course of the next four days, he scored one victory on each day, a Boston on 25 August, a Pe-2 on 26 August, a I-16 on 27 August, and another Boston on 28 August. After three victories over LaGG-3s and one Pe-2 on 29 August 1942, he reached 150 aerial victories and became the ''Luftwaffe'''s highest scoring pilot at that point.{{sfn|Prien|1995|p=2420}} For this he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten''}}) on 30 August. Gollob was the third member of the ''Wehrmacht'' and the third fighter pilot who had received this award. Fearing he would be lost in combat, Hitler imposed a flying ban on him.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=40}} The next day, he was again mentioned in the ''Wehrmachtbericht'' radio report, his third and last of such mentions.{{sfn|Die Wehrmachtberichte 1939–1945 Volume 2|p=268}} ''[[Der Adler]]'', a biweekly [[Nazi propaganda]] magazine published by the ''Luftwaffe'', also reported his actions in volume 19 of 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=[[Scribd]] |title=Der Adler / Zeitschrift der Deutschen Luftwaffe... |trans_title=The Eagle / Magazines of the German Luftwaffe … |url=https://de.scribd.com/collections/4501154/Der-Adler-Zeitschrift-der-Deutschen-Luftwaffe-1939-1944 |language=German |accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 September 1942, Gollob was officially replaced in command of JG&amp;nbsp;77 by ''Hauptmann'' [[Joachim Müncheberg]]. Gollob was then posted to the ''Stab'' of [[Jagdfliegerführer 3|''Jagdfliegerführer'' 3]] (Jafü&amp;nbsp;3—3rd Fighter Pilot Leader) at [[Brest Bretagne Airport|Brest-Guipavas]] on the English Channel Front.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=1216}}

===High command===
On 15 October 1942, Gollob was made ''Jagdfliegerführer'' 3, responsible for tactical fighter command over northwestern [[France]]. ''Jagdfliegerführer'' 3 was renamed [[Jagdfliegerführer 5|''Jagdfliegerführer'' 5]] (Jafü&amp;nbsp;5—5th Fighter Pilot Leader) on 6 September 1943. In this command position, he was promoted to ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (lieutenant colonel) on 20 April 1943, effective as of 1 April, and to ''Oberst'' on 1 May 1944.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=215}} When he became Jafü&amp;nbsp;5 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the [[5th Fighter Division (Germany)|5. ''Jagd-Division'']] (5th Fighter Division) about the suitability of the Bf&amp;nbsp;109 on the Western Front. He indicated that in its present state the Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;G-3 to G-6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw&amp;nbsp;190 and Bf&amp;nbsp;109 were inferior to enemy aircraft.{{sfn|Fraschka|2002|p=44}} Learning about the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] [[Jet aircraft|jet-powered]] aircraft, Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft. Hitler had become interested in the idea of using the Me&amp;nbsp;262 in a fighter-bomber role, which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for operational readiness as an interceptor.{{sfn|Fraschka|2002|p=45}}&lt;!--a delay of about three weeks--&gt;

{{Quote_box
|quote=&quot;I appointed him to my staff and entrusted him with full responsibilities for the preparation and planning for operational employment of the Me 262 and Me 163. Gollob did not tackle the task to my satisfaction. He was interested only in the purely technical aspects, neglecting ground organization, the training of air- and groundcrews, setting up a communications network and the information of operational units. This caused considerable friction between Gollob, myself and my staff.&quot;{{sfn|Forsyth|2008|p=14}}

In April 1944, Gollob was transferred to the personal staff of ''General der Jagdflieger'' Galland, to advise on the development of the Me&amp;nbsp;262 jet and [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] rocket aircraft projects. Gollob quarrelled with Galland in September and was transferred to ''Kommando der Erprobungstellen'' (headquarters of test units), which two years previously had been put under the command of ''Oberst'' [[Edgar Petersen]].{{sfn|Griehl|Dressel|1998||pp=52, 244}} Gollob was also involved in the development and testing of the [[Neptun (radar)|Neptun &quot;J&quot;]] airborne [[radar]] and [[air-to-air rocket]]s, such as the [[R4M]]. In November 1944, Gollob was appointed commander of the ''Jäger-Sonderstab''—or special fighter command—for the [[Ardennes offensive]] and the ill-fated [[Operation Bodenplatte]].{{sfn|Fraschka|2002|pp=46–48}}

[[Reichsführer-SS|''Reichsführer''-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] had suggested to Hitler that he appoint Gollob as ''General der Jagerflieger''. Himmler's intervention in ''Luftwaffe'' affairs had been an irritation to ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' (Marshal of the Reich) [[Hermann Göring]], the Commander-in-Chief of the ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' (Air Force High Command). Himmler had ambitions to expand his influence and power base into the ''Luftwaffe''. One aspect of this was to put jet fighter units under control of the [[SS]] and later, Göring ordered Galland to prepare a report on Gollob.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1999|p=165}} Galland's conclusion was that Gollob required close supervision in a responsible post. In early January 1945, Göring summoned Gollob to [[Karinhall]], Göring's estate northeast of Berlin, and read out selected excerpts from Galland's report to him and Gollob became infuriated with Galland. Göring then ordered Galland to Karinhall and informed him of his dismissal. During the meeting, Göring postponed his decision as to what position Galland would receive and sent Galland on vacation. News of Galland's dismissal soon spread, leading to the failed [[Fighter Pilots' Revolt]], an insurrection of a small group of high-ranking ''Luftwaffe'' pilots, including ''Oberst'' [[Johannes Steinhoff]] who after the war became [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]], aimed at re-instating Galland as ''General der Jagerflieger''.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1999|pp=166–167}} On 31 January 1945, Gollob was officially appointed  as ''General der Jagerflieger''.{{sfn|Stockert|2010|p=41}}

In his new role, Gollob worked with ''General der Flieger'' [[Josef Kammhuber]], responsible for fighting against the enemy [[heavy bomber|four-engined bombers]], and SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Hans Kammler]], responsible for air armament and manufacturing of the Me&amp;nbsp;262. Gollob's objective was to deploy and arm the Me&amp;nbsp;262 as a defensive weapon against the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied air offensive]]. Hitler's decision to use the Me&amp;nbsp;262 in a fighter bomber role had not been revised. Gollob gathered data and hoped to meet Hitler in order to convince him that the Me&amp;nbsp;262 was better suited as a fighter aircraft and not as a fighter bomber, but this meeting never occurred. On 7 April 1945, frustrated over the lack of progress made, Gollob submitted his written request to be released from office as ''General der Jagerflieger'', but the request was not approved by Göring.{{sfn|Fraschka|2002|pp=49–50}} Gollob left Berlin on 10 April 1945 after his staff had left for southern Germany. At that time he needed urgent hospitalization to treat his [[appendicitis]]. Gollob underwent surgery by Prof. Dr. [[:de:Burghard Breitner|Burghard Breitner]] at a hospital in Igls, in the present-day a borough of Innsbruck, eight days after his departure from Berlin. On 24 April, he was transferred to the ''Luftwaffe'' hospital at Kitzbühel, which was in the middle of the so called [[Alpine Fortress|''Alpenfestung'']] (Alpine Fortress).{{sfn|Fraschka|2002|p=50}} At Kitzbühel, he met with the last [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the ''Luftwaffe'', ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Greim and the female pilot [[Hanna Reitsch]]. Greim was convalescing from an injury sustained during a flight by Reitsch into the encircled city of Berlin on 26 April. At Kitzbühel, Gollob was taken prisoner of war by elements of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] under the command of General [[John E. Dahlquist]]. Shortly after, he was transferred into the custody of the US [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] commanded by [[Major General]] [[Harry J. Collins]].{{sfn|Fraschka|2002|p=51}}

==Prisoner of war and later life==
On 1 June 1945, Gollob, who had been released on [[parole]], was arrested at his home by the Austrian [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|''Gendarmerie'']] acting for the US authorities. From Kitzbühel, he was taken via Pass Strub, and other internment camps, to [[Ludwigsburg]] in [[Württemberg]], and then flown to England.{{sfn|Fraschka|1994|p=52}} In England, he was held at [[Latimer, Buckinghamshire|Latimer]] and interrogated at the [[Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre]] regarding combat operations.{{sfn|Isby|1998|pp=109–110}} He was released by US forces in 1946 and was then imprisoned by the French, as his home region of [[North Tyrol]] had become part of the [[Allied-occupied Austria|French Occupation Zone]].{{sfn|Fraschka|1994|p=52}} After finally being released from captivity, Gollob made a living as a contributor to aircraft magazines and lecturing.{{sfn|Fraschka|1994|p=53}} In 1948, he became [[Secretary (title)|General Secretary]] of the [[Federation of Independents]] (VDU—''Verband der Unabhängigen''), an Austrian political party. In 1950, the VDU dismissed Gollob from the party following the internal strife between the more liberal approach of the founders Herbert Kraus and Viktor Reimann and the [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalist]] [[Political faction|faction]] centered on Gollob.{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 36/1950}}

{{Quote_box
|quote=&quot;Well, I will say this, then I will say nothing else about Gollob. Losses soared under his leadership everywhere he went, much like Göring in the first war. He placed leaders in command of units not because of their competence, but due to their loyalty to the Nazi Party, which were very few in the ''Jagdwaffe''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |website=The 446th Bomb Group |last=Heaton |first=Colin D. |title=Interview: Luftwaffe Eagle Johannes Steinhoff |url=http://www.446bg.com/newsletters/Sept%202011.pdf |p=12 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gollob and his wife Elisabeth Lüning, had married on 14 February 1943, and had two sons and a daughter. Their first son, Ulrik, was born on 30 November 1943 in Kitzbühel, their second son, Gerald was born on 9 January 1946, also in Kitzbühel, and their daughter Cornelia was born on 16 March 1954 in [[Sulingen]]. Following his dismissal from the VDU, the family had moved to his wife's hometown of Sulingen. There, from November 1951, he started working in a sales role for the [[Deutz AG|Klöckner Humboldt Deutz AG]], a company making motors and vehicles. Until a [[myocardial infarction]] impeded his health in 1975, he  regularly flew powered and glider aircraft. Gollob died in Sulingen, [[Diepholz (district)|Diepholz]], [[Lower Saxony]] on 7 September 1987.{{sfn|Fraschka|1994|p=53}}{{sfn|Nekolar|1996|pp=11–13}}

==Aerial victory credits==
Gollob was credited with 150 aerial victories claimed in 340 combat missions, 144 of which were on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=229}} He never lost a wingman in combat, nor was he shot down.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=215}}

{{legend2|#e3d9ff|This and the ♠ ([[Ace of spades]]) indicates those aerial victories which made Gollob an &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot;, a term which designates a fighter pilot who has shot down five or more airplanes in a single day. |border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}
