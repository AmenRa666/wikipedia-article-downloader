The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T1''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''76 T''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. She was part of the escort force for the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] [[SMS Szent István|SMS ''Szent István'']] during the action that resulted in the sinking of that ship by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] torpedo boats in June 1918. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat later that year, ''76 T'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T1''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile. She was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after [[World War II]], and after a refit which included replacement of her armament, she served as ''Golešnica'' until 1959.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The T-group designation signified the builder, STT.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] T-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|262|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|320|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by a [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] steam turbine driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. They carried {{convert|18|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|24|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|980|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The T-group had one [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] rather than the two funnels of the later groups of the class. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class, T-group were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were originally to be armed with three [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}}L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and three {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed, in order to standardise the armament with the following F-group. They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

Eight T-group boats were completed between February and December 1914, designated ''74 T''&amp;nbsp;– ''81 T''. ''76&amp;nbsp;T'', the third of its class to be completed, was laid down on 24 June 1913, launched on 15 December 1913 and completed on 20 July 1914.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1914, one {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]] was added.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

==Career==

===World War I===
At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''76 T'' was part of the 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=11–12}} During World War I, ''76 T'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''76 T'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for &quot;high seas&quot; operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

By 1918, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, [[scout cruiser]]s, and [[destroyer]]s.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}}

During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of [[Pula|Pola]] in the upper Adriatic with {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen||2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the harbour defence barrage opened, {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''76 T'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]]. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit although Rizzo had to discourage ''76 T'' by dropping [[depth charge]]s in her wake. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her boiler rooms, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}}

===Interwar period===
''76 T'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class T-group boats, ''77 T,'' ''78 T'' and ''79 T'', and four 250t-class F-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''76 T'' was renamed ''T1''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] {{ship|Yugoslav submarine tender|Hvar||2}} and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T1'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T1'' was assigned to the Southern Sector of the KJRM's Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with her [[sister ship]] [[Yugoslav torpedo boat T3|''T3'']] and a number of [[minesweeper]]s and other craft.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013}} ''T1'' was captured by the Italian Navy shortly after the commencement of hostilities and was operated by them under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were also replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned by them to the KJRM-in-exile in December 1943.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|One source states that she was captured by the Germans and transferred to the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia|navy]] of the puppet state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} but several other sources state that she was returned to the KJRM in December 1943.{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}{{sfn|Whitley|1988|p=186}}}} She was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|Jugoslavenska Ratna Mornarica|links=no}}, Југословенска Pатна Mорнарица) after the war, serving as ''Golešnica''. Her post-war fit-out included replacing her guns with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and four {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, and removing her torpedo tubes. She continued in Yugoslav service until October 1959, when she was stricken.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}
