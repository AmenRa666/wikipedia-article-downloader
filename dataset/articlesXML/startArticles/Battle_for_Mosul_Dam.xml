The '''Battle for Mosul Dam''' was a battle between the militants of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]] forces supported by [[Iraqi Armed Forces|Iraqi]] troops and U.S.-led Coalition airstrikes.

==Background==
[[Mosul Dam]] was captured by ISIL militants on August 7, 2014, after Kurdish forces retreated from the area, following a series of battles in the region. Some American officials described the fall of the dam as a grave concern, because it could release a {{convert|20|m|ft}} wave of water if it was destroyed, threatening towns and cities downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://online.wsj.com/articles/mosul-dams-takeover-by-isis-raises-risk-of-flooding-1407799954|title = Mosul Dam's Takeover by ISIS Raises Risk of Flooding|last = |first = |date = August 11, 2014|work = Wall Street Journal|accessdate = August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these recent developments, Kurdish forces, Iraqi forces, and the US Air Force launched a counter-offensive to retake the dam.

Also of ongoing grave concern was/is the fact that Mosul Dam (Formerly Saddam Dam) was constructed on evaporite rocks of the Miocene Fars (Fatha) Formation, which are water-soluble. As a result, the reservoir behind the dam was not filled to capacity.  A continued program of pumping concrete grout into potential leaks meant that a long term interruption of remedial works could end in disaster.

==Events==
On August 16, the US Air Force launched air strikes on ISIL positions near the dam, destroying some of their equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/16/us-iraq-security-usa-strikes-idUSKBN0GG0KQ20140816|title = U.S. says conducts air strikes in Iraq near Arbil and Mosul dam|last = |first = |date = August 16, 2014|work = Reuters|accessdate = August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurdish forces also launched attacks against ISIL on the same day, shelling their positions near it, and opening up the possibility for a ground attack. A Kurdish commander, Major General Abdelrahman Korini, told AFP that the Peshmerga had captured the eastern side of the dam and were &quot;still advancing&quot;. [[Rudaw Media Network|Rudaw]], a Kurdish news organization, said the air strikes appeared to be the &quot;heaviest US bombing of militant positions since the start of air strikes&quot; against ISIL last week. At least 11 ISIL fighters were killed by the air strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28820509|title = Iraq crisis: US strikes aid Kurdish bid to retake dam|last = |first = |date = August 16, 2014|work = BBC|accessdate = August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, the fighting continued. Kurdish officials told that peshmerga forces captured three towns near the dam: Tel Skuf, Sharafiya and Batnaya. The U.S.-led coalition had until that day conducted nine airstrikes and destroyed or damaged four armoured personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two Humvees and an armoured vehicle. ISIL militants tried to slow down Kurdish forces by explosive devices, including homemade bombs and landmines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/iraqi-kurds-battle-islamic-state-fighters-20148177020281481.html|title = Iraqi Kurds battle Islamic State fighters|last = |first = |date = August 17, 2014|work = Al Jazeera|accessdate = August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, Iraqi and Kurdish forces said that they had taken full control of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28842515|title = Iraq crisis: The battle for Mosul dam|last = |first = |date = August 18, 2014|work = BBC|accessdate = August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; US President [[Barack Obama]] also confirmed that the Mosul Dam was under complete Kurdish and Iraqi control. He also said that the move to recapture the Mosul Dam was a &quot;major step forward&quot; in the long-term strategy to defeat the militants. Journalists in the area reported that the fighting did not completely end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28833519|title = Iraq crisis: Mosul dam recaptured from militants - Obama|last = |first = |date = August 18, 2014|work = BBC|accessdate = August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, the battle ended completely with a Kurdish-Iraqi victory. BBC reporter Jim Muir who has visited the dam, said it was &quot;back in safe hands&quot; and appeared intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28858601|title = Iraq crisis: Mosul dam retaken from IS|last = |first = |date = August 19, 2014|work = BBC|accessdate = August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
