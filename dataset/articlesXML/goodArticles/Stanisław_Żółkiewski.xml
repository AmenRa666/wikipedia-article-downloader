'''Stanisław Żółkiewski''' ({{IPA-pl|staˈɲiswaf ʐuwˈkʲɛfskʲi}}; 1547–1620) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[szlachta|nobleman]] of the [[Lubicz coat of arms]], [[magnate]] and military commander of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], who took part in many campaigns of the Commonwealth and on its southern and eastern borders. He occupied a number of high-ranking posts in the administration of the Commonwealth, including [[castellan]] of [[L'viv]] (from 1590), [[Voivode|voivod]] of the [[Kiev Voivodeship]] and [[Great Chancellor of the Crown]] (from 1618). From 1588 he was also a Field Crown [[Hetman]], and in 1613 was promoted to Grand Hetman of the Crown. During his military career he won major battles against [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], [[Muscovy]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Tatars]].

Żółkiewski's best-known victory was against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the [[battle of Klushino]] in 1610, in the aftermath of which the Poles seized and occupied Moscow. He died in the 1620 [[Battle of Cecora (1620)|battle of Cecora]] against the Ottomans, after allegedly refusing to retreat. Already renowned as a military leader, Żółkiewski's heroic death further boosted his fame. He is seen as one of the most accomplished military commanders in the history of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

==Biography==

===Youth===
[[File:Stanislaw Zolkiewski.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Stanisław Żółkiewski and [[Baltazar Batory]] at [[Siege of Pskov|Pskov]], detail from a painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]
Stanisław Żółkiewski was born in the village of [[Turynka]] in 1547 to [[Stanisław Żółkiewski (voivode)|Stanisław Żółkiewski]] of the [[Lubicz coat of arms]], [[voivode of Ruthenia]], and Zofia Lipska.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bielowski1861-25&quot;/&gt; The exact date of his birth is unknown, and even the year is disputed: most sources agree on 1547, although a few suggest 1550.&lt;ref name=&quot;Żółkiewski1966&quot;/&gt;

Żółkiewski attended a cathedral school in Lwów (now [[L'viv]], Ukraine).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt; Unlike many of his peers he had no higher education and did not travel abroad. However, he pursued studies on his own and was particularly interested in history and historical literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt; In 1566 he joined the court of King [[Sigismund II Augustus]], as an aid to the king's secretary [[Jan Zamoyski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt; There he became familiar with the [[executionist movement]], which advocated numerous reforms including military ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt; In 1573 he took part in the [[diplomatic mission]] to France, sent to meet a newly elected king [[Henry III of France]], and on his way back he was sent to [[Vienna]] to appease the [[Habsburgs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt;

===Early career===
Żółkiewski gained his first military experience under King [[Stefan Batory]] during the [[Danzig rebellion]] in which he commanded a [[rota (formation)|rota]] of [[Polish hussars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt; He subsequently participated in Batory's [[Livonian campaign of Stefan Batory|Livonian campaign]], fighting at [[Polotsk]], [[Rossony]] (Sokół), [[Velizh]] and at the [[Siege of Pskov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt; Żółkiewski maintained his political alliance with the Zamoyski family after those campaigns ended, particularly in their conflict with the [[Zborowski family|Zborowscy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt; On the night of 11 to 12 May 1584 he captured [[Samuel Zborowski]], whose subsequent execution caused much controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-131&quot;/&gt; Żółkiewski became notorious for his role in the incident, and was the subject of heated debates during the [[Sejm]] of 1585.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-131&quot;/&gt;

In 1588, during the [[War of the Polish Succession (1587–1588)|War of the Polish Succession]] between factions of [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria|Maximilian III]], Żółkiewski supported Sigismund. Żółkiewski commanded the right flank of Commonwealth forces in the [[battle of Byczyna]], during which he received a knee wound that lamed him for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-131&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krasiński1846&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Krasiński|title=Mary Barton: an historical tale of Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-p4DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA263|accessdate=13 May 2011|year=1846|publisher=A.K. Newman and Co.|pages=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in the battle he was appointed a [[Field Crown Hetman]], and became the [[starost]] of [[Hrubieszów]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-131&quot;/&gt;

===As Field Crown Hetman===

Soon after becoming a Hetman, Żółkiewski was sent to [[Ukraine]] to repel a [[Tatar]] invasion. In 1590 he became the [[castellan]] of Lwów, but his requests for military reinforcements against the Tatars went unheeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-131&quot;/&gt;

In 1595 Żółkiewski participated in the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars|Moldavian campaign]] and the [[battle of Cecora (1595)|battle of Cecora]] near the [[Prut river]]. The following year he defeated the [[Cossack]] uprising of [[Severyn Nalivaiko]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-131&quot;/&gt; Żółkiewski was a known supporter of [[Cossack]] grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them. When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in [[Warsaw]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-131&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-132&quot;/&gt; and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, which led to a deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations. In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious [[battle of Bukowo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-132&quot;/&gt;

In 1601 Żółkiewski operated in the north, in [[Livonia]] (Inflanty), during the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611)|Polish–Swedish War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-132&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-133&quot;/&gt; He also took part in the successful [[siege of Wolmar]], and in 1602 the [[Siege of Fellin|taking of Fellin]]. That same year he led Polish forces at the [[Battle of Reval (1602)|battle of Reval]], which led to a Swedish capitulation at the [[Siege of Weissenstein|siege of Biały Kamień]]. Żólkiewski became ill near the end of the campaign and had to relinquish command of his forces to Hetman [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-133&quot;/&gt;

In 1606 Żółkiewski returned to Ukraine, where he defeated the Tatars at the [[battle of Udycz]]. Later that year he decided to support the king during the [[Zebrzydowski's Rebellion]]. His decision was not an obvious one, as his mentor Zamoyski opposed the king. Additionally, Żółkiewski was related to the [[Zebrzydowski family]] and was sympathetic to some of the rebels' arguments. In the [[battle of Guzów]] he commanded the left flank of the royal forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-134&quot;/&gt; but his troops took relatively little part in the battle. Unimpressed with Żółkiewski's performance, the king did not give him not the [[Grand Crown Hetman]]ship that he coveted, although he was appointed to the office of the [[voivode of Kiev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-134&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-135&quot;/&gt;

In the second half of 1609 Żółkiewski took part in the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)|Polish–Muscovite War]] (also known as the Dymitriads).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-135&quot;/&gt;  He supported the election of [[Władysław IV Vasa]] for the [[tsar of Russia]] and the idea of a [[personal union]] between the Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia (the [[Polish-Muscovite union]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-135&quot;/&gt; During the [[De la Gardie Campaign]] in 1610 he achieved another significant victory against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the [[battle of Klushino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-135&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-136&quot;/&gt; As a result of his successful campaign Żółkiewski seized Moscow and captured the [[tsar]] [[Vasiliy Shuyskiy]] and his brothers, [[Ivan Shuyskiy]] and [[Dmitri Shuyskiy]]. Zygmunt rejected Żółkiewski's political plan however, which would have required Władysław to convert to [[Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-136&quot;/&gt;

Żółkiewski began to write his memoirs after his return from Muscovy. The ''Początek i progres wojny moskiewskiej'' (''The beginning and Progress of the Muscovy War''), published in 1612, is a critique of Zygmunt's policies. In 1612 he became a teacher and tutor of [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]], future hetman and military commander. Also that year he returned to Ukraine to defend against continuing Tatar and Moldovan incursions, as well as Cossack unrest. In 1616 during a Sejm he presented a project ''O chowaniu żołnierza kwarcianego'' (''On the raising of the [[wojsko kwarciane|kwarciane soldiers]]''), in which he argued for the need to raise a larger army to deal with the Tatars and the Cossacks. The project was however not approved by the parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-137&quot;/&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:Cecora 1620 111.JPG|230px|right|thumb|Death of Stanisław Żółkiewski with his confessor, [[Father Szymon Wybierski]], Battle of Cecora (1620), painting by [[Walery Eljasz Radzikowski]]]]
Żółkiewski's popularity waned in the latter years of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-137&quot;/&gt; He was accused of not supporting [[Samuel Korecki]] during the [[Battle of Sasowy Róg (1616)|battle of Sasowy Róg]] in 1616, of signing the [[Treaty of Jaruga]] (Busza) in 1617 which relinquished influence in some borderlands to Moldova and the [[Ottoman Empire]]; and of failing to stop the Tatars at the [[battle of Orynin]] in 1618.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-137&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-138&quot;/&gt; But in 1618 he finally received his coveted [[buława]] of the Grand Crown Hetman, and shortly afterwards the office of [[Grand Crown Chancellor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-138&quot;/&gt; He was thus for a brief period the most powerful individual in the Commonwealth after the king, a position he reached not through wealth or family but by military achievement and reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-138&quot;/&gt;

Despite being more than 70 years old, Żółkiewski continued in active service as a military commander until the very end. He died on 7 October 1620, during the Commonwealth's retreat after the [[Battle of Ţuţora (1620)|battle of Cecora]] against the Turks, during the [[Polish–Ottoman War (1620–1621)]] which marked the end of the Moldavian campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-138&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt; The battle comprised several engagements, in which Polish forces were routed. During the last rout Żólkiewski was killed; according to an anecdote he refused to retreat, preferring to stay with the rear guard till the very end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-138&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=nto/&gt; Before his death he received the blessing of his confessor, [[Father Szymon Wybierski (Wybierek, Wyberek)]] of the Society of Jesus, who stood fearlessly at his side (7 October).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/histoireduroije02salvgoog/histoireduroije02salvgoog_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; {see painting &quot;Battle of Cecora (1620)&quot; by Walery Eljasz Radzikowski}&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Cecora 1620 111.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle Żółkiewski's corpse was desecrated by the removal of its head and sent to Constantinople as a trophy of war. His widow bought his body from the Turks and ransomed their son, who had been captured during the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt; Żółkiewski was buried in [[St. Lawrence's Church, Zhovkva|St Lawrence Church]] in [[Żółkiew]] (now Zhovkva, Ukraine), the town he enlarged and where he built the [[Żółkiew Castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=nto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nto.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100116/REPORTAZ/490934164 |title=Hetman Żółkiewski&amp;nbsp;– zdobywca Kremla&amp;nbsp;– 16 stycznia 2010|author=Stanisław S.

==Remembrance==
Żółkiewski's heroic death&amp;nbsp;– portrayed in several works of art by contemporaries such as [[Teofil Szemberg]] and [[Stanisław Witkowski]]&amp;nbsp;– boosted his reputation and guaranteed him a place among the pantheon of the most famous of Polish military commanders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt; In the years following his death he was mentioned in the works of writers such as [[Stefan Żeromski]], [[Józef Szujski]], [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]] and [[Maria Konopnicka]].&lt;ref name=nto/&gt; Up to the present day, the story of his death is the best remembered aspect of his life, with a number of sources discussing the &quot;legend of Żółkiewski&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuczyńska1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jadwiga Kuczyńska|title=Stanisław Żółkiewski, hetman i pisarz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0AjAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2012|year=1988|publisher=Ossolineum|isbn=978-83-04-03073-2|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Śliwiński1920&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Artur Śliwiński|title=Hetman Zolkiewski|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pvMKAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2012|year=1920|publisher=Wydawnictwo M.

A monument was built at the site of Żółkiewski's death (now in [[Calaraşovca|Berezovca]] in [[Ocnița District]], [[Moldova]]) by his son Jan, in 1621.&lt;ref name=kg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuriergalicyjski.com/index.php/2012-02-03-12-29-43/irp/75-stanisaw-kiewski-hetman-i-onierz-do-koca?showall=&amp;start=3 |author=Krzysztof Szymański| title=Stanisław Żółkiewski&amp;nbsp;– hetman i żołnierz do końca |publisher=Kurier Galicyjski |issue=nr 17 (141) |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inscribed with a motto from [[Horace]]: &quot;''[[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori|Quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]]''&quot; (How sweet and fitting it is to die for one's country).&lt;ref name=kg/&gt; The monument was destroyed in 1868, rebuilt in 1912, and renovated in 2003.&lt;ref name=kg/&gt; It is a venue for events organized by the [[Polish minority in Moldova]].&lt;ref name=kg/&gt;

In 1903 a statue of Żółkiewski was built in Źółkiew, but it was demolished in 1939 by Soviet troops in the aftermath of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref name=nto/&gt; In modern Poland Źółkiewski is celebrated as a military hero, but modern Russia's [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison.&lt;ref name=nto/&gt; As of 2011, the St. Lawrence's Church and castle in Źółkwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainians conservators.&lt;ref name=nto/&gt;

==Family and assets==
[[File:Pomnik na miejscu śmierci hetmana Żółkiewskiego.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Monument to Żókiewski, near the site of his death in modern Moldova]]
Żółkiewski was married to Regina Herbutówna; they had a son, [[Jan Żółkiewski|Jan]], and two daughters, [[Katarzyna Żółkiewska|Katarzyna]] and [[Zofia Żółkiewska|Zofia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt; Over the course of his career Żółkiewski amassed a large fortune,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt; and acquired lands near [[Boryspil]], [[Brody]], [[Vinnytsia]] and Żółkiew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt; His annual income of more than 100,000 [[złoty]]s made him one of the wealthiest [[magnate]]s in the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt; Żółkiewski's assets were eventually inherited by [[Jakub Sobieski]], whose son [[Jan III Sobieski|Jan]] became a Polish king and another renowned Polish commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagielski1995-139&quot;/&gt;
