'''ORP ''Grom''''' was the [[lead ship]] of [[Grom-class destroyer|her class]] of [[destroyer]]s serving in the [[Polish Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was named after the [[Polish language|Polish]] word for [[Thunderbolt]], while her [[sister ship]] {{ORP|Błyskawica}} translates to [[lightning]].

==Design==
''Grom'' was thought of as a large destroyer, similar to [[flotilla leader]]s. She and sister ship ORP ''Błyskawica'' were to support the outdated French-built {{ORP|Wicher|1928|2}} and {{ORP|Burza||2}} in the role of the core of the Polish Navy in a possible conflict. As Poland had only one major seaport, the main task of the Polish naval forces was to secure supplies shipment to and from allied countries. Because of that, the ''Grom'' class was designed to fulfill both the role of shore defence and [[convoy escort]] and was supposed to be stronger than single enemy destroyers.

Two Parsons [[steam turbine]]s of {{convert|54000|shp|lk=in}} altogether, three [[boiler]]s and two shafts allowed ''Grom'' to travel at {{convert|39|kn|lk=in}}, faster than the contemporary designs like the US {{sclass-|Farragut|destroyer (1934)|5}} and {{sclass-|Porter|destroyer|4}}es, the British {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1936)|4}}, or the [[Nazi Germany|German]] {{sclass2-|Type 1934|destroyer|5}}s. Also, as it was not clear whether the ships would be used to secure convoys to the Polish port of [[Gdynia]] or the Romanian port of [[Constanţa]] (through the [[Romanian Bridgehead]]), the possible range was much larger than in the case of destroyers designed exclusively for the [[Baltic Sea]]. The ship had an effective range of {{convert|3500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.

==Construction and career==
''Grom'' was ordered from the British [[J. Samuel White]] shipyard in [[Cowes]] and was [[Keel laying|laid down]] in 1935. The destroyer was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1937.

On 30 August 1939, the Polish destroyers ''Burza'', ''Błyskawica'' and ''Grom'' were ordered to activate the [[Peking Plan]], and the warships headed for Great Britain, from where they were to operate as convoy escorts. On 1 September 1939, Polish destroyers met the British destroyers {{HMS|Wanderer|D74|2}} and {{HMS|Wallace|L64|2}}. The British ships led the Polish flotilla to [[Leith]], and in the night the Polish destroyers came to [[Rosyth]]. However, no convoys were ever organized to help Poland during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Polish Defensive War]] and the Polish ships were used in support of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] maritime operations.

During her operations in the [[Norwegian Campaign]], ''Grom'' was ranked by the German soldiers as probably the most hated of all the Allied ships deployed to the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;kampf&quot;/&gt; This hatred was founded on the fact that ''Grom'' took an intense interest in all hostile movements on shore and was reputed to spend hours lurking the coast in order harass German forces. It is worth noting that this aggressive posture caused ''Grom'' to inflict heavy damage and casualties on the civilian population in the area.{{cn|date=June 2016}} On 4 May 1940, ''Grom'' carried out what turned out to be the last of her many [[naval gunfire support]] missions in the [[Narvik]] area in the Rombaken fjord. She was attacked by a [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber from [[Kampfgeschwader 100]] (piloted by Lt. Korthals).&lt;ref name=chrono/&gt; Her loaded midship torpedo launcher was struck by a bomb from a German plane and the torpedo exploded, causing the hull to break into two and the ship to sink almost immediately with a loss of life of 59 sailors.

The wreck was never raised and it was not until 6 October 1986 that it was explored by divers for the first time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
