The '''''Mahan''-class destroyers''' of the [[United States Navy]] were a series of 18 [[destroyer]]s of which the first 16 were laid down in 1934. The last two of the 18, {{USS|Dunlap|DD-384|2}} and {{USS|Fanning|DD-385|2}} (this pair laid down in 1935), are sometimes considered as a separate [[ship class]]. All 18 were commissioned in 1936 and 1937. {{USS|Mahan|DD-364|2}} was the [[lead ship]], named for Rear Admiral [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], an influential historian and theorist on sea power.

The ''Mahan''s featured improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 [[torpedo tube]]s, superimposed gun shelters, and generators for emergency use. [[Standard displacement]] increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class introduced a new steam [[propulsion]] system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight [[steam turbine]], proving simpler and more efficient than the ''Mahan''s' predecessors—so much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.

All 18 ships saw action in World War II, entirely in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]], including during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], and the battles of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]], [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]], and [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]]. Their participation in major and secondary campaigns included the bombardment of beachheads, amphibious landings, task force screening, convoy and patrol duty, and anti-aircraft and submarine warfare.  Six ships were lost in combat and two were expended in the postwar [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests. The remainder were decommissioned, sold, or scrapped after the war; none remain today. Collectively, the ships received 111 [[Service star#Navy warships|battle stars]] for their World War II service.

==Design==

The ''Mahan''-class destroyers emerged as improved versions of the {{sclass-|Farragut|destroyer (1934)|4}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Reilly p. 28&quot;&gt;Reilly p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; 
incorporating the most up-to-date machinery available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reilly p. 28&quot;/&gt; 
The Navy's [[General Board]] had been wrestling with proposed design changes, first considering 12 torpedo tubes with one fewer [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}}/38 caliber gun]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-p86&quot;&gt;Friedman p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and then proposing to retain all five guns with the twelve [[torpedo tube]]s, but configuring those guns only for surface targets, not air targets. The [[Chief of Naval Operations]] objected, recommending against &quot;subordinating the gun to the [[torpedo]]&quot;, and a compromise was struck that included a new engineering plant and a new battery arrangement for the ''Mahan'' class and others.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman pp. 87 &amp; 88&lt;/ref&gt; In the final design, No. 3 gun was moved to the aft deckhouse (just ahead of No. 4) to make room for the third quadruple torpedo tube; the two middle torpedo tubes were moved to the sides, releasing the centerline space for extension of the aft deckhouse. All five 5 in/38s were kept and remained [[dual purpose gun]]s, able to target aircraft as well as ships, but only No. 1 and No. 2 had [[gun shield]]s. The traditional destroyer machinery was replaced with a new generation of land-based machinery. This change ushered in a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine, which proved simpler and more efficient to operate. Double reduction [[gear]]ing also reduced the size of the faster-turning turbines and allowed cruising turbines to be added. These changes led to a ten percent increase in displacement over the ''Farragut''s.{{efn|The ''Mahan''s displaced {{convert|1500|LT}} compared to {{convert|1365|LT}} for the ''Farragut''s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;&gt;Friedman p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mahan''s typically had a tripod foremast with a pole mainmast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reilly p. 28&quot;/&gt; To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;/&gt; In silhouette, they were similar to the larger {{sclass-|Porter|destroyer|1}}s that immediately preceded them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reilly-p28&quot;&gt;Reilly  p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahan''s were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;/&gt;

The ''Mahan''s displaced {{convert|1500|LT|t|0}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The [[length overall|overall length]] of the class was {{convert|341|ft|3|in|m|1}}, the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and the [[draft (hull)|draft]] {{convert|10|ft|7|in|m|1}}. They were powered by [[General Electric]] geared steam turbines, driving two shafts that developed a total of {{convert|46000|shp|lk=in}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}}. Four [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] or four [[Foster Wheeler]] [[water-tube boiler]]s generated the [[superheated steam]] needed for the turbines. The ''Mahan''s carried a maximum of {{convert|523|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], with a range of {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. Their peacetime complement was 158 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 465&quot;&gt;Friedman p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; The wartime complement increased to approximately 250 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
The ''Mahan''s' propulsion plant was considerably improved over that of the ''Farragut''s. Steam pressure was raised from {{convert|400|psi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|465|psi|abbr=on}} in some ships, and [[superheated steam]] temperature was raised from {{convert|648|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|700|°F|abbr=on}} in all ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://destroyerhistory.org/assets/pdf/generalinformationbooks/364mahan_GIBook.pdf USS ''Mahan'' (DD-364) and USS ''Cummings'' (DD-365) General Information Book with as-built data] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://destroyerhistory.org/assets/pdf/generalinformationbooks/384dunlap_GIBook.pdf USS ''Dunlap'' (DD-384) and USS ''Fanning'' (DD-385) General Information Book with as-built data] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Double reduction [[gear]]ing replaced single reduction gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. [[Boiler]] [[economizer]]s, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|12|kn}}, {{convert|1000|nmi|abbr=on}} farther than the ''Farragut''s. Design shaft horsepower was increased from {{convert|42800|shp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|48000|shp|abbr=on}} in the same space and weight as in the ''Farragut''s.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 88, 465-467&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/1500ton/ Comparison of 1500-ton classes] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively compact power plant contributed to the ''Mahan''s' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by [[General Electric]] and were [[steam turbine#Impulse turbines|impulse-type]], also called Curtis turbines.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer and Roberts, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://destroyerhistory.org/assets/pdf/generalinformationbooks/364mahan_GIBook.pdf USS ''Mahan'' (DD-364) and USS ''Cummings'' (DD-365) General Information Book with as-built data]&lt;/ref&gt; Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, in a similar manner to the machinery illustrated at the following reference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leander-project.homecall.co.uk/Engines/turbine_gearbox.jpg Turbine and reduction gear illustration at the Leander Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a [[surface condenser|condenser]]. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
[[File:USS Mahan 24 June 1944.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Mahan|DD-364|6}} at Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul on 24 June 1944]]
The main battery of the ''Mahan'' class consisted of five dual purpose {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}}/38 caliber guns, equipped with the Mark 33 gun [[fire-control system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 465&quot;/&gt; The [[anti-aircraft]] battery had four water-cooled [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;Hodges and Friedman p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The class was fitted with three quadruple torpedo tube mounts for twelve {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} torpedo tubes, guided by the Mark 27 torpedo fire control system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 465&quot;/&gt; The class was initially equipped with the [[Mark 11 torpedo]] or [[Mark 12 torpedo]], which were replaced by the [[Mark 15 torpedo]] beginning in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Torpedo History: Torpedo Mk 11, Mk 12 and Torpedo Mk 15 | url= http://www.history.navy.mil/museums/keyport/html/part2.htm | accessdate = 2015-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depth charge roll-off racks were rigged on the stern.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-p86&quot; /&gt;

In early 1942, the ''Mahan''-class destroyers began a wartime armament refitting process, but most of the class was not fully refitted until 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges &amp; Friedman p. 145&quot;&gt;Hodges &amp; Friedman p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The notable refits to the ''Mahan'' class included the removal of one 5-inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin [[Bofors 40 mm gun]]s (1.6&amp;nbsp;in) and between four and six [[20 mm Oerlikon]] (0.9&amp;nbsp;in) guns to increase the ships' light [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) armament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges &amp; Friedman p. 145&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1945, removal of two quadruple torpedo tubes was authorized to permit substitution of two 40&amp;nbsp;mm quad mounts. In June, removal of the third centerline tube was authorized to make way for two 40&amp;nbsp;mm twin mounts abreast of the aft stack. All ships receiving these AA modifications were to have directors installed with their new 40&amp;nbsp;mm mounts; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind-firing GFFC Mark 63 installations with [[radar]].&lt;ref&gt;Reilly p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Dunlap'' class==
The ''Dunlap'' class was a two-ship destroyer class based on the ''Mahan'' design, listed as a separate class in some sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer and Roberts, pp. 184-186&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were {{USS|Dunlap|DD-384}} and {{USS|Fanning|DD-385}}, the last two ''Mahan''s. Unlike the ''Mahan''s, the ''Dunlap''s had the new Mark 25 [[gunhouse|enclosed mounts]] for the two forward 5-inch/38 caliber guns, with base rings housing projectile hoists that rotated with each of the guns; their ammunition was fed from a handling room below each mount.&lt;ref&gt;McComb p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_5-38_mk12.htm|title=DiGiulian, Tony, 5&quot;/38 (12.7 cm) Mark 12 at Navweaps.com |accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dunlap'' and ''Fanning'' were the first US destroyers to use enclosed forward gun mounts rather than shields; their light pole foremast and lack of a mainmast visibly distinguished them from the ''Mahan''s.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The building of the first sixteen vessels was all authorised under the NIRA Executive Order on 16 June 1933; the last two were authorised under the Vinson-Trammell Act on 27 March 1934 (as part of a batch of 95 destroyers authorised on that date - covering DD-380 to DD-436 and DD-445 to DD-482). Contracts for the first six ''Mahan''s were awarded to three shipbuilders, but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in-house design structure.  On the strength of their reputation, the New York firm of [[Gibbs &amp; Cox]] was named as the design agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reilly p. 28&quot;/&gt; The firm had no experience in the design of warships,  but had successfully designed passenger-cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy.&lt;ref&gt;McComb p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made to design the ''Mahan'' class and future classes around a new generation of machinery,&lt;ref&gt;Reilly pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; including a cheaper, faster and more efficient propulsion system that combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, fast-running turbine and double reduction gears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman p. 88&quot;&gt;Friedman p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==

===''Mahan''===
{{main|USS Mahan (DD-364)}}
USS ''Mahan'' was commissioned on the east coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937. She sailed to the Southern California coast for fleet training before moving on to Pearl Harbor. At sea when the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Mahan'' participated in the initial post-attack efforts in search of the strike force.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Mahan/&gt; The ship joined [[Task Force 17]] in February 1942, which conducted raids on several atolls in the [[Marshall Islands|Marshall]] and [[Gilbert Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Late in March, she returned to Pearl Harbor and proceeded to the west coast for overhaul. By August 1942, ''Mahan'' was back operating out of Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Mahan/&gt;

[[File:BB South Dakota.jpg|thumb|''South Dakota'', Navy repair ship, ''Mahan'' (damaged [[bow (ship)|bow]]), and ''Lamson'', after ''South Dakota'' – ''Mahan'' collision, following the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]]
In October 1942, ''Mahan'' was assigned to [[Task Force 61]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]. The engagement cost the Navy 74 aircraft, the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, and one destroyer. While en route to [[Nouméa, New Caledonia]], ''Mahan'' and the [[battleship]] {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} collided, causing severe damage to both ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p 185 188&quot;&gt;Roscoe pp. 185–188&lt;/ref&gt;  Temporary repairs were made to ''Mahan'' and she steamed to Pearl Harbor for a new bow. She pulled out of Pearl Harbor in January 1943. In the months to follow, ''Mahan'' escorted convoys between [[New Hebrides]] and the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], performed patrol assignments off New Caledonia and engaged in operations in Australian waters.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Mahan/&gt; Assigned to the amphibious force of Rear Admiral [[Daniel E. Barbey]], ''Mahan'' participated in a succession of wide-ranging amphibious campaigns in [[New Guinea]] and [[New Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 256–259 &amp; 267–269&lt;/ref&gt;  In February and March 1944, she saw action with the [[7th Fleet]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt; After that the ship was ordered  back to the west coast for an overhaul, leaving the yard in July 1944 for Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Mahan/&gt;

Returning to New Guinea, ''Mahan'' began to escort convoys between [[Jayapura|Hollandia]], in [[Indonesia]] and [[Leyte]], in the [[Philippine Islands]]. By November 1944, she was doing anti-submarine patrols off Leyte. On 7 December 1944 while patrolling the channel between Leyte and [[Ponson Island]], a group of Japanese [[kamikaze|suicide aircraft]] overwhelmed ''Mahan'' at [[Ormoc Bay]]. She was disabled by the attack, then abandoned and sunk by a US destroyer. ''Mahan'' received five battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Mahan/&gt;

===''Cummings''===
{{Main|USS Cummings (DD-365)}}
[[File:Cummings in the Pacific.jpg|thumb|''Cummings'' underway in 1944]]
USS ''Cummings'' served in the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in the late 1930s, participating in numerous individual and fleet training exercises. In 1940, she served on security patrols off the west coast. ''Cummings'' went on a goodwill visit to several ports in the South Pacific, including [[Auckland]], New Zealand, and [[Tahiti]]. The destroyer was hit by fragments while docked in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, and suffered a few casualties. She escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor and the west coast for the first six months of World War II. In June 1942, she was transferred to convoy escort duties in the South Pacific until August, when she had an overhaul in San Francisco, and then returned to her role as a convoy escort in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cummings/&gt;

In January 1944, ''Cummings'' joined the screen for the Fast Carrier Strike Force while it raided Japanese positions in the Central Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohwer p. 303&quot;&gt;Rohwer p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;  In March, ''Cummings'' sailed for [[Trincomalee]], Ceylon, where she rendezvoused with British ships for exercises. In April, the ship joined a British force to screen during air strikes on [[Sabang, Indonesia]]. She returned to Ceylon in May and then moved on to [[Exmouth Gulf]], Australia. With a British force, ''Cummings'' sortied for air strikes on [[Soerabaja]], Java, before leaving for Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cummings/&gt;

By July she was back in San Francisco to escort the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Baltimore|CA-68|2}}, the ship that carried President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cummings'' joined the  [[US 3rd Fleet]] for the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cummings/&gt;  The next month, she bombarded Iwo Jima in preparation for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|amphibious assault on the island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohwer p. 384&quot;&gt;Rohwer p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The ship operated off Okinawa [[Battle of Okinawa|during its invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, ''Cummings'' returned to the United States and was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold for scrap in July 1947. She received seven battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cummings/&gt;

===''Drayton''===
{{main|USS Drayton (DD-366)}}
[[File:USSDraytonDD366.jpg|thumb|''Drayton'' underway in 1936|left]]
USS ''Drayton'' made her shakedown cruise to Europe late in 1936, and finished her final trials in the United States.  She left Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1937 for San Diego, California, to join the Scouting Force.  In July, ''Drayton'' participated in the search for the lost American pilot, [[Amelia Earhart]].  For the next two years, she exercised along the west coast, the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the [[Caribbean]]. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, ''Drayton'' was at sea but able to participate in the post-attack efforts in search of the enemy force.  During the succeeding three months, she escorted a convoy to Christmas Island ([[Kiritimati]]), screened a carrier in an airstrike on [[Bougainville Island]], and screened a tanker to [[Suva]] Harbor, Fiji Islands.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Drayton/&gt; In late November 1942
''Drayton'' became part of [[Task Force 67]], which intercepted a Japanese naval force guarding transports en route to resupply [[Guadalcanal]]. The [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 206-209&quot;&gt;Roscoe pp. 206–209&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout June, July and August 1943, ''Drayton'' escorted Australian troop carriers from [[Townsville]], Australia, to [[Milne Bay]], New Guinea.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Drayton/&gt; In early September, the ship supported the [[Landing at Lae|amphibious landing at Lae]], New Guinea.  Later in September, she participated in the [[Battle of Scarlet Beach|amphibious landing at Finschhafen]], New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 256–259&lt;/ref&gt;  After escorting troops to [[Arawe]], New Britain, in December 1943, ''Drayton'' participated in [[Battle of Arawe|the landings there]] and at Borgen Bay, near [[Cape Gloucester]], New Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 267-269&quot;&gt;Roscoe pp. 267–269&lt;/ref&gt;  The destroyer took part in the invasion of [[Los Negros Island]] in the Admiralty Islands during February 1944.  She reported to the 7th Fleet in October and performed patrol and escort duty in Leyte Gulf. In December 1944, while screening a convoy to [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] in the Philippines, a Japanese bomber attacked the ship, killing two men and wounding seven.  The next day, she fought off enemy fighters; one crashed into a 5&quot;/38 caliber gun mount, killing six men and wounding twelve. By August 1945 she was on her way to New York, arriving in September. ''Drayton'' was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrap in December 1946.  She received 11 [[battle stars]] for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Drayton/&gt;

{{main|USS Lamson (DD-367)}}
[[File:USS Lamson (DD-367) at Ormoc Bay.jpg|thumb|''Lamson'' on fire at Ormoc Bay, Philippine Islands, December 1944]]
USS ''Lamson'' shipped out of Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1937 for San Diego, California, less than a year after her naval service began. She engaged in exercises and tactical training until sailing for Pearl Harbor in October 1939. For the next two years, ''Lamson'' continued training from her base in [[Hawaii]].  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, she joined the post-attack efforts to search for the Japanese strike force.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Lamson/&gt; In February 1942 she became part of the newly formed [[ANZAC Squadron]], consisting of Australian, New Zealand, and American warships in Suva, Fiji Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; In March, she operated with the squadron as a cover group southeast of Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  In late November 1942, ''Lamson'' was assigned to Task Force 67 and took part in the Battle of Tassafaronga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 206-209&quot;/&gt;

For the next eight months, ''Lamson'' screened convoys en route to Guadalcanal. By August 1943, she had moved on to Milne Bay, New Guinea, and participated in the September amphibious landings at Lae and Finschhafen.  In December, the ship engaged in the pre-invasion bombardment of Arawe and landings at Cape Gloucester, New Britain.  After an overhaul and training at Pearl Harbor, ''Lamson'' joined the 7th Fleet in October 1944.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Lamson/&gt; In early December 1944, she took part in the amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay, Leyte, Philippine Islands. There she was struck by a ''[[kamikaze]]'' that set fire to the ship, killing 21 men and injuring 50. The fires were extinguished by a rescue tug and ''Lamson'' was saved.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive repairs in the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], she returned to the Pacific and operated off Iwo Jima, then sailed to the United States in November 1945.  In May 1946, she participated in the Able nuclear test of [[Operation Crossroads]]; she was sunk in the Baker test in July 1946. ''Lamson'' received five battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Lamson/&gt;

USS ''Flusser'' steamed her way to San Diego, California, in July 1937, after spending the first months of her naval service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.  She was based in San Diego until 1939, then reassigned to Pearl Harbor. ''Flusser'' was at sea when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor, but took part in the post-attack search.  For the next six months, she carried out convoy duty between Pearl Harbor and the west coast, and engaged in escort and patrol duty out of southwest Pacific ports.  From July 1942 to February 1943, ''Flusser'' was in overhaul status at Pearl Harbor.  She returned to escort and training operations in the [[Solomon Islands]] and was later based at Milne Bay, New Guinea.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Flusser/&gt; During September, ''Flusser'' was part of the amphibious landing forces at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohwer pp. 270 &amp; 277&quot;&gt;Rohwer pp. 270 &amp; 277&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1943, the destroyer participated in the bombardment and landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, New Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 267-269&quot;/&gt;  While attached to the  7th Fleet in February, she supported the landing of troops at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands.  Between April and June 1944, the ship was in the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] for overhaul.&lt;ref Name=DANFS_Flusser/&gt;

After her overhaul, ''Flusser'' returned to Pearl Harbor.  In August, she escorted a convoy to [[Eniwetok]] and moved on to [[Majuro]] in the Marshall Islands, where she patrolled bypassed Japanese-held atolls.&lt;ref Name=DANFS_Flusser/&gt; On a patrol off [[Wotje Atoll]], the ship was fired on by a shore battery that left nine of her crew members wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, she sailed north to San Pedro Bay for duty in the Leyte Gulf and [[Surigao Strait]].  By early December 1944, ''Flusser'' had escorted convoys from Hollandia Jayapura to Leyte and taken part in the amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay. In March 1945, ''Flusser'' provided escort support for the landing near [[Cebu]] in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Flusser/&gt; During July she participated in the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Balikpapan campaign]] in Borneo, escorting ships and covering the landing.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;  After occupation duty in Okinawa during September and October, she sailed to San Diego, California, arriving in November 1945.  During  1946, ''Flusser'' took part in the atomic weapons tests in the Marshall Islands.   From there, she steamed to Pearl Harbor, then to Norfolk, Virginia.  The destroyer was decommissioned there in December 1946 and sold in January 1948.  ''Flusser'' received eight battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Flusser/&gt;

===''Reid''===
{{main|USS Reid (DD-369)}}
[[File:USS Reid (DD 369).jpg|thumb|''Reid'' off Mare Island in 1943]]
USS ''Reid'' came into naval service in November 1936. From 1937 until 1941, she participated in training and fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic and Pacific.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Reid/&gt; ''Reid'' was berthed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked, but escaped without damage while her gunners fired at the enemy attackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 47-48&quot;&gt;Roscoe pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; After the attack, ''Reid'' did patrol duty in the Hawaiian waters, and later escorted convoys to San Francisco, California.  Late in May 1942, ''Reid'' steamed north from Pearl Harbor to bombard the Japanese positions in [[Kiska]] and supported landings at [[Adak, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=DANFS_Reid/&gt; While conducting an anti-submarine patrol in August, she brought a Japanese submarine to the surface with a heavy [[depth charge]] barrage, and opened fire on it until it capsized and sank.  Five of the submarine's crew survived and were rescued by ''Reid''.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp.152–153&lt;/ref&gt; By October, she was patrolling the waters near New Caledonia, Samoa, and the Fiji Islands. In January 1943, the ship bombarded several Japanese locations on Guadalcanal.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Reid/&gt;

During September 1943, ''Reid'' provided support for the landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea.  In December, ''Reid'' escorted troop transports for the landings at Arawe, New Britain, and participated in the landings at Cape Gloucester, New Britain. In the following months she supported landings at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands, Hollandia Jayapura, [[Wakde Island]], [[Biak]], and [[Noemfoor]], New Guinea. ''Reid'' supported air strikes against [[Wake Island]], and in November 1944 did patrol duty off Leyte in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Reid/&gt;

On 11 December 1944, ''Reid'' was operating with a convoy bound for Ormoc Bay, Leyte, to resupply land forces.  Late that afternoon, a group of Japanese planes descended on the convoy and penetrated the defenses, taking aim at ''Reid'' and another destroyer.  The destroyers put up an anti-aircraft barrage that splashed some of the planes and damaged others, but ''Reid'' was hit by five suicide planes, causing powerful explosions. Within minutes, she went to the bottom, and over a hundred men perished.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Reid'' received seven battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Reid/&gt;

===''Case''===
{{main|USS Case (DD-370)}}
[[File:USS Case DD370 stern.jpg|thumb|''Case''{{'}}s stern, showing the 5 inch guns at Mare Island in November 1943|left]]
USS ''Case'' began active duty in September 1936 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet.  In April 1940, Pearl Harbor became her home base.  The following year, she participated in fleet exercises to [[Midway Island]], [[Johnston Island]], [[Palmyra Atoll]], Samoa, and Auckland.  ''Case'' was berthed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese struck, but sustained no damage.  After the attack, she escorted convoys between the west coast and Pearl Harbor until late May 1942.  ''Case'' went north to support the pre-invasion bombardment of Kiska and do patrol duty off Adak, Alaska.  In October, the ship escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor and then headed to the states for repair, returning to Pearl Harbor in November. In January 1943, she sailed to [[Espiritu Santo]] for training and remained there until September.  After overhaul in San Francisco, California, ''Case'' returned to Pearl Harbor in December 1943.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Case/&gt; She proceeded to the Marshall Islands, taking part in attacks on Wotje Atoll and [[Maloelap Atoll]] in late January and Eniwetok in early February 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohwer p. 303&quot;/&gt;

In April 1944, ''Case'' took part in air raids on Hollandia, Truk ([[Chuuk Lagoon]]), [[Satawan]], and [[Ponape Island]].  Her next assignment was with Task Group 58.4, participating in strikes on Japanese airfields in the [[Bonin Islands]].&lt;ref name=DANFS_Case/&gt; During June 1944, ''Case'' engaged in raids on the [[Mariana Islands]] and Vulcan Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Following repair work at Eniwetok, the ship resumed operations with the task group, screening for air strikes in July and for attacks on the Bonin Islands in August and September. She took part in the bombardment of [[Marcus Island]] before joining Task Group 38.1 for strikes on [[Luzon]].  While screening US cruisers bound for [[Saipan]], ''Case'' rammed and sank a Japanese midget submarine.  Undamaged, she sailed to Saipan for offshore patrol duty until early December 1944.&lt;ref Name=DANFS_Case/&gt; Afterward, ''Case'' became involved in a raid on Iwo Jima airfields and helped sink two Japanese ships.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;  Following repairs at Saipan, she patrolled between there and Iwo Jima until the end of the war.  She then left Iwo Jima for Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in December 1947.  ''Case'' received seven battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref Name=DANFS_Case/&gt;

===''Conyngham''===
{{main|USS Conyngham (DD-371)}}
[[File:USS Conyngham.jpg|thumb|''Conyngham'' off Mare Island January 1942]]
USS ''Conyngham'' made her maiden voyage to northern Europe in early 1937, shortly after being commissioned. Following an overhaul in Boston, she sailed to San Diego, California.  From October 1937 until April 1940, ''Conyngham'' operated along the west coast, the Hawaiian Islands and the Caribbean, then made her way to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Conyngham/&gt; In March 1941, ''Conyngham'' left Pearl Harbor on a goodwill tour to Samoa, Sydney and Brisbane in Australia, and Suva in Fiji, returning in April 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Undamaged by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she put to sea on patrol duty that continued through December. After a brief overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, ''Conyngham'' performed escort duty between the west coast and New Hebrides. Her escort assignment was interrupted to screen carriers in the Battle of Midway Island in June 1942.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Conyngham/&gt;

During October 1942, ''Conyngham'' participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and supported the attack at the [[Matanikau River]], Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1943 she joined an amphibious force that later carried out landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohwer pp. 270 &amp; 277&quot;/&gt;  In December, she took part in the landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, New Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, ''Conyngham'' participated in the [[landing at Saidor]], New Guinea, and sailed to San Francisco for overhaul.  Returning to duty in May 1944, she screened battleships in the Mariana Islands and remained there until August. ''Conyngham'' then joined a convoy screening ships to the Philippines Islands, arriving at Leyte Gulf in early November 1944. There, a floatplane (a type of seaplane) strafed her, wounding 17 men yet causing slight damage to the ship. By early December, she had covered landings at Ormoc Bay and helped with reinforcements.   ''Conygnham'' left the Philippines late in December for Manus Island, New Guinea, to replenish supplies. Later on, she helped screen a convoy to Leyte for the landings at Lingayen Gulf.  The ship participated in bombardments at Lingayen Gulf and remained on patrol there after the landings in January 1945. ''Conygham'' sailed to [[Subic Bay]] for overhaul in late July 1945, and remained there until the end of the war. Decommissioned in December 1946, ''Conyngham'' was used in the atomic weapons test at Bikini in 1946, and was scuttled in July 1948.  She received 14 battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Conyngham/&gt;

USS ''Cassin'' began naval service in August 1936, but alterations kept her from sea duty until March 1937. The next year, she joined the forces at Pearl Harbor for annual fleet exercises. In April 1940, ''Cassin'' was assigned to a Hawaiian unit.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cassin/&gt; When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, ''Cassin'' was in dry-dock with the battleship {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} and the destroyer {{USS|Downes|DD-375|2}}. Both destroyers were at the southern end of the dock when an incendiary bomb struck ''Downes,'' starting unstoppable fires on both destroyers. ''Cassin'' slipped off her blocks and rolled over onto the burning ''Downes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 46-47&quot;&gt;Roscoe pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; She was salvaged and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard and decommissioned.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cassin/&gt;

''Cassin'' was rebuilt and commissioned again in February 1944.  She reported to Pearl Harbor in April and pulled escort duty until August.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cassin/&gt; In October, the ship took part in the shelling of Marcus Island to destroy enemy installations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p. 416&quot;&gt;Roscoe p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;  After participating in the bombardment of Iwo Jima in November 1944 and January 1945, she escorted an ammunition ship to the newly invaded Iwo Jima. There, ''Cassin'' did radar picket and air-sea rescue duty.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cassin/&gt;

With the war over, she took part in guarding the air evacuation of released prisoners of war from [[Japan]].  In November 1945, the ship deployed to Norfolk, Virginia, and decommissioned there in December 1945.  She was sold for scrap in November 1947. ''Cassin'' received six battle stars for her World War II  service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cassin/&gt;

===''Shaw''===
{{main|USS Shaw (DD-373)}}
[[File:US Shaw exploding in Pearl Harbor.jpg|thumb|''Shaw'' exploding during Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941|left]]
USS ''Shaw'' crossed the Atlantic on her [[shakedown cruise]] in April 1937, and returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in June.  There, she began a year of yard work before completing acceptance trials. For the remainder of the year, the ship conducted training exercises in the Atlantic.  Sailing to the west coast, she was at the Mare Island Navy Yard from January to April 1939. By April 1940, ''Shaw'' moved on to Hawaiian waters, then back to the west coast in November for overhaul.  She returned to Hawaii in February 1941, and later entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for repairs.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Shaw/&gt; ''Shaw'' was still in [[dry dock]] when the Japanese attacked, with most of the ship's crew ashore.  She was hit by three bombs and severely damaged when her forward magazine exploded. Temporary repairs were made at Pearl Harbor, and in February 1942 the ship sailed to the west coast to complete them.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

With repairs completed, ''Shaw'' returned to Pearl Harbor in August 1942. She was then assigned to Task Force 61, and took part in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands in mid-October. Reassigned to a unit of the 7th Amphibious Force, ''Shaw'' escorted reinforcements to Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea, for the remainder of October and part of November. In late December, she escorted units engaged in the assault on Cape Gloucester, New Britain, and sustained casualties and damage. Thirty-six men were injured; three later died of their wounds. Temporary repairs were made at Milne Bay, New Guinea, and permanent repairs were completed at San Francisco in May 1944.  ''Shaw'' then returned to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Shaw/&gt;

With Task Force 52, she participated in the offensive to gain possession of  the Japanese-held Mariana Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 406–408&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1945, with the San Fabian Attack Force, ''Shaw'' saw action at [[Manila Bay]] in the Philippine Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;  She returned to the United States in April, stopping first at San Francisco for repairs, then routed to New York via Philadelphia for deactivation. The ship was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrap in July 1946. ''Shaw'' received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Shaw/&gt;

===''Tucker''===
{{main|USS Tucker (DD-374)}}
[[File:Uss Tucker DD-374.jpg|thumb|''Tucker'' off the Norfolk Navy Yard in 1937]]
USS ''Tucker'' was commissioned in July 1936.  After her shakedown cruise, she joined the destroyer forces attached to the US Battle Fleet based in San Diego, California. In February 1939 the ship took part in a naval exercise in the Caribbean, personally observed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from the cruiser {{USS|Houston|CA-30|2}}.  After exercises in Hawaiian waters in early 1940, ''Tucker'' operated between the west coast and Hawaii until the end of the year.  By February 1941, she was back in Pearl Harbor. ''Tucker'' went on a goodwill tour that included Auckland, during March, before returning to Pearl Harbor. There, she participated in exercises at sea before sailing on to San Diego.  By November 1941, ''Tucker'' was once again in Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Tucker/&gt; When the Japanese attacked, the ship was berthed at East Loch undergoing tender overhaul. She was undamaged, and returned fire on the Japanese forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 47-48&quot;/&gt;

After the hostilities, ''Tucker'' patrolled off Pearl Harbor, then spent the next five months escorting convoys between the west coast and Hawaii. She later escorted the tender {{USS|Wright|AV-1|2}} to Tutuila in American Samoa, Suva in the Fiji Islands, and Nouméa in New Caledonia. The ship then escorted ''Wright'' back to Suva, arriving there in June 1942.  From Suva, she escorted the cargo ship ''Nira Luckenbach'' to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, in August.&lt;ref Name=DANFS_Tucker/&gt; The ship entered the harbor by the western entrance and struck at least one mine. The crew abandoned ship and was rescued by nearby vessels. Efforts to save her were in vain; she eventually jack-knifed and went to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tucker'' had steamed into a minefield placed by US forces, but she was never informed of its existence.  Three men were killed and three more were listed as missing. She was removed from the Navy list in December 1944. ''Tucker'' received one battle star for her World War II service.&lt;ref Name=DANFS_Tucker/&gt;

===''Downes''===

USS ''Downes'' entered service in January 1937. The following November, she sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Diego, California. While based there, ''Downes'' participated in exercises along the west coast, in the Caribbean and in Hawaiian waters until April 1940. Pearl Harbor then became her homeport. In early 1941, ''Downes'' joined a cruise to Samoa, the Fiji Islands, and Australia, then visited the west coast later in the year.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Downes/&gt; When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, ''Downes'' was in dry-dock with the battleship ''Pennsylvania'' and the destroyer ''Cassin''. Both destroyers were at the southern end of the dock when an incendiary bomb struck ''Downes'', setting unstoppable fires on both ships. ''Cassin'' slipped her blocks and rolled over onto the burning ''Downes'', and ''Downes'' was later decommissioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe pp. 46-47&quot;/&gt;

''Downes'' was rebuilt and recommissioned in November 1943. During March 1944, she escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor and on to Majuro in the Marshall Islands. By July, ''Downes'' began escort duty from Eniwetok to Saipan in support of the invasion of the Mariana Islands. Then she patrolled off [[Tinian]] during its invasion, and gave fire support during mop-up operations there.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Downes/&gt;  Afterward, ''Downes'' took part in the bombardment of Marcus Island to create a diversion and destroy Japanese installations, an action that Admiral Halsey later commended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p. 416&quot;&gt;Roscoe p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the ship screened the Fast Carrier Task Force during the air strikes on Vice Admiral [[Jisaburō Ozawa]]'s Northern Force. ''Downes'' served in Iwo Jima from June 1944 until the end of the war, when the ship was ordered to return to the United States, arriving at Norfolk in November 1945. She was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in November 1947. ''Downes'' received four battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Downes/&gt;

===''Cushing''===
{{main|USS Cushing (DD-376)}}
[[File:Uss Cushing DD-376.jpg|thumb|''Cushing'' off Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton – 1936]]
USS ''Cushing'' reported to the Pacific Fleet in August 1936, soon after her Navy service began. She joined the unsuccessful search for the missing Earhart during the month of July 1937. She moved on to San Diego for training exercises, continuing to operate along the west coast for the next several years. ''Cushing'' was under overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor.  Following the attack, she did convoy duty between the west coast and Pearl Harbor, and later operated off Midway Island on anti-submarine patrol. In August 1942, ''Cushing'' sailed to Pearl Harbor for training exercises and later joined operations around Guadalcanal.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Cushing/&gt;

With Task Force 61, ''Cushing'' took part in the bitterly contested Battle of Santa Cruz in October 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p 185 188&quot;/&gt; Outnumbered, the force stalled the Japanese from their advance toward Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Battle of Guadalcanal, ''Cushing'' was perhaps the first US ship to strike the enemy on that November day in 1942. In the fighting that followed, she sustained several hits amidships and slowly began to lose power, but was able to fire six torpedoes by local control at the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2|up=yes}}. In his book, ''Destroyer Operations in World War II'' (1953), Theodore Roscoe said, “ Three of the “fish” seemed to hit the bulls-eye; if they did, it was with tack-hammer thumps. They may have exploded prematurely. But ''Hiei''{{'}}s lookouts must have seen them coming, for the big ship swung her bow to the left and lumbered westward, disappearing into the smoke-haze.”
By this time, ''Cushing'' was dead in the water, an easy target for repeated enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cushing'' received three battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref Name=DANFS_Cushing/&gt;

===''Perkins''===
{{main|USS Perkins (DD-377)}}
[[File:Uss Perkins DD-377.jpg|thumb|''Perkins'' steaming through heavy seas, August 1937]]
USS ''Perkins'' was commissioned in September 1936 and San Diego, California, became her homeport.  She operated in the eastern Pacific prior to World War II, and was at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor. In mid-December, she escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor, returned to Mare Island for new radar gear, and sailed back to Pearl Harbor the latter part of January 1942. The following month, ''Perkins'' departed Pearl Harbor and joined Australian, New Zealand, and other US ships in the ANZAC Squadron, charged with protecting the eastern approaches to Australia and New Zealand. She continued operations with ANZAC until April.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Perkins/&gt; In May 1942, ''Perkins'' participated in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 116–122&lt;/ref&gt;  After that, propeller problems took her to New Zealand and to Pearl Harbor, where repairs were completed. While at Pearl Harbor, additional radar gear and 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns were installed.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Perkins/&gt;

By November 1942 ''Perkins'' was with Task Force 67, led by Rear Admiral [[Carleton H. Wright]].  In the nighttime Battle of Tassafaronga, the force intercepted the Japanese to stop them from supplying Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Undamaged in the encounter, ''Perkins'' headed for [[Tulagi]] where she bombarded the Guadalcanal coast and served on escort assignments until January 1943.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Perkins/&gt;  She joined Task Force 76, an amphibious group, in March.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1943, ''Perkins'' bombarded Lae, New Guinea, and supported the landings there.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  She took part in the successful landings at Finschhafen, New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Late in November, the ship was bound from Milne Bay to Buna, steaming independently, when [[MV Duntroon|''Duntroon'']], an Australian troopship, accidentally collided with her. ''Perkins'' broke in two and quickly sank; nine of the crew went down with her.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt; ''Perkins'' received four battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Perkins/&gt;

===''Smith''===
{{main|USS Smith (DD-378)}}
[[File:SantaCruzSmith1.jpg|thumb|''Smith'' burning after being hit by Japanese torpedo plane, October 1942|left]]
USS ''Smith'' began her US naval service in September 1936, and operated along the west coast of the United States for the next five years.  From the start of World War II until April 1942, she was based in San Francisco, California, attached to a destroyer squadron.  In June, ''Smith'' was in Pearl Harbor, engaged in training exercises, then escorted a convoy back to San Francisco. After overhaul and sea trials in the bay area, ''Smith'' returned to Pearl Harbor in August.  By October she was part of Task Force 61, participating in the Battle of Santa Cruz.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Smith/&gt; In the course of the battle, a Japanese torpedo plane crashed into her; the explosion ignited the forward part of the ship. The crew eventually extinguished the fires, and ''Smith'' was able to retain her position in the screen.  When the air cleared, 28 were dead and 23 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 186–188&lt;/ref&gt; She was patched up enough in New Caledonia to make her way to Pearl Harbor, where she was under overhaul until February 1943. The next few months, ''Smith'' performed anti-submarine patrols, did convoy duty, and participated in Navy exercises. In September and October, she was part of the amphibious landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea.  In late December 1943 ''Smith'' was attached to Task Force 76, and took part in landing  the 1st Marine Division at Cape Gloucester, New Britain.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Smith/&gt;

In January 1944, ''Smith'' participated in the amphibious landing near Saidor, New Guinea, led by Barbey.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;  In February, she bombarded designated targets in preparation for the landing at Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands.  By the middle of March, ''Smith'' sailed to the west coast for overhaul. Completed in June, she returned to Pearl Harbor for training exercises and gunnery practice.  Attached to the 7th Fleet in October, ''Smith'' sailed to Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Islands. There, she was positioned northeast of Ponson Island as a fighter director ship for the landing at Ormoc Bay in December 1944.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Smith/&gt;  During January 1945, ''Smith'' supported the landings in Lingayen Gulf, Philippine Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;  In late June, she bombarded Balikpapan, Borneo, in preparation for the landing by an Australian force. ''Smith'' departed the Philippines on 15 August 1945 for [[Buckner Bay]], remaining there until steaming to [[Nagasaki]] Harbor, [[Kyushu]], Japan, on 15 September, arriving there just 37 days after the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 by US forces.
There the ship boarded 80 US military ex-prisoners of war, taking them to Okinawa for transfer to the United States. On 21 September  ''Smith'' returned to Nagasaki and picked up 90 Allied prisoners of war, taking them to Bickner Bay.   She arrived in [[Sasebo, Nagasaki]], on 28 September and departed two days later for San Diego via Pearl Harbor. Docking at San Diego on 19 November, she remained there until ordered to  Pearl Harbor on 28 December, arriving there on 3  January 1946 and assumed an inactive status. The ship was decommissioned on 28 June 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 25  February 1947. ''Smith'' received six battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Smith/&gt;

===''Preston''===
{{main|USS Preston (DD-379)}}
[[File:Uss Preston DD-379.jpg|thumb|''Preston'' underway in the 1930s]]
USS ''Preston'' was in service from October 1936 until November 1942. Following shakedown, she served briefly under the Chief of Naval Operations, then joined the US Fleet. ''Preston'' did peacetime training exercises into the month of December 1941, and performed patrol and escort duties along the west coast until June 1942. After that, she screened the carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} to Hawaii, followed by four months of patrol and escort work in Hawaiian waters.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Preston/&gt;

In October she became part of Task Force 61 and participated in the Battle of Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-November 1942, ''Preston'' sailed to the western end of Guadalcanal to intercept another run by the Japanese to bombard [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. In the ensuing skirmish, ''Preston'' was hit by a salvo from a Japanese cruiser that put both fire rooms out of commission and toppled the aft stack. Her fires made an easy target; as they spread, the order was given to abandon ship. The ship rolled onto her side and sank, taking 116 of her crew with her. ''Preston'' received two battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Preston/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dunlap''===
{{main|USS Dunlap (DD-384)}}
[[File:DunlapTorp.jpg|thumb|''Dunlap'' firing a torpedo from starboard waist torpedo tubes, July 1942|left]]
USS ''Dunlap'' became part of the US Navy in June 1937. A year later, she served as an escort at Philadelphia for the steamer {{SS|Kungsholm}}, which carried [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf Adolf]], the Crown Prince of Sweden. By April 1940, Pearl Harbor was ''Dunlap'''s homeport.  When the Japanese attacked, ''Dunlap'' was at sea bound for Pearl Harbor; she entered port the following day. In January, she sortied for air strikes on the Marshall Islands, and in February she took part in a raid on Wake Island.  Afterward, ''Dunlap'' patrolled Hawaiian waters, escorted convoys between various ports on the west coast, and returned to Pearl Harbor in October 1942.  In December, the destroyer moved on to Noumea, New Caledonia, and operated from there until July 1943.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Dunlap/&gt;
''Dunlap'' saw action at Vella Gulf in the Solomon Islands in a nighttime torpedo clash. In ''United States Destroyer Operations in World War II'' (1953), [[Theodore Roscoe]] wrote: &quot;In the [[Battle of Vella Gulf]], as this engagement was called, the enemy had not laid a hand on the American ships.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 233–237&lt;/ref&gt;

After overhaul in San Diego, ''Dunlap'' performed patrol duty out of Adak, Alaska, in November and December 1943 and sailed to Pearl Harbor. From January until March 1944, she screened carriers in strikes on the Marshall Islands with the 5th Fleet.  After that, ''Dunlap'' took part in strikes on the Soerabaja area of [[Java]] in May and returned to Pearl Harbor in June. In July, she sailed to San Francisco to join the screen for the heavy cruiser ''Baltimore'', which carried Roosevelt for conferences and inspections with top Pacific commanders of Pearl Harbor and Alaskan bases.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Dunlap/&gt;  In early September 1944, ''Dunlap'' participated in the shelling of Wake Island.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1944, she lent a hand in the bombardment of Marcus Island.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;  By January 1945, the ship was involved in the shelling of Iwo Jima, Haha-jima, and [[Chichi-jima]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 1945, Commodore John H. Magruder accepted the surrender of the Bonin Islands by Lt. General [[Yoshio Tachibana]] on board the destroyer. ''Dunlap'' sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, in November 1945, where she was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in December 1947.  She received six battle stars for her World War II service.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Dunlap/&gt;

===''Fanning''===
{{main|USS Fanning (DD-385)}}
[[File:USS Fanning 385.jpg|thumb|''Fanning'' at sea on 18 April 1942, supporting the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo]]
USS ''Fanning'' was occupied with sea trials and minor repairs for the first six months of her naval service. In April 1938, she escorted the light cruiser {{USS|Philadelphia|CL-41|2}} from Annapolis, Maryland, to the Caribbean with Roosevelt aboard.
''Fanning'' sailed to New York for overhaul the following month; in September she moved on to her new base in San Diego, California.  Over the next three years, her duties took her to the east coast and eventually to Hawaii.  The ship was at sea when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor; she returned the following day.  Underway for [[Tutuila]] in January 1942, ''Fanning'' encountered a blinding rainstorm and collided with {{USS|Gridley|DD-380|2}}.  Both destroyers suffered bow damage and were forced to return to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Fanning/&gt; In April 1942 ''Fanning'' became part of Task Force 16, which supported the [[Doolittle Raid]] on the air strike against Tokyo.  After the mission, she returned to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first nine months of 1943, ''Fanning'' deployed against the Japanese on Guadalcanal, supported an occupation force on the [[Russell Islands]], participated in patrol duty, and assisted in the protection of troops occupying [[Munda, Solomon Islands]]. In September, she had an overhaul on the west coast, then finished the year operating off the [[Aleutian Islands]]. By January 1944, ''Fanning'' was operating with Task Group 58.4 in the Marshall Islands.  In March she reported to the Eastern Fleet (British units, reinforced with Australian, Dutch and French warships), participating in strikes against Sabang, Indonesia, the next month.  Detached from the Eastern Fleet in May, ''Fanning'' sailed to the west coast.  In July she left San Diego, escorting the heavy cruiser ''Baltimore'' to Alaska with Roosevelt on board.&lt;ref name=DANFS_Fanning/&gt;  Her next assignment was with Task Group 30.2, shelling Marcus Island in October 1944 to create a diversion and destroy enemy installations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roscoe p. 416&quot;/&gt;  During January 1945, ''Fanning'' took part in the shelling of Iwo Jima, Haha-jima, and Chichi-Jima.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohwer p. 384&quot;/&gt; For the remainder of the war, she was occupied with patrol and escort activities.  In September 1945, she sailed for the United States, and was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, in December 1945; she was sold for scrap in 1948.
