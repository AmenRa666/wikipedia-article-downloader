{{Campaignbox War of 1812: Naval}}

The '''sinking of HMS ''Peacock'' ''' was a naval action fought off the mouth of the [[Demerara River]], [[Guyana]] on 24 February 1813, between the [[sloop of war]] {{USS|Hornet|1805, brig|6}} and the {{sclass-|Cruizer|brig-sloop}} {{HMS|Peacock|1806|6}}. After an exchange of [[broadside]]s, ''Hornet'' was able to [[raking fire|rake]] ''Peacock'', forcing her to [[striking the colours|strike]]. ''Peacock'' was so damaged that she sank shortly after surrendering.

==Prelude==
On 26 October 1812, the [[frigate]] {{USS|Constitution}} and sloop ''Hornet'' sortied from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. (The frigate {{USS|Essex|1799|6}} was supposed to accompany them but was undergoing repairs. Several rendezvous were assigned for ''Essex'' to meet the other two ships, but the arrangements miscarried.)&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December, the two American ships arrived off [[Salvador, Bahia]] on the coast of [[Brazil]], where they found the British sloop of war {{HMS|Bonne Citoyenne|1796|6}}. Commodore [[William Bainbridge]], commanding ''Constitution'', sent a letter to the captain of ''Bonne Citoyenne'', challenging him to fight ''Hornet'', an equal match. The British captain refused, as his ship was carrying a valuable cargo of bullion.&lt;ref&gt;Forester, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Bainbridge left ''Hornet'' to blockade ''Bonne Citoyenne'' and cruised to the south, looking for other prizes. Eventually he found and sank the frigate {{HMS|Java|1811|6}}.

Aboard ''Hornet'', Master Commandant [[James Lawrence]] was aware from Portuguese sources that a British [[ship of the line]] was expected. On 24 January 1813, {{HMS|Montagu|1779|6}} appeared and Lawrence retreated into Portuguese territorial waters. After dark, he headed north along the South American coast. On 14 February, ''Hornet'' encountered and captured the British [[Packet (sea transport)|packet brig]] ''Resolution'', which was carrying twenty thousand dollars in gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;Forester, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
On 24 February, Lawrence pursued a British merchant brig into the mouth of the Demerara River. As evening drew on, Lawrence then noted a British brig-sloop, {{HMS|Espiegle|1812|6}}, at anchor in the river, and another, ''Peacock'', approaching from seaward.

''Hornet'' beat to windward and gained the advantage of the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] position. Lawrence then tacked, and as ''Hornet'' and ''Peacock'' passed each other on opposite tacks they exchanged broadsides at &quot;half pistol shot&quot;. Even at this close range, the British fire went high. Some American sailors were killed and wounded at the mastheads. ''Peacock'' suffered heavy damage to the hull.&lt;ref name=Roosevelt94&gt;Roosevelt, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Peake of ''Peacock'' turned downwind to bring his opposite battery to bear, but Lawrence had carried out the same manoeuvre more rapidly. The starboard bow of ''Hornet'' came up against the stern of ''Peacock'' from where the British could bring no guns to bear, and from this position, ''Hornet{{'}}''s gunners shattered ''Peacock'' in a mere four minutes.&lt;ref name=Roosevelt94/&gt; Peake was killed, and his [[First lieutenant#Royal Navy|First lieutenant]] surrendered and almost immediately made a distress signal. The British lost 5 men killed and 33 wounded (three mortally); the Americans lost only one man killed and four wounded (one mortally), most to ''Peacock''{{'}}s first broadside.{{#tag:ref|''Lloyd's List'' initially reported that Captain Peake and eight of her crew were killed in the action, and 27 were wounded; 19 men, who could not be rescued, went down with her when she sank, though ''Hornet'' rescued the rest. ''Hornet'' herself had lost only one man killed and two wounded.&lt;ref name=Lloyds&gt;''Lloyd's List'' 154 May 1813[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/05-14-1813.jpg] - accessed 13 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Both vessels anchored. An American prize crew went aboard ''Peacock'' and tried to plug the holes below the waterline and throw the guns overboard to lighten the brig, but ''Peacock'' sank suddenly. Three Americans and nine British sailors were trapped below deck and drowned. ''Peacock'' sank in only {{convert|33|ft|m}} of water, and four British sailors saved themselves by climbing the foremast, the top of which remained above the water. Four others escaped to the shore in a boat in the confusion.

Although ''Peacock'' was more lightly armed than ''Hornet'', mounting eighteen 24-pounder [[carronade]]s to ''Hornet''{{'}}s eighteen 32-pounder carronades, the overwhelming defeat was more probably due to poor training and lack of practice at the guns. It was said that Captain Peake had concentrated on the appearance of his command rather than its fighting efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Forester, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The survivors of ''Peacock'' were taken aboard ''Hornet'', where they joined some other prisoners from captured British merchant vessels. Together with some American sailors from a recaptured prize, ''Hornet'' was now carrying 277 people. ''Hornet'' made for [[Martha's Vineyard]], the nearest point of the American coast known not to be watched by the Royal Navy. Even so, all on board were suffering severely from shortage of water when they arrived&lt;ref&gt;Forester, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 March.&lt;ref name=Lloyds/&gt; The surviving officers of ''Peacock'' nevertheless testified to the generosity of ''Hornet''{{'}}s crew.&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, ''Peacock''{{'}}s surviving officers and crew were put on a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] on which they reached Britain in June.
