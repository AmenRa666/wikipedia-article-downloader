The '''Portuguese Colonial War''' ({{lang-pt|Guerra Colonial Portuguesa}}), also known in Portugal as the '''Overseas War''' (''Guerra do Ultramar'') or in the [[Portuguese Empire|former colonies]] as the '''War of Liberation''' (''Guerra de Libertação''), was fought between [[Portuguese military history|Portugal's military]] and the emerging [[nationalist]] movements in [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal's African colonies]] between 1961 and 1974. The Portuguese regime was overthrown by a military [[Carnation Revolution|coup in 1974]], and the change in government brought the conflict to an end. The war was a decisive [[ideology|ideological]] struggle in [[Lusophone]] Africa and surrounding nations and mainland Portugal.

The prevalent Portuguese and international historical approach considers the Portuguese Colonial War as a single conflict fought in three separate [[theater of operations|theaters of operations]] ([[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]). However, some other approaches consider the existence of three distinct conflicts, the [[Angolan War of Independence]], the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]], and the [[Mozambican War of Independence]]. Occasionally, the brief conflict that led to the [[1961 Indian Annexation of Goa]] is also included.

Unlike other European nations during the 1950s and 1960s, the Portuguese [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime did not withdraw from its African colonies, or the overseas provinces (''províncias ultramarinas'') as those territories had been officially called since 1951. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements became active: the 
[[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] in Angola, [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] in Portuguese Guinea, and the [[FRELIMO|Mozambique Liberation Front]] in Mozambique. During the ensuing conflict, atrocities were committed by all forces involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Der Spiegel&quot;&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41955370.html Der Spiegel,1973]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the period Portugal faced increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by the international community. By 1973, the war had become increasingly unpopular due to its length and financial costs, the worsening of diplomatic relations with other United Nations members, and the role it had always played as a factor of perpetuation of the entrenched Estado Novo regime and the non-democratic status quo

The end of the war came with the [[Carnation Revolution]] military coup of April 1974. The withdrawal resulted in the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Portugal-MIGRATION.html Portugal Migration], ''The Encyclopedia of the Nations''&lt;/ref&gt; plus military personnel of European, African and mixed ethnicity from the former Portuguese territories and newly independent African nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'' (August 16, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (Monday, July 7, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal - Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed. ''Portugal: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; This migration is regarded as one of the largest peaceful [[Human migration|migration]]s in the world's history.&lt;ref&gt;António Barreto, ''Portugal: Um Retrato Social'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal had been the first modern European power to establish a colony in Africa when it captured [[Ceuta]] in 1415; it became one of the last to leave.  The former Portuguese territories in Africa became sovereign states, with [[Agostinho Neto]] in Angola, [[Samora Machel]] in Mozambique, [[Luís Cabral]] in Guinea-Bissau, [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]] in São Tomé and Príncipe, and [[Aristides Pereira]] in Cape Verde as the [[heads of state]].

==Political context==

===15th century===
When the Portuguese began trading on the west coast of Africa, in the 15th century, they concentrated their energies on [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] and [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]]. Hoping at first for [[gold]], they soon found that [[slave]]s were the most valuable commodity available in the region for export. The [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] was already well-established in the [[African slave trade]], for centuries linking it to the [[Arab slave trade]]. However, the Portuguese who had conquered the Islamic port of [[Ceuta]] in 1415 and several other towns in current day [[Morocco]] in a [[Crusade]] against Islamic neighbors, managed to successfully establish themselves in the area. But the Portuguese never established much more than a foothold in either place.

In Guinea, rival Europeans grabbed much of the trade (mainly slaves) while local African rulers confined the Portuguese to the coast. These rulers then sent enslaved Africans to the Portuguese ports, or to forts in Africa from where they were exported. Thousands of kilometers down the coast, in Angola, the Portuguese found it even harder to consolidate their early advantage against encroachments by Dutch, British and French rivals. Nevertheless, the fortified Portuguese towns of [[Luanda]] (established in 1587 with 400 Portuguese settlers) and [[Benguela]] (a fort from 1587, a town from 1617) remained almost continuously in Portuguese hands.

As in Guinea, the slave trade became the basis of the local economy in Angola. Excursions traveled ever farther inland to procure captives that were sold by African rulers; the primary source of these slaves were those captured as a result of losing a war or inter-ethnic skirmish with other African tribes. More than a million men, women and children were shipped from Angola across the Atlantic. In this region, unlike Guinea, the trade remained largely in Portuguese hands. Nearly all the slaves were destined for [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]].

In [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], reached in the 15th century by Portuguese sailors searching for a maritime [[spice trade]] route, the Portuguese settled along the coast and made their way into the hinterland as ''[[Wikt:sertanejos|sertanejos]]'' (backwoodsmen). These sertanejos lived alongside [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders and even obtained employment among [[Shona people|Shona]] kings as interpreters and political advisers. One such ''sertanejo'' managed to travel through almost all the Shona kingdoms, including the [[Mutapa Empire]]'s (Mwenemutapa) metropolitan district, between 1512 and 1516.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, page 207&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1530s, small bands of Portuguese traders and [[Prospecting|prospector]]s penetrated the interior regions seeking gold, where they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] and [[Tete]] on the [[Zambezi River]] and tried to establish a monopoly over the gold trade. The Portuguese finally entered into direct relations with the Mwenemutapa in the 1560s.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, page 203&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Portuguese traders and explorers settled in the coastal strip with greater success, and established strongholds safe from their main rivals in East Africa - the [[Omani Arabs]], including those of [[Zanzibar]].

===Scramble for Africa and the World Wars===
[[File:Combat de marracuene.jpg|thumb|The Battle of [[Marracuene]] in 1895]]
[[File:Combat de Coolela.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Coolela in 1895]]
Portugal's colonial claim to the region was recognized by the other European powers during the 1880s, during the [[Scramble for Africa]], and the final boundaries of Portuguese Africa were agreed by negotiation in Europe in 1891. At the time Portugal was in effective control of little more than the coastal strip of both Angola and Mozambique, but important inroads into the interior had been made since the first half of the 19th century. In Angola, construction of a railway from [[Luanda]] to [[Malanje]], in the fertile highlands, was started in 1885.

Work began in 1902 on a commercially significant line from Benguela all the way inland to the Katanga region, aiming to provide access to the sea for the richest mining district of the Belgian Congo. The line reached the Congo border in 1928. In 1914, both Angola and Mozambique had Portuguese army garrisons of around 2,000 men, African troops led by European officers. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Portugal sent reinforcements to both colonies, because the fighting in the neighboring German African colonies was expected to spill over the borders into its territories.

After Germany declared war on Portugal in March 1916 the Portuguese government sent more reinforcements to Mozambique (the South Africans had captured German South West Africa in 1915). These troops supported British, South African and Belgian military operations against German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]]. In December 1917, German colonial forces led by Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]] invaded Mozambique from German East Africa. Portuguese, British and Belgian forces spent all of 1918 chasing Lettow-Vorbeck and his men across Mozambique, German East Africa and [[Northern Rhodesia]]. Portugal sent a total of 40,000 reinforcements to Angola and Mozambique during World War I.

By this time the regime in Portugal had been through two major political upheavals: from monarchy to republic in 1910 and then to a military dictatorship after a coup in 1926. These changes resulted in a tightening of Portuguese control in Angola. In the early years of the expanded colony, there was near constant warfare between the Portuguese and the various African rulers of the region. A systematic campaign of conquest and pacification was undertaken by the Portuguese. One by one the local kingdoms were overwhelmed and abolished.

By the middle of the 1920s the whole of Angola was under control. Slavery had officially ended in Portuguese Africa, but the plantations were worked on a system of paid [[serf]]dom by African labour composed of the large majority of ethnic Africans who did not have resources to pay Portuguese taxes and were considered unemployed by the authorities. After [[World War II]] and the first decolonization events, this system gradually declined. However, paid forced labor, including labor contracts with forced relocation of people, continued in many regions of Portuguese Africa until it was finally abolished in 1961.

===Post-World War II===
In the late 1950s, the [[Military of Portugal|Portuguese Armed Forces]] saw themselves confronted with the paradox generated by the dictatorial regime of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' that had been in power since 1926: on the one hand, the policy of Portuguese neutrality in World War II placed the Portuguese Armed Forces out of the way of a possible [[Cold war|East-West conflict]]; on the other hand, the regime felt the increased responsibility of keeping Portugal's vast overseas territories under control and protecting the citizenry there. Portugal joined [[NATO]] as a founding member in 1949, and was integrated within the various fledgling military commands of NATO.

NATO's focus on preventing a conventional Soviet attack against Western Europe was to the detriment of military preparations against guerrilla uprisings in Portugal's overseas provinces that were considered essential for the survival of the nation. The integration of Portugal in NATO resulted in the formation of a military élite that were critical in the planning and implementation of operations during the Overseas War. This &quot;NATO generation&quot; ascended quickly to the highest political positions and military command without having to provide evidence of loyalty to the regime.

The Colonial War established a split between the military structure—heavily influenced by the western powers with democratic governments—and the political power of the regime. Some analysts see the &quot;[[Botelho Moniz coup]]&quot; (also known as ''A Abrilada'') against the Portuguese government and backed by the U.S. administration,&lt;ref name=&quot;US involvement&quot;&gt;{{pt icon}} Luís Nuno Rodrigues [http://www.ipri.pt/investigadores/artigo.php?idi=8&amp;ida=140 &quot;Orgulhosamente Sós&quot;? Portugal e os Estados Unidos no início da década de 1960 - At the 22nd Meeting of History teachers of the Centro (region), Caldas da Rainha, April 2004], Instituto de Relações Internacionais (International Relations Institute)&lt;/ref&gt; as the beginning of this rupture, the origin of a lapse on the part of the regime to keep up a unique command center, an armed force prepared for threats of conflict in the colonies. This situation caused, as would be verified later, a lack of coordination between the three general staffs ([[Portuguese Army|Army]], [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]]).

The United States supported the Union of Peoples of Angola (UPA - ''União dos Povos de Angola''), headed by [[Holden Roberto]]. With this support, the [[Congo-Léopoldville]]-based UPA attacked Portuguese settlers and Africans living in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] from bases in the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} {{YouTube|2ZKylJoqq0U|A«GUERRA» 1º Episódio - &quot;Massacres da UPA&quot; - (Parte 1)}}, A Guerra by [[Joaquim Furtado]]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the African farm workers living in northern Angola worked under labor contracts that required seasonal relocation of workers from the desertified Southwest and [[Bailundo]] areas of Angola.  Photos of Africans killed by the UPA, which included photos of decapitated civilians, men, women and children of both white and black ethnicity, would later be displayed in the UN by Portuguese diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=100012 Angola discutida na Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas], a film of a Portuguese formal protest in the United Nations (March 1961), and an anti-American riot at Lisbon, guerracolonial.org&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of labor protests, attacks by newly organized guerrilla movements, and the [[Santa Maria hijacking]] by [[Henrique Galvão]] began a path to open warfare in Angola.

According to historical researchers like José Freire Antunes, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy&quot;&gt;A Guerra De Africa (1961–1974) by José Freire Antunes, Temas e Debates, ISBN 972-759-039-X (972-759-039-X)&lt;/ref&gt; sent a message to President [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] advising Portugal to abandon its African colonies shortly after the outbreak of violence in 1961. Instead, after a coup led by pro-U.S. forces failed to depose him, Salazar consolidated power and immediately sent reinforcements to the overseas territories, setting the stage for continued conflict in Angola. Similar scenarios would play out in other overseas Portuguese territories.

==Multiethnic societies, competing ideologies, and armed conflict in Portuguese Africa==
By the 1950s, the European [[mainland Portugal|mainland Portuguese territory]] was inhabited by a society that was poorer and had a much higher illiteracy rate than the average Western European societies or those of North America. It was ruled by an authoritarian and conservative right-leaning dictatorship, known as the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.  By this time, the Estado Novo regime ruled both the Portuguese mainland and several centuries-old overseas territories as theoretically co-equal departments. The possessions were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Macau]], [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]], [[São João Baptista de Ajudá]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]].

In reality, the relation of mainland Portuguese to their overseas possessions was that of colonial administrator to a subservient colony.  Political, legislative, administrative, commercial and other institutional relations between the colonies and Portugal-based individuals and organizations were numerous, though migration to, from, and between Portugal and its overseas departments was limited in size, due principally to the long distance and low annual income of the average Portuguese as well that of the indigenous overseas populations.

An increasing number of African anti-colonial movements called for total independence of the overseas African territories from Portugal.  Some, like the U.S.-backed UPA&lt;ref&gt;The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy Towards Angola Since 1945, George Wright, Pluto Press, 1997 - ISBN 0-7453-1029-X, 9780745310299&lt;/ref&gt; wanted national [[self-determination]], while others wanted a new form of government based on Marxist principles.  Portuguese leaders, including Salazar, attempted to stave off calls for independence by defending a policy of assimilation, multiracialism, and [[civilising mission]], or [[Lusotropicalism]], as a way of integrating Portuguese colonies, and their peoples, more closely with Portugal itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnard.edu/history/sample%20thesis/Fine%20thesis.pdf Colorblind Colonialism? Lusotropicalismo and Portugal’s 20th. Century Empire. in Africa.] Leah Fine. Barnard College Department of History, Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Portuguese ruling regime, the overseas empire was a matter of [[national interest]], to be preserved at all costs.  As far back as 1919, a Portuguese delegate to the International Labour Conference in Geneva declared: &quot;The assimilation of the so-called inferior races, by cross-breeding, by means of the Christian religion, by the mixing of the most widely divergent elements; freedom of access to the highest offices of state, even in Europe - these are the principles which have always guided Portuguese colonisation in Asia, in Africa, in the Pacific, and previously in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., ISBN 0-89388-072-8 (1974), pp. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the 1950s the policy of 'colorblind' access and mixing of races did not extend to all of Portugal's African territories, particularly Mozambique, where in tune with other minority white regimes of the day in southern Africa, the territory was segregated along racial lines.  Strict qualification criteria ensured that less than one per cent of black Mozambicans became full Portuguese citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Rupiya, Martin, ''[http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/mozambique/historical-context.php Historical context: war and peace in Mozambique]'', Conciliation Resources (1998), retrieved 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Settlement subsidies ===

Numerous subsidies were offered by the Estado Novo regime to those Portuguese who agreed to settle in Angola or Mozambique, including a special premium for each Portuguese man who agreed to marry an African woman.&lt;ref&gt;Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., ISBN 0-89388-072-8 (1974), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Salazar himself was fond of restating the old Portuguese policy maxim that any indigenous resident of Portugal's African territories was in theory eligible to become a member of Portuguese government, even its President.  In practice, this never took place, though trained black Africans living in Portugal's overseas African possessions were allowed to occupy positions in a variety of areas including the military, the civil service, the clergy, education, and private [[business]] - providing they had the requisite education and technical skills.

While access to basic, secondary and technical education remained poor until the 1960s, a few Africans were able to attend schools locally or in some cases in Portugal itself.  This resulted in the advancement of certain black Portuguese Africans who would become prominent individuals during the war and its aftermath, including [[Samora Machel]], [[Mário Pinto de Andrade]], [[Marcelino dos Santos]], [[Eduardo Mondlane]], [[Agostinho Neto]], [[Amílcar Cabral]], [[Jonas Savimbi]], [[Joaquim Chissano]], and [[Graça Machel]]. Two state-run universities were founded in Portuguese Africa in the 1962 by the Minister of the Overseas [[Adriano Moreira]] (the ''[[Universidade de Luanda]]'' in Angola and the ''[[Universidade de Lourenço Marques]]'' in Mozambique, awarding a range of degrees from engineering to medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/troy/4285/ensino52.html&amp;date=2009-10-24+21:17:49 52. UNIVERSIDADE DE LUANDA]&lt;/ref&gt;); however, most of their students came from Portuguese families living in the two territories). Several personalities in Portuguese society, including one of the most idolized sports stars in Portuguese football history, a black football player from [[Portuguese East Africa]] named [[Eusébio]], were other examples of efforts towards assimilation and multiracialism in the Post-World War II period.

According to Mozambican historian [[João Paulo Borges Coelho]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;African Troops in the Portuguese Colonial Army, 1961-1974: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique&lt;/ref&gt; the Portuguese colonial army was largely segregated along terms of race and ethnicity until 1960.  There were originally three classes of soldier in Portuguese overseas service: commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato). These categories were renamed to 1st, 2nd and 3rd class in 1960 - which effectively corresponded to the same categories. Later, after official discrimination based on skin colour was outlawed, some Portuguese commanders such as General [[António de Spínola]] began a process of ''Africanization'' of Portuguese forces fighting in Africa.  In Portuguese Guinea, this included a large increase in African recruitment along with the establishment of all-black military formations such as the ''Black Militias'' (''Milícias negras'') commanded by Major [[Carlos Fabião]] and the ''African Commando Battalion'' (''Batalhão de Comandos Africanos'') commanded by General [[Almeida Bruno]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 p. 340&quot;&gt;Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000), ISBN 972-46-1192-2, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

While black African soldiers constituted a mere 18% of the total number of troops fighting in Portugal's African territories in 1961, this percentage would rise dramatically over the next thirteen years, with black soldiers constituting over 50% of all government forces fighting in Africa by April 1974.  Coelho noted that perceptions of African soldiers varied a good deal among senior Portuguese commanders during the conflict in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. General [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]], perhaps the most successful counterinsurgency commander, sought good relations with local civilians and employed African units within the framework of an organized counter-insurgency plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coelho, João Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50&quot;&gt;Coelho, João Paulo Borges, ''African Troops in the Portuguese Colonial Army, 1961-1974: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique'', Portuguese Studies Review 10 (1) (2002), pp. 129-50&lt;/ref&gt;  General [[António de Spínola]], by contrast, appealed for a more political and psycho-social use of African soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coelho, João Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50&quot;/&gt;  On the other hand, General [[Kaúlza de Arriaga]], the most conservative of the three, appears to have doubted the reliability of African forces outside his strict control, while continuing to view African soldiers as inferior to Portuguese troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coelho, João Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaúlza de Arriaga (General), Lições de estratégia de curso de altos comandos - 1966/67 (Lessons Of Strategy in the Course of High Command - 1966/67), Vol. 12 (1971): As late as 1971, Kaúlza argued that the Portuguese government should tailor the social and political status progress of black Africans in Angola and Mozambique to the growth of the white settler population, while concluding that &quot;blacks are not highly intelligent, on the contrary, of all peoples of the world they are the least intelligent.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Native African troops, although widely deployed were initially employed in subordinate roles as enlisted troops or noncommissioned officers.  As the war went on, an increasing number of native Angolans rose to positions of command, though of junior rank. In the late 1950s, after 500 years of colonial rule, not only had Portugal failed to produce any native black governor, headmaster, police inspector, or professor, it had also failed to produce a single commander of senior commissioned rank in the overseas Army.  Here Portuguese colonial administrators fell victim to the legacy of their own discriminatory and limited polices in education, which largely barred indigenous black Africans from an equal and adequate education until well after the outbreak of the insurgency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humbaraci 1974 pp. 100-102&quot;&gt;Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., ISBN 0-89388-072-8 (1974), pp. 100-102&lt;/ref&gt;  With illiteracy rates approaching 99 per cent and almost no African enrollment in secondary schools,&lt;ref name=&quot;Humbaraci 1974 pp. 100-102&quot;/&gt;  few African candidates could qualify for Portugal's officer candidate programs; most African officers obtained their commission as the result of individual competence and valour on the battlefield.

Despite these handicaps, while the overwhelming majority of black or native African soldiers served in the enlisted ranks, an increasing percentage were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers by the 1970s, including such officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose to command from a first sergeant in a road engineering unit to a commander in the elite all-African ''Comandos Africanos'', where he eventually became one of the most-decorated soldiers in the Portuguese Army.

By the early 1970s, the Portuguese authorities had fully perceived racial discriminatory policies and lack of investment in education as wrong and contrary to their overseas ambitions in Portuguese Africa, and willingly accepted a true [[color blindness (race)|color blindness]] policy with more spending in education and training opportunities, which started to produce a larger number of black high ranked professionals, including military personnel.

After the World War II, as [[communist]] and [[anti-colonial]] ideologies spread across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of independence using various interpretations of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary ideology.  These new movements seized on anti-Portuguese and anti-colonial sentiment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 Independence redux in postsocialist Mozambique], Alice Dinerman&lt;/ref&gt; to advocate the complete overthrow of existing governmental structures in Portuguese Africa.  These Marxist movements alleged that Portuguese policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of the territories' ethnic Portuguese population at the expense of local tribal control, the development of native communities, and the majority of the indigenous population, who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure to comply with government policies largely imposed from Lisbon.  Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans.  Statistically, Portuguese Africa's white Portuguese population were indeed wealthier and more educated than the indigenous majority.

After conflict erupted between the UPA and MPLA and Portuguese military forces, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy&quot;/&gt; advised [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] (via the US consulate in Portugal) that Portugal should abandon Portugal's African colonies. A failed Portuguese military coup known as the ''Abrilada'', attempted in an effort to overthrow the authoritarian [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, received covert U.S support.&lt;ref name=&quot;US involvement&quot;/&gt;  In response, Salazar moved to consolidate his power, ordering an immediate military response to the violence occurring in Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 34&quot;&gt;Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war progressed, Portugal rapidly increased its [[mobilization|mobilized]] forces. Under the Salazar regime, a military draft required all males to serve three years of obligatory military service; many of those called up to active military duty were deployed to combat zones in Portugal's African overseas provinces.  The national service period was increased to four years in 1967, and virtually all conscripts faced a mandatory two-year tour of service in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 34&quot; /&gt;  The existence of the draft and likelihood of combat in African counterinsurgency operations would over time result in a sharp increase in emigration by Portuguese men seeking to avoid such service.  By the end of the Portuguese colonial war in 1974, black African participation had become crucial due to declining numbers of recruits available from Portugal itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;the war was won&quot;/&gt;

While Portuguese forces had all but won the guerrilla war in Angola, and had stalemated FRELIMO in Mozambique, colonial forces were forced on the defensive in Guinea, where PAIGC forces had carved out a large area of the rural countryside under effective insurgent control, using Soviet-supplied AA cannon and ground-to-air missiles to protect their encampments from attack by Portuguese air assets.&lt;ref&gt;Chilcote, Ronald H., ''The Struggle for Guinea-Bissau'', Indiana University Press: Africa Today (July 1974), pp. 57-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dos Santos 2009&quot;&gt;Dos Santos, Manuel, ''Disparar os Strela'', Depoimentos, Quinta-feira, 28 de Maio de 2009, retrieved 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the increasing success of Portuguese counterinsurgency operations and the inability or unwillingness of guerrilla forces to destroy the economy of Portugal's African territories was seen as a victory for the Portuguese government policies.

The Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=44903 Cambridge Journals] N. McQueen, &quot;...strategic boost to the Soviet Union, which could seek naval facilities there after independence&quot;, Contemporary European History (1999), 8: 209-230 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; realising that military success by insurgents in Angola and Mozambique was becoming increasingly remote, shifted much of its military support to the PAIGC in Guinea, while increasing diplomatic efforts to isolate Portugal from the world community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cold War]] [[CNN]] Episode 17: Good guys, bad guys, [http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/17/documents/angola/ Cuba-Angola letters, 1975] Letter from Raúl Diaz Arguelles to [[Raúl Castro]], August 11, 1975 - &quot;In the course of this conversation, the Angolans complained about the paucity of aid from the socialist camp, and they pointed out that if the socialist camp does not help them, no one will, since they are the most progressive forces [in the country], whereas the imperialists, Mobutu and ... [one word sanitized] are helping the FNLA in every way possible. They also complained that the Soviet Union stopped aiding them in 1972 and that although it is now sending them weapons, the amount of assistance is paltry, given the enormity of the need. In general, he [Neto] wants to portray the situation in Angola as a crucial struggle between the two systems -- Imperialism and Socialism -- in order to receive the assistance of the entire socialist camp. We believe that he is right in this, because at this time the two camps in Angola are well defined, the FNLA and UNITA represent reaction and world imperialism and the Portuguese reactionaries, and the MPLA represents the progressive and nationalist forces...&quot;, [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of the socialist bloc in isolating Portugal diplomatically extended inside Portugal itself into the armed forces, where younger officers disenchanted with the Estado Novo regime and promotional opportunities began to identify ideologically with those calling for overthrow of the government and the establishment of a state based on Marxist principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;infiltrated communists&quot;&gt;Stewart Lloyd-Jones, [[ISCTE]] (Lisbon), [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/media/Textos/portugal-since-1974.pdf Portugal's history since 1974], &quot;The Portuguese Communist Party (PCP–Partido Comunista Português), which had courted and infiltrated the MFA from the very first days of the revolution, decided that the time was now right for it to seize the initiative. Much of the radical fervour that was unleashed following Spínola's coup attempt was encouraged by the PCP as part of their own agenda to infiltrate the MFA and steer the revolution in their direction.&quot;, Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1974, guerrilla operations in Angola and Mozambique had been reduced to sporadic ambush operations against the Portuguese in the rural countryside areas, far from the main centers of population.&lt;ref name=&quot;the war was won&quot;/&gt; The only exception was [[Portuguese Guinea]], where PAIGC guerrilla operations, strongly supported by neighbouring allies like [[Guinea]] and [[Senegal]], were largely successful in liberating and securing large areas of Portuguese Guinea.  According some historians, Portugal recognized its inability to win the conflict in Guinea at the outset, but was forced to fight on to prevent an independent Guinea from serving as an inspirational model for insurgents in Angola and Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;NORRIE MACQUEEN, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=4D3D0B9D69C3D9A826A3E1B848F5E906.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=44903 Portugal's First Domino: ‘Pluricontinentalism’ and Colonial War in Guiné-Bissau, 1963–1974], &quot;Portugal's presence in Guiné-Bissau through eleven years of intense guerrilla war was justified by the doctrine of ‘[[pluricontinentalim]]’. In this view concession to nationalist pressure in one part of the ‘indivisible state’ would lead inevitably to the collapse of the whole. The defence of Portuguese Guiné, therefore, was the price to be paid for the maintenance of the infinitely more valuable territories of Angola and Mozambique. While the Salazar regime was rigid in its adherence to this doctrine, some movement was detectable under his successor from 1968, [[Marcelo Caetano]]. The governor-general in Guiné, General Spínola, was permitted to explore possibilities of negotiation. Politically insecure in the face of residual Salazarist power in the regime, however, Caetano abandoned this approach in 1972. This apparent loss of nerve would contribute to the overthrow of the Caetano government by its own military in 1974.&quot;, Contemporary European History (1999), 8: 209-230 [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continuing attacks by insurgent forces against targets throughout the Portuguese African territories, the economies of both Portuguese Angola and Mozambique had actually improved each year of the conflict, as had the economy of Portugal proper.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Lains, ''Instituto de Ciências Sociais'' ([[Lisbon University]]) [http://www.ics.ul.pt/publicacoes/workingpapers/wp2003/WP1-2003.pdf Catching up to the European core: Portuguese economic growth, 1910-1990]&lt;/ref&gt;  Angola enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom during the 1960s, and the Portuguese government built new transportation networks to link the well-developed and highly urbanized coastal strip with the remote inland regions of the territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 34&quot;/&gt;

The number of ethnic European Portuguese migrants from mainland Portugal (the ''[[metrópole]]'') continued to increase as well, though always constituting a small minority of each territory's total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/1878.html Testemunhos], Observatório da Emigração&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the costs of continuing the wars in Africa imposed a heavy burden on Portugal's resources; by the 1970s, the country was spending 40 per cent of its annual budget on the war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 34&quot;/&gt;

General Spínola was dismissed by Dr. [[Marcelo Caetano]], the last prime minister of Portugal under the Estado Novo regime, over the general's publicly announced desire to open negotiations with the PAIGC in Portuguese Guinea. The dismissal caused considerable public indignation in Portugal, and created favorable conditions for a military overthrow of the existing regime, which had lost all public support.  On 25 April 1974 a military coup organized by left-wing Portuguese military officers, the [[Movimento das Forças Armadas|Armed Forces Movement]] (MFA), overthrew the Estado Novo regime in what came to be known as the [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Lisbon]], Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;infiltrated communists&quot;/&gt;

The coup resulted in a period of economic collapse and political instability, but received general support from the public in its aim of ending the Portuguese war effort in Africa.  In the ex-colonies, officers suspected of sympathizing with the prior regime, even black officers, such as Captain Marcelino da Mata, were imprisoned and tortured, while African soldiers who had served in native Portuguese Army units were forced to petition for Portuguese citizenship or else face reprisals from their former enemies in Angola, Guinea, or Mozambique.

The Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974 came as a shock to the United States and other Western powers, as most analysts and the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration had concluded that Portuguese military success on the battlefield would resolve any political divisions within Portugal concerning the conduct of the war in Portuguese Africa, providing the conditions for US investment there.&lt;ref&gt;Tetteh Hormeku - Programme Officer with Third World Network's Africa Secretariat in Accra, Third World Resurgence No.89, January 1998, [http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/tett-cn.htm US intervention in Africa: Through Angolan eyes], &quot;Nixon's assumption that Portugal would be able to militarily contain Angolan nationalism and provide the conditions for US investment was unravelled with the 1974 coup in Portugal.&quot; Third World Network&lt;/ref&gt;  Most concerned was the apartheid government of [[South Africa]], which launched a deep border incursion operation into Angola to attack guerrilla-controlled areas of the country following the coup.

[[File:LocationAngola.svg|thumb|Map showing the location of [[Angola]] in modern-day Africa]]
On 3 January 1961 Angolan peasants in the region of [[Baixa de Cassanje]], [[Malanje Province|Malanje]], boycotted the Cotonang Company's cotton fields where they worked, demanding better working conditions and higher wages.  Cotonang, a company owned by Portuguese, British and German investors used native Africans to produce an annual cotton crop for export abroad.  The uprising, later to become known as the [[Baixa de Cassanje revolt]], was led by two previously unknown Angolans, António Mariano and Kulu-Xingu.&lt;ref&gt;George, Edward, ''The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965-1991'', New York: Frank Cass Publishing Co., ISBN 0-415-35015-8 (2005), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  During the protests, African workers burned their identification cards and attacked Portuguese traders.  The Portuguese Air Force responded to the rebellion by bombing twenty villages in the area, allegedly using [[napalm]] in an attack that resulted in some 400 indigenous Angolan deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, George, ''The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy Towards Angola Since 1945'', Pluto Press, ISBN 0-7453-1029-X, 9780745310299 (1997), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George, Edward, ''The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965-1991'', New York: Frank Cass Publishing Co., ISBN 0-415-35015-8 (2005) p. 9: Some sources state as many as 7,000 Angolans were killed in the air raids.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola]], the call for revolution was taken up by two insurgent groups, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]), and the União das Populações de Angola (UPA), which became the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) in 1962.  The MPLA commenced activities in an area of Angola known as the ''Zona Sublevada do Norte'' (ZSN or the Rebel Zone of the North), consisting of the provinces of Zaire, Uíge and Cuanza Norte.

On February 4, 1961, using arms largely captured from Portuguese soldiers and police&lt;ref name=&quot;Humbaraci 1974 p. 114&quot;&gt;Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., ISBN 0-89388-072-8 (1974), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; 250 MPLA guerrillas attacked the São Paulo fortress prison and police headquarters in Luanda in an attempt to free what it termed 'political prisoners'.  The attack was unsuccessful, and no prisoners were released, but seven Portuguese policemen and forty Angolans were killed, mostly MPLA insurgents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humbaraci 1974 p. 114&quot;/&gt;  Portuguese authorities responded with a sweeping counterinsurgency response in which over 5,000 Angolans were arrested, and a Portuguese mob raided the ''musseques'' (shanty towns) of Luanda, killing several dozen Angolans in the process.&lt;ref&gt;George, Edward, ''The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965-1991'', New York: Frank Cass Publishing Co., ISBN 0-415-35015-8 (2005) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 1961, the UPA led by [[Holden Roberto]] launched an incursion into the [[Bakongo]] region of northern Angola with 4,000-5,000 insurgents.  The insurgents called for local Bantu farmworkers and villagers to join them, unleashing an orgy of violence and destruction.  The insurgents attacked farms, government outposts, and trading centers, killing everyone they encountered, including women, children and newborns.&lt;ref name=&quot;esferadoslivros&quot;&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.esferadoslivros.pt/livros.php?id_li=%2086 Massacres em Africa], Felícia Cabrita (978-989-626-089-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

In surprise attacks, drunken and buoyed by belief in tribal spells that they believed made them immune to bullets, the attackers spread terror and destruction in the whole area.&lt;ref name=&quot;esferadoslivros&quot; /&gt;  At least 1,000 Portuguese settlers and an unknown but larger number of indigenous Angolans were killed by the insurgents during the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Frederick, ''A Certain Curve of Horn: The Hundred-Year Quest for the Giant Sable Antelope of Angola'', New York: Grove Press, ISBN 0-8021-4068-8 (2004), p. 143: Commenting on the incursion, Roberto said, &quot;This time the slaves did not cower. They massacred everything.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The violence of the uprising received worldwide press attention and engendered sympathy for the Portuguese, while adversely affecting the international reputation of Roberto and the UPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;George, Edward 2005 pp. 9-10&quot;&gt;George, Edward, ''The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965-1991'', New York: Frank Cass Publishing Co., ISBN 0-415-35015-8 (2005) pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portuguese response ====
[[File:Luanda,desfilemilitar.jpg|thumb|Portuguese military parade in Luanda, Angola.]]

In response, Portuguese Armed Forces instituted a harsh policy of reciprocity by torturing and massacring rebels and protesters. Some Portuguese soldiers decapitated rebels and impaled their heads on stakes, pursuing a policy of &quot;[[an eye for an eye]], a tooth for a tooth&quot;.  Much of the initial offensive operations against Angolan UPA and MPLA insurgents was undertaken by four companies of ''[[Special Operations Troops Centre#History|Caçadores Especiais]]'' (''Special Hunter'') troops skilled in light infantry and antiguerrilla tactics, and who were already stationed in Angola at the outbreak of fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000), ISBN 972-46-1192-2, pp. 94-97&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual Portuguese counterinsurgency commanders such as [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Fernando Robles]] of the ''6ª Companhia de Caçadores Especiais'' became well known throughout the country for their ruthlessness in hunting down insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} {{YouTube|CwrphTMWbuY|A «GUERRA» 3º Episódio - «Violência do lado Português»}}, A Guerra by [[Joaquim Furtado]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese Army steadily pushed the UPA back across the border into Congo-Kinshasa in a brutal counteroffensive that also displaced some 150,000 Bakongo refugees, taking control of Pedra Verde, the UPA's last base in northern Angola, on 20 September 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;George, Edward 2005 pp. 9-10&quot;/&gt;  Within the next few weeks Portuguese military forces pushed the MPLA out of Luanda northeast into the Dembos region, where the MPLA established the &quot;1st Military Region&quot;.  For the moment, the Angolan insurgency had been defeated, but new [[guerrilla]] attacks would later break out in other regions of Angola such as [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] province, the central plateaus, and eastern and southeastern Angola.

[[File:F.N.L.A. in Zaïre.jpg|thumb|left|Training of FNLA soldiers in Zaire]]
By most accounts, Portugal's counterinsurgency campaign in Angola was the most successful of all its campaigns in the Colonial War.&lt;ref name=&quot;the war was won&quot;/&gt;  Angola is a large territory, and the long distances from safe havens in neighboring countries supporting the rebel forces made it difficult for the latter to escape detection.  The distance from the major Angolan urban centers to the neighboring [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Zambia]] were so large that the eastern part of Angola's territory was known by the Portuguese as ''Terras do Fim do Mundo'' (the lands of the far side of the world).

Another factor was internecine struggles between three competing revolutionary movements - FNLA, MPLA, and UNITA - and their guerrilla armies.  For most of the conflict, the three rebel groups spent as much time fighting each other as they did fighting the Portuguese.  For example, during the 1961 ''Ferreira Incident'', a UPA patrol captured 21 MPLA insurgents as prisoners, then summarily executed them on 9 October, sparking open confrontation between the two insurgent groups.

Strategy also played a role, as a successful [[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] campaign led by General [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]] helped blunt the influence of the various revolutionary movements.  Finally, unlike other overseas possessions, Portuguese Angola was able to receive support from a local ally, in this case [[South Africa]].  South African military operations proved to be of significant assistance to Portuguese military forces in Angola, who sometimes referred to their South African counter-insurgent counterparts as ''primos'' (cousins).

Several unique counter-insurgency forces were developed and deployed in the campaign in Angola:

* ''[[Parachute Troops School|Batalhões de Caçadores Pára-quedistas]]'' (Paratrooper Hunter Battalions): employed throughout the conflicts in Africa, were the first forces to arrive in Angola when the war began
* ''Comandos'' ([[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]]): born out of the war in Angola, and later used in Guinea and Mozambique
* ''Caçadores Especiais'' ([[Special Operations Troops Centre#History|Special Hunters]]): were in Angola from the start of the conflict in 1961
* ''Fiéis'' (Faithfuls): a force composed by [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] exiles, black soldiers that opposed the rule of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in Congo-Kinshasa
* ''Leais'' (Loyals): a force composed by exiles from [[Zambia]], black soldiers that were against [[Kenneth Kaunda]]
* ''Grupos Especiais'' ([[Special Groups (Portugal)|Special Groups]]): units of volunteer black soldiers that had commando training; also used in Mozambique
* ''Tropas Especiais'' (Special Troops): the name of Special Forces Groups in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]]
* ''[[Flechas]]'' (Arrows): a successful indigenous formation of scouts, controlled by Portugal's International and State Defence Police ([[PIDE|PIDE/DGS]], and composed by [[Bushmen]] that specialized in tracking, reconnaissance and [[False flag#Pseudo-operations|pseudo-terrorist operations]].  Also employed in Mozambique, the ''Flechas'' inspired the formation of the Rhodesian [[Selous Scouts]].
* ''Grupo de Cavalaria Nº1'' (1st Cavalry Group): a mounted cavalry unit, armed with the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|7.62 mm Espingarda m/961]] rifle and the m/961 [[Walther P38]] pistol, tasked with reconnaissance and [[patrolling]].  The 1st was also known as the &quot;[[Angolan Dragoons]]&quot; (''Dragões de Angola''). The Rhodesians would also later develop a similar concept of horse-mounted counter-insurgency forces, forming the [[Grey's Scouts]].
* ''Batalhão de Cavalaria 1927'' (1927 Cavalry Battalion): a [[tank]] unit equipped with the [[Stuart tank|M5A1 tank]].  The battalion was used for supporting infantry forces and as a [[rapid reaction force]].

===Portuguese Guinea===
{{Main|Guinea-Bissau War of Independence}}
[[File:LocationGuineaBissau.svg|thumb|[[Guinea-Bissau]], formerly Portuguese Guinea, on a map of Africa]]
In [[Portuguese Guinea]] (also referred to as Guinea at that time), the [[Marxist]] [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) started fighting in January 1963.  Its [[guerrilla]] fighters attacked the Portuguese headquarters in [[Tite (Guinea-Bissau)|Tite]], located to the south of [[Bissau]], the capital, near the Corubal river. Similar actions quickly spread across the entire colony, requiring a strong response from the Portuguese forces.

The war in Guinea has been termed &quot;Portugal's Vietnam&quot;. The PAIGC was well-trained, well-led, and equipped and received substantial support from safe havens in neighboring countries like [[Senegal]] and the Republic of [[Guinea]] (Guinea-Conakry). The jungles of Guinea and the proximity of the PAIGC's allies near the border proved to be of significant advantage in providing tactical superiority during cross-border attacks and resupply missions for the guerrillas.
The conflict in Portuguese Guinea involving the PAIGC guerrillas and the [[Portuguese Army]] would prove the most intense and damaging of all conflicts in the Portuguese Colonial War, blocking Portuguese attempts to pacify the disputed territory via new economic and socioeconomic policies that had been applied with some success in [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]].  In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of Guinea; that year, the PAIGC carried out attacks in the north of the territory where at the time only the Front for the Liberation and Independence of Guinea (FLING), a minor insurgent group, was active. By this time, the PAIGC had begun to openly receive military support from [[Cuba]], [[China]] and the Soviet Union.

In Guinea, the success of PAIGC guerrilla operations put Portuguese armed forces on the defensive, forcing them to limit their response to defending territories and cities already held.  Unlike Portugal's other African territories, successful small-unit Portuguese counterinsurgency tactics were slow to evolve in Guinea.  Defensive operations, where soldiers were dispersed in small numbers to guard critical buildings, farms, or infrastructure were particularly devastating to the regular Portuguese infantry, who became vulnerable to guerrilla attacks outside of populated areas by the forces of the PAIGC. They were also demoralized by the steady growth of PAIGC liberation sympathizers and recruits among the rural population.  In a relatively short time, the PAIGC had succeeded in reducing Portuguese military and administrative control of the territory to a relatively small area of Guinea.  The scale of this success can be seen in the fact that native Guineans in the 'liberated territories' ceased payment of debts to Portuguese landowners and the payment of taxes to the colonial administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144&quot;&gt;Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., ISBN 0-89388-072-8 (1974), pp. 140-144&lt;/ref&gt;  The branch stores of the ''Companhia União Fabril'' (CUF), ''Mario Lima Whanon'', and ''Manuel Pinto Brandão'' companies were seized and inventoried by the PAIGC in the areas they controlled, while the use of Portuguese currency in the areas under guerrilla control was banned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144&quot;/&gt;  In order to maintain the economy in the liberated territories, the PAIGC established its own administrative and governmental bureaucracy at an early stage, which organized agricultural production, educated PAIGC farmworkers on how to protect crops from destruction from aerial attack by the Portuguese Air Force, and opened ''armazens do povo'' (people's stores) to supply urgently needed tools and supplies in exchange for agricultural produce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144&quot;/&gt;

In 1968, General [[António de Spínola]], the Portuguese general responsible for the Portuguese military operations in Guinea, was appointed as governor.  General Spínola began a series of civil and military reforms designed to weaken PAIGC control of the Guinea and rollback insurgent gains. This included a 'hearts and minds' propaganda campaign designed to win the trust of the indigenous population, an effort to eliminate some of the discriminatory practices against native Guineans, a massive construction campaign for public works including new schools, hospital, an improved telecommuncations and road network, and a large increase in recruitment of native Guineans into the Portuguese armed forces serving in Guinea as part of an ''Africanization'' strategy.

[[File:Portuguese paratrooper holding MG-42.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|Portuguese paratrooper holding an MG 42, Portuguese Guinea, 1972]]
Until 1960, Portuguese military forces serving in Guinea were composed of units led by white officers, with commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato) serving in the enlisted ranks.  General Spínola's Africanization policy eliminated these discriminatory colour bars, and called for the integration of indigenous Guinea Africans into Portuguese military forces in Africa.  Two special indigenous African counterinsurgency detachments were formed by the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]].  The first of these was the African Commandos (''Comandos Africanos''), consisting of a battalion of [[Comandos|commando]]s composed entirely of black soldiers (including the officers).  The second was the African Special Marines (''Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos''), [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marine]] units entirely composed of black soldiers.  The African Special Marines supplemented other Portuguese elite units conducting amphibious operations in the riverine areas of Guinea in an attempt to interdict and destroy guerrilla forces and supplies.  General Spínola's Africanization policy also fostered a large increase in indigenous recruitment into the armed forces, culminating the establishment of all-black military formations such as the Black Militias (''Milícias negras'') commanded by Major [[Carlos Fabião]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 p. 340&quot;/&gt;  By the early 1970s, an increasing percentage of Guineans were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers in Portuguese military forces in Africa, including such higher-ranking officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose from a first sergeant in a road engineering unit to a commander in the ''Comandos Africanos''.

During the latter part of the 1960s, military tactical reforms instituted by Gen. Spínola began to improve Portuguese counterinsurgency operations in Guinea.  Naval amphibious operations were instituted to overcome some of the mobility problems inherent in the underdeveloped and marshy areas of the territory, utilizing ''[[Portuguese Marine Corps|Destacamentos de Fuzileiros Especiais (DFE)]]'' (special marine assault detachments) as strike forces.  The ''Fuzileiros Especiais'' were lightly equipped with folding-stock m/961 (G3) rifles, 37mm rocket launchers, and light machine guns such as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK21]] to enhance their mobility in the difficult, swampy terrain.

[[File:PAIGC posto de controlo.jpg|thumb|A PAIGC checkpoint in 1974]]
Portugal commenced ''Operação Mar Verde'' or ''[[Operation Green Sea]]'' on 22 November 1970 in an attempt to overthrow [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], the leader of the Guinea-Conakry and staunch PAIGC ally, to capture the leader of the PAIGC, [[Amílcar Cabral]],  and to cut off supply lines to PAIGC insurgents.  The operation involved a daring raid on [[Conakry]], a PAIGC safe haven, in which 400 Portuguese ''Fuzileiros'' (amphibious assault troops) attacked the city.  The attempted [[coup d'état]] failed, though the Portuguese managed to destroy several PAIGC ships and free hundreds of Portuguese [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) at several large POW camps.  One immediate result of ''Operation Green Sea'' was an escalation in the conflict, with countries such as [[Algeria]] and [[Nigeria]] now offering support to the PAIGC as well as the [[Soviet Union]], which sent warships to the region (known by NATO as the ''West Africa Patrol'') in a show of force calculated to deter future Portuguese amphibious attacks on the territory of the Guinea-Conakry. The [[United Nations]] passed several resolutions condemning cross-border attacks of the Portuguese military against the PAIGC guerrilla bases in both neighboring Guinea-Conakry and Senegal, like the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 290]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 294]] and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 295]].

Between 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces increased their offensive posture, in the form of raids into PAIGC-controlled territory.  At this time Portuguese forces also adopted unorthodox means of countering the insurgents, including attacks on the political structure of the nationalist movement. This strategy culminated in the assassination of Amílcar Cabral in January 1973. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to increase its strength, and began to heavily press Portuguese defense forces. This became even more apparent after the PAIGC received heavy radar-guided [[anti-aircraft weapons|anti-aircraft cannon]] and other AA munitions provided by the Soviets, including [[SA-7]] shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, all of which seriously impeded Portuguese air operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dos Santos 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chilcote, Ronald H., ''The Struggle for Guinea-Bissau'', ''Africa Today'', July 197), pp. 57-61&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Carnation Revolution]] military coup in [[Lisbon]] on 25 April 1974, the new revolutionary leaders of Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in [[Algiers]], Algeria in which Portugal agreed to remove all troops by the end of October and to officially recognize the [[Republic of Guinea-Bissau]] government controlled by the PAIGC, on 26 August 1974 and after a series of diplomatic meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22&quot;&gt;Lloyd-Jones, Stewart, and Costa Pinto, António, ''The last empire: thirty years of Portuguese decolonization'', Portland, Oregon: Intellect Books, ISBN 1-84150-109-3, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Demobilized by the departing Portuguese military authorities after the independence of Portuguese Guinea had been agreed, a total of 7,447 black Guinea-Bissauan African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the PAIGC after the independence of the new African country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PAIGC, Jornal Nô Pintcha, 29 November 1980: In a statement in the party newspaper '' Nô Pintcha'' (''In the Vanguard''), a spokesman for the PAIGC revealed that many of the ex-Portuguese indigenous African soldiers that were executed after cessation of hostilities were buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of [[Cumerá]], [[Portogole]], and [[Mansabá]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Munslow, Barry 1981 pp. 109-113&quot;&gt;Munslow, Barry, ''The 1980 Coup in Guinea-Bissau'', Review of African Political Economy, No. 21 (May - Sep., 1981), pp. 109-113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozambique===
[[File:LocationMozambique.svg|thumb|[[Mozambique]] within modern-day Africa]]
{{Main|Mozambican War of Independence}}
The Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]] was the last territory to start the war of liberation.  Its nationalist movement was led by the [[Marxist-Leninist]] Liberation Front of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]), which carried out the first attack against Portuguese targets on September 24, 1964, in [[Chai, Mozambique|Chai]], [[Cabo Delgado Province]].  The fighting later spread to [[Niassa]], [[Tete]] in central Mozambique. A report from Battalion No. 558 of the Portuguese army makes references to violent actions, also in Cabo Delgado, on August 21, 1964.

On November 16 of the same year, the Portuguese troops suffered their first losses fighting in the north of the territory, in the region of [[Xilama]].  By this time, the size of the guerrilla movement had substantially increased; this, along with the low numbers of Portuguese troops and colonists, allowed a steady increase in FRELIMO's strength.  It quickly started moving south in the direction of [[Meponda]] and [[Mandimba]], linking to Tete with the aid of [[Malawi]].

Until 1967 the FRELIMO showed less interest in Tete region, putting its efforts on the two northernmost districts of Mozambique where the use of [[landmines]] became very common. In the region of [[Niassa]], FRELIMO's intention was to create a free corridor to [[Zambezia Province]]. Until April 1970, the military activity of FRELIMO increased steadily, mainly due to the strategic work of [[Samora Machel]] in the region of [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]].

[[Rhodesia]] was involved in the war in Mozambique, supporting the Portuguese troops in operations and conducting operations independently. By 1973, the territory was mostly under Portuguese control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portuguese Mozambique development&quot;&gt;[[Kaúlza de Arriaga]] (General), [http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/desenvol.html O DESENVOLVIMENTO DE MOÇAMBIQUE E A PROMOÇÃO DAS SUAS POPULAÇÕES - SITUAÇÃO EM 1974]&lt;/ref&gt; The Operation &quot;''Nó Górdio''&quot; ([[Gordian Knot Operation]]) - conducted in 1970 and commanded by Portuguese Brigadier General [[Kaúlza de Arriaga]] - a conventional-style operation to destroy the guerrilla bases in the north of Mozambique, was the major military operation of the Portuguese Colonial War. A hotly disputed issue, the Gordian Knot Operation was considered by several historians and military strategists as a failure that worsened the situation for the Portuguese. Others did not share this view, including its main architect,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/sucesso.html Sucesso], selected texts of Brigadier General [[Kaúlza de Arriaga]] on the military success of the Portuguese military&lt;/ref&gt; troops, and officials who had participated on both sides of the operation, including high ranked elements from the FRELIMO guerrillas. It was also described as a tremendous success of the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} ''&quot;De acordo com as afirmações posteriormente produzidas por representantes qualificados da FRELIMO, este juízo da situação militar de Moçambique carecia de fundamento. Segundo esses representantes, a FRELIMO atravessara duas fases críticas: em 1970, estivera à beira do colapso no final da operação &quot;Nó Górdio&quot;, devido ao volumoso número de baixas sofridas, e, em 1974, quando do desencadeamento da &quot;Revolução de Abril&quot;, atravessava uma fase grave de desmoralização, motivada por dificuldades insuperáveis de recompletamento de efectivos, cansaço e hostilidade das populações, o que os levou a afirmar que a &quot;Revolução de Abril&quot; tinha apanhado a FRELIMO em fase crítica de desequilíbrio e que esta devia exclusivamente ao MFA a sua recuperação.&quot;'', Arriaga on the book &quot;PAÍS SEM RUMO&quot;, by [[António de Spínola]], [http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/Spinola.html], selected texts by [[Kaúlza de Arriaga]]&lt;/ref&gt; Arriaga, however, was removed from his powerful military post in Mozambique by [[Marcelo Caetano]] shortly before the events in Lisbon that would trigger the end of the war and the independence of the Portuguese territories in Africa. The reason for Arriaga's abrupt fate was an alleged incident with indigenous civilian populations, and the Portuguese government's suspicion that Arriaga was planning a military coup against Marcelo's administration in order to avoid the rise of leftist influences in Portugal and the loss of the African overseas provinces.

The construction of the [[Cahora Bassa]] Dam tied up nearly 50 percent of the Portuguese troops in Mozambique, and brought the FRELIMO to the [[Tete Province]], closer to some cities and more populated areas in the south. The FRELIMO failed, however, to halt the construction of the dam. In 1974, the FRELIMO launched mortar attacks against Vila Pery (now [[Chimoio]]), an important city and the first (and only) heavy populated area to be hit by the FRELIMO.

In Mozambique special units were also used by the Portuguese Armed Forces:

* ''Grupos Especiais'' (Special Groups): locally raised counter-insurgency troops similar to those used in Angola
* ''Grupos Especiais Pára-Quedistas'' (Paratrooper Special Groups): units of volunteer black soldiers that were given airborne training
* ''Grupos Especiais de Pisteiros de Combate'' (Combat Tracking Special Groups): special units trained in tracking and locating guerrillas forces
* ''[[Flechas]]'' (Arrows), a formation of indigenous scouts and trackers, similar to the one employed in Angola

===Major counter-insurgency operations===
*1970 - [[Gordian Knot Operation]] (''Operação Nó Górdio'')
*1970 - [[Operation Green Sea]] (''Operação Mar Verde'')
*1971 - [[Frente Leste]]

===Role of the Organisation of African Unity===
The [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) was founded May 1963. Its basic principles were co-operation between African nations and solidarity between African peoples. Another important objective of the OAU was an end to all forms of colonialism in Africa. This became the major objective of the organization in its first years and soon OAU pressure led to the situation in the Portuguese colonies being brought up at the [[UN Security Council]].

The OAU established a committee based in [[Dar es Salaam]], with representatives from [[Ethiopia]], [[Algeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Egypt]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zaire]], [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], [[Nigeria]], to support African liberation movements. The support provided by the committee included military training and weapon supplies.

The OAU also took action in order to promote the international acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE), composed by the FNLA. This support was transferred to the MPLA and to its leader, [[Agostinho Neto]] in 1967. In November 1972, both movements were recognized by the OAU in order to promote their merger. After 1964, the OAU recognized PAIGC as the legitimate representatives of Guinea-Bissau and [[Cape Verde]] and in 1965 recognised FRELIMO for Mozambique.

==Armament and tactics==

=== Portugal ===
In 1961 the Portuguese had 79,000 in arms—58,000 in the Army, 8,500 in the Navy and 12,500 in the Air force (Cann, 1997). These numbers grew quickly. By the end of the conflict in 1974, due to the [[Carnation Revolution]] (a military coup in Lisbon), the total in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] had risen to 217,000.

Prior to their own Colonial War the Portuguese military had studied French and British efforts in Indo-China, Algeria and Malaya (Cann, 1997). Based on their analysis of operations in those theatres and considering their own situation in Africa, the Portuguese military took the unusual decision to restructure their entire armed forces, from top to bottom, for [[counterinsurgency]]. This transformation did, however, take seven years to complete and only took its final form in 1968. By 1974, the counterinsurgency efforts were successful in the Portuguese territories of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], but in [[Portuguese Guinea]] the local guerrillas were making progress. As the conflict escalated, the Portuguese authorities developed progressively tougher responses, these included the [[Gordian Knot Operation]] and the [[Operation Green Sea]].

When conflict erupted in 1961, Portuguese forces were badly equipped to cope with the demands of a counter-insurgency conflict. It was standard procedure, up to that point, to send the oldest and most obsolete material to the colonies. Thus, initial military operations were conducted using World War II radios, the old m/937 7.92mm [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser]] rifle, and the equally elderly German m/938 7.92mm ([[MG 13]]) Dreyse and Italian [[8×59mm RB Breda|8×59mm RB]] m/938 ([[Breda M37]]) machine guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 17&quot;&gt;Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Portugal's older small arms came from Germany in various deliveries made mostly before World War II.  Later, Portugal purchased arms and military equipment from France, West Germany, South Africa, and to a lesser extent, from Belgium, [[Israel]] and the U.S.A.
[[File:G3a3.gif|300px|right|thumb|A Portuguese version of [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|Heckler &amp; Koch G3A3]] was used as the standard infantry weapon for most of Portugal's forces. It would be produced in large quantities in the [[Fábrica do Braço de Prata]] small arms plant.]]
Within a short time, the [[Portuguese Army]] saw the need for a modern [[battle rifle|selective-fire combat rifle]], and in 1961 adopted the [[7.62×51mm NATO]] caliber ''Espingarda m/961'' ([[Heckler &amp; Koch G3]]) as the standard infantry weapon for most of its forces, that would be produced in large quantities in the [[Fábrica do Braço de Prata]], a Portuguese small arms producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 pp. 358-359&quot;&gt;Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), ISBN 972-46-1192-2, pp. 358-359&lt;/ref&gt;  However, quantities of the 7.62×51mm [[FN FAL|FN]] and German [[FN FAL|G1]] FAL battle rifle, known as the m/962, were also issued; the FAL was a favored weapon of members serving in elite commando units such as the ''Caçadores Especiais''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 pp. 358-359&quot;/&gt;  At the beginning of the war, the elite [[Parachute Troops School|airborne units]] (''Caçadores Pára-quedistas'') rarely used the m/961, having adopted the modern 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm NATO [[ArmaLite]] [[AR-10]] (produced by the Netherlands-based arms manufacturer Artillerie Inrichtingen) in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Pikula, Sam (Major), ''The ArmaLite AR-10'', Regnum Fund Press (1998), ISBN 9986-494-38-9, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000), ISBN 972-46-1192-2, pp. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;  In the days before attached grenade launchers became standard, Portuguese paratroopers frequently resorted to the use of [[ENERGA anti-tank rifle grenade]]s fired from their AR-10 rifles.  Some Portuguese-model AR-10s were fitted with A.I.-modified upper receivers in order to mount 3× or 3.6× telescopic sights.&lt;ref&gt;Pikula, Sam (Major), ''The ArmaLite AR-10'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; These rifles were used by marksmen accompanying small patrols to eliminate individual enemy at extended ranges in open country.&lt;ref&gt;Pikula, Sam (Major), ''The ArmaLite AR-10'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Netherlands embargoed further sales of the AR-10, the paratroop battalions were issued a collapsible-stock version of the regular m/961 (G3) rifle, also in 7.62×51mm NATO caliber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 pp. 183-184&quot;&gt;Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), ISBN 972-46-1192-2, pp. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;

The powerful recoil and heavy weight of the 7.62mm NATO cartridge used in Portuguese rifle-caliber arms such as the m/961 limited the amount of ammunition that could be carried as well as accuracy in automatic fire, generally precluding the use of the latter except in emergencies.  Instead, most infantryman used their rifles to fire individual shots.  While the heavy m/961 and its relatively lengthy barrel were well-suited to patrol operations in open savannah, it tended to put Portuguese infantry at a disadvantage when clearing the low-ceilinged interiors of native buildings or huts, or when moving through thick bush, where ambush by a concealed insurgent with an automatic weapon was always a possibility.  In these situations the hand grenade often became a more useful weapon than the rifle. Spanish rifle grenades were sourced from [[Instalaza]], but in due course, the [[Dilagrama m/65]] was more commonly used, utilising a derivative of the [[M26 grenade]] made under licence by [[INDEP]], the M312.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://aquellasarmasdeguerra.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/algunas-armas-utilizadas-en-la-guerra-colonial-portuguesa-1961-1974/ | title=Algunas armas utilizadas en la guerra Colonial Portuguesa 1961-1974 | date=4 June 2012 | accessdate=4 May 2016 | language =Spanish |trans-title=Some weapons used in the Portuguese Colonial War 1961-1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[general purpose machine gun]] role, the German [[MG42]] in 8mm and later 7.62mm NATO caliber was used until 1968, when the 7.62mm [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK21|m/968 Metralhadora Ligeira]] became available.  Some [[9×19mm Parabellum|9×19mm]] [[submachine gun]]s, including the Austrian Steyr [[MP 34]] m/942, the Portuguese [[FBP submachine gun|FBP m/948]], and the Israeli [[Uzi|Uzi submachine gun]] were also used, mainly by officers, horse-mounted cavalry, reserve and paramilitary units, and security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 17&quot;/&gt;

To destroy enemy emplacements, other weapons were employed, including the 37&amp;nbsp;mm (1.46&amp;nbsp;in), 60&amp;nbsp;mm (2.5&amp;nbsp;in), and 89&amp;nbsp;mm (3.5 in.) ''Lança-granadas-foguete'' ([[Bazooka]]), along with several types of recoilless rifles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 pp. 183-184&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 18&quot;&gt;Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the mobile nature of counterinsurgency operations, heavy support weapons were less frequently used.  However, the m/951 12.7mm ([[12 mm caliber|.50 caliber]]) U.S. [[M2 Browning]] heavy machine gun was used in ground and vehicle mounts, as were 60mm, 81mm, and later, 120mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 18&quot;/&gt;  Artillery and mobile [[howitzer]]s were used in a few operations.

Mobile ground operations consisted of patrol sweeps by armored car and reconnaissance vehicles.  Supply convoys used both armored and unarmored vehicles.  Typically, armored vehicles would be placed at the front, center, and tail of a motorized convoy.  Several [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s were used, including the [[Panhard AML]], [[Panhard EBR]], [[Fox Armoured Car|Fox]] and (in the 1970s) the [[Bravia Chaimite|Chaimite]].

[[File:Fiat G91.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Portuguese Airforce employed [[Fiat G.91]] aircraft like this in the Portuguese Colonial War.]]
Unlike the [[Vietnam War]], Portugal's limited national resources did not allow for widespread use of the [[helicopter]]. Only those troops involved in [[Coup de main|coups de main]] attacks (called ''golpe de mão'' in Portuguese)—mainly [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] and Paratroopers—would deploy by helicopter. Most deployments were either on foot or in vehicles ([[Berliet]] and [[Unimog]] trucks).  The helicopters were reserved for support (in a [[gunship]] role) or [[Medical evacuation|medical evacuation (MEDEVAC)]]. The [[Aérospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] was the most widely used helicopter, although the [[Aérospatiale Puma|Puma]] was also used with great success. Other aircraft were employed: for [[air support]] the [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texan]], the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] and the [[Fiat G.91]] were used, along with a quantity of [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invaders]] covertly acquired in 1965; for [[reconnaissance]] the [[Dornier Do 27]] was employed. In the transport role, the [[Portuguese Air Force]] originally used the [[Junkers Ju 52]], followed by the [[Nord Noratlas]], the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymaster]], and the [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] (all of these aircraft were also used for Paratroop drop operations). From 1965, [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] began to purchase the Fiat G.91 to deploy to its African overseas territories of [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] in the close-support role.&lt;ref name=&quot;nicollip174&quot;&gt;Nicolli 2003, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; The first 40 G.91 were purchased second-hand from the [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]], aircraft that had been produced for Greece and which differed from the rest of the Luftwaffe G.91s enough to create maintenance problems. The aircraft replaced the Portuguese F-86 Sabre.

The [[Portuguese Navy]] (particularly the [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marines]], known as Fuzileiros) made extensive use of patrol boats, [[landing craft]], and [[Zodiac Group|Zodiac]] [[inflatable boat]]s. They were employed especially in Guinea, but also in the [[Congo River]] (and other smaller rivers) in Angola and in the [[Zambezi]] (and other rivers) in Mozambique.  Equipped with standard or collapsible-stock m/961 rifles, grenades, and other gear, they utilized small boats or patrol craft to infiltrate guerrilla positions.  In an effort to intercept infiltrators, the Fuzileiros even manned small patrol craft on [[Lake Malawi]].  The Navy also used Portuguese civilian [[Cruise ship|cruisers]] as troop transports, and drafted [[Portuguese Merchant Navy]] personnel to man ships carrying troops and material and into the Marines.

There were also many [[Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War]]; these included the [[Flechas]] and the Fiéis (Faithfuls).

Native black warriors were employed in Africa by the Portuguese colonial rulers since the 16th century. Portugal had employed regular native troops (''companhias indigenas'') in its colonial army since the early 19th century. After 1961, with the beginning of the colonial wars in its overseas territories, Portugal began to incorporate black Portuguese Africans into integrated units as part of the war effort in Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Mozambique, based on concepts of multi-racialism and preservation of the empire.  African participation on the Portuguese side of the conflict varied from marginal roles as laborers and informers to participation in highly trained operational combat units like the [[Flechas]]. As the war progressed, use of African counterinsurgency troops increased; on the eve of the [[Carnation Revolution|military coup of 25 April 1974]], black ethnic Africans accounted for more than 50 percent of Portuguese forces fighting the war.

From 1961 to the end of the Colonial War, the [[paratrooper]] [[nurse]]s nicknamed ''[[Maria (given name)|Marias]]'', were women who served the Portuguese armed forces being deployed in Portuguese Africa's dangerous guerrilla-infiltrated combat zones to perform [[rescue]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} {{YouTube|GBnrbRLOMlo|Enfermeiras Pára-Quesdistas}}, [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://greenberet.no.sapo.pt/enfermeira.htm enfermeiras], [[Green beret]], [[sapo.pt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. The later included [[International sanctions|UN-sponsored sanctions]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]]-led defamation, and myriad boycotts and protests performed by both foreign and domestic political organizations, like the clandestine [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (PCP). Near the end of the conflict, a report by the controversial priest [[Adrian Hastings]], alleging atrocities and war crimes of the Portuguese military, was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister [[Marcelo Caetano]] was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the [[Anglo-Portuguese alliance]] in 1973. Portugal's growing isolation following Hastings's claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the &quot;carnation revolution&quot; coup in Lisbon which deposed the Caetano regime in 1974, ending the Portuguese African counter-insurgency campaigns and triggering the rapid collapse of the [[Portuguese Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] (June 26, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guerrilla movements===
[[File:AK 47.JPG|thumb|200px|[[AK-47]] automatic rifles were widely used by the African guerrilla movements.]]
[[File:SKS Flickr.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifles]] were also utilised by guerrillas.]]
The armament of the nationalist groups came mainly from the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Eastern Europe. However, they also used small arms of U.S. manufacture (such as the .45 [[Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompson submachine gun]]), along with British, French, and German weapons came from neighboring countries sympathetic to the rebellion. Later in the war, most guerrillas would use roughly the same infantry rifles of Soviet origin: the [[Mosin–Nagant]] bolt-action rifle, the [[SKS]] carbine, and most importantly the [[AK-47]] series of [[7.62×39mm]] automatic rifle, or Kalashnikov. Rebel forces also made extensive use of machine guns for ambush and positional defense.

Rapid-fire arms in use with the insurgents included the [[7.62×54mmR]] [[Degtyaryov machine gun|DP-28]], the 7.62×39mm [[RPD machine gun]] (the most widely used of all), the [[7.92×57mm Mauser|8×57mm Mauser]] [[MG 34]] general-purpose machine gun, together with the [[12.7×108mm]] [[DShK]] and the 7.62×54mm [[SG-43 Goryunov]] heavy machine guns, [[7.62×25mm Tokarev|7.62×25mm]] [[PPSh-41]] and [[PPS submachine gun|PPS-43]], [[9×19mm Parabellum|9×19mm]] [[Sa vz. 23]], [[Sterling submachine gun|Sterling]], [[MP 40]], [[MAT-49]] [[submachine gun]] operation. Support weapons included mortars, [[recoilless rifle]]s, and in particular, Soviet-made rocket launchers, the [[RPG-2]] and [[RPG-7]]. [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft (AA) weapons]] were also employed, especially by the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] and the [[FRELIMO]]. The [[14.5×114mm]] [[ZPU]] AA cannon was the most widely used, but by far the most effective was the [[Strela 2]] missile, first introduced to guerrilla forces in Guinea in 1973 and in Mozambique the following year by Soviet technicians.

The guerrillas' AK-47 rifles and such variants were highly thought of by many Portuguese soldiers, as they were shorter, slightly lighter, and more mobile than the m/961 (G3), while permitting the user to deliver a heavy volume of controlled automatic fire at the close ranges typically encountered in bush warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267&quot;&gt;Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), ISBN 972-46-1192-2, pp. 266-267&lt;/ref&gt;  The AK-47's ammunition load was also lighter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267&quot;/&gt;  The average Angolan or Mozambican rebel could easily transport 150 7.62×39mm cartridges (five 30-round magazines) on his person during bush operations, compared to 100 7.62×51mm rounds (five 20-round magazines) typically carried by a Portuguese infantryman on patrol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267&quot;/&gt;  Though a common misconception holds that Portuguese soldiers used captured AK-47 type weapons, this was only true of a few elite units for special missions.  Like U.S. forces in Vietnam, ammunition resupply difficulties and the obvious danger of being mistaken for a guerrilla when firing an enemy weapon generally precluded their use.

[[Land mine|Mines]] and other [[booby trap]]s were one of the principal weapons used by the insurgents against Portuguese mechanized forces to great effect, who typically patrolled the mostly unpaved roads of their territories using motor vehicles and armored scout cars.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 23: It is estimated that mines planted by insurgents caused about 70 per cent of all Portuguese casualties.&lt;/ref&gt;   To counter the mine threat, Portuguese engineers commenced the herculean task of tarring the rural road network.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Mine detection was accomplished not only by electronic mine detectors, but also by employing trained soldiers (''picadors'') walking abreast with long probes to detect nonmetallic road mines.

Guerrillas in all the various revolutionary movements used a variety of mines, often combining [[Anti-tank mine|anti-tank]] with [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]] mines to ambush Portuguese formations with devastating results.  A common tactic was to plant large anti-vehicle mines in a roadway bordered by obvious cover, such as an irrigation ditch, then seed the ditch with anti-personnel mines.  Detonation of the vehicle mine would cause Portuguese troops to deploy and seek cover in the ditch, where the anti-personnel mines would cause further casualties.

If the insurgents planned to confront the Portuguese openly, one or two heavy machine guns would be sited to sweep the ditch and other likely areas of cover.  Other mines used included the [[PMN mine|PMN (Black Widow)]], [[TM-46 mine|TM-46]], and [[POMZ]]. Even amphibious mines were used such as the [[PDM series of amphibious mines|PDM]], along with numerous home-made antipersonnel wood box mines and other nonmetallic explosive devices.  The impact of mining operations, in addition to causing casualties, undermined the mobility of Portuguese forces, while diverting troops and equipment from security and offensive operations to convoy protection and mine clearance missions.

In general, the PAIGC in Guinea was the best armed, trained and led of all the guerrilla movements. By 1970, it even had candidates training in the Soviet Union, learning to fly [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] jets and to operate Soviet-supplied amphibious assault crafts and [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]].

==Opposition in Portugal==
The government presented as a general consensus that the colonies were a part of the national unity, closer to overseas provinces than to true colonies. The [[Communism|communists]] were the first party to oppose the official view, since they saw the Portuguese presence in the colonies as an act against the colonies' right to [[self determination]]. During its 5th Congress, in 1957, the illegal [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (''Partido Comunista Português'' - PCP) was the first political organization to demand the immediate and total independence of the colonies.

However, being the only truly organized opposition movement, the PCP had to play two roles. One role was that of a communist party with an anti-colonialist position; the other role was to be a cohesive force drawing together a broad spectrum of opposing parties. Therefore, it had to accede to views that didn't reflect its true anticolonial position.

Several opposition figures outside the PCP also had anticolonial opinions, such as the candidates to the fraudulent presidential elections, like [[Norton de Matos]] (in 1949), [[Quintão Meireles]] (in 1951) and [[Humberto Delgado]] (in 1958). The communist candidates had, obviously, the same positions. Among them were [[Rui Luís Gomes]] and [[Arlindo Vicente]], the first would not be allowed to participate in the election and the second would support Delgado in 1958.

After the electoral fraud of 1958, Humberto Delgado formed the [[Independent National Movement]] (''Movimento Nacional Independente'' - MNI) that, in October 1960, agreed that there was a need to prepare the people in the colonies, before giving them the right of self-determination. Despite this, no detailed policies for achieving this goal were set out.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In 1961, the nº8 of the ''Military Tribune'' had as its title &quot;''Let's end the war of Angola''&quot;. The authors were linked to the [[Patriotic Action Councils]] (''Juntas de Acção Patriótica'' - JAP), supporters of Humberto Delgado, and responsible for the attack on the [[barracks of Beja]]. The [[Portuguese Front of National Liberation]] (''Frente Portuguesa de Libertação Nacional'' - FPLN), founded in December 1962, attacked the conciliatory positions. The official feeling of the Portuguese state, despite all this, was the same: Portugal had inalienable and legitimate rights over the colonies and this was what was transmitted through the media and through the state propaganda.

In April 1964, the Directory of Democratic-Social Action (''Acção Democrato-Social'' - ADS) presented a political solution rather than a military one. In agreement with this initiative in 1966, [[Mário Soares]] suggested there should be a referendum on the overseas policy Portugal should follow, and that the referendum should be preceded by a national discussion to take place in the six months prior to the referendum.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The end of Salazar's rule in 1968, due to illness, did not prompt any change in the political panorama.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The radicalization of the opposition movements started with the younger people who also felt victimized by the continuation of the war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

=== Leftist activity in Portugal (early 1970s) ===

The universities played a key role in the spread of this position. Several magazines and newspapers were created, such as ''Cadernos Circunstância'', ''Cadernos Necessários'', ''Tempo e Modo'', and ''Polémica'' that supported this view. It was in this environment that the [[Armed Revolutionary Action]] (''Acção Revolucionária Armada'' - ARA), the armed branch of the Portuguese Communist Party created in the late 1960s, and the [[Revolutionary Brigades]] (''Brigadas Revolucionárias'' - BR), a left-wing organization, became an important{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} force of resistance against the war, carrying out multiple acts of sabotage and bombing against military targets.

The ARA began its military actions in October 1970, keeping them up until August 1972. The major actions were the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the [[NATO]] headquarters at [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in October of the same year. The BR, on its side, began armed actions on 7 November 1971, with the sabotage of the NATO base at [[Pinhal de Armeiro]], the last action being carried out 9 April 1974, against the [[Niassa]] ship which was preparing to leave Lisboa with troops to be deployed in [[Portuguese Guinea]]. The BR acted even in the colonies, placing a bomb in the Military Command of Bissau on 22 February 1974.

By the early 1970s, the Portuguese Colonial War raged on, consuming fully 40 percent of Portugal's annual budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 34&quot;/&gt;  The Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the human losses were relatively small, the war as whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated. It had a profound impact on Portugal - thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by emigrating illegally, mainly to France and the US.

The war in the Portuguese overseas territories of Africa was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people got weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African overseas territories were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. In addition, younger Portuguese military academy graduates resented a program introduced by [[Marcello Caetano]] whereby militia officers who completed a brief training program and had served in the overseas territories' defensive campaigns, could be commissioned at the same rank as military academy graduates.

Caetano's government had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened government budget. Thus, the group of revolutionary military insurgents started as a military professional class&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=movicapi Cronologia: Movimento dos capitães], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt; protest of [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] [[captain (land)|captains]] against a decree law: the ''Dec. Lei nº 353/73'' of 1973, organizing themselves in a loosely allied group known as the Movement of the Armed Forces ([[Movimento das Forças Armadas|MFA]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;{{pt icon}} {{YouTube|aJH2U8jmKmI|A Guerra Colonial na Guine/Bissau (07 de 07)}}, [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]] on the Decree Law, [[RTP 2]] television, [[youtube.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=otesacar Arquivo Electrónico: Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carnation Revolution (1974) ===

{{Further|Carnation Revolution}}

Faced with government inflexibility over proposed reforms, some Portuguese junior military officers, many from underprivileged backgrounds and increasingly attracted to the Marxist philosophy of their African insurgent opponents,&lt;ref name=&quot;infiltrated communists&quot;/&gt; began to move the MFA to the political left.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 35&quot;&gt;Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;    On April 25, 1974, Portuguese military officers of the MFA staged a bloodless military coup that toppled [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s successor [[Marcelo Caetano]], and successfully overthrew the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.

The revolt later became known as the [[Carnation Revolution]].  General Spínola was invited to assume the office of President, but resigned a few weeks later after it became clear that his desire to set up a system of federalized home rule for the African territories was not shared by the rest of the MFA, who wanted an immediate end to the war (achievable only by granting independence to the provinces of Portuguese Africa).&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 35&quot;/&gt;  The 25 April coup led to a series of temporary governments, marked by a [[Nationalization#Portugal|nationalization]] of many important areas of the economy.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Monument in Coimbra to the heroes of the Portuguese Colonial War.jpg|thumb|200px|Portuguese soldier with black Afro-Portuguese little child, a monument to the Portuguese Overseas Territories' Heroes (''Heróis do Ultramar''), in [[Coimbra]], Portugal.]]
After the coup on April 25, 1974, while the power struggle for control of Portugal's government was occurring in Lisbon, many Portuguese Army units serving in Africa simply ceased field operations, in some cases ignoring orders to continue fighting and withdrawing into barracks, in others negotiating local ceasefire agreements with insurgents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 35&quot;/&gt;

On 26 August 1974, after a series of diplomatic meetings, Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in Algiers, Algeria in which Portugal agreed to remove all troops by the end of October and to recognize the Republic of Guinea-Bissau government controlled by the PAIGC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22&quot;/&gt;

In June 1975, after a period of eight months under which Mozambique had been administered by a provisional government, representatives of the Portuguese government and FRELIMO signed an agreement to grant independence to Mozambique, with the president of FRELIMO to assume the presidency of the newly independent nation.  This was followed the next month by the announcement of the independence of Cape Verde, and the establishment of a new nation, the Republic of Cape Verde.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 35&quot;/&gt;

In Angola, the [[Alvor Agreement]] was signed on January 15, 1975, granting Angola independence from Portugal on 11 November 1975.  The Alvor Agreement formally ended the [[Angolan War of Independence|war for independence]]. The agreement, while signed by the MPLA, the FNLA, UNITA, and the Portuguese government, was never signed by the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] or the [[Eastern Revolt]] as the other parties had excluded them from the peace negotiations.  The coalition government established by the Alvor Agreement soon fell apart as the various nationalist parties each attempted to seize power.  Unable to broker a new compromise, in November 1975 Portugal's last African High Commissioner [[António Alva Rosa Coutinho|Rosa Coutinho]] hauled down his nation's flag and departed Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 35&quot;/&gt;

For a brief time after the 25 April Coup (May 1974 - November 1975), the country was on the brink of [[civil war]]&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=eacalvao ENTREVISTA COM ALPOIM CALVÃO], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt; between left-wing hardliners ([[Vasco Gonçalves]], [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]] and others) and the moderate forces ([[Francisco da Costa Gomes]], [[António Ramalho Eanes]] and others). Moderate elements of the new military government eventually won, preventing Portugal from becoming a [[communist state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917672,00.html &quot; Western Europe's First Communist Country?&quot;], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (Monday, Aug. 11, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact in Africa ===

Portugal had been the first European power to establish a colony in Africa when it captured [[Ceuta]] in 1415 and now it was one of the last to leave. The departure of the Portuguese from Angola and Mozambique increased the isolation of [[Rhodesia]], where [[white minority rule]] ended in 1980 when the territory gained international recognition as the Republic of [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]] with [[Robert Mugabe]] as the head of government. The former Portuguese territories in Africa became sovereign states with [[Agostinho Neto]] (followed in 1979 by [[José Eduardo dos Santos]]) in Angola, [[Samora Machel]] (followed in 1986 by [[Joaquim Chissano]]) in Mozambique and [[Luís Cabral]] (followed in 1980 by [[Nino Vieira]]) in Guinea-Bissau, as [[heads of state]].

In contrast to some other European colonial possessions, many of the Portuguese living in Portuguese Africa had strong ties to their adopted land, as their ancestors had lived in Africa for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Wright (author)|Robin Wright]], [http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright06/Wright06.html White Faces In A Black Crowd: Will They Stay?], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' (May 27, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} Carlos Fontes, [http://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page6portugal.html Emigração Portuguesa], Memórias da Emigração Portuguesa&lt;/ref&gt;  For these individuals, the prospect of Portugal's imminent departure from its African territories was nearly impossible to comprehend.  Nevertheless, most accepted the inevitable, and while an abortive right-wing settler revolt broke out in Mozambique, it quickly died out as Portuguese coup leaders made it clear that the decision to grant independence was irrevocable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott 1998 p. 35&quot;/&gt;

Fear of reprisals and impending changes in political and economic status by the Marxist governments of the new African states resulted in the peaceful exodus of over one million Portuguese citizens of European, African and mixed ethnicity from the newly independent African territories to Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, and other countries.

=== New governments of Angola and Mozambique ===

The new governments of Angola and Mozambique, faced a severe set of challenges as devastating civil wars broke out in both countries.  Lasting several decades, these ongoing conflicts would eventually claim over two million lives and an even greater number of refugees, while destroying much of the infrastructure in both nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norrie MacQueen&quot;&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0001-9909(199804)97%3A387%3C276%3ATDOPAM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C The Decolonization of Portuguese Africa: Metropolitan Revolution and the Dissolution of Empire by Norrie MacQueen - Mozambique since Independence: Confronting Leviathan by Margaret Hall, Tom Young - Author of Review: Stuart A.

These problems were exacerbated by a tendency to consolidate power by directing public anger against ethnic Portuguese, mixed-race Africans,&lt;ref name=&quot;post-independence goal&quot;&gt;&quot;Things are going well in Angola. They achieved good progress in their first year of independence. There's been a lot of building and they are developing health facilities. In 1976 they produced 80,000 tons of coffee. Transportation means are also being developed. Currently between 200,000 and 400,000 tons of coffee are still in warehouses. In our talks with [Angolan President Agostinho] Neto we stressed the absolute necessity of achieving a level of economic development comparable to what had existed under [Portuguese] colonialism.&quot;; &quot;There is also evidence of black racism in Angola. Some are using the hatred against the colonial masters for negative purposes. There are many mulattos and whites in Angola. Unfortunately, racist feelings are spreading very quickly.&quot; [http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/17/documents/castro/] [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]'s 1977 southern Africa tour: A report to [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]], [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt; and those who had supported the former colonial regime.

Many of the local black soldiers that served in the [[Portuguese Army]] and who had fought against the insurgents were demobilized by Portuguese authorities and left behind in Africa.  The most infamous reprisal occurred in Guinea-Bissau.  Demobilized by the Portuguese authorities and abandoned to their fate, a total of 7,447 black African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the PAIGC after Portuguese forces ceased hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22&quot;/&gt;  In a statement in the party newspaper '' Nô Pintcha'' (''In the Vanguard''), a spokesman for the PAIGC revealed that many of the ex-Portuguese indigenous African soldiers that were executed after cessation of hostilities were buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of [[Cumerá]], [[Portogole]], and [[Mansabá]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Munslow, Barry 1981 pp. 109-113&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PAIGC, Jornal Nô  Pintcha, 29 November 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the political regimes involved in wars or counterinsurgency tend to minimize unfavorable news stories about their military actions, many Portuguese remained unaware of the atrocities committed by the colonial regimes and the army. In 2007, a [[Radiotelevisao Portuguesa]] (RTP) documentary by [[Joaquim Furtado]], made public both these government-supported atrocities and the organized massacres and terror campaign policies of some pro-independence guerrilla movements or their supporters; it was watched by over a million people, a tenth of the population at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/portugals-hidden-atrocities Concord Monitor, November 10 2007: &quot;Portugal's hidden atrocities; Documentary brings long-hidden brutality into public view&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the Estado Novo regime, most Portuguese citizens, tired of the long war and their isolation from the world community under the Caetano regime, supported the decision to recognize the independence of Portuguese Africa immediately, while accepting the inevitable loss of their former overseas territories.  However, controversies over the MFA coup of 25 April 1974 and the decisions made by coup leaders remain to this day.  In 2011, one of the chief organizers of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]], stated that he would never have participated in the coup if he had known what the country would become after it.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.destak.pt/artigo/92580-se-soubesse-como-o-pais-ia-ficar-nao-fazia-a-revolucao «Se soubesse como o País ia ficar, não fazia a revolução»], [[Destak.pt]] (April 13, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, government budgets increased significantly during the war years. The country's expenditure on the armed forces ballooned since the beginning of the war in 1961. The expenses were divided into ordinary and extraordinary ones; the latter were the main factor in the huge increase in the military budget. The succession of [[Marcelo Caetano]], after Salazar's incapacitation, resulted in steady increases in military spending on the African wars through 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, Paul, and Nikolaidou, Eftychia Nikolaidou, ''Military Spending and Economic Growth in Greece, Portugal, and Spain'', Discussion Papers 0510, Department of Economics, University of the West of England (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 13, 1972, a [[sovereign wealth fund]] was enacted through the Decree Law ''Decreto-Lei n.º 448/ /72'' and the Ministry of Defense ordinance ''Portaria 696/72'', in order to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese overseas territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&amp;seccao=Convidados&amp;page=1 A verdade sobre o Fundo do Ultramar], [[Diário de Notícias]] (November 29, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese Government decided to create sustainability policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run. In addition, new Decree Laws (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto'') were enforced in order to cut down military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating militia and military academy officers in the Army branches as equals.&lt;ref name=&quot;infopedia_a&quot;&gt;{{pt icon}} Movimento das Forças Armadas (MFA).

In [[Continental Portugal|mainland Portugal]], the growth rate of the economy during the war years ranged from 6%-11%, and in post war years 2-3%.&lt;ref&gt;World Development Indicators 2007, Portugal economic growth rate data set, retrieved 26 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This is substantially higher than the vast majority of other European nations.  Other indicators like GDP as percentage of Western Europe would indicate that Portugal was rapidly catching up to its European neighbors. In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy influenced by a new generation of technocrats, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the EC-12 average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/64.htm Economic Growth and Change], [[U.S. Library of Congress]], countrystudies.us&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, on the eve of the revolution, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average. In 1975, the year of maximum revolutionary turmoil, Portugal's per capita GDP declined to 52.3 percent of the EC-12 average. Convergence of real GDP growth toward the EC average occurred as a result of Portugal's economic resurgence since 1985. In 1991 Portugal's GDP per capita climbed to 54.9 percent of the EC average, exceeding by a fraction the level attained just during the worst revolutionary period.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot; /&gt;

For many decades to come after independence, the economies of the three former Portuguese African territories involved in the war continued to remain problematic due to continuing internecine political conflicts and power struggles as well as inadequate agricultural production caused by disruptive government policies resulting in high birth mortality rates, widespread malnutrition, and disease. By the 21st century, the [[Human Development Index]] of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, were among the lowest in the World, while [[Transparency International|corruption]] and [[Gini Index|social inequality]] soared.

After 1974, the deterioration in [[central planning]] effectiveness, [[economic development]] and growth, security, education and health system efficiency, was rampant. None of the newly independent ex-Portuguese African states made any significant economic progress in the following decades, and political progress in terms of democratic processes and protection of individual human rights was either minimal or nonexistent.  With few exceptions, the new regimes ranked at the bottom of human development and [[GDP per capita]] world tables.  By 2002, however, the end of the [[Angolan Civil War]], combined with exploitation of the country's highly valuable natural resources, resulted in that country becoming economically successful for the first time in decades.
