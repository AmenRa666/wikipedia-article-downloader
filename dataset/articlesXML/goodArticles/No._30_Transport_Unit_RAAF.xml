'''No. 30 Transport Unit''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) unit that operated during the [[Korean War]]. It was formed in November 1950 as '''No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit''' and based at [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]], Japan, as part of [[No. 91 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;91 (Composite) Wing]]. The unit was initially equipped with four [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C–47&amp;nbsp;Dakota]]s and two [[Auster]]s, one of the Dakotas being the personal transport of Lieutenant General [[Horace Robertson|Sir Horace Robertson]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Another four Dakotas were sent to Japan due to operational demands. The unit's role in Korea was to support [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]] by transporting supplies and equipment. It also delivered materials and stores to Australian and Commonwealth ground forces, and transported VIPs of the [[United Nations Command]]. Return journeys to Japan were often used to evacuate wounded personnel from the theatre. No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit was redesignated No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit in November 1951, and re-formed as [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 (Transport) Squadron]] in March 1953. The squadron remained in Korea following the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]], and returned to Australia in June 1955.

==History==
When the [[Korean War]] broke out on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1950, [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 (Fighter) Squadron]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) was based at [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]], Japan, having served with the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF) for four years.&lt;ref name=Solo222&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped primarily with [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s, the squadron also operated a [[Flight (military unit)|communications flight]] of two [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47&amp;nbsp;Dakotas]] and two [[Auster]]s.&lt;ref name=Wilson170&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, ''The Forgotten Few'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel were preparing to return to Australia when they were placed on standby for action over Korea; the Mustangs began flying missions as part of [[United Nations Command]] (UNC) forces a week later.&lt;ref name=Solo222/&gt; Following the [[Battle of Inchon|landing at Inchon]] and the consequent advance northward of UNC troops, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron relocated to [[Pohang Airport|Pohang]], South Korea, on 12&amp;nbsp;October 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt; It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni.&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; [[No. 91 Wing RAAF|No. 91 (Composite) Wing]] was established at the base on 20&amp;nbsp;October and given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the conflict.&lt;ref name=Korean314&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APDC91WG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=404|title=No 91 (Composite) Wing formed in Japan|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, this included the newly formed [[No. 391 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;391 (Base) Squadron]] and [[No. 491 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;491 (Maintenance) Squadron]], and No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Flight, formerly the No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron Communications Flight.&lt;ref name=Wilson170/&gt;&lt;ref name=Solo228&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The flight's original complement of two Dakotas and two Austers had been augmented in September 1950 by two more Dakotas from Australia.&lt;ref name=Eather163&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mordike&gt;Mordike, ''The Post-War Years'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;November, the flight was designated No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit.&lt;ref name=APDC91WG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units150&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit was headquartered at Iwakuni, along with the rest of No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's components except No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, which was based on the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name=Solo228/&gt; It was initially commanded, unofficially, by [[Flight Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Commodore]]) Dave Hitchens. According to Hitchens, &quot;Having commanded the communications flight in No. 77 Squadron, I assumed control but had no formal authority to do so, but nobody told me to stop.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mordike/&gt; The transport aircraft included the personal Dakota of the BCOF commander, Lieutenant General [[Horace Robertson|Sir Horace Robertson]], operating under his direction.&lt;ref name=Korean314/&gt;  During November 1950, the unit received another four Dakotas from [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Squadron]] (of [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing]] in [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]]), giving it a total strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers.&lt;ref name=Units150/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; It supported all Australian forces in Korea.&lt;ref name=Eather163/&gt; One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs.&lt;ref name=Units150/&gt; Unlike No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron, it was not tasked by the US [[Fifth Air Force]] but instead operated under Australian control, exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan.&lt;ref name=Eather163/&gt; In December 1950 the unit undertook &quot;Operation Haggis&quot;, the delivery of {{convert|180|lb|kg}} of [[haggis]] to the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] based in [[Suwon]], Korea.&lt;ref name=Units150/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, a [[United States Air Force]] Mustang taking off from Suwon smashed into the cockpit of one of the Dakotas; none of the Australian crew was injured but the aircraft had to be written off and stripped for components by No.&amp;nbsp;491 Squadron.&lt;ref name=Units151&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit, [[Squadron Leader]] John Gerber, took over from Hitchens on 28&amp;nbsp;January 1951.&lt;ref name=Mordike/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units152/&gt; As of 31&amp;nbsp;March, the unit's strength was eight Dakotas and two Austers, and fifty-seven personnel including twelve officers.&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; According to the RAAF Historical Section, a &quot;typical month&quot; (May 1951) involved carrying over 1,000 troops, {{convert|180000|lb|kg}} of cargo and {{convert|95000|lb|kg}} of mail from Iwakuni to Korea, and over 1,000 troops, 380 medical evacuees, {{convert|16000|lb|kg}} of cargo and {{convert|32000|lb|kg}} of mail from Korea to Iwakuni.&lt;ref name=Units150/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;30 Communications Unit was redesignated No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit on 5&amp;nbsp;November 1951.&lt;ref name=Units152&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eather169&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; One of its aircraft dropped a wreath over [[Hiroshima]] on 6&amp;nbsp;August 1952, the seventh anniversary of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]].&lt;ref name=Units150/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; As of 31&amp;nbsp;December 1952, its strength was eight Dakotas and one [[CAC Wirraway]], and fifty-nine personnel including eight officers.&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10&amp;nbsp;March 1953, No.&amp;nbsp;30 Transport Unit re-formed as [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 (Transport) Squadron]], which had disbanded the previous day at [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Between the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] in July and the end of August 1953, the squadron repatriated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 58, 152&lt;/ref&gt; As of 30&amp;nbsp;November 1954, its strength was seven Dakotas and one Wirraway, and eighty-seven personnel including seven officers.&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron began returning to Australia in January 1955, and by the end of the month its strength was four Dakotas and one Wirraway, and fifty-eight personnel including five officers.&lt;ref name=Korea592&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', p. 592&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 315–319&lt;/ref&gt; Nominal operational control of the squadron was transferred to Fifth Air Force on 1&amp;nbsp;February 1955, though its purpose continued to be the support of Commonwealth forces.&lt;ref name=Units58&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron ceased flying on 13&amp;nbsp;March, after which its remaining elements departed Iwakuni for Australia, leaving three Dakotas and a Wirraway that formed [[RAAF Transport Flight (Japan)]]; the flight operated until July 1956 and was disbanded two months later.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 58, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The transportation unit suffered two fatal accidents. One of the Austers crashed on takeoff in April 1951, killing all three occupants. A Wirraway came down in a river after striking telephone wires in June 1952; the pilot and passenger survived the impact but the latter subsequently died of his injuries.&lt;ref name=Units151/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 36 Squadron, ''Operations Record Book'', pp. 107, 193&lt;/ref&gt; During the war the Dakotas carried around 100,000 passengers and over {{convert|6000|lt|kg}} of cargo.&lt;ref name=Eather169/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;91 Wing's records listed 12,762 medical evacuations from Korea to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Australia in the Korean War'', pp. 583–584&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the nature of transport work in Korea, Hitchens stated:&lt;ref&gt;Eather, ''Odd Jobs'', pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Most of our flying was not very exciting; but there was a lot of it. Lots of late dark nights. Lots of crowded airfields. Lots of plain hard work. [...] We all shed a lot of weight.}}
