== [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Biography/Assessment#Class_parameter|Biography assessment rating]] comment ==
Even though the article received a B, the article may be improved by following the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Biography#WikiProject_Biography_11_easy_steps_to_producing_at_least_a_B_article|WikiProject Biography 11 easy steps]] to producing at least a B article. -- &lt;font face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Jreferee|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;Jreferee&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;''([[User talk:Jreferee|Talk]])''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 02:17, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

==Will incorporate suggestions==
Thank you very much for the assessment. Will incorporate suggestions for improvement. Appreciate the feedback. Sincerely, [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 22:18, 27 June 2007 (UTC), a &quot;newbie&quot; to Wikipedia, and a first article.

===No picture exists===
Appreciate the suggestion of including a portrait of William Stacy. Unfortunately, there is no available published painting (portrait) or drawing of William Stacy. Also, Dr. Lemonds, the author of the “Col. William Stacy” book, was unable to locate a drawing, portrait, or likeness when he wrote the book in 1993. In addition to searching for a published portrait, Dr. Lemonds interacted with descendants of William Stacy, but no portrait or likeness could be found. Regards, [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 23:47, 29 June 2007 (UTC) &lt;br /&gt;Re-set &quot;needs-photo&quot; to &quot;no&quot;.  Regards, [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 19:10, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

===Incorporated biography infobox===
Incorporated biography infobox using the default biography template, which seemed more appropriate than the military template. Regards, [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 01:28, 4 July 2007 (UTC) &lt;br /&gt;Re-set &quot;needs-infobox&quot; to &quot;no&quot;.  Regards, [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 19:10, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

==&quot;Tory&quot; vs &quot;Loyalist&quot;==
This article makes extensive use of &quot;Tory&quot;, thus giving it a pro-Revolutionary POV bias.  Since &quot;Tory&quot; was a largely pejorative term (see [[Tory#American_Revolution]]), I'd recommend replacing it with the more neutral &quot;Loyalist&quot; (which also has a much better article of its own; see [[Loyalist (American Revolution)]]).

===Incorporated recommendation===
Good suggestion. Thank you. [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 21:34, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

==GA review==
#a proper lead, as a summary has few if any footnotes, this has 22
#needs more on his early life
#is there a painting or sketch of him so we know what he looked like?
#all the google links in the bibliography need cleaned up, have it display words not URLs
#possibly more later
#five days is allotted to act on these issues
[[User:Sumoeagle179|Sumoeagle179]] 20:29, 25 August 2007 (UTC)

===Incorporated recommendations===
Thank you very much for your review and comments.
#Removed footnotes in the lead paragraph. [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 03:34, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
#Created a section entitled &quot;Early life&quot; and expanded over original article. There is not a great deal of information available about his life prior to the Revolutionary War; most published information regarding Stacy concerns his time in the war and afterwards as a pioneer to Ohio. Will try to add more substance if possible. Thank you. [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 17:52, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
#Unfortunately, there is no available published painting or sketch of William Stacy. Dr. Lemonds, the author of the “Col. William Stacy” book, was unable to locate a likeness when he wrote his book; he searched for a published portrait, contacted historical societies, and interacted with descendants of William Stacy. [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 22:25, 25 August 2007 (UTC)
#Cleaned up the Google links in the bibliography to display words instead of URLs. [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 01:59, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
::As to the refs in the lead, move them to an appropriate spot in the body, don't totally remove them. I should have been clearer. [[User:Sumoeagle179|Sumoeagle179]] 12:14, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
::Thank you. Understood. Refs were retained in the body. [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] 14:11, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
:::Leave not here when done.[[User:Sumoeagle179|Sumoeagle179]] 02:17, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

==Version 0.7==
This article has been nominated for Version 0.7 of the offline Wikipedia release but did not meet the standards for importance. It has been put on [[Wikipedia:Release_Version_Nominations/Held_nominations]] for further review. Please see that page for details.

Article is nice enough on quality, but not quite high enough on importance. [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] ([[User talk:Walkerma|talk]]) 05:46, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

== [[William Stacy]] and [[Joseph Brant]] ==

There is a discussion thread on the [[Talk:Joseph_Brant#William_Stacy_incident|Joseph Brant talk page]] regarding the Brant-Stacy incident. If there are additional comments, please do not add comments here on the Stacy talk page; instead, for completeness, please add to the [[Talk:Joseph_Brant#William_Stacy_incident|Joseph Brant talk page]]. Also, there is some limited description within the [[Cherry Valley massacre]] article. — [[User:ColWilliam|ColWilliam]] ([[User talk:ColWilliam|talk]]) 17:00, 20 November 2009 (UTC)</text>
