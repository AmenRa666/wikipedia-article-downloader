'''SMS ''Don Juan d'Austria'''''&lt;ref&gt;The ship is sometimes referred to as ''Juan de Austria'' or ''Juan d'Austria''. See: Gardiner, p. 268 and Sondhaus, p. 72, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; was the third member of the {{sclass-|Kaiser Max|ironclad|4||1862}} built for the [[Austrian Navy]] in the 1860s. Her [[keel]] was laid in October 1861 at the [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] shipyard; she was launched in July 1862, and was completed in 1863. She carried her [[main battery]]&amp;mdash;composed of sixteen 48-pounder guns and fifteen 24-pounders&amp;mdash;in a traditional [[broadside]] arrangement, protected by an [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|110|mm|abbr=on}} thick.

''Don Juan d'Austria'' saw action at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] in July 1866. There she was heavily engaged in the center of the melee; she traded broadsides with the Italian ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}} and was hit three times by the [[turret ship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}, though she received little damage. After the war, ''Don Juan d'Austria'' was modernized slightly in 1867 to correct her poor [[seakeeping]] and improve her armament, but she was nevertheless rapidly outpaced by naval developments in the 1860s and 1870s. Obsolescent by 1873, ''Don Juan d'Austria'' was officially &quot;rebuilt&quot;, though in actuality she was [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap, with only her armor plate, parts of her machinery, and other miscellaneous parts being reused in the new {{SMS|Don Juan d'Austria|1875|2}}.

==Design==
{{main|Kaiser Max-class ironclad (1862)}}

''Don Juan d'Austria'' was {{convert|70.78|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]]; she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|10|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.32|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|3588|MT|sp=us}}. She had a crew of 386. Her propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]]. The number and type of her coal-fired [[boiler]]s have not survived. Her engine produced a top speed of {{convert|11|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|1900|ihp|lk=in}}. She could steam for about {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=G268&gt;Gardiner, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

''Don Juan d'Austria'' was a [[broadside ironclad]], and she was armed with a [[main battery]] of sixteen 48-pounder [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] guns and fifteen 24-pounder {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading]] guns. She also carried a single 12-pounder gun and a six-pounder. The sides of ship's hull were sheathed with [[wrought iron]] armor that was {{convert|110|mm|abbr=on|0}} thick and extended from [[Bow (ship)|bow]] to [[stern]].&lt;ref name=G268/&gt;

==Service history==
''Don Juan d'Austria'' was built by the [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) shipyard. She was laid down in October 1861, and her completed [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched on 26 July 1862. [[Fitting-out]] work was completed the following year and she was commissioned into the Austrian fleet the following year. She proved to be very wet forward, owing to her open bow, and as a result, tended to handle poorly.&lt;ref name=G268/&gt; In February 1864, the Austrian Empire joined [[Prussia]] in the [[Second Schleswig War]] against Denmark. ''Don Juan d'Austria'' was sent with the wooden [[ship of the line]] {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}} and two smaller vessels under Vice Admiral [[Bernhard von Wüllerstorf-Urbair]] to reinforce a smaller force consisting of the screw frigates {{SMS|Schwarzenberg||2}} and {{SMS|Radetzky|1854|2}} under then-Captain [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]]. After the two groups combined in [[Den Helder]], the Netherlands, they proceeded to [[Cuxhaven]] on 27 June, arriving three days later. The now outnumbered Danish fleet remained in port for the rest of the war and did not seek battle with the Austro-Prussian squadron. Instead, the Austrian and Prussian naval forces supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, p. 210&amp;ndash;211&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], which was fought concurrently with the [[Austro-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name=S1&gt;Sondhaus, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff, by now promoted to Rear Admiral and given command of the entire fleet, brought the Austrian fleet to [[Ancona]] on 27 June, in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], refused to engage Tegetthoff.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 216&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Lissa===
[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July]]
{{main|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet, with twelve ironclads, out of Ancona, bound for the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought [[troop transport]]s carrying 3,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=S1/&gt; Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 221&amp;ndash;224&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at [[Pula|Pola]] and [[Venice]]. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 229&amp;ndash;230&lt;/ref&gt; As Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided into three groups, with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 223&amp;ndash;225&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge-shaped formation, with ''Don Juan d'Austria'' on his right flank; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 230&amp;ndash;231&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was forming up his ships, Persano transferred from his [[flagship]], {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, to the [[turret ship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}. This created a gap in the Italian [[line of battle|line]], and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 232&amp;ndash;235&lt;/ref&gt; ''Don Juan d'Austria'' initially attempted to follow Tegetthoff's flagship, {{SMS|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max||2}}, but quickly lost contact with her in the ensuing melee. ''Don Juan d'Austria'' became surrounded by Italian vessels, prompting her sister {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1862|2}} to come to her aid. ''Don Juan d'Austria'' thereafter engaged {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}} for around half an hour before shifting targets back to ''Affondatore''. The latter scored three hits on ''Don Juan d'Austria''{{'}}s unarmored bow, but they caused little damage. The first passed directly through the ship without exploding, the second struck the belt armor and failed to penetrate, and the third hit her quarter deck.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, ''Re d'Italia'' had been rammed and sunk and the [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}} was burning badly, soon to be destroyed by a [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance so as not to risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 238&amp;ndash;241, 250&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
After returning to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the [[Armistice of Cormons]]; this ended the fighting and led to the [[Treaty of Vienna (1866)|Treaty of Vienna]]. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]], the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the [[Battle of Königgrätz]]. As a result, Austria, which became [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|''Ausgleich'']] of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 1&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleet embarked on a modest modernization program after the war, primarily focused on re-arming the ironclads with new rifled guns.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; ''Don Juan d'Austria'' was rebuilt in 1867, particularly to correct her poor sea-keeping. Her open bow was plated over and she was rearmed with twelve {{convert|7|in|adj=on|0}} muzzle-loaders manufactured by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] and two {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}} 4-pounder guns. By 1873, the ship was obsolescent and had a thoroughly-rotted hull, so the Austro-Hungarian Navy decided to replace the ship. Parliamentary objection to granting funds for new ships forced the navy to resort to subterfuge to replace the ship. Reconstruction projects were routinely approved by the parliament, so the navy officially &quot;rebuilt&quot; ''Don Juan d'Austria'' and her sister ships. In reality, only some parts of the engines, armor plate, and other miscellaneous parts were salvaged from the ships. ''Don Juan d'Austria'' was dismantled at the STT shipyard beginning in December 1873. The new ironclads were given the same names of the old vessels in an attempt to conceal the deception.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 268, 270&lt;/ref&gt;
