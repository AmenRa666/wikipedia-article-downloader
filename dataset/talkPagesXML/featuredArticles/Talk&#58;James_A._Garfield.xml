== Images ==

I thought I'd do a couple restorations to celebrate this reaching FA, but what do you think of this one instead of the existing Civil War image? It has a lot more gravitas, I think. http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cwpbh.00947/ I'm also somewhat eyeing http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cwpbh.03743/ for the lead, but think the current lead image isn't bad... &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 21:34, 26 May 2015 (UTC)
:No opinion on the Civil War image, I will leave that for {{u|Coemgenus}}.  I like the present lede image, you can see more of his face, and you get so tired of those Gilded Age profile shots.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 21:55, 26 May 2015 (UTC)
:: I'm kind of partial to the current lede image, too, but I do like that new Civil War picture. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 01:52, 27 May 2015 (UTC)
:::I kind of like both possible lead images, so let's use the current lead and the new Civil War. Presuming there's not major issues I discover when I start them. Would you like any of the others as well? the Library of Congress has about 200 images that come up when you search him ( http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=James%20Garfield ) , but, of course, a number of those are false hits. Although that said, please see http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2015645630/ and http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2015645629/ and, on a different tack, http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/brh2003000492/PP/ or http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cwpbh.04855/ - which might make interesting additions.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 06:38, 27 May 2015 (UTC)
::: If we could improve the picture of Lucretia, that would be great. I think there's room for one of Guiteau, too. I like the one of Garfield with his kid, if we can fit it in without crowding the text. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 12:23, 27 May 2015 (UTC)
::::I'm starting on the Civil War one. Judgement: Annoying! But quite doable. It's one of the ones that has lots of minor damage, and a few more major challenges. If anyone wants to learn basic restoration, I could probably teach you using it, though - I could do the major challenges, then supervise you through the easy-but-repetitive part. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 12:57, 27 May 2015 (UTC)

== Presidential ranking - why so laudatory? ==

&quot;Despite the effectiveness of his term, Garfield is little-remembered in the American cultural memory other than for his assassination; historians often forego listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency.&quot;

Actually, most of the historian rankings do give Garfield a ranking, and they are generally fairly '''bad''' rankings. How does this square with the beginning of the article which seems to put him in a uniformly positive light?!  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/116.24.11.172|116.24.11.172]] ([[User talk:116.24.11.172|talk]]) 14:57, 13 August 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Senator-elect in infobox ==

No question Garfield was senator elect, but I don't think it should be in the infobox as he was never sworn in.  And the dates are wrong, he did not stay senator-elect until March, he resigned (renounced?) so the general assembly could elect [[John Sherman]] without loss of seniority.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 11:10, 8 May 2016 (UTC)
:I'd leave it out. It's not an actual office, and there are plenty of offices he did hold that make the infobox quite large already. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 12:33, 8 May 2016 (UTC)

== Photograph of Eliza Garfield's portrait at Garfield Site's Visitor Center ==
There is a painted portrait of [[Eliza Garfield]] in the [[James A. Garfield National Historic Site]]'s Visitor Center.  I have placed a photograph request at Eliza's article &amp; at the Center's articles but am also posting about my request here.  Eliza died when she was only a toddler, I could find no photographs of her, just this one painting.  I did find a photo of it on Flikr but that had too many restrictions.  So far as I know the painting was done outside of any possible copyright restrictions since Eliza died in 1863, so if anyone could help out that would be great. Thanks, [[User:Shearonink|Shearonink]] ([[User talk:Shearonink|talk]]) 16:38, 16 October 2016 (UTC)
:I wonder if it is simply a reproduction of A two dimensional art work and therefore the photographer would not be able to place additional restrictions on it.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 19:53, 16 October 2016 (UTC)</text>
