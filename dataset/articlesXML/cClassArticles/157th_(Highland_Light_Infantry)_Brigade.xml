The '''157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade''' was an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Army]]. The brigade fought in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], assigned to [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division|52nd (Lowland) Division]].

==History==

===Formation===
The brigade was originally raised as the '''Highland Light Infantry Brigade''', assigned to the Lowland Division. Both were raised in 1908 when the [[Territorial Force]] was created by the amalgamation of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] and the [[Yeomanry]]. The brigade was composed of the 5th and 6th (City of Glasgow), 7th (Blythswood) and 9th ([[Glasgow Highlanders|Glasgow Highland]]) battalions of the [[Highland Light Infantry]].

===First World War===
Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the Lowland Division was mobilised immediately for full-time war service. In May 1915 the brigade became the '''157th (1/1st Highland Light Infantry) Brigade''' and the division the [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division|52nd (Lowland) Division]]. The battalions were also redesignated with the '1/' prefix, 1/4th HLI. This was to avoid confusion with the 2nd Line duplicates which were also forming up and training as the [[196th (2/1st Highland Light Infantry) Brigade]] of [[65th (2nd Lowland) Division]]. The 2nd Line units consisted mainly of those few men who did not volunteer for [[Territorial Force Imperial Service Badge|overseas service]] when asked at the outbreak of war, together with the many recruits, and were intended to act as a reserve for the 1st Line units being sent overseas. During the war the brigade and division served in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] and later on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

====Order of battle First World War====
* 1/5th ([[City of Glasgow]]) Battalion, [[Highland Light Infantry]]
* 1/6th (City of Glasgow) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry
* 1/7th ([[Archibald Campbell, 1st Baron Blythswood|Blythswood]]) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry
* 1/9th ([[Glasgow Highlanders]]) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry ''(left November 1914)''
* 1/5th ([[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]]) Battalion, [[Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)]] ''(from April 1915, left 28 June 1918)''

* 157th Trench Mortar Battery ''(formed 11 June 1917)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1914-1918.net/52div.htm | title=The 52nd (Lowland) Division in 1914-1918 | publisher=The Long, Long Trail | first=Chris | last=Baker | accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between the wars===
After the Great War both the brigade and division were disbanded, as was the rest of the Territorial Force which was later renamed in the 1920s as the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and the 52nd Division was reconstituted as was the brigade, which became the '''157th (Highland Light Infantry) Infantry Brigade''', again composed of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 9th battalions of the Highland Light Infantry and remained this way for most of the inter-war period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/52_Division__1930_38_.pdf |title=52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division (1930–38) |date=13 December 2009 |work=British Military History |accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, due to an increasing need to strengthen the anti-aircraft defences of the country, the 7th Battalion, HLI was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] and converted into [[83rd (7th (Blythswood) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-scotland/vinf/hli-7.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230124650/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-scotland/vinf/hli-7.htm |title=7th Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry [UK] |archivedate=30 December 2005 |work=regiments.org |accessdate=7 August 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the 9th (Glasgow Highland) Battalion was redesignated 1st Battalion, [[Glasgow Highlanders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-scotland/vinf/glasgow.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209012954/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-scotland/vinf/glasgow.htm |title=The Glasgow Highlanders [UK] |archivedate=9 February 2006 |work=regiments.org |accessdate=7 August 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but still retained the Highland Light Infantry as its parent regiment. In the following year the brigade was redesignated as '''157th Infantry Brigade'''.

===Second World War===

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the brigade served with the division during [[Operation Ariel]] in France in mid-1940 to cover the withdrawal of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) being [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from France]]. In 1942 to June 1944 the division was trained in [[mountain warfare]] yet was never used in the role. They were then trained in airlanding operations but were again never utilised in the role. In October 1944 they were sent to Belgium to join the [[21st Army Group]] and were attached to the [[First Canadian Army]] and fought in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]]. The brigade took part in [[Operation Blackcock]] in 1945 and ended the war by the [[Elbe|River Elbe]].
