{{nihongo|'''Chichijima'''|父島|extra=''Father Island''}}, formerly known as '''Peel Island''' and in the 19th century known to the English as part of the [[Bonin Islands]], is the largest [[island]] in the [[Bonin Islands|Ogasawara]] archipelago. Chichi-jima is approximately {{convert|240|km}} north of [[Iwo Jima]]. The island is within the political boundaries of [[Ogasawara, Tokyo|Ogasawara Town]], [[Ogasawara Subprefecture]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. 2,000 people live on its land area of 24&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Topography and climate==
Chichijima is located at {{Coord|27|4|0|N|142|12|30|E|display=inline,title}}. There are currently around 2,000 people living on the island, and the island's area is about 24&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

On English maps from the early 19th century, the island chain was known as the [[Bonin Islands]]. The name Bonin comes from a French cartographer's corruption of the old Japanese word 'munin', which means 'no man', and the English translated it to &quot;No mans land&quot; islands.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite book | last = Bradley | first = James | author-link =James Bradley (author) | title = [[Flyboys: A True Story of Courage]] | place = | publisher = Little, Brown and Company (Time Warner Book Group) | year = 2003 | volume = | edition = 1st | type= hardcover | url = | doi = | id = | isbn= 0-316-10584-8 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2010-01-15 --&gt; Note: [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sgEfKbRaAC Google review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of Chichijima is on the boundary between a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''). Temperatures are warm to hot and humid all year round, and have never fallen below {{convert|7.8|C|F|1}} or risen above {{convert|34.1|C|F|1}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/rank_s.php?prec_no=19&amp;prec_ch=%8B%FA%98H%8Ex%92%A1&amp;block_no=47971&amp;block_ch=%8B%FA%98H&amp;year=&amp;month=13&amp;day=&amp;view= 観測史上1～10位の値（年間を通じての値）]&lt;/ref&gt; owing to the warm currents from the North Pacific gyre that surround the island. Rainfall is however less heavy than in most parts of mainland Japan since the island is too far south to be influenced by the [[Aleutian Low]] and too far from mainland Asia to receive monsoonal rainfall or orographic precipitation on the equatorward side of the [[Siberian High]]. Occasionally very heavy cyclonic rain will fall, as on 7 November 1997 when the island received its record daily rainfall of {{convert|348|mm|in|1}} and monthly rainfall of {{convert|603.5|mm|in|1}}.

== History ==
The first European discovery of the Bonin Islands is said to have taken place in 1543, by the [[Spain|Spanish explorer]] [[Bernardo de la Torre]].&lt;ref&gt;Welsch, Bernhard. (2004). &quot;Was Marcus Island Discovered by Bernardo de la Torre in 1543?&quot; ''Journal of Pacific History,'' 39:1, 109-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological excavations show that [[Micronesia]]n people lived on the island in the past, though no details are yet known.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;[http://www.iwojima.jp/ogasa2.html 小笠原・火山(硫黄)列島の歴史]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] dispatched an expedition in 1675 and made a map of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; It remained uninhabited until May 1830.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Western ships visited the island on several occasions in the 19th century, including:&lt;ref&gt;Information in this section was taken from the Wikipedia articles on [[Bonin grosbeak]] and [[Bonin thrush]] which have reference sections citing sources for those articles&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Frederick William Beechey|Beechey]] Pacific expedition in 1827,
*Naturalist [[Heinrich von Kittlitz]] in 1828 with the [[Russia]]n ''Senjawin'' expedition, led by Captain [[Fyodor Petrovich Litke]];
*A whaling ship established an American colony in 1830;
*Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry's]] U.S. expedition to Japan in 1853;
*Naturalist [[William Stimpson]] of the [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|Rodgers]]-[[Cadwalader Ringgold|Ringgold]] [[North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition]] came in 1854.

Two shipwrecked sailors who were picked up by Beechey in 1827 suggested that the island would make a good stopover station for [[whaler]]s due to natural springs found on the island.

The first settlement on the island was established in May 1830 by thirty-six-year-old [[Massachusetts]] native [[Nathaniel Savory]] along with four other whites and twenty Hawaiian men and women from [[Oahu]]. Descendants of Nathaniel Savory continue to live on the island to this day.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

Commodore Perry's [[flagship]] {{USS|Susquehanna|1850}} anchored for three days in Chichijima's harbor on June 15, 1853 on the way to his historic visit to [[Tokyo Bay]] to open up the country to western trade. Perry also laid claim to the island for the [[United States]] for a coaling station for steamships, appointing Nathaniel Savory as an official agent of the US Navy and formed a governing council with Savory as the leader. On behalf of the US government, Perry &quot;purchased&quot; {{convert|50|acre|m2}} from Savory.&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune  &quot;..first piece of land bought by Americans in the Pacific&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 1862, a Tokugawa Shogunate ship entered a harbor at Chichijima and officially proclaimed Japanese sovereignty over the Ogasawara Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; Japanese immigrants were introduced from [[Hachijōjima]] under the direction of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Forty members of the Savory colony were allowed to stay on the island.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt; Following the [[Meiji restoration]], a group of 37 Japanese colonists arrived on the island under the sponsorship of the Japanese [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]] in March 1876. The island was officially incorporated into [[Tokyo Metropolis]] on October 28, 1880. [[Emperor Hirohito]] made an official visit to the island in 1927, aboard the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}}.

=== World War II ===
A small naval base had been established on Chichijima in 1914. The island was the primary site of long range Japanese radio stations during [[World War II]], as well as being the central base of supply and communication between Japan and the Bonin Islands.&lt;ref name=peleliu&gt;[http://pfweb.com/plf-usmc/japanese-plan-for-chichi-jima/ Japanese Defense Plan for Chichi Jima] '''Peleliu: USMC WWII Combat''' ''website''&lt;/ref&gt; As behooved this status it had the heaviest garrison in the [[Nanpō Islands|Nanpo Shoto]]. According to one source: &quot;At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor an Army force of about 3,700-3,800 men garrisoned Chichi Jima. In addition, about 1,200 naval personnel manned the Chichi Jima Naval Base, a small seaplane base, the radio and weather station, and various gunboat, subchaser, and minesweeping units.&quot;&lt;ref name=USMCg3&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/IV/USMC-IV-VI-1.html Western Pacific Operations; History of U.S. Marine Corps in World War II - Part VI ''Iwo Jima''] Historical Branch, G3 Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cdYahoo&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/CoastDefense/message/13520 CoastDefense] (''Yahoo Groups'')&lt;/ref&gt; The garrison also included a heavy artillery fortress regiment,&lt;ref name=pacificenc&gt;[http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/C/h/Chichi_Jima.htm Chichi Jima] ''The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; it was a frequent target of US attacks. A young [[George H. W. Bush]] was shot down while on one of these raids. In 1944, all of the 6,886 civilian inhabitants were ordered to evacuate from the Ogasawara islands. Japanese troops and resources from Chichijima  were used in reinforcing the strategic point of [[Iwo Jima]] before the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|historic battle]] that took place there from February 19 to March 24, 1945. The island also served as a major point for Japanese radio relay communication and surveillance operations in the Pacific, with two radio stations atop its two mountains being the primary goal of multiple bombing attempts by the US Navy.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

Chichijima was also the subject of a book by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] entitled ''[[Flyboys: A True Story of Courage]]'', a factual account of the lives of a group of young World War II pilots, including George H. W. Bush.  The book tells the story of [[United States Navy]] [[Aviator|pilots]] who bombed the island's two radio stations, and details the stories of the US pilots who were captured, tortured, executed, and in some cases, partially eaten in February 1945.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

The island was never captured and at the end of World War II some twenty-five thousand troops in the island chain surrendered. Thirty Japanese soldiers were court-martialled for [[Japanese war crimes|class &quot;B&quot; war crimes]], primarily in connection with the [[Chichijima incident]] and four officers (Major Matoba, General [[Yoshio Tachibana|Tachibana]], Admiral Mori, and Captain Yoshii) were found guilty and hanged. All enlisted men and Probationary Medical Officer Tadashi Teraki were released within eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | format = PDF | url = http://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/welch_naval_MCs.pdf | title = Without a Hangman, Without a Rope: Navy War Crimes Trials After World War II | chapter = Cannibalism | last = Welch | first = JM | journal = International Journal of Naval History | volume = 1 | issue = 1 |date=April 2002 | accessdate = 2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two US citizens of Japanese descent served in the Japanese military on Chichijima during the war, including [[Nobuaki &quot;Warren&quot; Iwatake]], a Japanese-American from Hawaii who was drafted into the Japanese Imperial Army while living with his family back in [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

The United States maintained the former Japanese naval base and attached seaplane base after the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Under United States sovereignty===
After World War II, the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] allowed only 129 locals of Western origin to go back to the island and destroyed the rest of the housing. In 1960, the harbor facilities were devastated by [[tsunami]] after the [[Great Chilean earthquake]].

Several Japanese islands, including Chichijima, were used by the United States in the 1950s to store [[nuclear arms]], according to Robert S. Norris, William M. Arkin, and William Burr, writing for the ''[http://www.thebulletin.org Bulletin of Atomic Scientists]'' in early 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Norris, William M. Arkin and William Burr, [http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/r111482630153263/?p=3a380821ba1e42149b5973c5d0662a67&amp;pi=4 &quot;Where they were: How much did Japan know?&quot;] [http://www.thebulletin.org Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists], January/February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert S.

RENUNCIATION OF WAR|Constitution of Japan - Chapter II, Renunciation of War]]&lt;/ref&gt; Japan holds [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]]. The island was returned to Japanese sovereignty in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/traveloutdoors/2002670726_chichi11.html|title=Dolphin dances, WWII relics in blissful, remote Japanese islands|last=Bowermaster|first=David |date=2009-12-05|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Island development==
[[File:Chichijimaport.JPG|right|thumb|Futami Harbor, the port at Chichijima]]

===Astronomy and telemetry stations===
The Japanese [[National Institute of Natural Sciences]] (NINS) is the umbrella agency maintaining a radio astronomy facility on Chichijima.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nao.ac.jp/E/AboutUs/travel.html Ogasawa, VERA astronomy station.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2004, the [[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan]] ([[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan|NAOJ]]) has been a division of NINS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nao.ac.jp/A_Report/A_Report_2003_E/hajimeni.pdf NAOJ folded into NINS (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NINS/NAQJ research is on-going using a [[VLBI]] Exploration of Radio Astronomy ([[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan|VERA]]) 20m radio telescope. The dual-beam VERA array consists of four coordinated radio telescope stations located at [[Mizusawa, Iwate|Mizusawa]], [[Iriki, Kagoshima|Iriki]], [[Ishigaki Island|Ishigakijima]] and Ogasawara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veraserver.mtk.nao.ac.jp/VERA/stations-e.htm VERA stations and the array]&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined signals of the four-part array produce a correlated image which is used for deep space study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veraserver.mtk.nao.ac.jp/system/fxcorr-e.html VERA system, radio astronomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] ([[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]]) also maintains a facility on Chichijima.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxa.jp/about/index_e.html JAXA, about the agency]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ogasawara Downrange Station at Kuwanokiyama,  was established  in 1975 as a [[National Space Development Agency of Japan]] ([[National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA]]) facility. The Station is equipped with [[radar]] (rocket telemeter antenna and precision radar antenna) to check the flight trajectories, status, and safety of rockets launched from the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] ([[Tanegashima Space Center|TNSC]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxa.jp/about/centers/odrs/index_e.html  JAXA, Kuwanokiyama facility].&lt;/ref&gt;

===JSDF (MSDF) facilities===
From 1968, the [[Maritime Self-Defense Force]] has operated the ''Chichijima Naval Base'', along with the associated [[Chichijima Airfield]], the latter including a heliport originally built during the American occupation, as well as seaplane facilities.

==Wildlife==
Possibly as a result of the introduction of non-indigenous animals, at least three species of birds became extinct: the [[Bonin nankeen night heron]], the [[Bonin grosbeak]] (a finch), and the [[Bonin thrush]]. The island was the only known home of the thrush and probably the finch, although the heron was found on [[Nakōdojima]] (also &quot;Nakoudo-&quot; or, erroneously,  &quot;Nakondo-&quot;) as well. The existence of the birds was documented by von Kittlitz in 1828, and five stuffed thrushes are in European museums.

The [[Bonin wood-pigeon]] died out in the late 19th century, apparently as the result of the introduction of alien mammals, or from both causes.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} The species is known to have existed only on Chichijima and another island, Nakōdo-jima.

===Green turtle consumption and preservation===
[[File:Chichijimaturtle.JPG|right|thumb|A baby sea turtle at the restoration facility]]
The inhabitants of the island traditionally have caught and consumed [[green turtles]] as a source of [[protein]]. Local restaurants serve turtle soup and [[sashimi]] in dishes. In the early 20th century, some thousand turtles were captured per year and the population of turtles decreased.&lt;ref name=&quot;everlasting&quot;&gt;[http://www2.charity-platform.com/navi_file_down.php?f_no=1&amp;f_id=120 2006年度 活動報告書], NGO group Everlasting Nature&lt;/ref&gt; Today in Chichijima, only one fisherman is allowed to catch turtles and the number taken is restricted to at most 135 per season.&lt;ref name=&quot;everlasting&quot; /&gt;

The Fisheries Agency and the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] operate a conservation facility on the edge of Futami Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umigame.org/J1/link_aqua_list.html Ogasawara Marine Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Eggs are carefully planted in the shore and infant turtles are raised at the facility until they have reached a certain size, at which point they are released into the wild with an identification tag. Today the number of green turtles has been stabilized and is increasing slowly.&lt;ref name=&quot;everlasting&quot; /&gt;

==Education==
Ogasawara Village operates the island's public elementary and junior high schools.

[[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education]] operates [[Ogasawara High School]] on Chichijima.
