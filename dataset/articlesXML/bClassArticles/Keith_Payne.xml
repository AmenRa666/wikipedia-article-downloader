'''Keith Payne''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|VCi|AM}} (born 30 August 1933) is an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot; awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. Payne's VC was awarded due to his actions during the [[Vietnam War]]. Aged&amp;nbsp;{{age|1933|08|30}}, he is the last living Australian recipient of the original &quot;Imperial&quot; Victoria Cross.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;[[Mark Donaldson]], [[Ben Roberts-Smith]] and [[Daniel Keighran]] are recipients of the [[Victoria Cross for Australia]], a separate award to the original [[Victoria Cross]]. [[Edward Kenna]], the last living Australian recipient from the Second World War, died on 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Keith Payne was born at [[Ingham, Queensland]], on 30 August 1933, the son of Romilda (Millie) Hussey and Henry Thomas Payne. He attended Ingham State School and later became an apprentice cabinet-maker. Dissatisfied with working as a tradesman, Payne joined the [[Australian Army]] in August 1951 and, after brief period in the [[Citizen Military Forces]] (CMF), was posted to the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] in September the following year.{{sfn|Wigmore|1986|pp=173–174}}

==Military career==
Payne served with his unit in the [[Korean War]] from April 1952 to March 1953.{{sfn|Wigmore|1986|pp=173–174}} He married Florence Plaw, a member of the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps, in December 1954, and was promoted to [[corporal]] the following year. Payne served in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] with this unit and in 1965, now a [[sergeant]], he joined the 5th Battalion. In June 1965, by now a Warrant Officer Class II, Payne was a fieldcraft instructor on the staff of the [[Officer Training Unit, Scheyville]], established to commission national servicemen. In February 1967 he was posted to [[Papua New Guinea]] where he served with the 2nd Battalion, [[Pacific Islands Regiment]]. He remained there until March 1968 when he returned to Brisbane. On 24 February 1969 he was posted to the [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam]] (AATTV).{{sfn|Wigmore|1986|pp=173–174}}

In May 1969 he was commanding the 212th Company of the 1st Mobile Strike Force Battalion when it was attacked by a strong [[North Vietnamese]] force near [[Ben Het Camp]]. His company was isolated and, surrounded on three sides, Payne's Vietnamese troops began to fall back. Payne, by now wounded in the hands and arms and under heavy fire, covered the withdrawal before organising his troops into a defensive perimeter. He then spent three hours scouring the scene of the day's fight for isolated and wounded soldiers, all the while evading the enemy who kept up regular fire. He found some forty wounded men, brought some in himself and organised the rescue of the others, leading the party back to base through enemy dominated terrain.{{sfn|Wigmore|1986|pp=173–174}}

Payne's actions that night earned him the [[Victoria Cross]], which was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 19 September 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44938|supp=yes|startpage=9703|date=19 September 1969|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was evacuated to Brisbane in September suffering from an illness, receiving a warm reception at the airport before entering hospital. In January 1970 Payne was posted to the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] as an instructor.{{sfn|Wigmore|1986|pp=173–174}}

Payne received his VC from the Queen aboard the Royal Yacht, ''Britannia'', in Brisbane on 13 April 1970. He was made a Freeman of the city and of the shire in which his hometown was located. A park in Stafford, Brisbane, (where Payne lived) was also named after him. He also received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the [[Silver Star]] from the United States of America and the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] awarded Payne the [[Vietnam Gallantry Cross]] with Bronze Star.&lt;ref name=Legion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frontiersmen.org.au/PAYNE.HTM |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140126084437/http://frontiersmen.org.au/PAYNE.HTM |title= Keith Payne, VC |year=2001 |archivedate= 26 January 2014 |website=Legion of Frontiersmen Australian Division |accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later posted to the [[42nd Battalion (Australia)|42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment]].{{sfn|Wigmore|1986|pp=173–174}} Payne subsequently retired from the Australian Army in 1975, but saw further action as a captain with the Army of the Sultan of Oman against communist forces in the [[Dhofar War]] in 1975 and 1976.&lt;ref name=Legion/&gt;

==Later life==
Payne joined the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]] in 1975 and holds the rank of an Honorary Chief Commissioner.&lt;ref name=Legion/&gt; After returning to Australia, he became active in the veteran community, particularly in counselling sufferers of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Payne and his wife raised five sons and live in [[Mackay, Queensland]]. He was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] (OAM) for his service to the veteran community in 2006,&lt;ref name=OAMItsanhonour&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1131848&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true Medal of the Order of Australia], 26 January 2006, It's an Honour&lt;br/&gt;Citation: ''For service to the community, particularly through support for youth programs and veterans groups.''&lt;/ref&gt; while Flo Payne was recognised with an OAM for her service to the community, particularly through surf lifesaving and veteran's families, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2011/Media%20Notes%20OAM%20%28M-R%29%20%28final%29.pdf|title=Medal (OAM) of the Order of Australia in the General Division|date=26 January 2011|website=Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia|publisher=The Australian Honours Secretariat|access-date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne was interviewed for the [[2006 in television|2006]] television [[docudrama]] ''[[Victoria Cross Heroes]]'' which also included archive footage and dramatisations of his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/victoriacross/interviews/ |title=Interviews |publisher=Victoria Cross Heroes |accessdate=2008-07-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 he became a Patron of the Victoria Cross Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://victoriacrosstrust.org/about/patrons |title= Patrons |publisher= Victoria Cross Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental health ward at [[Greenslopes Private Hospital]] in Brisbane is named the Keith Payne Unit (KPU), in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychiatry and Mental Health |url= http://www.greenslopesprivate.com.au/Services/psychiatry-mental-health.aspx |work= Greenslopes Private Hospital website |publisher= Ramsay Health Care |accessdate=20 November 2012 |location= Greenslopes, Queensland, Australia |year=2012 |quote=The 30 bed Keith Payne Unit, opened in 1996, was named in honour of Australia's only surviving Vietnam Victoria Cross recipient.

Payne was advanced to a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] in June 2015. The award recognised his &quot;significant service to veterans and their families as an ambassador, patron and as an advocate for veterans' health and welfare.&quot;&lt;ref name=GGAM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/qb/qb2015/sinvhopeg/Media%20Notes%20-%20AM%20(M-Z).pdf|title=Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in the General Division|date=8 June 2015|website=Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia|publisher=The Australian Honours Secretariat|access-date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
