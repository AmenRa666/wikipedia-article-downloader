The '''''Francesco Caracciolo''-class battleships''' were a [[Ship class|class]] of [[battleship]]s designed for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' in 1912&amp;ndash;1913 and ordered in 1914; the first ship of the class, ''Francesco Caracciolo'', was laid down that year. The other three ships, ''Cristoforo Colombo'', ''Marcantonio Colonna'', and ''Francesco Morosini'' were all laid down in 1915. Armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|381|mm|abbr=on}} guns and possessing a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}, the four ships of the class were intended to be the equivalent of the British {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|4}}. They were never completed, however, due to material shortages and shifting construction priorities after the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914. Only the lead ship was launched, and several proposals to convert her into an [[aircraft carrier]] were considered, but budgetary problems prevented any work being done. She was sold to an Italian shipping firm for conversion into a merchant ship. This too proved to be too expensive, and so she was broken up for scrap.

==Design==
In 1913, Admiral [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]] became the Chief of Staff of the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy). He secured authorization for a huge new construction program, which called for four new battleships, three cruisers, and numerous other warships.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Francesco Caracciolo'' class was the first type of [[super-dreadnought]] battleship designed by the ''Regia Marina''.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; They were intended to match the new [[fast battleship]]s being built in foreign navies, such as the British {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|4}}. Rear Admiral [[Edgardo Ferrati]] was responsible for preparing the designs. He originally called for a ship armed with twelve {{convert|381|mm|adj=on}} guns and twenty {{convert|152|mm|abbr=on}} secondary guns, but by the time he had finalized the design, he had reduced the main battery to eight guns and the secondary battery to twelve guns.&lt;ref name=GG260&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
The ''Francesco Caracciolo'' class was {{convert|201.6|m|abbr=on}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|212|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|29.6|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.5|m|abbr=on}}. They would have displaced {{convert|31400|MT|sp=us}} at normal loading and up to {{convert|34000|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. They were to be equipped with two tripod masts.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt;

The ships would have been powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, with steam provided by twenty oil-fired [[Yarrow boiler]]s. The boilers were trunked into two large [[funnel]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|105000|shp|lk=in}}, which provided a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}. At a more economical speed of {{convert|10|kn}}, the ships could have cruised for {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt;

===Armament===
''Francesco Caracciolo'' and her sisters were to be armed with a main battery of eight [[Cannone navale da 381/40|381&amp;nbsp;mm 40-caliber guns]] in four twin [[gun turret]]s, all mounted on the centerline in [[superfire|superfiring pairs]] fore and aft. They had a secondary battery of twelve 152&amp;nbsp;mm 45-caliber guns mounted in [[casemate]]s clustered [[amidships]]. These were supplemented by eight {{convert|102|mm|abbr=on}} 45-caliber guns. Anti-aircraft defense was to be provided by twelve {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} autocannon. As was typical for [[capital ship]]s of the period, the ships of the ''Francesco Caracciolo'' class were to be armed with eight [[torpedo tube]]s, either {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} or {{convert|533|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt;

Armor for the class consisted of [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented steel]] manufactured by [[Terni]]. The main [[belt armor]] was {{convert|303|mm|abbr=on}} thick; horizontal protection consisted of a {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick deck. The main [[conning tower]] had {{convert|400|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides. The same level of protection was applied to the main battery turrets, while the secondary guns had {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} of armor protection.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Italian battleship Francesco Caracciolo launching.jpg|thumb|''Francesco Caracciolo'' is [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] at the Royal Naval Yard, Castellamare di Stabia, on 12 May 1920. She was the only member of her class to be launched, but she was not completed.]]

''Francesco Caracciolo'' was laid down at the [[Castellammare di Stabia|Castellammare]] shipyard on 16 October 1914. ''Marcantonio Colonna'' was laid down on 3 March 1915 at the [[Odero Shipyard]] in [[Sestri Ponente]]. ''Cristoforo Columbo'' followed on eleven days later on the 14th, at the [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo shipyard]] in [[Genoa]]. The last member of the class, ''Francesco Morosini'', was laid down at the [[Orlando Shipyard]] in [[Livorno]] on 27 June 1915. ''Francesco Caracciolo'' was the only member of the class to be launched, on 12 May 1920.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt;

Shortages of steel slowed the construction of the ships, and after Italy entered [[World War I]], other classes of warships, particularly [[destroyer]]s, [[submarine]]s, and other light craft were needed to combat the [[Central Powers]]. As a result, work on the ships was suspended in March 1916. Around {{convert|9000|MT|abbr=on}} of steel had been built into the hull for ''Francesco Caracciolo'' when work stopped. ''Cristoforo Columbo'' was the next furthest along ship, with 12.5&amp;nbsp;percent of the hull completed and 5&amp;nbsp;percent of the machinery assembled. Work on the last two ships had not progressed significantly by the time work on them halted.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt; Two of the heavy guns intended for ''Cristoforo Colombo'' were installed aboard the [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{ship|Italian monitor|Faà di Bruno||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The monitor {{ship|Italian monitor|Alfredo Cappellini||2}} received a pair of 381&amp;nbsp;mm guns from ''Francesco Morosini'',&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; and the two {{sclass-|Monte Santo|monitor|5}} and four {{sclass-|Monte Grappa|monitor|2}}s were also equipped with spare 381&amp;nbsp;mm guns.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Another pair of guns was installed in Venice as ''Batteria Amalfi'' to protect the harbor.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, Dickson, &amp; Worth, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Work resumed on ''Francesco Caracciolo'' in October 1919, but she was not to be completed.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt; That year, the ''Regia Marina'' considered converting ''Francesco Caracciolo'' into a flush-deck [[aircraft carrier]] similar to the British {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}}.&lt;ref name=CO63&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The poor economic situation in Italy in the aftermath of World War I, and the heavy expenses of the [[Pacification of Libya|Italian pacification campaigns in Libya]], forced severe reductions in the naval budget.&lt;ref&gt;Zabecki, p. 859&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a modern carrier conversion could not be completed. Ansaldo proposed converting ''Franceso Caracciolo'' into a [[floatplane]] carrier, a cheaper alternative. It was nevertheless still too expensive for the ''Regia Marina''.&lt;ref name=CO63/&gt;

In addition to the budgetary problems, the senior Italian navy commanders could not agree on the shape of the post-war ''Regia Marina''. One faction advocated a traditional surface battle fleet, while a second believed a fleet composed of aircraft carriers, [[torpedo boat]]s, and submarines would be ideal. A third faction, led by Admiral Sechi, argued that a balanced fleet with a core of battleships and carriers was the most flexible option.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein &amp; Maurer, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure budgetary space for new construction, Sechi drastically reduced the number of older ships in service; he also cancelled the battleships of the ''Francesco Caracciolo'' class.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein &amp; Maurer, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; ''Francesco Caracciolo'' was sold on 25 October 1920 to the ''Navigazione Generale Italiana'' shipping company. The firm planned to convert her into a merchant ship, but the work was deemed too expensive, and so she was temporarily mothballed in [[Baia Bay]] outside [[Naples]].&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt;&lt;ref name=CO64&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, the ''Regia Marina'' had returned to the idea of converting the ship into an aircraft carrier. In the on-going negotiations [[Washington Naval Conference]], the proposed tonnage limits for the ''Regia Marina'' was to be {{convert|60000|LT}}, which was now to include a converted ''Francesco Caracciolo'' and two new, purpose-built ships. A new conversion design for ''Francesco Caracciolo'' was prepared, with an island superstructure, but Italy's chronic budgetary problems prevented the navy from building any of these ships.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, pp. 64&amp;ndash;65&lt;/ref&gt; ''Francesco Caracciolo'' was subsequently broken up for scrap,&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt; starting in the fall of 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuschi &amp; O'Hara, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  The other three ships had also been dismantled shortly after the end of the war.&lt;ref name=GG260/&gt;
