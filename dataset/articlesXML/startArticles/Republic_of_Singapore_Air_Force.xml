The '''Republic of Singapore Air Force''' ('''RSAF''') is the [[Air force|air arm]] of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]. It was first established in 1968 as the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC). In 1975, it was renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSAFHIST&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/about/History.html|title=History of RSAF: OUR EARLY DAYS|date=2003 [updated 9 July 2010]|work=Wings on High: 35 Years of the Republic of Singapore Air Force|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)]] (MINDEF)|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1968, the British announced the imminent withdrawal of all their troops east of Suez by the end of 1971. Prior to then, Singapore had depended completely on Britain's [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) for its air defence, while the newly established [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) had concentrated its efforts mainly on building up the [[Singapore Army]].

The predecessor to the RSAF, the SADC, was formed in September 1968. The SADC's immediate task was to set up the Flying Training School to train pilots. Qualified flying instructors were obtained through [[Airwork Services|Airwork Services Limited]], a UK-based company specialising in defence services. Basic training for pilots was carried out using two Cessna light aircraft hired from the Singapore Flying Club. The SADC also enlisted the help of the Royal Air Force which introduced the first flying training syllabus and provided two ex-RAF pilots as instructors, as well as facilities and services at [[Seletar Airport]]. Finally, the first batch of six pilot trainees were sent to the [[United Kingdom]] in August 1968 to undergo training in various technical disciplines. The training was based on the [[Hawker Hunter]], the SADC's first air defence fighter. The following month, another pioneer group of technicians, this time from the rotary wing, were sent to France to begin their technical training on the [[Aérospatiale Alouette III]] helicopter. In 1969, a number of local RAF technicians were released to join the fledging SADC. These [[RAF other ranks|local technicians (local other ranks)]] had experience working on fixed-wing RAF aircraft such as the Hawker Hunter, [[Gloster Javelin]], [[English Electric Canberra]], [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[Avro Shackleton]];&lt;ref name=&quot;CGJ&quot;&gt;Jefford 2001, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as rotary-wing RAF aircraft such as the [[Bristol Belvedere]], [[Westland Wessex]] and [[Westland Whirlwind (helicopter)|Westland Whirlwind]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CGJ&quot;/&gt;

Eight Cessna 172K aircraft – the SADC's first – arrived in May 1969 to be used for basic pilot training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Arrival of Cessna 172K – A Boost to our Fledgling Air Force|url= http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/birth_of_saf/v08n05_history.html|publisher=MINDEF|date=7 May 2004|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December, the first batch of students completed the course. Of these, six were sent to the UK to receive further training. On their return to Singapore in 1970, they were ready to operate the then newly acquired Hawker Hunter fighter aircraft.

The pace of training pilots and ground crew picked up gradually. On 1 August 1969, Minister for the Interior and Defence, [[Lim Kim San]], inaugurated the Flying Training School (FTS) at [[Tengah Air Base]] (then known as RAF Tengah). The inauguration of FTS brought SADC closer to its goal of fulfilling the heavy responsibility of defending Singapore's airspace.

The subsequent arrival of the [[BAC Strikemaster]]s in 1969, used for advanced phase flying training, meant that pilot trainees were now able to earn their initial wings locally rather than overseas. The first batch of locally trained fighter pilots were trained at the FTS and graduated in November 1970. Amongst this batch was 2LT Goh Yong Siang, who later rose to the appointment of Chief of Air Force on 1 July 1995. Gradually, the SADC had its own pilots, flying instructors, air traffic controllers, and ground crew.

When Britain brought forward its plan to withdraw its forces by September 1971, the SADC was suddenly entrusted with a huge responsibility and resources. Britain's former air bases – [[Tengah Air Base|Tengah]], [[Seletar Airport|Seletar]], [[Sembawang Air Base|Sembawang]] and [[Changi Air Base|Changi]] – were handed over to the SADC, as well as its air defence radar station and [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound II]] surface-to-air missiles.

In 1973, the SADC procured [[Short SC.7 Skyvan|Shorts Skyvan]] search-and-locate aircraft and [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] fighter-bombers. With a reliable mix of fighters, fighter-bombers, helicopters and transport aircraft, the SADC was ready to assume the functions of a full-fledged air force. On 1 April 1975, the SADC was renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).&lt;ref name=&quot;RSAFHIST&quot;/&gt;

One of its first commanders was LTC [[Ee Tean Chye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19730123.2.28.aspx|title=VIP send-off for Gen Bulsak|date=23 January 1973|work=[[The Straits Times]]|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]]|page=5|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19720211.2.83.aspx|title=Mr. Lee hosts Istana dinner|date=11 February 1972|work=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|page=12|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2007, Defence minister [[Teo Chee Hean]] announced that the Air Force organisation chart will be re-structured into five major commands, namely the Air Defence and Operations Command (ADOC), the Air Combat Command (ACC), the Participation Command (PC), the Air Power Generation Command (APGC) and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Command (UC). The first to be inaugurated was ADOC, along the restructuring announcement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/about/command_centre.html&lt;/ref&gt;

ADOC is the principal agency in charge of planning and executing peacetime operations and air defence. ADOC is also responsible for the development and operational readiness of the command and control and ground-based air defence units of the RSAF. ADOC comprises Air Surveillance Control Group (ASCG), National Air Defence Group (ADG) and Air Operations Control Group (AOCG).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/commands/adoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

UAV Command was the second command to be inaugurated and become operational in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Inauguration of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Command|publisher=MINDEF|date=25 May 2007 [updated 24 July 2009]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2007/may/25may07_nr.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main structures under UC are Operations &amp; System Development Group (OSDG), headed by the Deputy Commander of UC and Squadrons and UAV Training School (UTS).

The next command to be inaugurated was PC in January 2008. Participation Command comprises the Operations Development Group (ODG), the Helicopter Group (HeliG), the Tactical Air Support Group (TASG), and the Divisional Air Defence Group (DAG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=RSAF Inaugurates Participation Command|publisher=MINDEF|date=4 January 2008 [updated 28 May 2008]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2008/jan/04jan08_nr2.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last two commands, ACC and APGC, were inaugurated together in August 2008 in conjunction with the RSAF 40th Anniversary. The ACC will bring together fighter and transport squadrons under one command, with central planning, control and execution of the air battle in operations. The APGC will enhance the missions of the ACC by ensuring that all air bases remain operational at all times, as well as improving the servicing and turn-around of aircraft to ensure continuous and responsive operations.

The ACC is responsible for the planning, control and execution of the air battle in operations. It brings together all fighter and transport squadrons that will carry out these tasks under a single command which will be responsible for training the pilots and aircrew to think and operate in a fully integrated way. The ACC consists of the Integrated System Development Group (ISDG), Operations Development Group (ODG), Fighter Group (FG) and Transport Group (TG).

The APGC is set up to enable the RSAF to generate and sustain effective, timely and robust air power to meet the operational needs of the SAF. With the APGC, higher operational efficiency within each RSAF Air Base, and secondly, greater integration across the four bases are achieved. The APGC consists of the Operations Development Group (ODG) and four air bases: Changi Air Base, Paya Lebar Air Base, Sembawang Air Base and Tengah Air Base. The four support squadrons still remain organic to each Base but are under direct command of APGC. These four squadrons are: Airfield Maintenance Squadron (AMS), Ground Logistics Squadron (GLS), Field Defence Squadron (FDS) and Flying Support Squadron (FSS).

The Air Force Training Command (AFTC) is an amalgamation of the former Air Force School, Flying Training School and UAV Training school which facilitates training of future pilots and ground crew of the RSAF. The training schools and squadrons under AFTC consist of the Flying Training Institute, Air Warfare Training Institute, and Air Engineering Training Institute.

==Overview==
{{RSAF Infobox}}

The backbone of the RSAF is formed by the Block 52/52+ [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s. These are armed with US-supplied [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120C AMRAAM]] missiles and [[LANTIRN]] targeting pods, laser guided munitions and [[conformal fuel tank]]s for long-range strike.

While Singapore initially bought as many as 70 F-16 planes, on 18 November 2004, it was announced that the RSAF would offer its remaining 7 F-16A/B's to the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. It is believed that these early Block 15OCU aircraft were upgraded to &quot;Falcon One&quot; standard by [[ST Aerospace]] before the transfer and delivered in late 2005. In return, the RSAF was permitted to train at the [[Udon Thani International Airport|Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in north-east Thailand for a specified number of days each year. This would mean that the RSAF will operate only the Block 52/52+ model, as many as 62 F-16CJ/DJ planes.

Due to severe airspace constraints within Singapore, the RSAF operates its aircraft at several overseas locations to provide greater exposure to its pilots. With the F-16C/D Fighting Falcons, [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135R Stratotankers]], [[AH-64 Apache|AH-64D Apaches]] and [[CH-47 Chinook#CH-47D|CH-47SD Chinook]] helicopters based in the United States, the [[Aermacchi S-211|Marchetti S-211s]], [[Pilatus PC-21|PC-21s]], and [[Eurocopter Super Puma|Super Puma]] helicopters in [[Australia]], and the [[A-4SU Super Skyhawk|TA-4SU Super Skyhawks]] in France, almost one third of the force's inventory is based outside Singapore.

In 1994, the RSAF commenced a modernisation program for its fleet of approximately 49 operational (R)[[Northrop F-5#Singapore|F-5E and F-5F]] aircraft. The upgrade was performed by Singapore Technologies Aerospace (STAero) and the upgraded aircraft were designated (R)F-5S and F-5T respectively, operating from Paya Lebar Air Base. These upgraded F-5S/T, equipped with the Galileo Avionica's FIAR Grifo-F X-band Radar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Assets: Fighter aircraft|publisher=MINDEF|date=24 April 2010|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/aircraft/fighters.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM275&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Mike Yeo|date=March 2011|title=Tigers over Lion City|magazine=[[Air Forces Monthly]]|publisher=[[Key Publishing]]|location=[[London]]|issue= 275|pages=86–91|issn=0955-7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2000/04/11/64402/brazil-favours-grifo-f-radar-for-f-5br-upgrade.html|title=Brazil favours Grifo F radar for F-5BR upgrade: &quot;The air force has test flown the Singapore air force's upgraded version of the F-5S/T, fitted with the Grifo F radar.&quot;|date=11 April 2000|work=[[Flightglobal.com]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|accessdate=3 June 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; are thought to be capable of firing the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile but to date, no actual live-firing has actually been reported. For [[in-flight refuelling]], four KC-135Rs and four [[Lockheed Martin KC-130|KC-130Bs]] are commissioned to support the fighter force of F-16C/Ds and (R)F-5S/Ts.

[[Airborne Early Warning and Control]] (AEW&amp;C) capability was introduced in 1987 when four [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeyes]] were delivered to 111 Squadron. The duty of [[Maritime patrol|Maritime Patrol and Coastal surveillance]] is performed by the five Fokker 50 MPA (entered service in 1991) of 121 Squadron, which can be armed with long-range anti-shipping [[Harpoon (missile)|AGM-84 Harpoon]] missiles and ASW torpedoes.

As part of its fleet renewal process, the RSAF officially withdrew its fleet of [[ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk]] from front-line service on 31 March 2005 after 31 years of operations. The A-4SUs' achievements included flying directly from Singapore to the Philippines, incorporating the RSAF's first air-to-air refuelling mission in 1986, as well as the excellent aerobatic display of the 'red and white' Super Skyhawks flown by the [[RSAF Black Knights]] during Asian Aerospace 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSAFBK&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/black_knights/history.html|title=RSAF Black Knights 2008: History|date=24 April 2010|publisher=MINDEF|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month before its retirement, the Skyhawk squadron won top honours in a strike exercise against its more modern F-16 and F-5 counterparts.

Singapore ordered a total of twenty [[AH-64 Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow]] attack helicopters in two batches. After a long period of negotiations over the delivery of the sophisticated Longbow [[Fire-control radar]], the first batch of eight aircraft, fitted with the Fire Control Radar, was delivered on 17 May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Singapore Receives First AH-64D Apache Longbow Attack Helicopter|publisher=MINDEF|date=18 May 2002 [updated 26 June 2006]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2002/may/18may02_nr2.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second batch of 12 Apaches were ordered in 2001 even before the first delivery took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Singapore to Purchase 12 Additional Boeing AH-64D Apache Longbows|publisher=[[Boeing]]|date=23 August 2001|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2001/q3/nr_010823o.htm|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the initial eight Apaches are based in the United States. Three of the Apache Longbows returned in January 2006 at the request of the Minister of Defence.

Apart from the six CH-47SDs delivered from 1996, a new batch of six aircraft was ordered in 1997, with an option of four extra airframes. At least 12 CH-47SD have been delivered and are in service at Sembawang Air Base. It is believed that these had been upgraded to the SD standard prior to delivery.

Eight CH-47SDs were also deployed to support the relief efforts in the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indonesian Tsunami]]. It was the first and one of the few countries to reach the affected areas. The RSAF deployed dozens of C-130Hs, CH-47SDs and AS 332Ms there along with three of the RSN's latest Landing Ship Tanks (RSS Endurance, RSS Persistence and RSS Endeavour of the [[Endurance class landing platform dock ship|''Endurance'' class LST]]) as well as [[Singapore Armed Forces]] vehicles, engineers, and medical teams.

In September 2005, the RSAF sent three CH-47SD Chinook helicopters, later augmented by a fourth CH-47SD Chinook, to provide assistance in the rescue and evacuation of stranded civilians after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans and nearby areas in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Sep/08-339829.html|title=Asia-Pacific Opens Hearts, Wallets to U.S. Victims of Katrina|last=Jane A.

Since 2003, the RSAF has also made deployments of KC-135 tankers and C-130 aircraft to the [[Persian Gulf]] in support of the multinational efforts for the [[reconstruction of Iraq]]. RSAF personnel have carried out airlift, transportation and supply, and air-to-air refuelling missions in support of the multinational forces, assisting the [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] in carrying supplies and personnel, transporting humanitarian material and conducting medical evacuation operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=SAF KC-135 Deployment to Aid in the Reconstruction of Iraq|publisher=MINDEF|date=9 June 2004 [updated 15 June 2005]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2004/jun/09jun04_nr.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=SAF Deploys LST and C-130 to Assist in Reconstruction of Iraq|publisher=MINDEF|date=27 October 2003 [updated 4 July 2008]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2003/oct/27oct03_nr.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, Defence Minister [[Ng Eng Hen]] stated in a parliamentary reply that Singapore would soon acquire the [[Aster (missile family)#Land systems|Aster 30]] land-based missile system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/press_room/official_releases/ps/2013/16sep13_ps.html#.Ujy6M5ygtyE&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
{{Main|Singapore Armed Forces ranks}}
Military ranks in the Singapore Armed Forces are identical across the three services except for the flag ranks of the [[Republic of Singapore Navy|RSN]]. They are based on the Army model. The official table of ranks stops at three stars for all three services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/about/Ranks.html|title=About us: Ranks|year=2011|publisher=MINDEF|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NATO]] rank codes are not officially used, but are listed here for easy comparison with other armed forces.

Like the [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Navy]], the majority of Air Force personnel are regulars. This is due to the specialised and technical nature of many jobs. The employment of [[Conscription in Singapore|National Servicemen]] in various roles are limited mostly to the infantry-like Field Defence Squadrons which do not require such specialised training.

The [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle#F-15SG|F-15SG Strike Eagle]] is a variant of the F-15E Strike Eagle and is similar in configuration to the F-15K sold to [[South Korea]], but differs in the addition of the [[APG-63 and APG-70#AN/APG-63(V)3|APG-63(V)3]] active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar developed by [[Raytheon]]. The F-15SG will be powered by two [[General Electric]] [[General Electric F110|F110-GE-129]] {{convert|29400|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust engines.

In February 2003, Singapore joined the [[F-35 Lightning II#Security Cooperative Participants (SCP)|JSF program's]] System Design and Development (SDD) Phase, as a Security Co-operation Participant (SCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Singapore Signs Letter of Intent for Joint Strike Fighter Programme|publisher=MINDEF|date=22 February 2003 [updated 17 March 2006]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2003/feb/22feb03_nr2.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Singapore Joins Joint Strike Fighter Programme|publisher=MINDEF|date=16 March 2004 [updated 4 June 2010]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2004/mar/16mar04_nr.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first deliveries of the F-35 are not expected before 2015, but replacement for some of the [[ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk]]s was needed by 2007. As a start, 20 F-16D Block 52+ have been delivered from 2003 under project Peace Carvin IV.The initial order is for 12 aircraft with 8 options. Eventually, as many as 40 to 60 aircraft may be procured in several batches. Pending news on [[Lockheed Martin]]'s [[F-35 Lightning II]]'s progress, it is speculated that more F-15SGs may be bought, with the upper limit, as disclosed by the RSAF, being 80 F-15SG aircraft in total. On 22 October 2007, Singapore's Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) exercised the option to purchase eight more F-15SG fighters as part of the original contract signed in 2005. Along with this buy, an additional order for four F-15SGs was made, bringing the total number of F-15SGs purchased to 24. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 

The RSAF embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace the ageing A-4SU Super Skyhawks. The original list of competitors was shortlisted to the final two – [[Dassault Rafale]] and the [[F-15E Strike Eagle#F-15SG|F-15SG Strike Eagle]]. The DSTA (Defense Science &amp; Technology Agency) conducted detailed technical assessment, simulations and other tests to assess the final selection. On 6 September 2005, it was announced that the Boeing F-15SG Strike Eagle had won the contract over the Rafale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Singapore Seals Deal to Acquire Twelve F-15SG|publisher=MINDEF|date=12 December 2005 [updated 18 April 2006]|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2005/dec/12dec05_nr.html|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All 20 AH-64D Longbow attack helicopters have been delivered, achieving pilot IOC. 12 of these Longbow Apaches were deployed back to Singapore and took part in combined arms exercises with the Army.

The backbone of the transport fleet are the four KC-130B, one KC-130H and five C-130H Hercules transport aircraft, which are expected to remain in service through 2030, will be undergoing an extensive modernisation process to bring all ten existing airframe to the same common standard. The first airframe, a KC-130B, was returned to frontline service on 21 September 2010. ST Aerospace, the main contractor behind the project, is expected to upgrade the other nine airframes for the RSAF within the next seven years. Included in the package is the replacement of cockpit [[flight management system]] with a modern [[glass cockpit]] avionics suite, central engine displays to replace analogue gauges, improved voice communications, digital autopilot, flight director as well as a digital weather radar, which will make the aircraft [[Global Air Traffic Management]]-compliant. Also, the C-130Bs will receive an [[auxiliary power unit]] and [[Environmental Control System|environmental control system]] in common with the C-130Hs. Once the upgrade is completed, this will effectively give the RSAF five refueller KC-130Hs and five Cargo C-130Hs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.key.aero/view_news.asp?ID=2529&amp;thisSection=military|title=Singapore gets first upgraded C-130|author=Gary Parsons|date=21 September 2010|publisher=Key Publishing|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/11/12/349670/singapores-c-130-upgrade-makes-progress.html|title=Singapore's C-130 upgrade makes progress|author=Greg Waldron|date=12 November 2010|publisher=FlightGlobal.com|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the RSAF issued a letter of request to inspect stored ex-US Navy [[P-3C Orion]] aircraft that have been retired from active duty. Lockheed Martin believes the RSAF has a requirement of 4 to 5 of these aircraft, which would be modernised extensively before reintroduction into active service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/15/350934/singapore-interested-in-ex-us-navy-p-3s.html|title=Singapore interested in ex-US Navy P-3s|last=Craig Hoyle|date=15 December 2010|publisher=Flightglobal.com|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
