'''Chalmers W. &quot;Bump&quot; Elliott''' (born January 30, 1925)&lt;ref name=CFHOF&gt;{{cite web |title=College Football Hall of Fame: Bump Elliott |url=http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=40051 |publisher=College Football Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[American football]] player, coach, and college athletics administrator.  He played [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] at [[Purdue University]] (1943–1944) and the [[University of Michigan]] (1946–1947).  Elliott grew up in [[Bloomington, Illinois]], enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a senior in high school and was assigned to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Purdue University]].  He received [[varsity letter]]s in football, [[baseball]], and [[basketball]] at Purdue, before being called into active duty in late 1944, serving with the Marines in China.

After being discharged from the military, he enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1946 and joined the football team for whom his brother [[Pete Elliott]] played [[quarterback]].  In 1947, he played for an undefeated and untied [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan football team]] known as the &quot;Mad Magicians&quot;, led the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Nine Conference]] in scoring, won the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football]] trophy as the [[Most Valuable Player]] in the Conference, and was selected as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by the [[American Football Coaches Association]].

After graduating from Michigan in 1948, Elliott spent ten years as an assistant football coach at [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]], [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], and Michigan.  He was appointed as Michigan's head football coach in 1959 and held that position until 1968, leading the team to a [[Big Ten Conference]] championship and [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] victory in the 1964 season.  For a period of 21 years, from 1970 to 1991, he was the [[athletic director]] at the [[University of Iowa]].  During his tenure as athletic director, he hired coaches [[Dan Gable]], [[Hayden Fry]], [[Lute Olson]], [[C. Vivian Stringer]], and [[Tom Davis (basketball, born 1938)|Dr. Tom Davis]], and the [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] won 41 [[Big Ten Conference]] championships and 11 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] titles.  In 1989, Elliott was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Elliott was born in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], but grew up in [[Bloomington, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=Hired&gt;{{cite news |title=Bump Elliott Named Iowa Athletic Director |publisher=Iowa City Press-Citizen |date=1970-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Dr. J. Norman Elliott, was an [[Otolaryngology|ears, nose and throat doctor]] who also coached football at [[Illinois Wesleyan University]] from 1930 to 1934.&lt;ref name=Clash&gt;{{cite news |title=Brothers Could Clash Someday |publisher=Charleston Daily Mail |date=1958-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott's given name is Chalmers, but he has been known by the nickname &quot;Bump&quot; since he was six months old, though nobody remembers how he got the nickname, &quot;not even his mother.&quot;&lt;ref name=Betsy&gt;{{cite news |author=Lowery, Lucie |title=Football Fills Lives of Bump Elliott Family |publisher=The Independent (Pasadena) |date=1964-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliott and his younger brother, [[Pete Elliott]], both played football together for [[Bloomington High School (Illinois)|Bloomington High School]], where Bump was an All-State [[running back|halfback]] in 1942, and Pete made it as a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=McCormick /&gt;  Had it not been for World War II, Bump and Pete likely would have attended the [[University of Illinois]], which was about 50 miles from their home in Bloomington.  However, both brothers wanted to get into the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], and Illinois did not have such a program.&lt;ref name=McCormick /&gt;  Bump enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] while still a senior in high school and was called to active duty in 1943.  He was assigned to the V-12 officer training program at [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref name=Grid /&gt;  His brother, Pete, also enlisted and was assigned to officer training at Michigan.

==Purdue University and military service==
Elliott attended Purdue from 1943–1944.  In his freshman year, Elliott earned [[varsity letter]]s in football, [[basketball]] and [[baseball]].  He played three games for the unbeaten and untied 1943 [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue football]] team where he was described as &quot;a capable triple-threater and stellar defensive performer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big Ten Notes |publisher=San Antonio Express |date=1944-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He scored a [[touchdown]] against [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] in his first game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Late Score Gives Purdue 14–7 Win Over Minnesota |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1943-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a key [[interception]] at Purdue's ten-yard line in the season's final game against [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ryan, Cornelius |title=Purdue eleven ends season with 7–0 win over Indiana |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1943-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A May 1944 newspaper article reported that the 19-year-old Elliott, who had been a &quot;high school sensation last year,&quot;&lt;ref name=Sholl /&gt; had won three major athletic letters in his first year as a Naval V-12 student at Purdue.  &quot;A speedy 160-pound, five foot 10-inch performer, he lost little time making his mark in football last fall once he became eligible upon completion of his first [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12]] term.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sholl&gt;{{cite news |author=Sholl, Harry |title=Eight To Go |publisher=The Vidette-Messenger (Valparaiso, Ind.) |date=1944-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott appeared in the final three games of the football season, and his performance in the season's final game against [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] &quot;provided one of the highlights of the Boilermaker season.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sholl /&gt;

In basketball, he was &quot;consistent as a [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] on Purdue's cage combination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chalmers Elliott Speaks for Frosh |publisher=Council Bluffs Iowa Nonpareil |date=1944-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In baseball, Elliott played [[shortstop]] and [[center fielder|center field]], where he was &quot;a steady fielder with a strong arm.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sholl /&gt;  In a May 1944 game, Elliott led the [[Purdue Boilermakers|Boilermakers]] to a 17–4 win over [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]], with five [[Hit (baseball)|hits]], five [[stolen base]]s, four [[RBI]]s, three [[Run (baseball)|runs scored]], and four [[putout]]s in [[Baseball field#outfield|center field]].  His performance against Wisconsin was &quot;one of the biggest baseball days ever turned&quot; by a Big Ten baseball player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Purdue Swamps Wisconsin in Seven-Inning Tilt, 17-4 |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1944-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliott played in the first six games of the 1944 football season for Purdue before being transferred by the Marine Corps.  In a game against [[Marquette University|Marquette]] in late September, he broke up a 7–7 tie with successive [[touchdown]] runs of 24 and 71 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saturday's Stars |publisher=Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune |date=1944-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also the only defensive player in 1944 to pull down Illinois' [[Buddy Young|Claude &quot;Buddy&quot; Young]] from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves Prep For Purdue 11 Saturday |publisher=The News-Palladium, Benton Harbor, Mich. |date=1944-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott received orders to report for active duty in October 1944, and he played his last game in a Purdue uniform against the [[Michigan Wolverines]] on October 28, 1944.&lt;ref name=Grid&gt;{{cite news |title=Lions H.S. Grid Banquet: To Hear Bump Elliott of Iowa University |publisher=Blue Island Sun-Standard |date=1952-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1944, Elliott was sent to [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]].  He was later sent to China and emerged from the war as a Marine [[lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves Prep For Purdue 11 Saturday |publisher=The Oelwein Daily Register |date=1944-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Michigan==
Elliott and his younger brother, [[Pete Elliott]], were teammates at [[Bloomington High School (Illinois)|Bloomington High School]] in 1943 and again at Michigan in 1946 and 1947.  After his discharge from the military, Bump joined Pete at Michigan, where Pete played quarterback and Bump was the right halfback for the undefeated [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 team]].&lt;ref name=McCormick /&gt;  Before the [[1948 Rose Bowl]], one article noted that the two brothers roomed together at Michigan and arranged their programs so that their classes were identical.  The article observed: &quot;They look alike, act alike and think alike and in Ann Arbor, Mich., when they walk down the street any Michigan student can recognize Bump and Pete, the inseparable Elliott Brothers, Wolverines right half and quarterback respectively.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bussey&gt;{{cite news |author=Bussey, Beverly |title=Bump, Pete Elliott Are Great Wolverine Duo |publisher=[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]] |date=1947-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The brothers shared the same distinctive golden red hair, and the two were so close that they told a reporter in 1947 that a girl had to receive &quot;the Bumper stamp of approval&quot; before passing Pete's test.&lt;ref name=Bussey /&gt;

===1946 season===
After being discharged from the Marine Corps, Elliott attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he joined his brother, Pete, in Michigan's [[backfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Bump' Elliott, Ex-Purdue Star, Joins Michigan |publisher=The Wisconsin State Journal |date=1946-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott &quot;practically stepped off a World War II [[Troopship|transport]] from Marine Corps duty in China to Michigan's [[Ferry Field]] and stardom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan Grid Coach Will Be Here Tonight |publisher=Ironwood Daily Globe |date=1961-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With less than a week of conditioning after his discharge from the Marines, he was reported to be giving Michigan's coaching staff &quot;something lovely to look at.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='M' Coaches See New Star in Ex-Marine |publisher=The News-Palladium, Benton Harbor, Mich. |date=1946-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 14–14 tie with [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] in mid-October 1946, Elliott scored all 14 of Michigan's points.  He scored the first [[touchdown]] late in the first quarter on a 37-yard [[Forward pass|pass]] from [[Bob Chappuis]] in the corner of the [[end zone]].  In the fourth quarter, Michigan [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] Bob Wiese [[intercepted]] a [[Forward pass|pass]] on Michigan's 1-yard line, and [[Lateral pass|lateralled]] to Elliott on the Michigan 40-yard line.  From that point, Elliott ran it back 60 yards down the [[Sidelines|sideline]] for his second [[touchdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swiped Pass Lets Wolves Salvage Tie: Wildcat Lead Wiped Out in Last Quarter |publisher=Council Bluffs Iowa Nonpareil |date=1946-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He again scored two touchdowns in Michigan's 21-0 win over [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] on November 2, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swiped Wolves Can Win Big 9 Title If Ohio State Co-Operates |publisher=The News-Palladium, Benton Harbor, Mich. |date=1946-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also helped Michigan to a 28–6 win over [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]] with a bullet [[Forward pass|pass]] to end [[Bob Mann (American football)|Bob Mann]] in the [[end zone]].

===Big Nine MVP in 1947===
[[File:Bump Elliott 74 yard touchdown run, 1947.png|thumb|right|190px|Elliott runs 74 yards for a touchdown against Illinois, 1945]]
In 1947, Elliott played for the Wolverines team known as the &quot;Mad Magicians&quot; that went undefeated and untied, and defeated the [[USC Trojans football|Southern Cal Trojans]], 49–0 in the [[1948 Rose Bowl]].  The team is considered to be the greatest Michigan team of all time.&lt;ref name=ESPNB10&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Todd |editor=MacCambridge, Michael |title=ESPN Big Ten College Football Encyclopedia |chapter=Michigan |publisher=ESPN Enterprises |year=2007 |isbn=1-933060-49-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Bob Chappuis]], Elliott was one of the key players in Michigan's undefeated season.  He led the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Nine]] in scoring, made the [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] team picked by the [[American Football Coaches Association]], and was voted [[Most Valuable Player]] in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Nine Conference]] to win the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football]] trophy.  Elliott was one of two Michigan players in 1947 (the other was fullback Jack Weisenburger) who played both offense and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Specialist |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1947-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Elliott was actually a four-way threat as he contributed in [[Rush (American football)|rushing]], [[Reception (American football)|receiving]], [[punt return]]s, and defense.  He scored a total of 12 [[touchdown]]s in 1947—eight [[Rush (American football)|rushing]], two receiving, one on a [[punt return]], and another on an [[interception]] return.&lt;ref name=Bentley /&gt;  He contributed 911&amp;nbsp;[[all-purpose yardage]] – 438 rushing, 318 receiving, and 155 on punt returns.&lt;ref name=Bentley /&gt;  He averaged 6.4 yards per carry as a rusher, 19.9 yards per reception, and 17.2 yards per punt return.&lt;ref name=Bentley /&gt;  Michigan head coach [[Fritz Crisler]] called Elliott the greatest right halfback he had ever seen.&lt;ref name=Bentley&gt;{{cite web |title=Bump Elliott |url=http://www.umich.edu/~bhl/athdept/football/coaches/celliott.htm |publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliott had a breakthrough season that began with the team's &quot;Blue&quot; versus &quot;White&quot; exhibition game in mid-September in which he scored four touchdowns, including 50- and 60-yard runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Four Touchdowns for Bump Elliott |publisher=Council Bluffs Iowa Nonpareil |date=1947-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He scored touchdowns in each of the team's early season wins over [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] (55–0),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan Serves Warning to Big Nine; Manhandles Spartans in 55-0 Landslide |publisher=Nevada State Journal |date=1947-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] (49-13),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan Powerhouse Whips Stanford, 49-13 |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1947-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pitt Panthers football|Pitt]] (69-0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan's Power Crushes Pitt, 69-0 |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1947-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His touchdown against Pitt came on defense, as he [[intercepted]] a [[Forward pass|pass]] and ran it back 37 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverines in Easy 69-0 Win Over Panthers |publisher=Kingsport Times-News |date=1947-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Big Nine opener against [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]], Elliott scored on a nine-yard run less than two minutes after the game started, as the Wolverines won, 49-21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Open Big Nine Drive in Easy 49-21 Victory: Win Is Powerful Michigan's Fourth Straight |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1947-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Michigan's closest contest of the 1947 season, a 13-6 win over [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]], Elliott caught a 40-yard [[Forward pass|pass]] from [[Bob Chappuis]] on his fingertips at the Minnesota 15-yard line and went on to score with a minute and 15 seconds to go in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minnesota line Nearly Upsets Michigan, 13-6 |publisher=Waterloo Daily Courier |date=1947-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said one reporter: &quot;It was the exceptional speed of Elliott on this play that turned the tide.  He completely outmaneuvered the Minnesota secondary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan, Texas Extended But Retain Clean Records |publisher=Charleston Gazette (West Virginia) |date=1947-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest challenge of the 1947 season came in a 14–7 win over [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]].  The [[Associated Press]] described Elliott as Michigan's &quot;Big Cog&quot; in the Illinois game,&lt;ref name=Illinois&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves Clear Big Hurdle: Michigan Topples Illini, 14-7 |publisher=Council Bluffs Iowa Nonpareil |date=1947-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Press]] proclaimed: &quot;Bump Elliott Steals Show in 14 to 7 Defeat of Illinois Saturday.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Three Hurdles Between Mich. and Rose Bowl: Bump Elliott Steals Show in 14 to 7 Defeat of Illinois Saturday |publisher=Record-Eagle, Traverse City, Mich. |date=1947-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first quarter, he ran back a punt 75 yards for a touchdown, as Bob Mann &quot;bulldozed the path with a vicious block&quot;, and &quot;the Bloomington blaster scampered down the sidelines.&quot;&lt;ref name=Illinois /&gt;  Elliott also set up the Wolverines second score with a long reception to the Illinois four-yard line.  He also played a key role on defense, intercepting a pass at the Michigan nine-yard line to halt an Illinois drive.&lt;ref name=Illinois /&gt;  Another article concluded: &quot;The individual hero was Bump Elliott, a 168-pound halfback who loped 74 yards for one touchdown and caught a pass for a 52 yard gain to set up the second and winning marker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan, Past Toughest Hurdles, Appears Sure Bet to Play in Rose Bowl |publisher=The Daily Register, Harrisburg, Ill. |date=1947-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He finished the season scoring two touchdowns each in games against Indiana and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan Rocks Hoosiers, 35-0 |publisher=The Long Beach Press-Telegram |date=1947-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michigan Completes Perfect Season: Ohio State Bows to Wolverines by 21-0 Score |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1947-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the season, Elliott and [[Bob Chappuis]] both received 16 of 18 possible points in voting by the [[Associated Press|AP]] for the All-Big Nine football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverines Get 4 on All-Big Nine |publisher=Charleston Daily Mail |date=1947-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott weighed only {{convert|160|lb|kg stlb|1}} during his All-American season in 1947.  Asked later about how he managed to compete at his weight, Elliott noted, &quot;I was awful lucky to get by at that weight.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peppers&gt;{{cite news |author=Schrader, Gus |title=Red Peppers: The Danger to Young Coaches |publisher=Cedar Rapids Gazette |date=1952-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948 Rose Bowl against Southern Cal===
[[File:Elliott Brothers, Fritz Crisler and Bruce Hilkene.png|200px|thumb|right|Elliot, brother Pete (No. 45), [[Fritz Crisler]] and [[Bruce Hilkene]] (No. 75) celebrate Big 9 championship after defeating Wisconsin.]]
As the Big Nine Conference champions, the 1947 Wolverines were invited to play in the [[1948 Rose Bowl]] game against the Southern Cal Trojans.  Michigan dominated the game, winning 49–0, as &quot;the shifty Chappuis and the speedy Elliott began to fake (the Trojans) out of their shoes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Stiles, Maxwell |title=Michigan Rips Trojans Apart |publisher=Long Beach Press-Telegram |date=1948-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott scored on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Chappuis.  In August 1948, Elliott was chosen as the captain of the College All-Stars in their game against the [[Chicago Cardinals]] at [[Soldier Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ward, Al |title=Patrolling the Sport Highway |publisher=The Ogden (Utah) Standard-Examiner |date=1948-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Injured in practice, Elliott was unable to play as the Cardinals beat the All-Stars, 28–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Liska, Jerry |title=Chicago Cards Roll Over All Stars 28 to 0 |publisher=Council Bluffs Nonpareil |date=1948-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application for 1948 eligibility denied===
Elliott applied for an extra year of eligibility in 1948.  Due to his military service, he played in only three games as a freshman and six games in his sophomore season.  Under the Big Nine conference code, he was eligible for a fifth season due to a war-caused stay at Purdue in 1943–1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bump Elliott May Play Again for Wolverines |publisher=The Lima News |date=1947-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his request was denied by the Big Nine Conference.  The decision was criticized by Michigan's representative on the Big Nine faculty committee as a &quot;grave injustice.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ineligible&gt;{{cite news |title=Bump Elliott Ruled Ineligible for Further Grid Competition |publisher=Ironwood Daily Globe |date=1948-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, Elliott set the Michigan career [[interception]] [[return yards]] record that stood for five years until [[Don Oldham]] pushed the record from 174&amp;nbsp;yards to 181&amp;nbsp;yards.  His 174 career yards still ranks fifth in school history.&lt;ref name=RB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgoblue.com/document_file/fbl-2007spring-records1.pdf |title=Record Book |accessdate=2008-01-01 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Michigan &amp; Host Interactive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229173113/http://www.mgoblue.com/document_file/fbl-2007spring-records1.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
The Elliott brothers served as assistant coaches together at [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]] in 1949 and 1950, before going their separate ways.&lt;ref name=Brothers&gt;{{cite news |title=Bump Elliott Selected ‘Coach of the Week’ |publisher=The Holland, Michigan Evening Sentinel |date=1963-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Elliotts' coached against each other in the early 1960s while Bump was the head football coach at Michigan and Pete held the same position at the [[University of Illinois]].&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;{{cite news |author=McCormick, Henry J. |title=Playing the Game: Saga of The Elliott Brothers |publisher=Wisconsin State Journal |date=1960-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1963, Pete Elliott's  Illinois team was ranked No. 2 in the country and the favorite for the Rose Bowl when it faced off against Bump Elliott's Michigan team.  Michigan had a record of 2–3–1 when the brothers met in 1963, but Michigan came out on top, 14–8, marking the fourth time in four games that Bump's Wolverines came out on top of brother Pete's Illini.&lt;ref name=Brothers /&gt;

After graduating from Michigan, Bump turned down an offer to play professional football for the [[Detroit Lions]], saying he said he had obtained a job in Chicago outside of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playing Bump Elliott Spurns Lions |publisher=Syracuse Herald Journal |date=1948-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching.  He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach.&lt;ref name=Grid /&gt;  In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under [[Kip Taylor]] at [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]], where he remained for three seasons, from 1949–1951.&lt;ref name=Hired /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grid /&gt;  Elliott later recalled, &quot;I was only 24 when Kip Taylor hired me as backfield coach at Oregon State, and it bothered me a little because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peppers /&gt;  It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends.  Bump recalled: &quot;After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a [[cigarette|cigaret]].  One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't [[Tobacco smoking|smoke]], coach; I didn't do it when I was your age.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peppers /&gt;  Oregon State had an overall record of 14–15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.

In 1952, Elliott was hired as an assistant at the [[University of Iowa]] under its head coach, [[Forest Evashevski]], another former All-American at the [[University of Michigan]].  On being hired at Iowa, Elliott said, &quot;I should feel at home back in the Big Ten.  I grew up in Bloomington – 40 miles from Illinois.  I played at Purdue and Michigan and coached at Michigan.  My father went to Iowa and Northwestern and now I’m coaching at Iowa.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peppers /&gt;  He stayed at Iowa until 1957.&lt;ref name=Hired /&gt;  Elliott was with the Hawkeyes in 1956 when they went 9–1, won the Big Ten championship, and defeated his former team, Oregon State, 35–19, in the 1957 Rose Bowl game.

He returned to Michigan in 1957 as a backfield coach under [[Bennie Oosterbaan]].&lt;ref name=Hired /&gt; In 1959, Elliott was elevated to head football coach at Michigan.  He was the head coach for ten years from 1959 to 1968, posting a career record of 51–42–2, for a .547 winning percentage. In [[Big Ten Conference]] play, his record was 32–34–2 (.485).

Although his tenure at Michigan was unsuccessful by the school's historic standards, he did lead the 1964 Wolverines to a 9–1 record, a Big Ten title and a win in the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] against [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]].  His final team, in 1968, won eight of its first nine games but then suffered a humiliating 50–14 loss against [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]].  Despite having a 36-point lead, Ohio State Coach [[Woody Hayes]] passed for, and failed to get, a two-point conversion after the final score and with 1:23 remaining in the game.  When asked why he went for the two-point conversion, Hayes reportedly said, &quot;Because we couldn't go for three!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Miller, Rusty |title=The Game: Buckeyes, Michigan renew rivalry |publisher=The Indiana Gazette |date=2002-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the game, Elliott resigned, and athletic director [[Don Canham]] hired [[Bo Schembechler]] to replace him as head coach. Schembechler would use the memory of the 1968 Ohio State loss to motivate his team the following season.&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt;

There were reports during the 1968 season that Elliott had been given an ultimatum: &quot;Either win or face the possibility of being kick upstairs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ultimatum&gt;{{cite news |author=Ford, Bob |title=Warmath Called Michigan Shot; Canham Helped |publisher=The Kokomo Tribune |date=1968-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also reports when Don Canham was hired that Elliott had expected to be named athletic director and that there was &quot;bad blood&quot; between Canham and Elliott.&lt;ref name=Ultimatum /&gt;

However, Canham later denied that Elliott was &quot;eased out&quot; of his job.  In an interview with [[Joe Falls]], Canham said: &quot;Bump and I are close personal friends.  Bump is not naïve – he knows that when you work at a place for 10 years and you’re not winning consistently, it doesn’t become fun for anybody – the coach, the alumni, the players or anybody else.  We talked about this and we talked about it openly.  If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him.  I mean that.  I didn’t fire Bump Elliott.  My first year as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record.  Anyone could live with that.&quot;&lt;ref name=Grady&gt;{{cite news |author=Grady, Al |title=Words From A New Book About Bo Schembechler |publisher=Iowa City Press-Citizen |date=1973-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Canham, he met with Elliott in December 1968 and offered him the job of associate athletic director.  Canham told Elliott he could stay on as coach if he wanted, but Canham could not promise him that the job of associate athletic director would still be open in another couple of years.  Canham said: &quot;Bump smiled at me and said, ‘I don’t have to think about it.’  He was ready to get out.  I did not force him, and I mean that in all honesty.  But the job had ceased to be fun for him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt;

Schembechler later recalled that he remained loyal to Elliott when he took over as Michigan's head coach in 1969.  When Schembechler won the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] championship in 1969, he said, &quot;I made certain I let everyone know I won with Bump's kids.  Bump was a man of great class and he showed it to me again and again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me.&quot;&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt;  After Michigan won the [[1969 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game|1969 Ohio State game]], the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that &quot;I don’t remember when I felt happier about anything in my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt;

From 1969 to 1970, Elliott was the associate director of athletics at Michigan.&lt;ref name=Hired /&gt;

==Athletic director at Iowa==
Elliott became the [[Men's athletic director]] at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1970, succeeding [[Forest Evashevski]].  He came to Iowa in the midst of a feud between athletic director [[Forest Evashevski]] and football coach [[Ray Nagel]].  Evashevski resigned in May 1970, and Elliott was hired to replace him.  On accepting the job, Elliott noted: &quot;It's difficult to leave a town where you’ve lived for 13 years ([[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]), but the opportunity is so good at Iowa with the people and the school that no one could pass it up.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hired /&gt;

During Elliott's tenure, the school's teams won 34 [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] championships and 11 [[NCAA]] titles, as well as making three Rose Bowl appearances and one trip to the Final Four in basketball. The university also built a basketball arena ([[Carver-Hawkeye Arena]]), erected an indoor workout center for football and added more than 10,000 seats to its football stadium.&lt;ref name=Retires&gt;{{cite news |title=Bump Elliott announces  his retirement: Iowa athletic director to end 21-year tenure |publisher=Waterloo Courier |date=1991-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His career at Iowa was marked by a general resurgence in the competitiveness of Iowa athletics.  Elliott hired a number of notable coaches, including [[Lute Olson]], [[Dan Gable]], [[Hayden Fry]], and [[Tom Davis (basketball, born 1938)|Dr. Tom Davis]].  During Elliott's 21 years as athletic director, the [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] won 41 Big Ten championships in football (1981, 1985, 1990), [[wrestling]] (1974–1990), men's [[basketball]] (1970, 1979), [[baseball]] (1972, 1974, 1990), men's [[gymnastics]] (1972, 1974, 1986), men's [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] (1981, 1982). ''See'' [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] for complete list of championships.

Elliott was known as &quot;a coach's AD.&quot;&lt;ref name=Retires /&gt;  &quot;He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, latitude and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules.&quot;&lt;ref name=Retires /&gt;  Iowa wrestling coach [[Dan Gable]] said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired.  In 1999, Gable wrote: &quot;Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I had a meeting with Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EWAOC7EYCCUC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=Coaching Wrestling Successfully |first=Dan |last=Gable |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-87322-404-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university,&quot;&lt;ref name=Firn /&gt; Elliott said at the time of his retirement.  &quot;There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs.  I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs.  I wanted absolute loyalty.  If not, then that person could leave any time.&quot;&lt;ref name=Firn&gt;{{cite book |author=Mike Firn, Chadi Leistikow |title=Hawkeye Legends, List &amp; Lore, p. 195 |publisher=Sports Publishing LLC |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cP7rCdVdFFcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA195&amp;lpg=RA2 PA195&amp;dq=bump+elliott |isbn=978-1-57167-178-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliott was also the one who hired [[Hayden Fry]] as Iowa's football coach in 1979.  Fry later said that Elliott was one of the principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa.  In his autobiography, Fry wrote: &quot;Iowa had one thing in its favor as far as I was concerned: Bump Elliott was its athletic director.  Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fry, Hayden |title=Hayden Fry: A High-Porch Picnic, p. 99 |publisher=Sport Publishing LLC |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired.  Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott what he meant.  Elliott said, &quot;Simple, I don’t think they’ll give me a chance to hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, neither will I.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fry, Hayden |title=Hayden Fry: A High-Porch Picnic, p. 100 |publisher=Sport Publishing LLC |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the only person to have been with Rose Bowl teams in five capacities – player, assistant coach, head coach, assistant athletic director, and athletic director.&lt;ref name=Retires /&gt;

==Family==
Elliott and his wife Barbara met while he was with the Marine Corps at Purdue and she was studying pre-school education there.&lt;ref name=Betsy /&gt;  They married in 1949, and have three children, Bill (born October 1951), Bob (born May 1953), and Betsy (born c. 1955).&lt;ref name=Hired /&gt;&lt;ref name=Betsy /&gt;  Son Bob Elliott was Iowa's [[defensive coordinator]] under [[Hayden Fry]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elliott's recovery from transplant going well |publisher=Wa terloo Courier |date=1999-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and accolades==
Elliott has received numerous honors and accolades, including the following:
* Recipient of the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football]] as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Nine Conference in 1947;&lt;ref name=CFHOF /&gt;
* Selected as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by the [[American Football Coaches Association]] in 1947;&lt;ref name=CFHOF /&gt;
* Inducted into the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in 1986 for his contributions in football, basketball, baseball, and as a football coach;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Michigan Hall of Honor |url=http://www.letterwinnersmclub.com/hallofhonor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1989;&lt;ref name=CFHOF /&gt;

* Inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2002;&lt;ref name=MSHOF /&gt; and
* Elliott Drive, the [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]] street on which [[Carver-Hawkeye Arena]] is located, is named in his honor. The sculpture of the 12' stainless steel hawk, Strike Force, is located in a small park just south of Carver-Hawkeye arena. In addition to the street in his name and the sculpture, a scholarship in Elliott's name were all spearheaded by his good friend Earle Murphy to honor Bump and future Iowa athletes.
