==Old comments==
A recommendation for additions to this page: Preserve some kind of balance between discussions of Parsons the engineer and those of Parsons the mystic.  It would suit Wikipedia for this page to become either a torrent of overwrought Thelema, nor a whitewash of that side of Parsons' life. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]]

:Was this the fellow who blew himself up with fulminate of mercury trying to create an alchemical homunculus? -- [[User:Ihcoyc|IHCOYC]] 13:35 17 Jul 2003 (UTC)

::I have read credible assertions that he was producing mercury fulminate at the time of the explosion, but not for what purpose. It seems to me at least as credible a conjecture that he was producing it in his laboratory for his straight job. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 02:11 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:::The Los Angeles Times ran a long biographical piece on Parsons around 2000 in their Sunday magazine. I can't find it now, but interested individuals might uncover it. Cheers, -[[User:Willmcw|Willmcw]] 09:28, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)

::::I've got a biography of his published by Feral House that was written in the last couple of years (2004, I believe). I've read through it once, but I did not glean a lot of information from it due to my lack of &quot;magickal&quot; knowledge, either of history or practice. It does mention his various start-ups, his work on the JATO bottles, and the early solid- and liquid-fuel experiments done by the JPL folks at Arroyo Seco (sp?). I'll dig into this article as my first wikipedia project once I've read up on Crowley and his ilk and gone over the book once more. The book supports the &quot;accident&quot; hypothesis, but does mention the humonculous angle (mentioned twice by the author's sources, but the theory was never really supported.) Parsons' second wife, Cameron, thought it was murder and insisted that the blast came from beneath the floorboards (i.e., planted explosives) rather than the Pasadena investigator's hypothesis that Parsons was mixing something dangerous in a can and simply dropped it. (The fact that the blast blew off Parson's right arm and appeared to have occured near to the ground, coupled with multiple anecdotal mentions of his tendency to perspire excessively which could likely have compromised his grip, seems to point to this conclusion)[[User:psilogen|psilogen]] 10 Nov 2005

Was Sir Peter Pendragon (the main character from Crowley's Diary of A Drug Fiend) Inspired by Jack Parsons? [[Special:Contributions/201.101.5.200|201.101.5.200]] ([[User talk:201.101.5.200|talk]]) 00:23, 23 May 2008 (UTC)
: I doubt it. Parsons was 8 years old at the time of publication. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 00:28, 23 May 2008 (UTC)

===Parsons and the Occult===
Where is the citation on this assertion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They were aided in this work by Sampson Bennetts of the Rosicrucian Order and his wife Sara Melian Gabriel, a spiritualist from India.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I've read a lot about Parsons and I;ve never heard of these people. A search seems to all loop back to this assertion on Wikipedia. Highly suspect.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/209.204.147.39|209.204.147.39]] ([[User talk:209.204.147.39|talk]]) 10:00, 11 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::It was vandalism. I tracked it back to May 13, 2007, when an anom. user placed the same name, Sampson Bennetts, into several different articles as vandalism. [[User:Aleister Wilson|Aleister Wilson]] ([[User talk:Aleister Wilson|talk]]) 10:07, 24 November 2009 (UTC)

===Rocket to the Morgue===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;For Hugo Chantrelle was an eccentric scientist. In working hours at the California Institute of Technology he was an uninspired routine labratory man; but on his own time he devoted himself to those peripheral aspects of science which the scientificpurist damns as mumbo-jumbo, those new alchemies and astrologies out of which the race may in time construct unsurmised wonders of chemistry and astronomy.&quot;'' ([[Rocket to the Morgue]] The Ninth Day: Friday, November 7, 1941)&lt;/blockquote&gt;I think the book [[Rocket to the Morgue]] by [[Anthony Boucher]] is an interesting resource for people looking for a character-sketch of Jack Parsons. While the book ''is'' fiction, a number of the characters and locations are extremely true-to-life, down to Robert A. Heinlein's [http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/about.html#wassa &quot;Nitrosyncretic Lab&quot;]. One of the scenes is at &quot;Hugo Chantrelle&quot;'s place, but I don't know if it matches Parsons'. The book was written in early 1942, and devotes at least a page to Hugo Chantrelle's double-life and predates later events involving Parsons and Hubbard. The next time I reread the book, whenever, I'll take notes. (And no, you can't borrow my copy. :) Obviously none of it can be used as fact in the article. [[User:AndroidCat|AndroidCat]] 06:10, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

== Jealousy? ==
It states that Parsons was very jealous of Hubbard and Sara's relationship but everything I've read, including Parsons' letters reprinted in ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'', seems to reflect a man who was a whole lot less jealous than you would expect under the circumstances.  Any citations for this jealousy? -- [[User:Antaeus Feldspar|Antaeus Feldspar]] 03:44, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

==Copyvio poem?==
Edit by [[User:GeoffCapp|GeoffCapp]] ''(remove uncited copyright violating poem unless/until someone has proof in writing of Parsons' Estate permission to use (this does not qualify under fair use))''

:Is there a filed copyright on record for that poem, or even a copyright notice in the publication? In 1943, copyrights weren't automatic, and according to [[Wikipedia:Public domain]]: &quot;Published in the U.S., without a copyright notice: From 1923 to 1977: in the public domain&quot; [[User:AndroidCat|AndroidCat]] 01:22, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== Details ==
It seems that by March 1952, Hubbard and Parsons were reconciled. Parsons is one of the persons receiving an auditing session by Hubbard in the lecture series Scientology: Milestone One (aka Dawn of Immortality). Hubbard calles him his friend in the years afterward and seems to have kept contact with Marjorie Cameron as he tells anecdotes of her keeping vials as a token of Jack after his death.
Parsons is mentioned in works of popular culture: Paradox's ''Big Book of Conspiracies'' and Alan Moore's Cobweb story in Top Shelf asks the big questions.

:Hubbard is, sadly, not a reliable source. He also referred to [[Aleister Crowley]] as &quot;my good friend&quot;, whereas Crowley actually considered Hubbard a scoundrel and a con-man for what he did to Parsons. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 08:27, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

::I know Hubbard's skill at name-dropping. But in the lecture series Hubbard talks with Parsons. This is in 1952, twice after he fled with his girl/money/who knows. --[[User:Leocomix|Leocomix]] 08:49, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

== Security clearance ==
Any chance that someone could do some high-quality research and tell us just what happened with Parsons' security clearance?  The information out there seems to be confused; the most coherent picture I can put together is that he lost it temporarily in 1948 when someone thought his membership in a &quot;sex cult&quot; was subversive, but it was restored after a hearing, and then lost it for good in January 1952 over the matter of showing the Israeli government some classified documents (of which he may have been co-author.)  1952, of course, was the year he died.  The problem is that many sources tell only part of the story, and/or get the 1948 incident confused with the 1952 incident.  Getting the account clear and cited would be nice. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.78.13.238|65.78.13.238]] ([[User talk:65.78.13.238|talk]]) 23:14, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

== Less Science Fiction Please ==
I thought articles were supposed to be encyclopedic? I think we can do without the overly-elaborated science fiction &quot;magick&quot; crap. &quot;Magick&quot; is akin to creationism nonsense and is not scientifically/factually valid. I don't really care what &quot;rituals&quot; (lol) he did with who. Note that everyone he did &quot;magick&quot; with was generally considered mentally ill.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/157.246.2.11|157.246.2.11]] ([[User talk:157.246.2.11|talk]]) 19:23, 27 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::Whether or not it is scientific, magical belief is a fact of human culture.  John Dee, Paracelsus, and Isaac Newton were all magicians as well as scientists. Whether magic is hogwash or not, there is ample evidence that Parsons himself believed in it. That said, the article could use a lot more on his childhood, education, and work as an engineer. [[Special:Contributions/208.102.58.109|208.102.58.109]] ([[User talk:208.102.58.109|talk]]) 09:32, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

::Along those lines, the biographical info is oddly incomplete. We have, &quot;born Marvel Whiteside Parsons;[nb 1] October 2, 1914 – June 17, 1952)&quot;. When and why did he change his given name from Marvel to John? 

And then: &quot;Born in Los Angeles, Parsons was raised by a wealthy family on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena.&quot; What does that mean? Was he raised by a different family than he was born to? That is what is seemingly implied. Both of these issues need to be clarified. [[User:Venqax|Venqax]] ([[User talk:Venqax|talk]]) 22:41, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

:::If you want more scientific stuff, please add it! Magick was a integral part of Parsons' life, so it clearly belongs here too. --[[User:Rodneyorpheus|Rodneyorpheus]] ([[User talk:Rodneyorpheus|talk]]) 13:56, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

== Proposed changes to &quot;Parsons and the Space Age&quot; section ==
I'd like to make two changes to this section.

First, &quot;He came up with a solution that could only have come from someone having a knowledge of alchemy and magic: Greek fire. &quot; violates [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and should be removed.

Second, &quot;Wernher von Braun would acknowledge Parsons as the father of America's space program.[4]&quot; violates [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] as the listed source does not provide a quote from Braun that backs up the statement, it simply alleges it was said.

== Parsons, Hubbard &amp; the yacht scam ==
&quot;Hubbard talked Parsons into funneling his savings into a venture to buy a fleet of yachts in Florida, then sail them through the Panama Canal to sell at a profit in California. As was immediately clear to his friends and associates (including Crowley), but only gradually to Parsons himself, this proposal was a massive rip-off, and a frantic Parsons was forced to chase down Hubbard and Betty in Miami before they sailed off around the world. As Parsons explained in another letter to Crowley, the pair almost did escape, but the resourceful magician managed to invoke the demon Bartzabel in a hasty hotel-room ceremony, whereupon Hubbard’s “ship was struck by a sudden squall off the coast, which ripped off his sails and forced him back to port.” Source: [http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/nerdy-and-perverted &quot;Lifestyles of the Nerdy and Perverted&quot;]

== Copyedit April 2014 ==
Hi

During the copyedit, some things came to light which ''may'' need attention:

''Lead'':
* &quot;Parsons sold the Parsonage, resigned from the OTO and went through various jobs, while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program.&quot; (Para 3)
:Was he acting as a consultant from selling the parsonage, or while he went through various jobs?
::Well, he became a consultant for the Israeli project while working in one of those &quot;various jobs&quot; (specifically for the Hughes Aircraft Company). Hope this helps. [[User:Midnightblueowl|Midnightblueowl]] ([[User talk:Midnightblueowl|talk]]) 21:25, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:::That does, thanks.


''Marriage and the GALCIT Rocket Research Group: 1934–1938'':
* &quot;He manufactured nitroglycerin for illegal bootlegging from their home&quot; (end Para 2) - not sure what to do there: to me it reads as if he was making dynamite in his basement and selling it to criminals that came to his house to buy it, as I'm not sure what illegal bootlegging means in this context. In my mind bootlegging is copying something or alcohol related. Do you know if this just selling it as home-made dynamite to anyone, or specifically to &quot;the underground&quot; or criminals, or making &quot;Acme&quot;/&quot;Halifax Powder Company&quot; ones and selling it as his own? I'm also guessing bootlegging is almost always illegal, so that may also be redundant.

''Embracing Thelema and JATO: 1939–1942'':
* ''Smith wrote to Crowley, claiming that Parsons was &quot;a really excellent man nbsp;... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself nbsp;... JP is going to be very valuable'' - This is correct if Pendle has it exactly this way in the book. If this is a synopsis, and the ellipsis are additions to cut out part of Pendles text, they should be [...] to show that we removed parts of the text. not having Pendle, I cannot easily check. [[User:Chaosdruid|Chaosdruid]] ([[User talk:Chaosdruid|talk]]) 19:29, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
* &quot;for which he was imprisoned&quot; (Para 5) - Not entirely sure, but guessing it should be &quot;for which Seckler was imprisoned&quot;. Will need to change if it was Parsons that was imprisoned.
* &quot;The first JATO tests using a [[Ercoupe]] plane&quot; (Para 6) - the rest of the paragraph does indeed talk about other tests using Ercoupes; however, if this were the first ever JATO tests, and the Ercoupe was incidental (i.e. could have been any old plane), there should be a comma in there &quot;tests, using&quot;.
* &quot;the fuselage in the plane's tail&quot; - tail is not synonymous with &quot;rear&quot;, that would be &quot;tail section&quot;. The tail is separate from the fuselage, so either &quot;the fuselage in the plane's tail-section&quot;, or &quot;the fuselage and the plane's tail&quot;, or just one or the other; &quot;the plane's fuselage&quot; or &quot;the plane's tail-section&quot;.
* &quot;the fire, containing shed and shrapnel all barely left the experimenters unscathed&quot; (Para 7) - Understand the fire and shrapnel could scathe them, but unclear as to how a containing shed could? If I was to guess, I would imagine &quot;the fire and shrapnel from the rocket and its containing shed barely left the experimenters unscathed.&quot;

1) I would favour using the ellipsis. 2) It was Seckler who was imprisoned. 3) Yes, all of the prior tests used the Ercoupe. 3) &quot;The plane's tail-section&quot; would be most accurate. 4) I support that correction.

''Aerojet and invention of storable solid rocket fuel: 1942–1944''
* &quot;while its second was from the Wilbur Wright Field&quot; (Para 2) - could do with clarification as it is unlikely that an airfield would buy them, rather than the organisation that was based there. Also felt like Aero-Jets first and second contracts could do with dates of some kind. [[User:Chaosdruid|Chaosdruid]] ([[User talk:Chaosdruid|talk]]) 16:53, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
* &quot;and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output.&quot; (Para 3) - this seems to come out of nowhere, raising questions such as Why/what caused that/what was going on?
* &quot;head of the OTO&quot; (Para 3) - what is OTO?
* sequence of events - as I read this section, it starts in 1943 (paras 1 &amp; 2), talks about 1940 &amp; 1942 (para 3), and then goes to 1941 at the start of paragraph 4. I realise this may be because of focus, ie first paras are GALCIT RRG, then Aerojet &amp; travelling around/OTO, then his personal life.
* dates - the last two paragraphs appear to be saying that all those events took place in 1941. Is this correct?

''General''
* the Group/the group/The Group - I had been treating this as if it were a general common-usage term (group), as per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Titles of people]], and so changing &quot;the Group&quot; to &quot;the group&quot;. I trawled through MoS for an hour looking for clarity, and am now thinking it should perhaps follow the guidelines for [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Institutions|Institutions]] - as they are said to be &quot;The [..] Group&quot;, I am proposing to put them all to &quot;The Group&quot; if that is indeed how they are commonly called. [[User:Chaosdruid|Chaosdruid]] ([[User talk:Chaosdruid|talk]]) 18:44, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

===Comments===
I have started with the lead, would appreciate any comments before I continue. I will, as always, try and preserve the writing style &quot;as is&quot; in the article. One notable exception would be using the date comma format &quot;In 1896, Fred did this [...}&quot;. As many sentences were constructed with the dates within the sentence parts, or at the end of sentences, I matched them. I would also point out that date-comma format is explicitly mentioned as a no-no in Chicago MOS. Will continue later tonight.

== Removing from sex offender Category ==
At 12:18, 4 July 2014, [[User:JJARichardson]], who has done much admirably work on this article, added [[:Category:American sex offenders]] with the edit summary &quot;sex offenders category is technically correct due to statuary rape of Sara&quot;.  I am removing this category as pejorative and (probably) technically inapplicable for the following reasons:
* ASO is a subcategory of [[:Category:American criminals by crime]], which appears to be predicated on actual criminal charges and/or conviction, for which there is no evidence provided in the article.
* Sara was 17 at the time, and while that would have a chance of qualifying for statutory rape today (assuming anyone actually wanted to bring charges, which is rare enough), there is no evidence provided to establish either:
** that there was a statutory rape law on the books in the relevant jurisdiction(s) in 1941, nor
** that the age of 17 was below the threshold limit for a charge of statutory rape under such law.
If evidence is found and added to the article, the category easily could be replaced; meanwhile, per [[WP:COPS]] and [[WP:COPDEF]], it does not appear to belong here: &quot;Categorization of articles must be [[WP:V|verifiable]]. It should be clear from verifiable information in the article why it was placed in each of its categories.&quot;

== Concerns over creeping expansion ==

{{ping|JJARichardson}} - hope that you are well! I just had a few thoughts about how this article has developed over the past few months, and wanted to express a few concerns that I have. When the article was awarded FA status back in January it looked like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer)&amp;oldid=641272076 this]. Looking at it now, it is clear that it has been greatly expanded in various places, in particular in the lede, and I fear that these changes might not only make it less readable but also would endanger the article's FA status. There has also been a switch of the image used in the lede, but that currently present does not provide a good clear image of Parsons' face, which I think is definitely necessary there. I do appreciate that it can always be a temptation to include as much information as possible into an article, but we must bear in mind that that is not Wikipedia's job; instead we must seek to provide a clear, concise overview of a subject. Many of the edits made since the FA award have clearly been improvements, but I am concerned over this gradual expansion, and think that we should perhaps hone it in a bit and edit some of the prose down; I'm particularly concerned by that third paragraph in the lede. Best, [[User:Midnightblueowl|Midnightblueowl]] ([[User talk:Midnightblueowl|talk]]) 12:40, 16 July 2015 (UTC)

:[[User:Midnightblueowl]] Given that I do not [[WP:OWN]] this article you are welcome to edit my contributions however you see fit. You provided the framework that I've worked in over the past year to bring this article to FA status and I thank you for that. The reason I have expanded the lead slightly is to provide a more cogent but condensed narrative of Parsons life that is described in detail in the body of the article, as during the successful FA review some editors expressed concerns that the life of Parsons the scientist as opposed to the occultist was not described adequately enough. The reason I made the 1944 photo of Parsons the main image is because it is a high resolution image of him in his professional heyday, but you are welcome to change this to the 1938 image of him if this is preferable. As it stands I am personally fully satisfied with the article and don't plan on making anymore substantial expansions, other than when the TV series portraying Parsons' life is released in the near future. [[User:JJARichardson|JJARichardson]] ([[User talk:JJARichardson|talk]]) 12:58, 16 July 2015 (UTC)

::{{ping|JJARichardson}} I see you've changed the image back; I think that that was a good move. The close up of his face is a bit blurry but at least it does show his face, which the other image didn't really do. I might have a tinker around with editing prose here and there but I shall try and ensure that I don't damage anything that you've created here. You've done some really great work with this article JJA, so I hope that you don't take my comments as criticism because they certainly won't meant in that manner !

== Broken reference ==

==Incomplete info on Babalon working==

The article says that after this was done, he took the arrival of some woman called Cameron to be the elemental appearance of Babalon he was trying to invoke. The idea was to then work with her to cause the appearance of a 'Moonchild' - a thelemic messiah - somewhere by immaculate conception of some woman (this was also supposed to be a manifestation of Babalon - a little confusing).The article states that he took the work to be 'completed'. Did he think this Moonchild had actualy appeared somewhere? There is no mention of it. [[Special:Contributions/95.149.54.104|95.149.54.104]] ([[User talk:95.149.54.104|talk]]) 22:33, 19 November 2015 (UTC)

Parsons wasn't particularly clear about this either. The literal conception of the Moonchild was apparently not fulfilled through the Babalon rituals, but they were apparently successful in bringing Babalon into the mortal plain in a supernatural sense. Parsons then continued the rituals via becoming the &quot;Antichrist&quot; in 1946 and described the epiphany that Babalon would appear on Earth in the years following that ritual, in which time he was killed in the explosion. Then Cameron claimed that Babalon was fully manifested in the first place in her being via the Babalon Working. So the best we can do is rely on the sources.

== Recent copyedits ==

I saw this was TFA in a few days so I gave it a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Parsons_%28rocket_engineer%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=746757840&amp;oldid=745881709 series of copyedits]. Some of the improvements I made were:
*Reduced &quot;however&quot; per [[WP:EDITORIAL]] (and see [[User:John/however]] for my essay on the subject of this word's overuse)
*Reduced &quot;would&quot; as this tense (while more common in American English than British English) makes an article harder to read when overused, without any corresponding increase of meaning
*Reduced &quot;while&quot; as it is ambiguous
*&quot;an anonymous benefactor whose identity was never revealed&quot; was a tautology; if the identity had been revealed they would no longer be anonymous
*&quot;Notable attendees of the church&quot; was changed to &quot;Celebrants of the church&quot;; if we are noting something here we may take it as read that it is notable
*&quot;sulfur&quot; is the American and increasingly the worldwide spelling of this element
*&quot;significant damage to the fuselage in the Ercoupe's tail&quot; seemed weird and hard to understand: I changed it to &quot;significant damage to the rear fuselage of the Ercoupe&quot;
*&quot;Providing a thrust five times more powerful than GALCIT-27, and again reducing takeoff distance by 30%, Malina wrote to his parents...&quot; is a truly hilarious ambiguity. Was Malina himself producing the thrust? I changed it to &quot;It provided five times more thrust  than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents...&quot;
*I redacted the last clause of &quot;In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on [[Enochian magic]] during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)|Second Violin Concerto]] and using his own semen and blood for this purpose.&quot; not on grounds of taste, but because it was not clear to me what purpose the bodily fluids served. If this can be clarified and sourced, I would be happy to restore the material.
*The verb is spelled &quot;practice&quot; in American English, contrary to BrEng usage.
*[[Supercooling]] and [[superheating]] were being used improperly
*We [[WP:SEASON|don't use seasons of the year]] to denote times.
*Image sizes should not be hard-coded per [[WP:IMGSIZE]]; I see this was raised at the FAC but never actioned. It should have been.
*[[Volatility (chemistry)|Volatility]] means something other than [[Chemical stability|instability]] in a chemistry context
*M-dashes were overused in some cases
*Various other nips and tucks.
*Incidentally, what is &quot;dectin&quot;? I've removed that as I have never heard of it, seemingly nether has Google, and the link is dead for the source.

As always, I am very happy to discuss any of these changes here. In particular, [[User:JJARichardson|JJARichardson]] as a lead editor here, are you happy with those changes? --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 21:21, 28 October 2016 (UTC)

== New infobox picture ==
