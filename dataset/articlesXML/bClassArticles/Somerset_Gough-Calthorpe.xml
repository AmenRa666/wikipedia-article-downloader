[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|GCMG|CVO}} (23 December 1865 – 27 July 1937), sometimes known as '''Sir Somerset Calthorpe''', was a [[Royal Navy]] officer and a member of the [[Gough-Calthorpe family]]. After serving as a junior officer during the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]], he became naval [[attaché]] observing the actions of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and then went on to command an armoured cruiser and then a battleship during the early years of the 20th century.

During the [[First World War]] Gough-Calthorpe initially served as commander of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the [[Grand Fleet]], then became [[Second Sea Lord]] and after that became Admiral commanding the Coastguard and Reserves. In the closing years of the War he served as Commander-in-Chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], in which capacity he signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]] on behalf of all the Allies, by which the [[Ottoman Empire]] accepted defeat and ceased hostilities. The [[Occupation of Constantinople]] began with the Allied fleet entering [[Constantinople]] in November 1918 and it was Gough-Calthorpe's flagship, {{HMS|Superb|1907|6}}, that led the way.

After the War Gough-Calthorpe served as British Commissioner in the Ottoman Empire during a time of considerable political instability associated with the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] and the [[allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]].
