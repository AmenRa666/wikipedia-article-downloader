The '''III Royal Bavarian Army Corps / III Bavarian AK''' ({{lang-de|'''III. Königlich Bayerisches Armee-Korps'''}}) was a [[corps]] level command of the Royal [[Bavarian Army]], part of the [[German Empire|German]] [[German Army (German Empire)|Army]], before and during [[World War I]].{{efn|From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army as, during the period of German unification (1866-1871), the states of the [[German Empire]] entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies. Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous and came under Prussian control only during wartime.}}

As the German and [[Bavarian Army|Bavarian]] Armies expanded in the latter part of the 19th century, the III Royal Bavarian Army Corps of the Bavarian Army was set up on 1 April 1900 in [[Nuremberg]] as the ''Generalkommando'' ([[headquarters]]) for [[Middle Franconia]], the [[Upper Palatinate]] and parts of [[Upper Franconia]], [[Lower Bavaria]] and [[Upper Bavaria]].  Like all Bavarian formations, it was assigned to the [[German Army (German Empire)#Army inspectorate|IV Army Inspectorate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cron|2002|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the [[6th Army (German Empire)|6th Army]] at the start of the [[First World War]].  The Corps was disbanded at the end of the War.

== Peacetime organisation ==
The 25 peacetime [[Corps]] of the German Army (Guards, I - XXI, I - III Bavarian) had a reasonably standardised organisation.  Each consisted of two [[Division (military)|divisions]] with usually two infantry brigades, one field artillery brigade and a cavalry brigade each.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haythornthwaite|1996|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each brigade normally consisted of two regiments of the appropriate type, so each Corps normally commanded 8 infantry, 4 field artillery and 4 cavalry regiments.  There were exceptions to this rule:
:[[V Corps (German Empire)|V]], [[VI Corps (German Empire)|VI]], [[VII Corps (German Empire)|VII]], [[IX Corps (German Empire)|IX]] and [[XIV Corps (German Empire)|XIV Corps]] each had a 5th infantry brigade (so 10 infantry regiments)
:[[II Corps (German Empire)|II]], [[XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps|XIII]], [[XVIII Corps (German Empire)|XVIII]] and [[XXI Corps (German Empire)|XXI Corps]] had a 9th infantry regiment
:[[I Corps (German Empire)|I]], [[VI Corps (German Empire)|VI]] and [[XVI Corps (German Empire)|XVI Corps]] had a 3rd cavalry brigade (so 6 cavalry regiments)
:the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Guards Corps]] had 11 infantry regiments (in 5 brigades) and 8 cavalry regiments (in 4 brigades).&lt;ref&gt;They formed the [[Guards Cavalry Division (German Empire)|Guards Cavalry Division]], the only peacetime cavalry division in the German Army.&lt;/ref&gt;
Each Corps also directly controlled a number of other units.  This could include one or more

== World War I ==

=== Organisation on mobilisation ===
On mobilization on 2 August 1914 the Corps was restructured.  5th Cavalry Brigade was withdrawn to form part of the [[Bavarian Cavalry Division]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cron|2002|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 6th Cavalry Brigade was broken up and its regiments assigned to the divisions as reconnaissance units.  Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from the Corps headquarters. In summary, III Bavarian Corps mobilised with 25 infantry battalions, 8 machine gun companies (48 machine guns), 8 cavalry squadrons, 24 field artillery batteries (144 guns), 4 heavy artillery batteries (16 guns), 3 pioneer companies and an aviation detachment.
