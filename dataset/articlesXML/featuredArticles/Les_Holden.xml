'''Leslie Hubert''' ('''Les''') '''Holden''', [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (6 March 1895&amp;nbsp;– 18&amp;nbsp;September 1932) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&amp;nbsp;I and later a commercial aviator. A [[South Australia]]n, he joined the [[Australian Light Horse|Light Horse]] in May 1915, serving in Egypt and France. In December 1916, he volunteered for the [[Australian Flying Corps]] and qualified as a pilot. As a member of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], he gained the sobriquets &quot;Lucky Les&quot; and &quot;the homing pigeon&quot; after a series of incidents that saw him limping back to base in bullet-riddled aircraft. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]], and went on to achieve five aerial victories flying [[Airco DH.5]]s and [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s.

Promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]], Holden finished the war as an instructor with [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 (Training) Squadron]] in England, where his work earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]]. After leaving the Australian Flying Corps in 1919, he became a manager at the family firm of [[Holden|Holden's Motor Body Builders]] and joined the part-time [[Royal Australian Air Force|Citizen Air Force]], before setting up as a commercial pilot and establishing his own air service. In 1929, he located [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Charles Ulm]] in the north-west Australian desert after the pair was reported missing on a flight to England in the ''[[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]]''. Holden began transport operations in New Guinea in 1931. He was killed the following year in a passenger plane crash in Australia.

==Family and early life==
Leslie Hubert Holden was born on 6&amp;nbsp;March 1895 in [[Adelaide|East Adelaide]], South Australia, to travelling businessman Hubert William Holden and his wife Annie Maria.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090338b.htm |last=Bridge|first=Carl|title=Holden, Leslie Hubert (1895–1932)|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Les was the nephew of Henry Holden, who later founded the Adelaide-based firm [[Holden|Holden's Motor Body Builders]] with his son [[Edward Holden|Edward]]. Hubert Holden landed a partnership with [[Nestlé]] in 1905, and the family moved to [[Turramurra, New South Wales|Turramurra]], New South Wales. Les completed his education at [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]], and joined Nestlé in 1911 as a salesman.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; By the time [[Military history of Australia during World War I|Australia entered World War&amp;nbsp;I]] in August 1914, he was an assistant manager.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;

==World War I==
[[File:LesHolden.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Les Holden, c. 1915–18|alt=Close-up portrait of man with short dark hair]]
Holden enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 26&amp;nbsp;May 1915, and was posted to the [[4th Light Horse Brigade]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]]. He departed for Egypt aboard the transport A29 ''Suevic'' on 13&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=AIF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=140588 |title=Leslie Hubert Holden|work= The AIF Project|publisher=[[University of New South Wales]]|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving as a driver first in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] and then on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], his mechanical ability and sense of adventure led him to volunteer for the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a [[lieutenant]] and posted to [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Commanded by Major [[Oswald Watt]], No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]]. The force trained extensively in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying to the Western Front that September.&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2Sqn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10836.asp |title=2 Squadron AFC|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holden was involved in the AFC's first day of combat in France; just after noon on 2&amp;nbsp;October, in the vicinity of [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]], he and his wingman engaged a German two-seater that managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069815--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 178]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because its [[Airco DH.5]]s were handicapped as [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] by engine problems and low speed, No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron was employed mainly in [[Close air support|ground support]] duties.&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt;  During the fog-shrouded opening day of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] on 20&amp;nbsp;November, Holden bombed and machine-gunned a German communications trench from altitudes as low as {{convert|20|or|30|ft|m|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutlack184-185,191&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069816--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 184–185, 191]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to a forward airfield near [[Havrincourt|Havrincourt Wood]] with his plane &quot;a&amp;nbsp;flying wreck&quot;, in the words of the [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918|official history of Australia in the war]]. &quot;Every part of it was shot full of holes, including petrol-tank, tail-plane, both [[longeron]]s, and part of the undercarriage, while the elevator control was shot clean away.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cutlack184-185,191/&gt; Two days later he repeated the exercise with similar consequences for his aircraft—&quot;clear evidence of the dangers of the work and of his own good luck&quot;, as the official history put it.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutlack184-185,191/&gt; This brace of close calls gained him the nicknames &quot;Lucky Les&quot; and &quot;the homing pigeon&quot;.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacDougall&gt;MacDougall, ''Australians at War'', pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recommended for the [[Military Cross]] on 3&amp;nbsp;December for his actions of 20&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1068780--28-.PDF |title=Recommendation: Military Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 4&amp;nbsp;February 1918, and the citation appeared on 5&amp;nbsp;July:&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30507|startpage=1606|date=4 February 1918 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30780|startpage=7936|date=5 July 1918 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Lt. Leslie Hubert Holden, F.C.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Whilst on a special mission he dropped a bomb direct on a support trench full of the enemy, causing them to scatter, and another bomb upon a strong point which was holding up our advance. He also bombed a large group of enemy infantry,
and turned his machine gun on them from a height of 100 feet. He rendered very valuable service throughout the operations.}}

Holden claimed his first aerial victory while No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron was still flying DH.5s, before it began converting to [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s in December 1917.&lt;ref name=Franks&gt;Franks, ''SE5/5a Aces of World War 1'', pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069816--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 197]&lt;/ref&gt; On 18&amp;nbsp;February 1918, he shared in one of the unit's first two victories in the S.E.5, helping send an [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] down in a spin.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed another three aircraft shot down over the following month, giving him a total of five victories.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Franks/&gt; At least one of these took place during the [[Spring Offensive]], on 22&amp;nbsp;March, when all available Allied aircraft were thrown into battle to stem the German advance.&lt;ref name=MacDougall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069818--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 228–230, 235]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royal Air Force]] policy required pilots to be rotated to home establishment for rest and instructional duties after nine to twelve months in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] in March 1918, Holden was posted to England in May as a flying instructor with [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 (Training) Squadron]] at [[Minchinhampton]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=6Sqn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10848.asp |title=6 (Training) Squadron AFC|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unit was part of the [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|1st Training Wing]], led by Lieutenant Colonel Watt, the former commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Holden briefly took command of No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron from 25&amp;nbsp;July to 11&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1076796.asp |title=Captain Leslie Hubert Holden|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]], promulgated on 3&amp;nbsp;June 1919, for his skill as an instructor.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=31378|startpage=7032|endpage=7033|date=3 June 1919 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career and legacy==

No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron was disbanded in March 1919.&lt;ref name=6Sqn/&gt; Along with many other Australian Flying Corps personnel including Colonel Watt, Major [[Elwyn Roy King|Roy King]], and Captain [[Garnet Malley]], Holden departed for Australia on 6&amp;nbsp;May aboard the troopship ''Kaisar-i-Hind'', disembarking in Sydney on 19&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15850643 |title=Airmen return|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=20 June 1919 |accessdate=18 July 2014 |page=9 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from the AFC on 18&amp;nbsp;August 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=5284259|author=[[Australian Military Forces]]|title=Holden, Arthur Hubert|date=1914–20|page=36|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking part in the Commonwealth Government's Peace Loan flights, he joined Holden's Motor Body Builders as its [[Sydney]] manager.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; In May 1921, he served with Malley and other veteran pilots as a pall-bearer at Watt's funeral in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15945306|title=The late Col.

Formed at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, it transferred to the newly opened [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Richmond]], New South Wales, during 29–30&amp;nbsp;June; Holden and Malley touched down at Richmond with the first two S.E.5s on the 30th.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Third Brother'', pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roylance123&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Still hankering after a full-time career in flying, Holden enlisted the help of friends to purchase a [[De Havilland Giant Moth|de Havilland DH.61 Giant Moth]] in 1928. He named it ''Canberra'', and used it to start a charter operation out of [[Sydney Airport|Mascot Aerodrome]] in Sydney.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; Holden became a national celebrity in April 1929 when he successfully undertook an aerial search of the north-western Australian wilderness to locate [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Charles Ulm]], after the pair had gone missing on a flight from Sydney to England in the ''[[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]]''. Two other searchers, Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, were lost in their aircraft, the ''Kookaburra''. The media of the day turned on Smith and Ulm, accusing them of a publicity stunt, and the Sydney Citizens' Relief Committee, which had commissioned Holden to undertake the rescue operation, withheld payment of his expenses.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 297–303&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless continued flying commercially, and is credited with making—in September 1931—possibly the first flight from Sydney to New Guinea, where he started an air freight service.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Returning to Sydney the following year, he established Holden's Air Transport Services.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; He also acquired two more aircraft for his New Guinea operations, a [[Waco Aircraft Company|Waco]] and a Moth, to supplement the ''Canberra''.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idriess, ''Gold-Dust and Ashes'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18&amp;nbsp;September 1932, Holden was travelling as a passenger aboard a [[List of defunct airlines of Oceania|New England Airways]] [[De Havilland Puss Moth|DH.80 Puss Moth]] from Sydney to [[Brisbane]] when it crashed at [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in northern New South Wales, killing him instantly.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;  The other occupants, pilot Ralph Virtue and the joint owner of the ''Canberra'', Holden's schoolfriend Dr George Hamilton, also perished.
