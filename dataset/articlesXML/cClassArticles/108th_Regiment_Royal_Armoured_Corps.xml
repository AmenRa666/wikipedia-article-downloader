The '''108th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (The Lancashire Fusiliers)''' (108 RAC) was an [[Armoured warfare|armoured]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Armoured Corps]] during [[World War II]].

==Origin and traditions==
108th Regiment RAC was formed at [[Barnard Castle]] on 1 November 1941 by the conversion to the armoured role of 1/5th (Bury) Battalion of the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], a 1st Line [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] infantry battalion.&lt;ref name = Forty&gt;Forty pp. 50–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diary, November 1941, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives, Kew]] (TNA) file WO 166/1425.&lt;/ref&gt; 1/5th Battalion had been serving in [[125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade|125th Infantry Brigade]] of [[42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division]], which were redesignated [[10th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|10th Armoured Brigade]] and [[42nd Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|42nd Armoured Division]] respectively. All three regiments in the brigade were drawn from the Lancashire Fusiliers and underwent simultaneous conversion (the other two became [[109th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|109 RAC]] and [[143rd Regiment Royal Armoured Corps|143 RAC]]).&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 29, 68, 164, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment was intensely proud of its Lancashire Fusiliers heritage, and always included the name in its RAC designation.&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diaries 1941–43, TNA files WO 166/1425, 166/6928, WO166/11101.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its conversion, the 108th's officers were ordered to wear the black beret of the RAC with their battledress uniform;&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diary,  26 November 1941, TNA file WO 166/1425.&lt;/ref&gt; but in common with other infantry units transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, personnel would have continued to wear their Lancashire Fusiliers cap badge on the beret.&lt;ref name = Forty/&gt; 108 RAC also continued the Lancashire Fusiliers' commemoration of [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli Day]] (25 April) and [[Minden Day]] (1 August). Minden Day was celebrated by [[Trooping the Colour]], a drum-head service, and regimental sports, followed by the officers visiting the men at dinner.&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diaries, April &amp; August 1942, TNA file WO 166/6928; August 1943, file WO 166.11101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
In January and February 1942 the regiment began to receive its first [[Covenanter tank|Covenanter]] tanks, some 'in extremely poor condition'.&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diaries, January &amp; February 1942, TNA file WO 166/6928.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1942, 10th Armoured Brigade was converted into [[10th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|10th Tank Brigade]]. This meant that its role was changed from [[Cruiser tank|Cruiser]] to [[Infantry tank]]s, and 108 RAC began to receive [[Valentine tank|Valentines]] and [[Churchill tank|Churchills]] in place of Covenanters, which were passed on to the newly formed [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armoured Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp. 164, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diary, May 1942, TNA file WO 166/6928.&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade also moved to the '[[Dukeries]]' area of Nottinghamshire where RAC infantry tank training was carried out: 108 RAC moved to [[Rufford Abbey]] in June 1942.

In October 1942, 10th Tank Brigade was attached to [[48th (South Midland) Division]], a Reserve infantry division tasked with holding and training reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; In December the Brigade and its regiments were given the role of producing drafts for RAC units serving overseas.&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diary, 22 December 1942, TNA file WO 166/6928.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in January 1943 108 RAC reorganised into three training wings:
* Wireless
* Gunnery
* Driving and Maintenance
The regiment now held a very mixed collection of tanks, including [[Cruiser Mk I]], [[Cruiser Mk II]], [[Cruiser Mk II]]a, [[Cruiser Mk III]], [[Cruiser Mk IV]], and Covenanters, Valentine and Churchill infantry tanks, and later some [[Lend-Lease Sherman tanks|Sherman V]]s. Throughout 1943, men were posted into the regiment from RAC training regiments, and posted out to drafts for overseas service.&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diaries, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disbandment==
In August 1943, rumours began to circulate that 10th Tank Brigade was scheduled for disbandment. [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] for the Lancashire towns complained about the possible loss of their TA battalions, and a recruiting team arrived to persuaded men to volunteer for the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] if the brigade disbanded. Although 10th Tank Brigade moved to [[Wensleydale]] in September, with 108 RAC at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire|Wensley village]], the impending disbandment was confirmed shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;10th Armoured Brigade War Diaries August &amp; September 1943, TNA file WO 166/10742.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diaries, August &amp; September 1943, TNA file WO 166/11101.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November the final announcement was received that 108 RAC would be disbanded by the end of the year, and 1/5th Lancashire Fusiliers would go into a state of suspended animation. Some officers were sent for retraining as infantry officers, but most of the officers and other ranks were posted to other RAC units or training regiments, with a few wireless operators transferring to the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] and gunners to the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref&gt;108th Regiment RAC War Diaries, November &amp; December 1943, TNA file WO 166/11101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postwar, 5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was reconstituted in the Territorial Army 1947.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20051227043136/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/la-f5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
