{{Campaignbox Kosovo War}}

The '''Kosovo War''' was an armed conflict in [[Kosovo]] that lasted from 28 February 1998{{citation needed|reason=start date not cited|date=September 2016}} until 11 June 1999. It was fought by the forces of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (by this time, consisting of the Republics of Montenegro and Serbia), which controlled Kosovo before the war, and the [[Kosovo Albanian]] rebel group known as the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), with air support from the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) from 24 March 1999, and ground support from the Albanian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NATOs Air War for Kosovo A Strategic and Operational Assessment, Page 53|author=Benjamin S. Lambeth|quote=...KLA [Kosovo Liberation Army], estimated to have been equipped with up to 30,000 automatic weapons, including heavy machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and antitank weapons, launched a counter-offensive on May 26 against [Serbian] VI troops in Kosovo.

In 1997, the organisation acquired a large amount of arms through [[weapons smuggling]] from [[Albania]], following a [[Albanian Rebellion of 1997|rebellion]] which saw large numbers of weapons looted from the country's police and army posts. In 1998, KLA attacks targeting Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo resulted in an increased presence of Serb paramilitaries and regular forces who subsequently began pursuing a campaign of retribution targeting KLA sympathisers and political opponents&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mincheva &amp; Gurr|Mincheva &amp; Gurr 2013]], p.&amp;nbsp;27–28&lt;/ref&gt; in a drive which killed 1,500 to 2,000 civilians and KLA combatants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-03.htm|title=Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo (March–June 1999)|date=12 June 1999|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Judah&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attempts at a diplomatic solution failed, NATO intervened, justifying the campaign in Kosovo as a &quot;humanitarian war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/world/20071209_KOSOVO_FEATURE/|title=Endgame in Kosovo|work=The New York Times|date=December 9, 2007|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This precipitated a mass expulsion of Kosovar Albanians as the Yugoslav forces continued to fight during the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia]] (March–June 1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200005--.htm A Review of NATO’s War over Kosovo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/war-in-the-balkans-the-day-the-men-of-bela-crkva-died-1088382.html|title=War in the Balkans: The day the men of Bela Crkva died – Anatomy Of A Massacre|date=20 April 1999|work=The Independent|accessdate=25 February 2013|location=London|first=Marcus|last=Tanner}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, investigations had recovered the remains of almost three thousand  victims of all ethnicities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pilger|first=John|date=September 4, 2000|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/138456|title=US and British officials told us that at least 100,000 were murdered in Kosovo.

==Background==

===Kosovo in Tito's Yugoslavia (1945–1980)===
{{Original research section|date=September 2009}}
Tensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13), [[World War I]] (1914–18), and [[World War II]] (1939–45). After 1945 the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|socialist]] government under [[Josip Broz Tito]] systematically repressed all manifestations of [[nationalism]] throughout Yugoslavia, seeking to ensure that no republic or nationality gained dominance over the others. In particular, Tito diluted the power of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]—the largest and most populous republic—by establishing autonomous governments in the Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]] in the north and in [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946–1974)|Kosovo]] in the south. Kosovo's borders did not precisely match the areas of ethnic Albanian settlement in Yugoslavia (significant numbers of Albanians remained in the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Albanians in Serbia|Serbia]]). Kosovo's formal autonomy, established under the 1945 Yugoslav constitution, initially meant relatively little in practice. The [[UDBA|secret police]] (the UDBA) cracked down hard on nationalists. In 1956 a number of [[Albanians]] went on trial in Kosovo on charges of espionage and subversion. The threat of separatism was in fact minimal, as the few underground groups aiming for union with [[Albania]] had little political significance. Their long-term impact became substantial, though, as some—particularly the Revolutionary Movement for Albanian Unity, founded{{when|date=October 2014}} by [[Adem Demaçi]]—would eventually form the political core of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (founded in 1990). Demaci himself was imprisoned in 1964 along with many of his followers. Yugoslavia underwent a period of economic and political crisis in 1969, as a massive government program of economic reform widened the gap between the rich north and poor south of the country.

Student demonstrations and riots in [[Belgrade]] in June 1968 spread to Kosovo in November of the same year, but Yugoslav security forces quelled them. However, Tito conceded some of the students' demands—in particular, representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies and better recognition of the [[Albanian language]]. The [[University of Pristina (1969–99)|University of Pristina]] was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]]. The lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia hampered the [[Albanisation]] of education in Kosovo, so an agreement was struck with [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] itself to supply textbooks.

In 1969 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Serbs in Kosovo]], seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the interests of Serbs there.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1974 Kosovo's political status improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with [[Socialist Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], Kosovo was [[Socialist Province of Kosovo|declared a province]] and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|federal presidency]] and its own assembly, police force and national bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Judah|title=Kosovo: War and Revenge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVf1na3FN_UC |accessdate=26 Nov 2012|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-08313-2|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the death of Tito (1980–86)===
Power was still exercised by the Communist Party, but it was now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito's death on 4 May 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo's main city, [[Pristina]], when a protest of University of Pristina students over long queues in their university canteen rapidly escalated and [[1981 protests in Kosovo|in late March and early April 1981 spread throughout Kosovo]], causing massive popular demonstrations in several towns. The disturbances were quelled by the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia]] proclaiming a state of emergency, sending in riot police and the army, which resulted in numerous casualties.

Hard-liners instituted a fierce crackdown on nationalism of all kinds, Albanian and Serbian alike. Kosovo endured a heavy secret-police presence throughout most of the 1980s that ruthlessly suppressed any unauthorised nationalist manifestations, both Albanian and Serbian. According to a report quoted by [[Mark Thompson (reporter)|Mark Thompson]], as many as 580,000 inhabitants of Kosovo were arrested, interrogated, interned or reprimanded. Thousands of these lost their jobs or were expelled from their educational establishments. During this time tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities continued to escalate.

In February 1982 a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask &quot;why the Serbian Church is silent&quot; and why it did not campaign against &quot;the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo&quot;. Such concerns did attract interest in Belgrade. Stories appeared from time to time in the Belgrade media claiming that Serbs and Montenegrins were being persecuted. There was a perception among Serbian nationalists that Serbs were being driven out of Kosovo.

In addition to all this, the worsening state of Kosovo's economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when hiring new employees, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. Kosovo was the poorest entity of Yugoslavia: the average per capita income was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635.

In 1981 it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press-October 17, 1981 &quot;Minorities Leaving Yugoslav Province Dominated by Albanians&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia reacted with a plan to reduce the power of Albanians in the province and a propaganda campaign that claimed Serbs were being pushed out of the province primarily by the growing Albanian population, rather than the bad state of the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=Central and Southeast European Politics Since 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFXdiS25N78C&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=9 March 2012|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71616-1|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by Yugoslav police, who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material.&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'' (London) February 5, 1982–&quot;Police fail to crush resistance in Kosovo&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo and the rise of Slobodan Milošević (1986–90)===
{{Original research section|date=September 2009}}
In 1987 [[David Binder (journalist)|David Binder]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the growing ethnic tension in Yugoslavia and rising nationalism among Albanians in Kosovo and referred to the [[Paraćin massacre]], where an ethnic Albanian soldier in the JNA killed four fellow soldiers.&lt;ref name=NYDB&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 1987, Late City Final Edition (p.14) -&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/in-yugoslavia-rising-ethnic-strife-brings-fears-of-worse-civil-conflict.html In Yugoslavia, Rising Ethnic Strife Brings Fears of Worse Civil Conflict] By David Binder&lt;/ref&gt; Binder also—writing of Slobodan Milošević's deposing of [[Dragiša Pavlović]] as head of Belgrade's party organisation shortly before—wrote that &quot;Mr. Milosevic accused Mr. Pavlovic of being an appeaser who was soft on Albanian radicals&quot;, and that &quot;Mr. Milosevic and his supporters appear to be staking their careers on a strategy of confrontation with the Kosovo ethnic Albanians&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYDB /&gt;

The article quotes the Federal Secretary for National Defence, Fleet Adm. Branko Mamula, who claimed that &quot;from 1981 to 1987, 216 illegal Albanian organisations with 1,435 members were discovered in the JNA&quot;. Mamula had also said that ethnic Albanian subversives had been preparing for &quot;killing officers and soldiers, poisoning food and water, sabotage, breaking into weapons arsenals and stealing arms and ammunition, desertion and causing flagrant nationalist incidents in army units&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYDB /&gt;

In Kosovo an increasingly poisonous atmosphere between Serbs and Albanians led to wild rumors being spread and otherwise trivial incidents being blown out of proportion. It was against this tense background that the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU, from its Serbian initials, САНУ) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm|title=The Migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija|year=2000|publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|author=Ruza Petrovic, [[Marina Blagojevic]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that a considerable number of those who had left had been under pressure from Albanians to do so{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Sixteen prominent members of SANU began work in June 1985 on a draft document that was leaked to the public in September 1986. The [[SANU Memorandum]], as it has become known, was hugely controversial. It focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito's deliberate hobbling of Serbia's power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside Serbia proper.

The Memorandum paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the province's Serbs were being subjected to &quot;physical, political, legal and cultural genocide&quot; in an &quot;open and total war&quot; that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo's status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the Nazi occupation or the First World War occupation of Serbia by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]]. The Memorandum's authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous 20 years and warned that there would soon be none left &quot;unless things change radically.&quot; The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for &quot;genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established&quot; and &quot;objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created.&quot; It concluded that &quot;Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past.&quot;

The SANU Memorandum provoked split reactions: Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at the local level, claiming the Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons, while the Slovenes and Croats saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official [[Slobodan Milošević]].

In November 1988 Kosovo's head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989 Milošević announced an &quot;[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]&quot; in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen). Milošević and his government claimed that the constitutional changes were necessary to protect Kosovo's remaining Serbs against harassment from the Albanian majority.

==Eruption of War==

===The slide to war (1995–1998)===
{{main article|Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–98)}}
{{Kosovo War}} {{Original research section|date=September 2009}}
[[Ibrahim Rugova|Rugova's]] policy of passive resistance succeeded in keeping Kosovo quiet during the war with [[Slovenia]], and the wars in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] during the early 1990s. However, as evidenced by the emergence of the KLA, this came at the cost of increasing frustration among Kosovo's Albanian population. In the mid-1990s, Rugova pleaded for a United Nations peacekeeping force for Kosovo. In 1997, Milošević was promoted to the presidency of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (comprising Serbia and Montenegro since its inception in April 1992).

Continuing repression convinced many Albanians that only armed resistance would change the situation. On 22 April 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in several parts of Kosovo. A hitherto-unknown organisation calling itself the &quot;[[Kosovo Liberation Army]]&quot; (KLA) subsequently claimed responsibility. The nature of the KLA was at first mysterious.
[[File:Kosovo-metohija-koreni-duse002.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian victims during [[Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–98)|insurgency]]]]

It is widely believed that the KLA received financial and material support from the Kosovo Albanian diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosovo.net/judah2.html|title=Kosovo: Peace Now|publisher=kosovo.net, originally from b92.net|author=Tim Judah|date=1999-08-12|accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;interpol&quot; /&gt; In early 1997, [[Albania]] collapsed into chaos following the fall of President [[Sali Berisha]]. Military stockpiles were looted with impunity by criminal gangs, with much of the hardware ending up in western Kosovo and boosting the growing KLA arsenal. [[Bujar Bukoshi]], shadow Prime Minister in exile (in [[Zürich]], Switzerland), created a group called FARK ([[Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosova]]) which was reported to have been disbanded and absorbed by the KLA in 1998.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Yugoslav government considered the KLA to be &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;[[insurgents]]&quot; who indiscriminately attacked police and civilians, while most Albanians saw the KLA as &quot;[[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]]&quot;.
In 1998, the U.S. State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organisation,&lt;ref name=&quot;interpol&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/Legacy/muts1213.htm|title=The Threat Posed by the Convergence of Organized Crime, Drugs Trafficking and Terrorism.|author=written Testimony of Ralf Mutschke Assistant Director, Criminal Intelligence Directorate International Criminal Police Organization&amp;nbsp;— Interpol General Secretariat before a hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime|publisher=U.S. House Judiciary Committee|date=2000-12-13|accessdate=2008-05-31|quote=In 1998, the U.S. State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organization}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican]] Policy Committee of the [[U.S. Senate]] expressed its troubles with the &quot;effective alliance&quot; of the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] Clinton administration with the KLA due to &quot;numerous reports from reputable unofficial sources &quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot; /&gt; In 2004, John Pilger claimed that for six years prior to 1998, the KLA had been regarded by the [[United States]] as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pilger|date=2004-12-13|work=[[New Statesman]]|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200412130010|title=John Pilger reminds us of Kosovo}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a [[BBC]] article stated that ''Nato at War'' shows how the United States, which had described the KLA as &quot;terrorist&quot;, now sought a relationship with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/674056.stm|title=Behind the Kosovo crisis|author=Allan Little|publisher=BBC|date=2000-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the US officially described the KLA as terrorists, author Alastair MacKenzie claims the KLA received training by the US' closest NATO-ally, the United Kingdom, since 1998 in a training camp in the mountains above the northern Albanian town of [[Dragobia|Bajram Curri]].&lt;ref&gt;[Alastair MacKenzie 2011. Special Force: The Untold Story of 22nd Special Air Service Regiment (SAS). I.B. Tauris s. 229]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1998, U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard referred to the KLA as terrorists.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_june_1998&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/121818.stm|title=The KLA&amp;nbsp;— terrorists or freedom fighters?|date=1998-06-28|publisher=BBC|author=Nened Sebak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to criticism, he later clarified to the House Committee on International Relations that &quot;while it has committed 'terrorist acts,' it has 'not been classified legally by the U.S. Government as a terrorist organization.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/fr033199.htm|title=The Kosovo Liberation Army: Does Clinton Policy Support Group with Terror, Drug Ties?|publisher=[[U.S. Senate]], Republican Policy Committee|date=1999-03-31|accessdate=2008-05-31}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, he held talks with two men who claimed they were political leaders of the KLA.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_june_1998&quot; /&gt;

Meanwhile, the U.S. held an &quot;outer wall of sanctions&quot; on Yugoslavia which had been tied to a series of issues, Kosovo being one of them. These were maintained despite the agreement at Dayton to end all sanctions. The Clinton administration claimed that Dayton bound Yugoslavia to hold discussions with Rugova over Kosovo.

The crisis escalated in December 1997 at the Peace Implementation Council meeting in Bonn, where the international community (as defined in the [[Dayton Agreement]]) agreed to give the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina sweeping powers, including the right to dismiss elected leaders. At the same time, Western diplomats insisted that Kosovo be discussed, and that Yugoslavia be responsive to Albanian demands there. The delegation from Yugoslavia stormed out of the meetings in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/11/world/serbs-pull-out-of-talks-on-bosnia-to-protest-warning-on-kosovo.html|title=Serbs Pull Out of Talks on Bosnia to Protest Warning on Kosovo|work=New York Times|author=Alan Cowell|date=1999-08-12|accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the return of the Contact Group that oversaw the last phases of the Bosnian conflict and declarations from European powers demanding that Yugoslavia solve the problem in Kosovo.

===War begins===
KLA attacks intensified, centering on the [[Drenica]] valley area with the compound of [[Adem Jashari]] being a focal point. Days after Robert Gelbard described the KLA as a terrorist group, Serbian police responded to the KLA attacks in the [[Likošane]] area, and pursued some of the KLA to Čirez, resulting in the deaths of 16 Albanian fighters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmlv.gv.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/01_kse1_02_tck.pdf Stefan Troebst: THE KOSOVO CONFLICT, 1998.

Despite some accusations of summary executions and killings of civilians, condemnations from Western capitals were not as voluble as they would become later. Serb police began to pursue Jashari and his followers in the village of [[Donje Prekaz]]. A massive firefight at the Jashari compound led to the massacre of 60 Albanians, of which eighteen were women and ten were under the age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/campaigns/kosovo98/timeline.shtml|title=Kosovo War Crimes Chronology|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This March 5, 1998 event provoked massive condemnation from the western capitals. [[Madeleine Albright]] stated that &quot;this crisis is not an internal affair of the FRY&quot;.

On March 24, Yugoslav forces surrounded the village of Glodjane and attacked a rebel compound there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=235663&amp;apc_state=henitri2005|title=Ramush Haradinaj|author=Stacy Sullivan|date=2005-03-11|publisher=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite superior firepower, the Yugoslav forces failed to destroy the KLA unit which had been their objective. Although there were deaths and severe injuries on the Albanian side, the insurgency in [[Glodjane]] was far from stamped out. It was in fact to become one of the strongest centers of resistance in the upcoming war.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VJ BVP M-80 in Kosovo.jpeg|thumb|right|Armoured column of the [[Yugoslav Army]] near [[Priština]] ]] --&gt;

The KLA's first goal was thus to merge its Drenica stronghold with their stronghold in Albania proper, and this would shape the first few months of the fighting.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Watson|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-10-20/news/9810190342_1_kosovo-liberation-army-serbian-forces-serbian-officials|title=Serb Troops Digging In To Battle Kosovo Rebels|work=Sun Sentinel|date=1998-10-20|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Yugoslav government was also formed at this time, led by the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] and the [[Serbian Radical Party]]. Ultra-nationalist Radical Party chairman [[Vojislav Šešelj]] became a deputy prime minister. This increased the dissatisfaction with the country's position among Western diplomats and spokespersons.

In early April, Serbia arranged for [[Serbian foreign mediation in Kosovo referendum, 1998|a referendum]] on the issue of foreign interference in Kosovo. Serbian voters decisively rejected foreign interference in this crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=rs011998 Serbien (Jugoslawien), 23. April 1998 : Internationale Beobachter für Kosovo] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the KLA claimed much of the area in and around [[Deçan]] and ran a territory based in the village of Glođane, encompassing its surroundings. So, on May 31, 1998, the Yugoslav army and the Serb Ministry of the Interior police began an operation to clear the border of the KLA. NATO's response to this offensive was mid-June's Operation Determined Falcon, an air show over the Yugoslav borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/determined_falcon.htm|title=Operation Determined Falcon|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the Yugoslav President Milošević reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who, through this whole crisis, refused to talk to the Serbian side, but not the Yugoslav. In fact, the only meeting between Milošević and Ibrahim Rugova happened on 15 May in Belgrade, two days after [[Richard Holbrooke]] announced that it would take place. One month later, Holbrooke, after a trip to Belgrade where he threatened Milošević that if he did not obey, &quot;what's left of your country will implode&quot;, he visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June; there he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathisers, and to observers in general, that the U.S. was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.

The Yeltsin agreement included Milošević's allowing international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo to monitor the situation there. This was the [[Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission]] (KDOM) that began operations in early July. The American government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative's call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the Americans demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire &quot;without linkage&amp;nbsp;... to a cessation in terrorist activities&quot;.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Member of the Kosovo Liberation Army.jpg|thumb|right|Member of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] wearing a surplus Yugoslav uniform with a red-black KLA armpatch]] --&gt;

All through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. KLA surrounded [[Peć]], [[Gjakova|Đakovica]], and had set up an interim capital in the town of [[Mališevo]] (north of [[Orahovac]]). The KLA troops infiltrated [[Suva Reka]], and the northwest of Pristina. They moved on to the Belacevec coal pits and captured them in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] and [[mountain warfare]], and harassing and ambushing Yugoslav forces and Serb police patrols.

The tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Orahovac. On 17 July 1998, two close-by villages to Orahovac, Retimlije and Opteruša, were also captured. Similarly, less systematic events took place in Orahovac and the larger Serb-populated village of Velika Hoča. The Orthodox monastery of Zociste three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from Orehovac—famous for the relics of the Saints Kosmas and Damianos and revered also by local Albanians—was robbed, its monks deported to a KLA prison camp, and, while empty, the monastery church and all its buildings were levelled to the ground by mining. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.

A new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo south of the Pristina-Peć road. This wound down with the capture of [[Klečka]] on August 23 and the discovery of a KLA-run crematorium in which some of their victims were found. The KLA began an offensive on September 1 around [[Prizren]], causing Yugoslavian military activity there. In western Kosovo, around [[Peć]], another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.

In early mid-September, for the first time, KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around [[Podujevo]]. Finally, in late September, a determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley itself. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, however, the threats intensified once again but a galvanising event was needed. They got it on September 28, when the mutilated corpses of a family were discovered by KDOM outside the village of [[Gornje Obrinje massacre|Gornje Obrinje]]; the bloody doll from there became the rallying image for the ensuing war.

====Morale====
Morale was a serious problem for Serb forces; intelligence surveys found that many soldiers disagreed with their comrades' actions. One tank commander reported, &quot;for the entire time I was in Kosovo, I never saw an enemy soldier and my unit was never once involved in firing at enemy targets. The tanks which cost $2.5 million each were used to slaughter Albanian children... I am ashamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4YbP0fPcMYC&amp;lpg=PA332|page=332|title=The Serbs: History, Myth, and the Destruction of Yugoslavia|first=Tim|last=Judah|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2000|ISBN=0300085079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when retreating from Kosovo after NATO intervention, Yugoslav units appeared combat effective with high morale and displaying large holdings of undamaged equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nardulli, Perry, Pirnie, Gordon, McGinn|title=Disjointed War: Military Operations in Kosovo, 1999|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks before the end of hostilities, David Fromkin has noted that ˝it seemed possible that NATO unity might crack before Yugoslav morale did.˝&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XR61G7jU09kC&amp;pg=PA364 The Strategic Triangle] by Helga Haftendorn, pag 364&lt;/ref&gt;  When Clinton announced it would not deploy ground troops, that made a tremendous boost to Serbian morale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0tEFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275 The Balkans Since the Second World]  by R. J. Crampton, pag. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN, NATO, and OSCE (1998–1999)===
On 9 June 1998, US President Bill Clinton declared a &quot;national emergency&quot; ([[state of emergency]]) due to the &quot;unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States&quot; imposed by Yugoslavia and Serbia over the Kosovo War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Executive Order|13088}} of June 9, 1998. Blocking Property of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro, and Prohibiting New Investment in the Republic of Serbia in Response to the Situation in Kosovo. {{USFR|63|32109}} (June 12, 1998). &quot;I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of Serbia with respect to Kosovo, by promoting ethnic conflict and human suffering, threaten to destabilise countries of the region and to disrupt progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementing the Dayton peace agreement, and therefore constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 1998 acting under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199|Resolution 1199]]. This expressed 'grave concern' at reports reaching the Secretary General that over 230,000 people had been displaced from their homes by 'the excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Serbian security forces and the Yugoslav Army',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1199(1998) UNSCR 1199] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219093335/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1199(1998) |date=December 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demanding that all parties in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cease hostilities and maintain a ceasefire. On 24 September the [[North Atlantic Council]] (NAC) of [[NATO]] issued an &quot;activation warning&quot; (ACTWARN) taking NATO to an increased level of military preparedness for both a limited air option and a phased air campaign in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement by the Secretary General following the ACTWARN decision|date=24 September 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1998/p980924e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other major issue for those who saw no option but to resort to the use of force was the estimated 250,000 displaced Albanians, 30,000 of whom were out in the woods, without warm clothing or shelter, with winter fast approaching.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Ambassador to the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Christopher R. Hill|Christopher Hill]], was leading [[shuttle diplomacy]] between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. It was these meetings which were shaping what was to be the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo.  During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO's Activation Order being given. NATO was ready to begin airstrikes, and Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milošević.  Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that the Yugoslavia end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Moreover, attempts were made to persuade Milošević to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement.

On 13 October 1998, the [[North Atlantic Council]] issued activation orders (ACTORDs) for the execution of both limited [[air strike]]s and a phased [[aerial warfare|air campaign]] in Yugoslavia which would begin in approximately 96 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement to the Press by the Secretary General Following Decision on the ACTORD|date=13 October 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1998/s981013a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October the NATO [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] (KVM) Agreement for a ceasefire was signed, and the deadline for withdrawal was extended to 27 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs_oee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Eagle Eye|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/eagle_eye.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nato_oaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Allied Force|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian withdrawal commenced on or around 25 October 1998, and [[Operation Eagle Eye (Kosovo)|Operation Eagle Eye]] commenced on 30 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs_oee&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nato_oaf&quot; /&gt;

The KVM was a large contingent of unarmed [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo. Their inadequacy was evident from the start. They were nicknamed the &quot;clockwork oranges&quot; in reference to their brightly coloured vehicles. Fighting resumed in December 1998 after both sides broke the ceasefire,&lt;ref name=Maisonneuve&gt;{{cite web|last=Brigadier-General Maisonneuve|title=THE OSCE KOSOVO VERIFICATION MISSION|url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo1/no1/doc/49-54-eng.pdf|work=Canadian Military Journal|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this surge in violence culminated in the killing of Zvonko Bojanić, the Serb mayor of the town of [[Kosovo Polje]]. Yugoslav authorities responded by launching a crackdown against KLA militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/19/world/serbian-mayor-slain-in-kosovo-new-sweep-on-rebels-ordered.html|title=Serbian Mayor Slain in Kosovo; New Sweep on Rebels Ordered|date=19 December 1998|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The January to March 1999 phase of the war brought increasing insecurity in urban areas, including bombings and murders. Such attacks took place during the Rambouillet talks in February and as the Kosovo Verification Agreement unraveled in March. Killings on the roads continued and increased. There were military confrontations in, among other places, the [[Vučitrn]] area in February and the heretofore unaffected [[Kačanik]] area in early March.

On 15 January 1999 the [[Račak massacre]] occurred when &quot;45 Kosovan Albanian farmers were rounded up, led up a hill and massacred&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massacre that started long haul to justice|last=Strauss|first=Julius|date=30 June 2001|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1312900/Massacre-that-started-long-haul-to-justice.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies had been discovered by OSCE monitors, including Head of Mission [[William Walker (diplomat)|William Walker]], and foreign news correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racak massacre haunts Milosevic trial|last=Silverman|first=Jon|date=14 February 2002|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1812847.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ustrans&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=TRANSCRIPT: AMB.

The incident was immediately condemned as a massacre by the [[Western countries]] and the [[United Nations Security Council]], and later became the basis of one of the charges of war crimes leveled against Milošević and his top officials. This massacre was the turning point of the war. [[NATO]] decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides.  Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, had been subjected to heavy firefights and segregation according to OSCE reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/271316.stm|title=Pristina waits for war|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-02-03|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rambouillet Conference (January–March 1999)===
On 30 January 1999 NATO issued a statement announcing that the [[North Atlantic Council]] had agreed that &quot;the NATO Secretary General may authorise air strikes against targets on FRY territory&quot; to &quot;[compel] compliance with the demands of the international community and [to achieve] a political settlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement by the North Atlantic Council on Kosovo|date=30 January 1999|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-012e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was most obviously a threat to the Milošević government, it also included a coded threat to the Albanians: any decision would depend on the &quot;position and actions of the Kosovo Albanian leadership and all Kosovo Albanian armed elements in and around Kosovo.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Also on 30 January 1999 the Contact Group issued a set of &quot;non-negotiable principles&quot; which made up a package known as &quot;Status Quo Plus&quot;—effectively the restoration of Kosovo's pre-1990 autonomy within Serbia, plus the introduction of democracy and supervision by international organisations. It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the [[Château de Rambouillet]], outside Paris.

The [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] began on 6 February 1999, with [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]] [[Javier Solana]] negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by 19 February. The FR Yugoslavian delegation was led by then president of Serbia [[Milan Milutinović]], while Milošević himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton conference]] that ended the war in Bosnia, where Milošević negotiated in person. The absence of Milošević was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Yugoslavia as well as abroad; Kosovo's Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Artemije]] traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time speculation about an indictment of Milošević for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear of arrest.
[[File:72nd Special Brigade equipment 1999, Belgrade Military Museum .jpg|thumb|upright|Equipment of 72nd Special Brigade [[Yugoslav Army (FRY)|Yugoslav Army]] in the 1999 Kosovo War.]]
The first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on 23 February 1999 that the negotiations &quot;have led to a ''consensus'' on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system&quot;. They went on to say that &quot;a political framework is now in place&quot;, leaving the further work of finalising &quot;the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the ''invited international'' civilian and military presence in Kosovo&quot;.

While the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Yugoslavs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even Russia (ally of FR Yugoslavia) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking &quot;the will of the people [of Kosovo]&quot; in determining the final status of the province.

On 18 March 1999, the Albanian, American, and British delegations signed what became known as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet Accords]] while the Yugoslav and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. They would have also permitted a continuing Yugoslav army presence of 1,500 troops for border monitoring, backed by up to 1,000 troops to perform command and support functions, as well as a small number of border police, 2,500 ordinary MUP for public security purposes (although these were expected to draw down and to be transformed), and 3,000 local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charles|first=Ingrao|title=Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative|year=2012|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=Indiana|isbn=978-1-61249-228-5|page=330|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=10&amp;article=1027&amp;context=purduepress_ebooks&amp;type=additional|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Yugoslav government cited military provisions of Appendix B of the Rambouillet provisions as the reason for its objections, claiming that it was an unacceptable violation of Yugoslavia's sovereignty, these provisions were essentially the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the [[SFOR]] (Stabilisation Force) mission there after the Dayton Agreement in 1995. The two sides did not discuss the issue in detail because of their disagreements on more fundamental problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmfaff/28/2809.htm#a21 U.K. Parliamentary report] THE KOSOVO CRISIS AFTER MAY 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Serb side rejected the idea of any NATO troop presence in Kosovo to replace their security forces, preferring unarmed U.N. observers. Milošević himself had refused to discuss the annex after informing NATO that it was unacceptable, even after he was asked to propose amendments to the provisions which would have made them acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingrao|first=Charles|title=Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative|year=2012|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=Indiana|isbn=978-1-61249-228-5|pages=332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet and the alternative Yugoslav proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Guns and Steel: A War Termination Strategy|first=Dominic J.|last=Caraccilo|year=2011|page=44|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-39149-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDA8dQyaQ9MC&amp;pg=PA44|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international monitors from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] withdrew on 22 March, for fear of the monitors' safety ahead of the anticipated NATO bombing campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot; /&gt;

On 23 March 1999 at 22:17 UTC the [[Secretary General of NATO]], [[Javier Solana]], announced he had directed the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR), US Army General [[Wesley Clark]], to &quot;initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wp99mar24&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Press Statement by Dr. Javier Solana, Secretary General of NATO|date=23 March 1999|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-040e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March at 19:00 UTC NATO started its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kosovo Report: Conflict, International Response, Lessons Learned|author=Independent International Commission on Kosovo|year=2000|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-924309-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3uS1o4IFXEC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Press Statement by Dr. Javier Solana, NATO Secretary General following the Commencement of Air Operations|date=24 March 1999|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-041e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO's bombing campaign lasted from 24 March to 11 June 1999, involving up to 1,000 aircraft operating mainly from bases in [[Italy]] and aircraft carriers stationed in the [[Adriatic]]. [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s were also extensively used, fired from aircraft, ships, and submarines. With the exception of Greece, all NATO members were involved to some degree. Over the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe''), it was the second time it had participated in a conflict since World War II after the Bosnian War.

The proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as &quot;[[Serbs]] out, peacekeepers in, refugees back&quot;. That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defences and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milošević's will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was not insignificant, it did not match the intensity of the bombing of Baghdad in 1991.

[[File:Sremska mitrovica all force.jpg|right|thumb|Post-strike damage assessment of the [[Sremska Mitrovica]] ordnance storage depot, Serbia]]

NATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was, however, heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. [[Montenegro]] was bombed on several occasions but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milošević leader, [[Milo Đukanović|Đukanović]].

At the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee [[convoy]], believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people. NATO admitted its mistake five days later and the Yugoslavs accused NATO of deliberately attacking the refugees;{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} A later report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) entitled the &quot;Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot;&lt;ref name=ICTYReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY}}&lt;/ref&gt; opined that &quot;civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident&quot; and that &quot;neither the aircrew nor their commanders displayed the degree of recklessness in failing to take precautionary measures which would sustain criminal charges.&quot; On May 7, [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade]], killing three Chinese journalists and outraging Chinese public opinion. The United States and NATO later apologised for the bombing, saying that it occurred because of an outdated map provided by the [[CIA]] although this was challenged by a joint report from ''[[The Observer]]'' (UK) and ''[[Politiken]]'' ([[Denmark]]) newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Kosovo/Story/0,2763,203214,00.html|title=Nato bombed Chinese deliberately|author=John Sweeney, Jens Holsoe, Ed Vulliamy|work=The Guardian|date=1999-10-17|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that NATO intentionally bombed the embassy because it was being used as a relay station for Yugoslav army radio signals.

By the start of April, the conflict appeared little closer to a resolution and NATO countries began to seriously consider conducting ground operations in Kosovo. British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was a strong advocate of ground forces and pressured the United States to agree; his strong stance caused some alarm in Washington as American forces would be making the largest contribution to any offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marr, Andrew page 550&quot;&gt;Marr, Andrew; ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2008 printing); page 550&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President Bill Clinton was extremely reluctant to commit American forces for a ground offensive. Instead, Clinton authorised a [[CIA]] operation to look into methods to destabilise the Yugoslav government without training KLA troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9905/24/kosovo.01/|title=CIA reportedly authorized to develop ways to 'destabilize' Yugoslavian government|publisher=CNN|author1=Walter Rodgers |author2=Carl Rochelle |author3=Matthew Chance |date=1999-05-24|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Finland|Finnish]] and [[Russia]]n diplomatic negotiators continued to try to persuade Milošević to back down. Tony Blair would order 50,000 British soldiers to be made ready for a ground offensive: most of the available [[British Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marr, Andrew page 550&quot; /&gt;

Milošević finally recognised that Russia would not intervene to defend Yugoslavia despite Moscow's strong anti-NATO rhetoric. He thus accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish–Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.

The Norwegian special forces [[Hærens Jegerkommando]] and [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] cooperated with the KLA in gathering intelligence information. Preparing for an invasion on 12 June, [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces worked with the KLA on the Ramno mountain on the border between Macedonia and Kosovo and acted as scouts to monitor events in Kosovo. Together with British special forces, Norwegian special forces were the first to cross over the border into Kosovo. According to Keith Graves with the television network Sky News, the Norwegians were in Kosovo two days prior to the entry of other forces and were among the first into Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=8665264|title=UCK hjalp norsk spesialstyrke|work=NTB|author1=Lise Åserud |author2=Gunnar Nyquist |date=1999-06-21|accessdate=2008-10-08|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hærens Jegerkommando's and Forsvarets Spesialkommando's job was to clear the way between the contending parties and to make local deals to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article254448.ece?service=print|title=Norway has forces in Afghanistan|work=Aftenposten English Web Desk|author=Nina Berglund|date=2002-01-08|accessdate=2008-10-08}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}} (Mentions work in Kosovo / Pristina)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Bakkeli|title=Norges Hemmelige Krigere / Norway's secret Warriors|isbn=978-82-489-0722-0|language=Norwegian|work=Kagge Forlag|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yugoslav army withdrawal and the entry of KFOR==
On 3 June 1999, Milošević accepted the terms of an international peace plan to end the fighting, with the national parliament adopting the proposal amid contentious debate with delegates coming close to fistfights at some points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9906/03/kosovo.peace.04/|publisher=CNN|title=Milosevic accepts peace plan, Finnish envoy says|date=June 3, 1999|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nytimes.com/1999/06/04/opinion/the-kosovo-peace-plan.html |work=The New York Times |title=The Kosovo Peace Plan |date=June 4, 1999 |accessdate=May 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605034712/http://nytimes.com/1999/06/04/opinion/the-kosovo-peace-plan.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June, the [[North Atlantic Council]] ratified the agreement and suspended air operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Press statement by NATO Secretary General|publisher=NATO|date=10 June 1999|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/press/p990610a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, after Milošević accepted the conditions, the NATO-led [[NATO peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) began entering Kosovo. KFOR had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. It was based upon the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]] of the [[British Army]]. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a [[French Army]] Brigade, a [[German Army]] brigade, which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south, and [[Italian Army]] and [[United States Army]] brigades.

The first NATO troops to enter Pristina on the 12th of June 1999 were [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces from FSK [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] and soldiers from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Air Service]] 22 S.A.S, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived first at the airport. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] soldiers from FSK [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] were the first to come in contact with the Russian troops at the airport. FSK's mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties, and to fine-tune the detailed, local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;categoryId=&amp;productId=1085065&amp;errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&amp;urlLangId=-101&amp;langId=-101&amp;top_category=&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;storeId=10651 Krigere og diplomater | Norli&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norli.no/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;categoryId=&amp;productId=286391&amp;errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&amp;urlLangId=-101&amp;langId=-101&amp;top_category=&amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;storeId=10651 Tittel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/serbia-og-montenegro/britisk-og-norske-soldater-i-pristina/a/3978724/ Britisk og norske soldater i Pristina - Montenegro - VG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/norske-elitesoldater-skamroses/a/6450899/ Norske elitesoldater skamroses - VG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the 1st Armored Division, commanded by Brigadier General Peterson, and was spearheaded by a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment attached to the British Forces. Other units included 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 10th Special Forces Group(Airborne) from Stuttgart Germany and Fort Carson, Colorado, TF 1–6 Infantry (1-6 infantry with C Co 1-35AR) from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] from [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the U.S. force was the [[Greek Army]]'s 501st Mechanised Infantry Battalion. The initial U.S. forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uroševac, the future [[Camp Bondsteel]], and Gnjilane, at [[Camp Monteith]], and spent four months—the start of a stay which continues to date—establishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.

During the initial incursion, the U.S. soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as U.S. soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages. Although no resistance was met, three U.S. soldiers from the Initial Entry Force lost their lives in accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant William Wright&amp;nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers (17 July 1999); Specialist Sherwood Brim&amp;nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers (17 July 1999); Private First Class Benjamin McGill&amp;nbsp;— C Company 1st Battalion 26th Infantry (5 August 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1999, approximately 150 paratroopers from Alpha Company, 1/508th Airborne Battalion Combat Team from Vicenza, Italy parachuted into [[Ferizaj|Uroševac]] as part of Operation Rapid Guardian. The purpose of the mission was primarily to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević of NATO resolve and of its rapid military capability. One U.S. soldier, Army Ranger Sgt. Jason Neil Pringle, was killed during operations after his parachute failed to deploy. The paratroopers of the 1/508th then joined paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne and K.F.O.R. in patrolling various areas of Kosovo, without incident, through 3 October 1999.

On 15 December 1999, Staff Sergeant Joseph Suponcic of 3rd Battalion/10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was killed, when the HMMWV in which he was a passenger struck an anti-tank mine planted by Albanians and meant for the Russian contingent with which SSG Suponcic's team was patrolling in Kosovska Kamenica.

Following the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and occupied [[Pristina International Airport]] ahead of the arrival of NATO forces. This resulted in [[Incident at Pristina airport|an incident]] during which NATO Supreme Commander [[Wesley Clark]]'s wish to forcibly block the runways with NATO vehicles, to prevent any Russian reinforcement, was refused by KFOR commander [[General Sir Mike Jackson|General Mike Jackson]].&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite book|title=Soldier |first=Jackson |last=Mike |publisher=Transworld Publishers |year=2007|pages=255–275 |isbn=978-0-593-05907-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[James Blunt]] described in an interview how his unit was given the assignment of securing Pristina during the advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and how the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the city's airport before his unit's arrival. Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt's account there was a stand-off with the Russians, and the NATO Supreme Commander, Wesley Clark, gave provisional orders to over-power them. Whilst these were questioned by Blunt, they were rejected by General Jackson, with the now famous line, &quot;I'm not having my soldiers responsible for starting World War III.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in June 2000, arms trading relations between Russia and Yugoslavia were exposed which led to the retaliation and bombings of Russian Checkpoints and area Police Stations. [[Outpost Gunner]] was established on a high point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of ⅔ Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-airport&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/671495.stm|title=Confrontation over Pristina airport|accessdate=2008-02-08|date=2000-03-09|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to the war==
Because of the country's restrictive media laws, the Yugoslav media carried little coverage of events in Kosovo, and the attitude of other countries to the humanitarian disaster that was occurring there. Thus, few members of the Yugoslav public expected NATO intervention, instead thinking that a diplomatic agreement would be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for the war===
Support for the Kosovan War and, in particular, the [[Legitimacy of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|legitimacy of NATO's bombing campaign]] came from a variety of sources. In a 2009 article, David Clark claimed &quot;Every member of NATO, every EU country, and most of Yugoslavia's neighbours, supported military action.&quot;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Statements from the leaders of [[Bill Clinton|United States]], [[Václav Havel|Czech Republic]] and [[Tony Blair|United Kingdom]], respectively, described the war as one &quot;upholding our values, protecting our interests, and advancing the cause of peace&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Bill|title=Statement on Kosovo (March 24, 1999)|url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/3932|publisher=Miller Center at the University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the first war for values&quot;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=David|title=Kosovo was a just war, not an imperialist dress rehearsal|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/apr/16/clark-kosovo-war-crimes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 April 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one &quot;to avert what would otherwise be a humanitarian disaster in [[Kosovo]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Tony|title=Blair: 'We must act – to save thousands of innocent men, women and children'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/mar/23/balkans.tonyblair|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 March 1999|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included the then U.N. Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] who was reported by some sources as acknowledging that the NATO action was legitimate&lt;ref name=CAForces&gt;{{cite journal|last=Legault|first=Albert|title=NATO intervention in Kosovo: the legal context*|journal=Canadian Military Journal|date=Spring 2000|page=64|url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo1/no1/doc/63-66-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who emphasised that there were times when the use of force was legitimate in the pursuit of peace&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Devenport|first=Mark|title=Kofi Annan's delicate balance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/03/99/kosovo_strikes/318104.stm|publisher=BBC|date=April 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Kofi Annan|Annan]] stressed that the &quot;[UN Security] Council should have been involved in any decision to use force.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; The distinction between the legality and legitimacy of the intervention was further highlighted in two separate reports. One was conducted by the [[Independent International Commission on Kosovo]], entitled ''The Kosovo Report'',&lt;ref name=KosovoReport&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kosovo Report|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/the_kosovo_report_and_update.pdf|publisher=U Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that:
{{quotation|[Yugoslav] forces were engaged in a well-planned campaign of terror and expulsion of the Kosovar Albanians. This campaign is most frequently described as one of &quot;ethnic cleansing,&quot; intended to drive many, if not all, Kosovar Albanians from Kosovo, destroy the foundations of their society, and prevent them from returning.}}
It concluded that &quot;the NATO military intervention was illegal but legitimate&quot;,&lt;ref name=UMich&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kosovo Report|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/the_kosovo_report_and_update.pdf|publisher=U Michigan|pages=2–3, 58–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second report was published by the NATO Office of Information and Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumbaro|first=Dajena|title=The Kosovo crisis in an international law perspective: self-determination, territorial integrity and the NATO intervention|url=http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/99-01/kumbaro.pdf|publisher=NATO Office of Information and Press|date=16 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reported that, &quot;the human rights violations committed on a large scale in Kosovo provide an incontestable ground with reference to the humanitarian aspect of NATO's intervention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumbaro|first=Dajena|title=The Kosovo crisis in an international law perspective: self-determination, territorial integrity and the NATO intervention|url=http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/99-01/kumbaro.pdf|publisher=NATO Office of Information and Press|date=16 June 2001|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics note that NATO did not have the backing of the [[United Nations Security Council]] meant that its intervention had no legal basis, but according to some legal scholars, &quot;there are nonetheless certain bases for that action that are not legal, but justified.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAForces&quot; /&gt;

Aside from politicians and diplomats, commentators and intellectuals also supported the war. [[Michael Ignatieff]] called NATOs intervention a &quot;morally justifiable response to ethnic cleansing and the resulting flood of refugees, and not the cause of the flood of refugees&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellon|first=James G.|title=Review Essays: Ethics, Diplomacy and Intervention in Kosovo|journal=Journal of Conflict Studies|date=Winter 2001|volume=XXI|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Christopher Hitchens]] said NATO intervened only, &quot;when Serbian forces had resorted to mass deportation and full-dress ethnic &quot;cleansing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=South Ossetia Isn't Kosovo|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2008/08/south_ossetia_isnt_kosovo.html|newspaper=Slate|date=Aug 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Nation]]'', [[Richard A. Falk]] wrote that, &quot;the NATO campaign achieved the removal of Yugoslav military forces from Kosovo and, even more significant, the departure of the dreaded Serbian paramilitary units and police&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Richard|title=Kosovo Revisited|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/kosovo-revisited|newspaper=The Nation|date=March 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that for [[Mary Kaldor]], Kosovo represented a laboratory on her thinking for human security, humanitarian intervention and international peacekeeping, the latter two which she defined as, &quot;a genuine belief in the equality of all human beings; and this entails a readiness to risk lives of peacekeeping troops to save the lives of others where this is necessary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tran|first=Mark|title='The international community makes a terrible mess wherever it goes'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/01/mary.kaldor.interview|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports stated there had been no peace between Albanians and Serbs, citing the deaths of 1,500 Albanians and displacement of 270,000 prior to NATO intervention.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

===Criticism of the case for war===
Some criticised the NATO intervention as a political diversionary tactic, coming as it did on the heels of the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]], pointing to the fact that coverage of the bombing directly replaced coverage of the scandal in American news cycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foerstel&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HorHFYH0NsoC&amp;pg=PA132 From Watergate to Monicagate: ten controversies in modern journalism and media] By Herbert N. Foerstel, pg 131–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some point out that before the bombing, rather than there being an unusually bloody conflict, the KLA was not engaged in a widespread civil war against Yugoslav forces and the death toll among all concerned (including ethnic Albanians) skyrocketed following NATO intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foerstel&quot; /&gt;

U.S. President Clinton and his administration were accused of inflating the number of Kosovo Albanians killed by state forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phyllis Schlafly|date=1999-10-19|title=Numbers Game in Kosovo|work=[[Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin said that the US was using its economic and military superiority to aggressively expand its influence and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese leaders called the NATO campaign a dangerous precedent of naked aggression, a new form of colonialism, and an aggressive war groundless in morality or law. It was seen as part of a plot by the US to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederking2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Frederking|first=Brian|title=The United States and the Security Council: Collective Security Since the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzNFT_7HcR4C&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=17 February 2014|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-77076-7|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Charter does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the United Nations Security Council; this legal enjoinment has proved controversial with many&lt;ref name=CAForces /&gt;&lt;ref name=KosovoReport /&gt;&lt;ref name=UMich /&gt; legal scholars who argue that though the Kosovo War illegal, it was still legitimate. The issue was brought before the UN Security Council by Russia, in a draft resolution which, ''inter alia'', would affirm &quot;that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter&quot;. China, Namibia, and Russia voted for the resolution, the other members against, thus it failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19990326.sc6659.html|date=1999-03-26|publisher=United Nations|title=Security Council Rejects Demand for Cessation of Use of Force Against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war inflicted many casualties. Already by March 1999, the combination of fighting and the targeting of civilians had left an estimated 1,500–2,000 civilians and combatants dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-03.htm|title=Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final estimates of the casualties are still unavailable for either side.

Perhaps the most controversial deliberate attack of the war was that made against the headquarters of Serbian television on April 23, 1999, which killed at least fourteen people.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/world/rights-group-says-nato-bombing-in-yugoslavia-violated-law.html | title=Rights Group Says NATO Bombing in Yugoslavia Violated Law | publisher=New York Times | date=June 8, 2000 | accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democratic League of Kosovo and FARK==
The [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] led by [[Ibrahim Rugova]] had been the leading political entity in Kosovo since its creation in 1989. Its parallel government in exile, was led by [[Bujar Bukoshi]] and its Minister of Defence until 1998 was the former Yugoslav colonel Ahmet Krasniqi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg-aeA-nUeAC&amp;pg=PR44|date=15 November 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7483-1|page=44|quote=...Ahmet Krasniqi, minister of defence of the Kosovar government in exile...}}&lt;/ref&gt; DLK politicians opposed the armed conflict and were not ready to accept KLA as a political factor in the region and tried to persuade the population not to support it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qosja1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rexhep Qosja]]|title=Paqja e përgjakshme: konferenca Ndërkombëtare për Kosovën, Rambuje 6-23. 2. 1999, Paris 14-19. 3. 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWy5AAAAIAAJ|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Botimet Toena|isbn=978-99927-1-217-7|quote=e në anën tjetër propaganda e tmerrshme e disa partive, sidomos e udhëheqjeve të tyre, krejt e organizuar prej udhëheqjes së LDK-së!

Sejdiiu, a member of the LPK since 1985, said that this decision had been made because of the LPK's frustration with the ineffectiveness of the passive civil disobedience line of the dominant Kosovar party, Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosova, the LDK. Sejdiiu said: With the creation of the KLA, the LDK, especially Rugova, started accusing the KLA of being a bunch of people linked to the Serbian state security. Roguva was saying that Serbia had an interest in destabilising us all. That was pure demagoguery because Serbia had it in hand, they didn't need any destabilisation and they controlled everything. So we have actually to fight on two fronts. As well as the military campaign we had to fight politically against the LDK as the main force who has been opposed to any other methods than peaceful means, while all the time only sitting in their offices, having meetings and press conferences. They have even been against the student organisation having mass demonstrations. But oppression in Kosova went on all the time, growing day by day and the ranks of the KLA began to grow from those people who actually started with the idea that the only way to get our independence was armed struggle. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugova himself stayed for several weeks out of Kosovo, while the prime-minister Bukoshi and other leading membership returned. But since only a fraction of Kosovo Albanians participated actively in the war, the support for DLK increased again as a way of opposing the arrogance of many KLA leaders who openly engaged in controlling the economical and political life within the vacuum created right before the deployment of [[UNMIK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/Kosovo%20120%20ALB.pdf | quote=Shumica menduan se partia dhe udhëheqësi i saj do të zhdukeshin politikisht pas fushatës së bombardimeve të NATO-s në 1999.

==Casualties==

===Civilian losses===
In June 2000, the [[Red Cross]] reported that 3,368 civilians (mainly Kosovar Albanians, but with several hundred Serbs, and Roma) were still missing, nearly one year after the conflict, most of whom it concluded had to be 'presumed dead'.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-missing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm|publisher=BBC|title=3,000 missing in Kosovo|date=2000-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers from the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia published in 2000 in medical journal [[the Lancet]] estimated that &quot;12,000 deaths in the total population&quot; could be attributed to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.thelancet.com/pdfdownload?uid=llan.355.9222.original_research.1004.1&amp;x=x.pdf |format=PDF |title=Casualties in Kosovo |work=[[The Lancet]] |date=2000-06-24 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number was achieved by surveying 1,197 households from February 1998 through June 1999. 67 out of the 105 deaths reported in the sample population were attributed to war-related [[Physical trauma|trauma]], which extrapolates to be 12,000 deaths if the same war-related mortality rate is applied to Kosovo's total population. The highest mortality rates were in men between 15 and 49 (5,421 victims of war) as well as for men over 50 (5,176 victims). For persons younger than 15, the estimates were 160 victims for males and 200 for females.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} For women between 15–49 the estimate is that there were 510 victims; older than 50 years the estimate is 541 victims. The authors stated that it was not &quot;possible to differentiate completely between civilian and military casualties&quot;.

In the 2008 joint study by the Humanitarian Law Centre (an NGO from Serbia and Kosovo), The International Commission on Missing Person, and the Missing Person Commission of Serbia made a name-by-name list of war and post-war victims. According to the Kosovo Memory Book, 13,421 people were killed in Kosovo during the conflict, from 1 January 1998 up until December 2000. Of that sum, 10,533 were Albanians, 2,238 were Serbs, 126 Roma, 100 Bosniaks and others.&lt;ref name=kosovomemorybook&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Kosovo Memory Book|url=http://www.kosovomemorybook.org/?page_id=2884&amp;lang=de|title=Public review of data on victims, killed and missing – Presentation in Belgrade|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yugoslavia claimed that NATO attacks caused between 1,200 and 5,700 civilian casualties. NATO's Secretary General, Lord Robertson, wrote after the war that &quot;the actual toll in human lives will never be precisely known&quot; but he then offered the figures found in a report by [[Human Rights Watch]] as a reasonable estimate. This report counted between 488 and 527 civilian deaths (90 to 150 of them killed from cluster bomb use) in 90 separate incidents, the worst of which were the 87 Albanian refugees who perished at the hands of NATO bombs, near Koriša.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/repo2000/conduct.htm#TopOfPage|title=Kosovo One Year On: Achievement and Challenge, by Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, Secretary General of NATO|publisher=[[NATO]]|date=March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks in Kosovo overall were more deadly due to the confused situation with many refugee movements—the one-third of the incidents there account for more than half of the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/index.htm#TopOfPage|title=Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of military equipment, NATO destroyed around 50 Yugoslav aircraft including 6 MiG-29s destroyed in air-to-air combat. A number of G-4 Super Galebs were destroyed in their hardened aircraft shelter by bunker-busting bombs which started a fire which spread quickly because the shelter doors were not closed. At the end of war, NATO officially claimed that they had destroyed 93 Yugoslav tanks. Yugoslavia admitted a total of 3 destroyed tanks. The latter figure was verified by European inspectors when Yugoslavia rejoined the Dayton accords, by noting the difference between the number of tanks then and at the last inspection in 1995.{{Citation needed|date = April 2014}} NATO claimed that the Yugoslav army lost 93 tanks ([[M-84]]'s and [[T-55]]'s), 132 APCs, and 52 artillery pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com/airpwr.htm|title=Kosovo Coverup|publisher=One-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com|date=2000-05-15|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'', the second-largest news weekly magazine in the U.S, gained access to a suppressed US Air Force report that claimed the real numbers were &quot;3 tanks, not 120; 18 armored personnel carriers, not 220; 20 artillery pieces, not 450&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Kosovo Cover-Up&quot; by John Barry and Evan Thomas, ''Newsweek'', May 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Another US Air Force report gives a figure of 14 tanks destroyed.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; Most of the targets hit in Kosovo were decoys, such as tanks made out of plastic sheets with telegraph poles for gun barrels, or old World War II–era tanks which were not functional. Anti-aircraft defences were preserved by the simple expedient of not turning them on, preventing NATO aircraft from detecting them, but forcing them to keep above a ceiling of 15,000 feet (5,000&amp;nbsp;m), making accurate bombing much more difficult. Towards the end of the war, it was claimed that carpet bombing by [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] aircraft had caused huge casualties among Yugoslav troops stationed along the Kosovo–Albania border. Careful searching by NATO investigators found no evidence of any such large-scale casualties.

However, the most significant loss for the [[Yugoslav Army]] was the damaged and destroyed infrastructure. Almost all military air bases and airfields ([[Batajnica Air Base|Batajnica]], [[Kraljevo-Lađevci Airport|Lađevci]], [[Slatina Air Base|Slatina]], [[Golubovci Air Base|Golubovci]] and [[Đakovica Airfield|Đakovica]]) and other military buildings and facilities were badly damaged or destroyed. Unlike the units and their equipment, military buildings couldn't be camouflaged. thus, defence industry and military technical overhaul facilities were also seriously damaged ([[Utva]], [[Zastava Arms]] factory, Moma Stanojlović air force overhaul center, technical overhaul centers in [[Čačak]] and [[Kragujevac]]). Moreover, in an effort to weaken the Yugoslav Army, NATO targeted several important civilian facilities (the [[Pančevo]] oil refinery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbudbill.com/jme14.html|title=NATO BOMBS LEAVE TOXIC SLOUGH|work=Washington Post}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novi Sad]] oil refinery, bridges, TV antennas, railroads, etc.)

===KLA losses===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:UCKmartyrsofks1999.JPG|thumb|KLA memorial in Smirë, Kosovo]]
Kosovo Liberation Army losses are difficult to analyze. According to some reports there were around 1,000 fatalities on the KLA side. Difficulties arise in calculating an accurate figure. Things are complicated by the difficulty of determining who was a KLA member and who was a civilian. For example, the Yugoslavs considered any armed Albanian to be a member of the KLA, regardless of whether he was officially a card-carrying member, so someone who is counted as a civilian by the Albanian side might be counted as a KLA combatant by the [[Serbs]]. Also, many KLA members were not wearing any uniforms and had no identification.

===Aftermath===
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 990521-F-5920L-006.jpg|thumb|right|Refugee camp in [[Fier]], Albania]]

Within three weeks, over 500,000 Albanian [[refugees]] had returned home.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} By November 1999, according to the [[UNHCR|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]], 848,100 out of 1,108,913 had returned.

The persistent anti-Serb attacks and riots ([[2000 unrest in Kosovo]]), including against other non-Albanians, had remained in the anarchic stage until some form of order was established in 2001. This order disintegrated during the [[2004 unrest in Kosovo]], called an anti-Serb [[pogrom]]. More than 164,000 Serbs had left Kosovo during the seven weeks since Yugoslav and Serb forces withdrew and the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) entered the province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/1999/08/01/abuses-against-serbs-and-roma-new-kosovo Abuses against Serbs and Roma in the New Kosovo], Human rights watch&lt;/ref&gt;

For the government of Serbia, cooperation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] is &quot;still regarded as a distressing obligation, the necessary price for joining the European Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/uncomfortable-truths-war-crimes-in-the-balkans|title=Uncomfortable Truths: War Crimes in the Balkans|date=16 November 2011|work=Balkan Insight|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, along with [[Milan Milutinović]], [[Nikola Šainović]], [[Dragoljub Ojdanić]] and [[Vlajko Stojiljković]] were charged by the ICTY with crimes against humanity including murder, forcible transfer, deportation, and &quot;persecution on political, racial or religious grounds&quot;. In 2001, then-President [[Vojislav Koštunica]] &quot;fought tooth and nail&quot; against attempts to put Milošević before an international court but was unable to prevent this happening after further atrocities were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|title=The Serbs|edition=3rd|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, there were more indictments against former armed forces chief of staff [[Nebojša Pavković]], former army corps commander [[Vladimir Lazarević]], former police official [[Vlastimir Đorđević]], and [[Sreten Lukić]]. All were indicted for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war.
Later, the [[United Nations]] [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) legally found that FRY and Serbian forces &quot;use[d] violence and terror to force a significant number of Kosovo Albanians from their homes and across the borders, in order for the state authorities to maintain control over Kosovo&amp;nbsp;... This campaign was conducted by [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|army]] and [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Interior Ministry]] [[Law enforcement in Serbia|police forces (MUP)]] under the control of FRY and Serbian authorities, who were responsible for mass expulsions of Kosovo Albanian civilians from their homes, as well as incidents of killings, [[sexual assault]], and the [[Desecration|intentional destruction]] of [[mosque]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Five Senior Serb Officials Convicted&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Senior Serb Officials Convicted of Kosovo Crimes, One Acquitted|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10070|accessdate=1 April 2013|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|date=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By Albanian forces===
The ICTY also leveled indictments against KLA members [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Haradin Bala]], [[Isak Musliu]], and [[Agim Murtezi]] for crimes against humanity. They were arrested on February 17 and 18, 2003. Charges were soon dropped against Agim Murtezi as a case of mistaken identity, whereas Fatmir Limaj was acquitted of all charges on November 30, 2005 and released. The charges were in relation to the prison camp run by the defendants at [[Lapušnik prison camp|Lapušnik]] between May and July 1998.

In 2008, [[Carla Del Ponte]] published a book in which she alleged that, after the end of the war in 1999, Kosovo Albanians were smuggling organs of between 100 and 300 Serbs and other minorities from the province to Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Champion|first=Marc|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120812796372611429.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Horrors Alleged in Kosovo|work=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-04-14|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2005, a U.N. tribunal indicted Kosovo Prime Minister [[Ramush Haradinaj]] for war crimes against the Serbs. On March 8, he tendered his resignation. Haradinaj, an ethnic Albanian, was a former commander who led units of the Kosovo Liberation Army and was appointed Prime Minister after winning an election of 72 votes to three in the Kosovo's Parliament in December 2004. Haradinaj was acquitted on all counts along with fellow KLA veterans Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj. The Office of the Prosecutor appealed their acquittals, resulting in the ICTY ordering a partial retrial. However, on 29 November 2012 all three were acquitted for second time on all charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haradinaj cleared&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosovo ex-PM Ramush Haradinaj cleared of war crimes|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20536318|accessdate=29 November 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), &quot;800 non-Albanian civilians were kidnapped and murdered from 1998 to 1999&quot;.

===By NATO forces===
The Yugoslav government and a number of international pressure groups (e.g., [[Amnesty International]]) claimed that NATO had carried out war crimes during the conflict, notably the bombing of the Serbian TV headquarters in Belgrade on April 23, 1999, where 16 people were killed and 16 more were injured. Sian Jones of Amnesty stated, &quot;The bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state radio and television was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iI-Ix5tQ59McTX8NyBF1R120X4dAD97O8IRO0 Amnesty: NATO bombing of Serbian TV 'war crime'] {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a later report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] entitled '''Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''' concluded that, &quot;Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable&quot; and that, &quot;NATO's targeting of the RTS building for propaganda purposes was an incidental (albeit complementary) aim of its primary goal of disabling the Serbian military command and control system and to destroy the nerve system and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power.&quot;&lt;ref name=ICTYReport /&gt; In regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, &quot;unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate.&quot;&lt;ref name=ICTYReport /&gt;

===Europe===
* {{flagicon|ALB}} – [[Albania]] strongly supported the bombing campaign.

* {{flagicon|FRA}} – In [[France]], a combatant, the bulk of the population supported the action but factions on the far left and far right opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/327457.stm|title=French pilots fly for Nato|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-04-24|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|FR Yugoslavia}} – [[Slobodan Milošević]], the president of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] called the bombings, an 'unlawful act of terrorism' and the 'key to colonize Yugoslavia'.

==Military and political consequences==
[[File:Kla members.jpg|thumb|Members of the Kosovo Liberation Army turn over their weapons to U.S. Marines]]

{{Main article|Kosovo status process|Constitutional status of Kosovo}}
The Kosovo war had a number of important consequences in terms of the military and political outcome. The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine Kosovo's level of autonomy as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], but efforts failed. The province is administered by the United Nations despite its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] on February 17, 2008.

[[File:Seized uniform.JPG|thumb|right|Seized uniform and equipment of U.S. soldiers 1999 in Kosovo War]]
The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], had begun in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm|title=UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock|publisher=BBC|date=2006-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes &quot;supervised independence&quot; for the province, which is in contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 1244. By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status|date=2007-06-29|work=[[Southeast European Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Priština.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02|title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo|date=2007-10-07|publisher=[[Southeast European Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the U.S. arsenal, which were later addressed for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] campaigns. [[AH-64 Apache|Apache attack helicopters]] and [[AC-130 Spectre]] gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were reduced to critically low levels. For combat aircraft, continuous operations resulted in skipped maintenance schedules, and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm|title=Hundreds of crippled jets put RAF in crisis|author=Antony Barnett|date=2000-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with [[Global Positioning System]] satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Although [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless surveillance aircraft]] were extensively used, often attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led missiles being fitted to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the &quot;sensor to shooter&quot; time to virtually zero.

Kosovo also showed that some low-tech tactics could reduce the impact of a high-tech force such as NATO; the Milošević government coöperated with Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, passing on many of the lessons learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews|title=NATO attack on Yugoslavia gave Iraq good lessons|work=[[Globe and Mail]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either [[Red Army|Soviet]] or NATO, during the [[Cold War]] and had developed effective tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably used to mislead overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:
* U.S. stealth aircraft were tracked with radars operating on long wavelengths. If stealth jets got wet or opened their bomb bay doors, they would become visible on the radar screens. An [[F-117 Nighthawk]] downed by a missile was possibly spotted in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj02/sum02/lambeth.html|title=Kosovo and the Continuing SEAD Challenge|accessdate=May 28, 2011|author=Benjamin S. Lambeth|date=2006-06-03|work=Aerospace Power Journal|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|quote=Serb air defenders could have employed low-frequency radars for the best chance of getting a snap look at the aircraft. Former F-117 pilots and several industry experts acknowledged that the aircraft is detectable by such radars when viewed from the side or directly below.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dummy targets such as fake bridges, airfields and decoy planes and tanks were used extensively. Tanks were made using old tires, plastic sheeting and logs, and sand cans and fuel set alight to mimic heat emissions. They fooled NATO pilots into bombing hundreds of such decoys, though General Clark's survey found that in Operation: Allied Force, NATO airmen hit just 25 decoys—an insignificant percentage of the 974 validated hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;fooled&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afa.org/magazine/june2000/0600kosovo.asp|date=June 2000|title=Nine Myths About Kosovo|author=Rebecca Grant}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[NATO]] sources claim that this was due to operating procedures, which oblige troops, in this case aircraft, to engage any and all targets, however unlikely they may be. The targets needed only to look real to be shot at, if detected, of course. NATO claimed that Yugoslav air force had been devastated. &quot;Official data show that the Yugoslav army in Kosovo lost 26 percent of its tanks, 34 percent of its APCs, and 47 percent of the artillery to the air campaign.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fooled&quot; /&gt;

==Military decorations==
As a result of the Kosovo War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation created a second NATO medal, the [[NATO Medal]] for Kosovo Service, an [[international military decoration]]. Shortly thereafter, NATO created the Non-Article 5 Medal for Balkans service to combine both Yugoslavian and Kosovo operations into one service medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=2449|title=News Release: Kosovo Campaign Medal Approved|publisher=Defense.gov|date=May 19, 2000|accessdate=2012-05-06}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the involvement of the [[United States armed forces]], a separate [[awards and decorations of the United States military|U.S. military decoration]], known as the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]], was established by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.

The [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] (KCM) is a military award of the United States Armed Forces established by Executive Order 13154 of President Bill Clinton on May 3, 2000. The medal recognises military service performed in Kosovo from March 24, 1999 through December 31, 2013.

==Weaponry and vehicles used==
A variety of weapons were used by the Yugoslav security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, NATO only operated aircraft and naval units during the conflict.

;Yugoslav security forces
The weapons used by Yugoslav government were mostly Yugoslav made, while almost all of their AA units were Soviet made.
