[[File:ATLAS OR KENTUCKY-TENNESSEE.jpg|thumb|400px|Kentucky-Tennessee, 1862.]]

The '''Confederate Heartland Offensive''' or '''Kentucky Campaign''' were a series of maneuvers and battles in [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|East Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] in 1862 during the [[American Civil War]]. From June to October, Confederate forces under Generals [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] launched a series of movements to outflank the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Ohio]] under Major General [[Don Carlos Buell]] and draw the [[Border states (Civil War)|border state]] of Kentucky into the [[Confederate States of America]]. Though the Confederates gained some early successes, their progress ended after the [[Battle of Perryville]]—despite general Confederate tactical success there—leaving Kentucky in Union hands for the rest of the war.

==Background==
===Military situation===

{{further|Western Theater of the American Civil War|Border states (American Civil War)#Kentucky|American Civil War}}

[[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]] campaigns by Union forces earlier in 1862 had reaped much progress. The [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River]]s had been opened to the U.S. Navy after successes at the battles of [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]]. The railroad hub at [[Siege of Corinth|Corinth]] had been evacuated by the Confederates, causing most of [[West Tennessee]] to fall into Union control. [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], the Confederacy's largest city at that time, had been captured by Admiral [[David Farragut]]. The city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], was now an important strategic aim for the Union commanders, as the western Confederates were &quot;narrowed down all to the single line of [rail]road running east from Vicksburg.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foote, ''Second Manassas'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Unclear if this is the correct book; 2 refs by Foote.--&gt; Consequentially, protecting the Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River became a top priority for the Confederacy. Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]] decided to avert Union attention away from Vicksburg and from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], which was being threatened by a large Union force under [[Don Carlos Buell]], by invading the border state of Kentucky. Kentucky, the most southern of the border states, produced cotton in west Kentucky, tobacco, and was the primary supplier of hemp for rope used in the cotton industry. The state was also a major slave trade center. 

Eighty percent of Kentucky counties had voted for secession after the Union Army occupied Louisville and seized the state capitol in Frankfort. Lincoln had signed secret orders to occupy the state at any cost. Upwards of 400,00 Union troops occupied Kentucky at times, using firing squads, conscription and martial law orders. Still, about half of all Kentuckians fought for the Confederacy, some in Virginia and Tennessee units, as well as Kentucky units. Kentucky had called for support from the deep south during the early secession period. The lower south failed to respond at that time. Bragg and the lower south did respond later. Kentucky had a star on the Confederate flag, and seats in the Confederate Congress. In addition many Confederate leaders were from Kentucky like Jefferson Davis and Breckenridge and many others. For example, most of Mrs Mary Todd Lincoln's relatives from the Lexington, KY area were Confederate officers.

In August 1862, Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]] invaded Kentucky, hoping that he could arouse supporters of the Confederate cause in the border state and draw Union forces under [[Major General (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Don Carlos Buell]] beyond the [[Ohio River]]. Bragg transported all of his [[infantry]] by railroads from [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], while his [[cavalry]] and [[artillery]] moved by road. By moving his army to Chattanooga, he was able to challenge Buell's advance on the city.

[[File:Harpers-perryville-battle.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Battle of Perryville]] as depicted in the November 1, 1862 edition of [[Harper's Weekly]].]]

Once his forces had assembled in Chattanooga, Bragg then planned to move north into Kentucky in cooperation with [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], who was commanding a separate force operating out of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. He captured over 4,000 Union soldiers at [[Battle of Munfordville|Munfordville]], and then moved his army to [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]]. On October 4, 1862, he participated in the inauguration of [[Richard Hawes]] as the provisional Confederate [[governor of Kentucky]]. The wing of Bragg's army under Maj. Gen. [[Leonidas Polk]] met Buell's army at [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] on October 8 and won a tactical victory against him.

Kirby Smith pleaded with Bragg to follow up on his success: &quot;For God's sake, General, let us fight Buell here.&quot; Bragg replied, &quot;I will do it, sir,&quot; but then displaying what one observer called &quot;a perplexity and vacillation which had now become simply appalling to Smith, to Hardee, and to Polk,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foote, ''Ft. Sumter to Perryville'', p. 740.&lt;/ref&gt; he ordered his army to retreat through the Cumberland Gap to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. Bragg referred to his retreat as a withdrawal, the successful culmination of a giant raid. He had multiple reasons for withdrawing. Disheartening news had arrived from North Mississippi that [[Earl Van Dorn]] and [[Sterling Price]] had failed at [[Second Battle of Corinth|Corinth]], just as [[Robert E. Lee]] had failed in his [[Maryland Campaign]]. He saw that his army had not much to gain from a further, isolated victory, whereas a defeat might cost not only the bountiful food and supplies yet collected, but also his army. He wrote to his wife, &quot;With the whole southwest thus in the enemy's possession, my crime would have been unpardonable had I kept my noble little army to be ice-bound in the northern clime, without tents or shoes, and obliged to forage daily for bread, etc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foote, ''Ft. Sumter to Perryville'', p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The invasion of Kentucky was a strategic failure, although it had forced the Union forces out of Northern Alabama and most of Middle Tennessee; it would take the Union forces a year to regain the lost ground. Bragg was criticized by some newspapers and two of his own generals, Polk and [[William J. Hardee]], but there was plenty of blame to spread among the Confederate high command for the failure of the invasion of Kentucky. The armies of Bragg and Kirby Smith suffered from a lack of unified command. Bragg can be faulted for moving his army away from Munfordville, out of Buell's path, a prime location for a battle to Confederate advantage. Polk can also be blamed for not following Bragg's instructions on the day before and of the battle. [[Jefferson Davis|Davis]] kept Bragg in command of the [[Army of Tennessee]]. [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] removed Buell from command of the [[Army of the Ohio]] for being too cautious in pursuit of Bragg, replacing him with Major General [[William Rosecrans]].
