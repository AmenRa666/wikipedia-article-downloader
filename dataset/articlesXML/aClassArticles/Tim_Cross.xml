[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major General]] '''Timothy Cross''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 19 April 1951) is a retired [[British Army]] officer and military logistics expert.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;&gt;
[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U12426 &quot;Cross, Maj.-Gen. Timothy&quot;], ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' 2011, [[A &amp; C Black]], 2011; online edn, [[Oxford University Press]], December 2010. Retrieved
24 May 2011. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned in 1971 into the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] and went on to serve in Germany, Northern Ireland and Cyprus, interspersed with staff duties and further education. He was posted to Paris in 1984, where he was involved in the development of the [[MILAN]] anti-tank weapon, before returning to his regiment as a [[company commander]]. He took command of 1 Ordnance Battalion in 1990 and was tasked with running logistics for [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] during the [[Gulf War]]. He went on to serve as Commander, Logistic Support for [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]] in 1992.

Cross served his first of three tours in the [[Balkans]], attached to the [[IFOR|Implementation Force]] (IFOR), in 1995–1996. His second was in 1997, with the [[SFOR|Stabilisation Force]] (SFOR), where he commanded [[101 Logistic Brigade]], and his third in 1999 with the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR). During his tour with KFOR, he was responsible for co-ordinating multinational troops and civilian agencies in establishing refugee camps in the aftermath of the [[Kosovo War]]. He was later appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for his service with KFOR. Cross was promoted to [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major general]] ([[2 star rank|two-star rank]] in NATO terms) in 2000 and served as Director General, Defence Supply Chain until 2002, when he became involved in planning for the forthcoming [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. He was the most senior British officer involved in the planning and in the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]].

His last command was as [[General Officer Commanding, Theatre Troops]], Iraq. Since retiring from the Army in 2007, Cross has been critical of the planning for Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein's government, giving evidence to the [[Iraq Inquiry]] that he urged politicians to delay the invasion and calling the post-war planning &quot;woefully thin&quot;. He serves as an advisor to the House of Commons [[Defence Select Committee]] and to several private companies, and is a visiting lecturer at several British universities. A convert to Christianity, he is a licensed [[lay reader]] in the [[Church of England]] and affiliated with several Christian organisations. Cross is married, with three children.

==Early life==
Cross is the son of Sidney George and Patricia Mary Cross. Having always wanted to be a soldier, he applied to join the Army at the age of fourteen, but was rejected due to his age.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBN&quot;/&gt; He joined the [[Army Cadet Force]] in 1964&lt;ref name=&quot;CBN&quot;/&gt; and, after his secondary education, was accepted to study at [[Welbeck Defence Sixth Form College]], before attending the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaworld.org/Public/Page_Local.aspx?Id=311|title=Major General Tim Cross|publisher=Cranfield Management Association ([[Cranfield School of Management]]) |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military career==
Cross started at Sandhurst in 1969 and was commissioned into the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] as a [[second lieutenant]] on 30 July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45465|supp=yes|startpage=9661|endpage=9662|date=6 September 1971|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first tour was in [[West Germany]], with the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) in 1971, after which he undertook an in-service degree at the Royal Military College of Science (now part of the [[Defence College of Management and Technology]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to [[First Lieutenant#British Army|lieutenant]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45892|supp=yes|startpage=1350|date=29 January 1973|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having graduated as a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1975, he served a tour with 22 Air Defence Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], with responsibility for the regiment's new [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier missiles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt; Promoted to [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=47289|supp=yes|startpage=9976|date=1 August 1977|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; he went on to train as an [[Ammunition Technical Officer]] (ATO) and was posted to Northern Ireland in 1978, where he was involved in explosive ordnance disposal along with inspection duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt;

Returning to the BAOR in 1979, Cross served as [[Adjutant]] to 1 Ordnance Battalion,&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,84944,00.html|title=Bio: Major-General Tim Cross|date=23 April 2003|work=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; before a tour in Cyprus, attached to the United Nations peace-keeping force in 1981. He studied for an [[MSc]] in guided weapons at [[Staff College, Camberley]] from 1982 to 1983&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt; and was promoted [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] on 30 September 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49509|supp=yes|startpage=13643|endpage=13645|date=17 October 1983|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1984 and 1985, he was posted to Paris as a British liaison to the [[MILAN]] [[anti-tank missile]] programme,&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;/&gt; after which he rejoined 1 Ordnance Battalion as the [[company commander]] of 12 Ordnance Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] on 30 June 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=51399|supp=yes|startpage=7702|endpage=7703|date=4 July 1988|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Staff College, Camberley later that year as a member of the Directing Staff, he was heavily involved in the modernisation of the Command and Staff Course. In 1990, Cross returned again to Germany to take command of 1 Ordnance Battalion, in which he had previously been adjutant and a company commander, and, in a double-hatted post, was appointed Commander Supply, [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]]. In the latter role, he was posted to Kuwait and later Iraq, as part of [[Operation Granby]] during the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;/&gt;

After Iraq, Cross was appointed the first Commander, Logistic Support for [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]] in late 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; During a re-organisation of the Army in 1993, the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] was amalgamated to become part of the newly formed [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC), into which Cross transferred and was promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53363|supp=yes|startpage=11367|date=5 July 1993|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed the [[Higher Command and Staff Course]] earlier in 1995, he returned to 3rd Division and served in Bosnia as part of [[NATO]]'s [[IFOR|Implementation Force]] in 1995 and 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;/&gt;

==High command==
Cross was promoted to [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] on 30 June 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=54453|startpage=8911|date=1 July 1996|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Director, Materiel Supply and Distribution (Army), a post which became Director, Materiel Support (Army) in 1997 as a result of re-organisation, based in [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cma&quot;/&gt; At the end of 1997, he took command of the British [[National Support Element]] in the Balkans, responsible for supplying the British contingent of the [[NATO]]-led [[SFOR|Stabilisation Force]] (SFOR). At the same time, he commanded the Combat Service Support Group, later renamed [[101st Logistic Brigade (United Kingdom)|101 Logistic Brigade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; He returned to the UK in April 1998, only to be told that he would be returning to the Balkans in January 1999 as part of the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR).&lt;ref name=&quot;JHA&quot;/&gt; In this role, he was responsible for the humanitarian effort in the aftermath of the [[Kosovo War]], establishing and maintaining refugee camps in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Albania]]. He was tasked with commanding multinational troops, as well as coordinating the humanitarian efforts of personnel from the British [[Department for International Development]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) and multiple [[non-governmental organisation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operations.mod.uk/telic/biogs_old.htm|title=Operation Telic: UK force commanders|year=2003|work= Brief biographical details of the senior UK commanders involved in Operation Telic |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about his service with KFOR, he later called it a &quot;challenging and demanding deployment&quot; and &quot;the first time that I have come face to face with a large-scale humanitarian crisis.&quot; He went on to say that the most challenging part was the military working alongside large numbers of civilian agencies and that the Army needed to learn how to better work with such organisations—a need he said was &quot;widely recognised&quot; outside the military.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cross|first=Tim|date=April 2001|title=Comfortable with chaos: working with UNHCR and the NGOs; reflections from the 1999 Kosovo refugee crisis|journal=The Journal of Humanitarian Assistance|url=http://www.jha.ac/articles/u042.htm|accessdate=27 May 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110608081629/http://www.jha.ac/articles/u042.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his service in the Balkans, Cross was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2000 [[New Year Honours List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=55711|supp=yes|startpage=42|date=31 December 1999|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January to August 2000, Cross attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies]], after which he was promoted to [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major general]] ([[2 star rank|two-star rank]])&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=55949|supp=yes|startpage=9329|date=22 August 2000|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed Director General, Defence Supply Chain. While Director General, he was responsible for the establishment of the United Kingdom's Joint Force Logistic Component for the forthcoming operations in Iraq and became involved in planning for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of the country]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; In early 2003, he became the British representative to the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, later the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] following the invasion, and one of three deputies to American [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Jay Garner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;

Cross was involved in coordinating the reconstruction of the country following the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; and was the most senior British officer involved in post-war planning for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC II&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6974611.stm|title=Fresh UK attack on US Iraq policy|date=2 September 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, he appeared on BBC ''[[Breakfast with Frost]]'', speaking to presenter [[Peter Sissons]] about his role. He praised the military campaign and went on to talk about the challenges of rebuilding the country, saying &quot;I think in relative terms we are not as badly off as me might have feared&quot;, but agreed that there were insufficient &quot;people on the ground&quot; to ensure security in the aftermath of the invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein's government.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/2936694.stm|title=Interview with Major General Tim Cross|date=25 May 2003|work=[[Breakfast with Frost]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later deeply critical of the planning made for post-war Iraq, and stated that he attempted to raise the issue of insufficient planning with politicians. However, he was never &quot;overly concerned&quot; by warnings from aid agencies of a massive humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion which, in the event, never materialised, though he admitted he had been too optimistic about the state of the Iraqi infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;belief&quot;/&gt; In the ''Breakfast with Frost'' interview, he drew an analogy with London, &quot;if you imagine going into London and every Ministry building is completely empty of furniture, completely empty of people, most of the windows blown out, just trying to find the people who work in those Ministries, the equivalent of the [[Home Office]] and [finding] out who worked there, getting them back to work, beginning to pay their salaries which we're now beginning to do, and encouraging them to come back and work with us is bound to take a bit of time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frost&quot;/&gt;

Cross was given the honorary title of [[Colonel Commandant]], Royal Logistic Corps on 5 April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=56899|supp=yes|startpage=4391|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2004, he was appointed [[General Officer Commanding, Theatre Troops]], Iraq—commander of all British Army combat personnel in the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=57441|supp=yes|startpage=13157|date=19 October 2004|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from active service on 20 January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=58226|supp=yes|startpage=889|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining the honorary title of Colonel Commandant, Royal Logistic Corps and, in April 2007, was given the further ceremonial appointment of [[Honorary Colonel]], [[168 Pioneer Regiment]] (Volunteers), Royal Logistic Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=58375|supp=yes|startpage=9160|date=26 June 2007|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Cross has lectured both  in the UK and elsewhere since his retirement and is a visiting professor at several British universities including the [[University of Nottingham]], [[University of Reading]] and [[Cranfield University]]. He serves as an advisor to a number of organisations. Since 2007, he has been army advisor to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Defence Select Committee]], as well as a defence advisor for [[Fujitsu]] and other companies. He is a non-executive chairman at Asuure Ltd, a British security company, and serves as a director at the Centre for International Humanitarian Cooperation and the [[Humanitarian International Services Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;/&gt;

Following his retirement, Cross attacked US foreign policy on Iraq, calling the plans &quot;fatally flawed&quot; shortly after General Sir [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]]—[[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] at the time of the invasion and also recently retired—called the same plans &quot;intellectually bankrupt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC II&quot;/&gt; In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he &quot;was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects of what we were going to do once the military campaign was over. And I think it's now very public knowledge that that was not well handled. It was not well thought through, it was not well executed. And we lived with the consequences of that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBN&quot;/&gt;

On 7 December 2009, Cross publicly [[List of witnesses of the Iraq Inquiry#7 December|testified]] before the [[Iraq Inquiry]], having previously argued that the proceedings should be held in public as, eventually, they were.&lt;ref name=&quot;indy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/retreat-hutton-and-butler-back-public-iraq-inquiry-1707887.html|title=Retreat?

Cross told Sir [[John Chilcot]], the inquiry chairman, that preparations for Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein were &quot;woefully thin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;campbell&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/alastair-campbell-faces-the-moment-of-truth-1864822.html|title=Alastair Campbell faces the moment of truth|last=Savage|first=Michael |date=12 January 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News and Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;statesman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=8 December 2009|title=The Chilcot Inquiry - 7 December|journal=[[New Statesman]]|publisher=New Statesman Limited|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2009/12/war-planning-iraq-inquiry|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/08/2764899.htm?section=justin|title=General warned Blair against Iraq Invasion|date=8 December 2009|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/dec/07/britain-unprepared-iraq-invasion-chilcot|title=Britain went into Iraq unprepared for aftermath, Chilcot Inquiry told|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|date=7 December 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to tell the inquiry that &quot;although I was confident that we would secure a military victory, I offered my view that we should not begin that campaign until we had a much more coherent postwar plan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;key witnesses&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/06/iraq-inquiry-tim-cross-edward-chaplin|title=Iraq war inquiry key witnesses: Major General Tim Cross and Edward Chaplin|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=6 January 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for ''[[The Independent]]'' in January 2010, Cross, speaking again about post-war Iraq, claimed &quot;A lot of senior generals were frustrated that they didn't have sufficient resources&quot;, and singled out both Blair and [[Clare Short]], [[Secretary of State for International Development]] at the time of the invasion, as well as criticising the system in which funding was allocated for the Iraq campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;indy interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/general-tells-of-frustration-over-iraq-funding-1856773.html|title=General tells of frustration over Iraq funding|last=Savage|first=Michael|date=4 January 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News and Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He visited Jerusalem over the Easter weekend and was inspired by a retired British Army officer he met there to convert.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBN&quot;/&gt; After converting, he considered leaving the Army, but has said in interviews that he reconciled his beliefs with his military service,&lt;ref name=&quot;CBN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;belief&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/timcross.shtml|title=Tim Cross|date=17 March 2008|work=Belief|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; contending that &quot;the British Army as a community [...] recognises the issue of spirituality and goodness and righteousness and justice and evil and wrong probably far more than most&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;belief&quot;/&gt; He is a licensed lay reader in the [[Church of England]] and has involvement with a number of Christian organisations, including as a trustee of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] and a former president of the [[Armed Forces Christian Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;belief&quot;/&gt; In an interview for the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] in 2009, he said &quot;The moral component of fighting power is about leadership, it's about ethics, it's about culture, it's about how do you get people to fight and embedded within that is an element of justice and righteousness. [I]f you lose the moral component, you lose everything. I think we – collectively in the West – have gone through 30 - 40 years really of pretending that this moral component is not important, and that I don't need to have a biblical foundation in my life. And I challenge that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBN&quot;/&gt; He has written on the subject in the British Army Review, an in house publication aimed at generating professional debate, where he described ideas of a secular Army as 'tripe' and 'dangerously wrong' and the rewrite of the motto of the Girl Guides, removing reference to God, as 'vapid and anodyne'.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=What has God got to do with military capability?
