'''Depleted uranium''' ('''DU'''; also referred to in the past as '''Q-metal''', '''depletalloy''' or '''D-38''') is [[uranium]] with a lower content of the [[fissile]] [[isotope]] [[uranium-235|U-235]] than natural uranium.&lt;ref name = &quot;McDiarmid 2001 123&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|McDiarmid|2001|p=123}}: &quot;Depleted uranium possesses only 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium, having been 'depleted' of much of its most highly radioactive U&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt; and U&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt; isotopes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (Natural uranium contains about 0.72% of its fissile isotope U-235, while the DU used by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] contain 0.3% U-235 or less). Uses of DU take advantage of its very high [[density]] of 19.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (68.4% denser than [[lead]]). Civilian uses include [[counterweight]]s in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical [[radiation therapy]] and industrial [[radiography]] equipment, and containers for transporting radioactive materials. Military uses include [[Vehicle armour|armor plating]] and [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectiles]].

Most depleted uranium arises as a [[by-product]] of the production of [[enriched uranium]] for use as fuel in [[nuclear reactor]]s and in the manufacture of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration of lower-[[atomic mass number|mass-number]] uranium isotopes (in particular U-235, which is the uranium isotope supporting the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] [[chain reaction]]) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium, in some cases with mass fractions of U-235 and U-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium. Since U-238 has a much longer [[half-life]] than the lighter isotopes, DU emits less [[alpha radiation]] than natural uranium. DU from [[nuclear reprocessing]] has different isotopic ratios from enrichment–by-product DU, from which it can be distinguished by the presence of [[uranium-236|U-236]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/unep81.doc.htm|title=UN Press Release UNEP/81: Uranium 236 found in depleted uranium penetrators|publisher=UN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DU used in US munitions has 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium.&lt;ref name=&quot;USOSD&quot;&gt;[http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/du_ii_tabc.htm &quot;Properties and Characteristics of DU&quot;] U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense&lt;/ref&gt; Trace [[transuranic]]s (another indicator of the use of reprocessed material) have been reported to be present in some US tank armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;USOSD&quot;/&gt;

The use of DU in [[munitions]] is controversial because of concerns about potential long-term health effects.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pattison|Hugtenburg|Green|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[Human brain|brain]], [[liver]], [[Human heart|heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by exposure to uranium, a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04 /&gt; It is only weakly [[radioactive]] because of its long [[half-life|radioactive half-life]] (4.468 billion years for [[uranium-238]], 700 million years for [[uranium-235]]; or 1 part per million every {{n-life|n=.5|t=4.468*10^9|end=1-10^-6|dec=0}} and {{n-life|n=.5|t=700*10^6|end=1-10^-6|dec=0}} years, respectively). The [[biological half-life]] (the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body) for uranium is about 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[aerosol]] or [[spallation]] [[frangible]] powder produced by impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites, leading to possible inhalation by human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;&gt;Mitsakou C., Eleftheriadis K., Housiadas C., Lazaridis M. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12705453 Modeling of the dispersion of depleted uranium aerosol.] 2003 Apr. Retrieved 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual level of [[acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[toxicity]] of DU is also controversial. Several studies using [[tissue culture|cultured cells]] and laboratory [[rodents]] suggest the possibility of [[leukemia|leukemogenic]], [[gene]]tic, [[reproduction|reproductive]], and [[neurological]] effects from chronic exposure.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|McClain|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 [[epidemiology]] review concluded: &quot;In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindin&quot; /&gt;

==History==
Enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] began their [[nuclear weapons]] programs. Later in the decade, [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] began their [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear power]] programs. Depleted uranium was originally stored as an unusable waste product ([[uranium hexafluoride]]) in the hope that improved enrichment processes could extract additional quantities of the [[Nuclear fission|fission]]able U-235 [[isotope]]. This re-enrichment recovery of the residual uranium-235 is now in practice in some parts of the world; e.g. in 1996 over 6000 metric tonnes were upgraded in a Russian plant.&lt;ref&gt;

Thus most civilian reactors as well as all [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors]] and nuclear weapons production require fuel containing concentrated U-235 and generate depleted Uranium.

In the 1970s, [[the Pentagon]] reported that the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] had developed [[armor plating]] for [[Warsaw Pact]] tanks that [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] ammunition could not penetrate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The Pentagon began searching for material to make denser armor-piercing projectiles. After testing various metals, [[ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] researchers settled on depleted uranium.

The US and NATO militaries used DU penetrator rounds in the [[1991 Gulf War]], the [[Bosnia war]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Production and availability===
[[Natural uranium]] metal contains about 0.71% [[Uranium-235|U-235]], 99.28% [[Uranium-238|U-238]], and about 0.0054% [[Uranium-234|U-234]]. The production of [[enriched uranium]] using [[isotope separation]]  creates ''depleted uranium'' containing only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235. Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U-235, enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium. For example, producing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of 5% enriched uranium requires 11.8&amp;nbsp;kg of natural uranium, and leaves about 10.8&amp;nbsp;kg of depleted uranium having only 0.3% U-235.

The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) defines ''depleted uranium'' as uranium with a percentage of the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U isotope that is less than 0.711% by weight (see [http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part040/part040-0004.html 10 CFR 40.4]). The military specifications designate that the DU used by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) contain less than 0.3% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (AEPI, 1995). In actuality, DoD uses only DU that contains approximately 0.2% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (AEPI, 1995).

Depleted uranium is further produced by recycling spent nuclear fuel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs257/en/ Depleted uranium] WHO Fact sheet N°257, Revised January 2003 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815092349/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs257/en/ |date=15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case it contains traces of [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nukewatchinfo.org/Quarterly/2007spring/07sprp11.pdf Plutonium in DU Weapons, a Chronology] Dr. Michael Repacholi, WHO&lt;/ref&gt; and has therefore been called &quot;dirty DU&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/LAF208A.html U.S. Dirty Bombs: Radioactive Gene Busting Munitions Spiked with Plutonium] John M. Laforge, Centre for Research on Globalisation (CRG), 2002&lt;/ref&gt; although the quantities are so small that they are considered to be not of serious radiological significance (even) by [[ECRR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euradcom.org/publications/ecrruraniumrept.pdf The Health Effects of Exposure to Uranium and Uranium Weapons Fallout] Chris Busby, Documents of the ECRR 2010 No 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranium hexafluoride===
[[File:DUF6 cylinder leak.gif|250px|thumb|right|Hexafluoride tank leaking]]
Some depleted uranium is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]], a crystalline solid, (D)UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in steel cylinders in open air storage yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder holds up to 12.7 tonnes (14 short tons) of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. In the U.S. 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; had accumulated by 1993. In 2008, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near [[Portsmouth, Ohio]], [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States], anl.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/documents/index.cfm |title=Depleted UF6 Management Program Documents |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storage of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is exposed to water vapor in the air, it reacts with the moisture to produce UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[uranyl fluoride]]), a solid, and HF ([[hydrofluoric acid|hydrogen fluoride]]), a gas, both of which are highly soluble and toxic. The uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak, limiting further escape of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq21.cfm |title=What happens if a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride leaks? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks, and are repainted and repaired as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/pdf/DUF6MgmtOverviewFS.PDF], Overview of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride Management Program&lt;/ref&gt;

A tenfold jump in uranium prices has transformed approximately one-third of the U.S. depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth $7.6 billion, assuming DOE re-enriches it. This estimate is based on February 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services, and DOE's access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cibolabeacon.com/articles/2008/04/03/news/news7.txt Agency review nuclear waste], Cibola County Beacon – News, April 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States, including one in which 32 workers were exposed to a cloud of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and its reaction products. One person died; while a few workers with higher exposure experienced short-term [[kidney]] damage (e.g., [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]]), none of them showed lasting damage from the exposure to uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/health/faq30.cfm |title=FAQ 30-Have there been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government has been converting depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq22.cfm |title=FAQ 22-What is going to happen to the uranium hexafluoride stored in the United States? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such disposal of the entire DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/mgmt/faq27.cfm |title=FAQ 27-Are there any currently-operating disposal facilities that can accept all of the depleted uranium oxide that would be generated from conversion of DOE's depleted UF6 inventory? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military applications==
[[File:M900.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The 105mm M900 APFSDS-T (Depleted Uranium Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot – Tracer)]]

Depleted uranium is very dense; at 19,050&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, it is 1.67 times as dense as [[lead]], only slightly less dense than [[tungsten]] and [[gold]], and 84% as dense as [[osmium]] or [[iridium]], which are the densest known substances under standard (i.e., Earth-surface) pressures. Consequently, a DU projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile, with less [[external ballistics|aerodynamic drag]] and deeper [[terminal ballistics|penetration]] due to a higher pressure at point of impact. DU projectile ordnance is often inherently [[incendiary device|incendiary]] because uranium is [[flammable]].&lt;ref name=peacock&gt;{{Cite web |last=Peacock |first=H. B. |title=Pyrophoricity of Uranium |url=http://sti.srs.gov/fulltext/WSRC-TR-92-106.pdf |publisher=Westinghouse Savannah River Company |date=March 1992 |page=2 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity |publisher=United States Department of Energy |date=6 January 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2015 |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/01/f19/DOE-HDBK-1081-2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armor plate===
Because of its high density, depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor, sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate. For instance, some late-production [[M1 Abrams|M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams]] tanks built after 1998 have DU modules integrated into their [[Chobham armour#Heavy metal modules|Chobham armor]], as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret, and there is a program to upgrade the rest.

===Nuclear weapons===
{{main article|Nuclear weapons design}}
Depleted uranium is used as a [[Neutron reflector#Nuclear weapons|tamper]] in [[fission bomb]]s.

===Ammunition===
Most military use of depleted uranium has been as [[30 mm caliber]] ordnance, primarily the 30&amp;nbsp;mm PGU-14/B armour-piercing incendiary round from the [[GAU-8 Avenger]] cannon of the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] used by the [[United States Air Force]]. 25&amp;nbsp;mm DU rounds have been used in the [[M242]] gun mounted on the U.S. Army's [[M2 Bradley|Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]'s [[LAV-25]].

The U.S. Marine Corps uses DU in the 25&amp;nbsp;mm PGU-20 round fired by the [[GAU-12 Equalizer]] cannon of the [[AV-8 Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier]], and also in the 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[M197]] gun mounted on [[AH-1 Cobra]] helicopter gunships. The [[United States Navy]]'s [[Phalanx CIWS]]'s [[M61 Vulcan]] [[Gatling gun]] used 20&amp;nbsp;mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding [[plastic]] [[sabot]]s made using depleted uranium, later changed to [[tungsten]].

Another use of depleted uranium is in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s, [[anti-armor]] rounds such as the 120&amp;nbsp;mm sabot rounds fired from the British [[Challenger 1]], [[Challenger 2]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh McManners|McManners, Hugh]], ''Gulf War One'' Real Voices From the Front Line, Ebury Publishing, 2010, ISBN 9780091935986 p91&lt;/ref&gt; M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams.&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, D. (2003) [http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/pdf/dumyths.pdf &quot;Science or Science Fiction? Facts, Myths and Propaganda In the Debate Over Depleted Uranium Weapons&quot;], Table 1 on p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding [[sabot]]. [[Staballoy]]s are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually [[titanium]] or [[molybdenum]]. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of [[titanium]]. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition. The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium.

DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120&amp;nbsp;mm or 105&amp;nbsp;mm cannons employed on the [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]]. The Russian military has used DU ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s, mostly for the 115&amp;nbsp;mm guns in the [[T-62]] tank and the 125&amp;nbsp;mm guns in the [[T-64]], [[T-72]], [[T-80]], and [[T-90]] tanks.

The DU content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20&amp;nbsp;mm projectiles, 200&amp;nbsp;g in 25&amp;nbsp;mm ones, 280&amp;nbsp;g in 30&amp;nbsp;mm, 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg in 105&amp;nbsp;mm, and 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg in 120&amp;nbsp;mm penetrators. DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make [[hand grenade]]s, [[cluster bomb]]s, and [[land mine]]s, but those applications have been discontinued, according to [[Alliant Techsystems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The US Navy used DU in its 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phalanx CIWS]] guns, but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten.

===Legal status in weapons===
In 1996, the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) gave an advisory opinion on the &quot;''[[legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornnet.nl/~akmalten/unan5a.html ADVISORY OPINION 1996 July 8; General List No.95 (req: UNGA)]. Cornnet.nl. Retrieved 16 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it clear, in paragraphs 54, 55 and 56, that [[international law]] on poisonous weapons—the Second Hague Declaration of 29 July 1899, Hague Convention IV of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925—did not cover nuclear weapons, because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate. This ICJ opinion was about nuclear weapons, but the sentence &quot;The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate,&quot; also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate, but to destroy [[materiel]] and kill soldiers through [[kinetic energy]].

Yeung Sik Yuen to prepare, without financial implications, in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms, the working paper originally assigned to Ms. Forero Ucros.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Y. K. J. Yeung Sik Yuen]] in accordance with [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]] resolution 2001/36. He argues that the use of DU in weapons, along with the other weapons listed by the Sub‑Commission, may breach one or more of the following treaties: [[the Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Genocide Convention]], the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], the [[Geneva Conventions]] including [[Protocol I]], the [[Convention on Conventional Weapons]] of 1980, and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. Yeung Sik Yuen writes in Paragraph 133 under the title &quot;''Legal compliance of weapons containing DU as a new weapon''&quot;:

{{quotation|Annex II to the [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]] 1980 (which became operative on 8 February 1997) classifies DU as a category II nuclear material. Storage and transport rules are set down for that category which indicates that DU is considered sufficiently &quot;hot&quot; and dangerous to warrant these protections. But since weapons containing DU are relatively new weapons no treaty exists yet to regulate, limit or prohibit its use. The legality or illegality of DU weapons must therefore be tested by recourse to the general rules governing the use of weapons under humanitarian and human rights law which have already been analysed in Part I of this paper, and more particularly at paragraph 35 which states that parties to [[Protocol I]] to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have an obligation to ascertain that new weapons do not violate the laws and customs of war or any other international law. As mentioned, the [[International Court of Justice]] considers this rule binding customary humanitarian law.}}

[[Louise Arbour]], chief prosecutor for the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] led a committee of staff lawyers to investigate possible treaty prohibitions against the use of DU in weapons. Their findings were that:&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sills ''et al'' ''[http://www.aepi.army.mil/internet/env-crime-icc-printer.pdf Environmental Crimes in Military Actions and the International Criminal Court (ICC)-United Nations Perspectives]'' (PDF) ([http://web.archive.org/web/20041015050907/http://www.aepi.army.mil/internet/env-crime-icc-printer.pdf HTML]) of American Council for the UN University, April 2002.

In September 2008, and in response to the 2007 General Assembly resolution, the [[UN Secretary General]] published the views of 15 states alongside those of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). The IAEA and WHO evidence differed little from previous statements on the issue.&lt;ref name=ICBUW&gt;Staff.

==Civilian applications==
Depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material, and as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]. Examples include sailboat [[keel]]s, as [[counterweight]]s and as shielding in industrial [[radiography]] cameras.

===Shielding in industrial radiography cameras===
[[Industrial radiography]] cameras include a very high activity [[gamma radiation]] source (typically [[Iridium-192#Iridium-192|Ir-192]] with an activity above 10 TBq). Depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source. Typically, the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in [[polyurethane]] foam for thermal, mechanical and oxidation protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Coloring in consumer products===
Consumer product uses have included incorporation into [[dental porcelain]], used for [[false teeth]] to simulate the fluorescence of natural teeth, and uranium-bearing reagents used in chemistry laboratories (e.g. [[uranyl acetate]], used in [[analytical chemistry]] and as a [[staining|stain]] in [[electron microscopy]]). Uranium (both depleted uranium and natural uranium) was widely used as a coloring matter for [[Fiestaware|porcelain]] and [[Uranium glass|glass]] in the 19th and early-to-mid-20th century. The practice was largely discontinued in the late 20th century. In 1999, concentrations of 10% depleted uranium were being used in &quot;jaune no.17&quot; a yellow [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] powder that was being produced in [[France]] by Cristallerie de Saint-Paul, a manufacturer of enamel [[pigment]]s. The depleted uranium used in the powder was sold by [[Cogéma]]'s Pierrelatte facility. In February 2000, Cogema discontinued the sale of depleted uranium to producers of enamel and glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Trim weights in aircraft===
Aircraft that contain depleted uranium trim weights for stabilizing wings and control surfaces (such as the [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747–100]]) may contain between 400 and 1,500&amp;nbsp;kg of DU. This application is controversial because the DU might enter the environment if the aircraft crashes. The metal can also [[oxidation|oxidize]] to a fine powder in a fire. Its use has been phased out in many newer aircraft. [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell-Douglas]] discontinued using DU counterweights in the 1980s. Depleted uranium was released during the crash of [[El Al Flight 1862]] on 4 October 1992, in which 152&amp;nbsp;kg was lost, but a [[case study]] concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium from the plane to any health problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uijt de Haag P.A. and Smetsers R.C. and Witlox H.W. and Krus H.W. and Eisenga A.H. 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author= Uijt de Haag P.

===US NRC general license===
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations at [http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part040/part040-0025.html 10 CFR 40.25] establish a general license for the use of depleted uranium contained in industrial products or devices for mass-volume applications. This general license allows anyone to possess or use depleted uranium for authorized purposes. Generally, a registration form is required, along with a commitment to not abandon the material. Agreement states may have similar, or more stringent, regulations.

===Sailboat keel===
[[Pen Duick|''Pen Duick VI'']], a boat designed by André Mauric and used for racing, was equipped with a keel in depleted uranium. The benefit is that, due to the very high density of uranium, the keel could be thinner for a given weight, and so have less resistance than a normal keel. It was later replaced by a standard lead keel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/news/7245_Roaring-Forties-chapter-22-Frances-inspiration.html|title=Roaring Forties, chapter 22: France’s inspiration|author=Volvo Ocean Race|work=Volvo Ocean Race|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling calorimeters for detectors in high-energy particle physics===
Depleted uranium has been used in a number of [[calorimeter (particle physics)#Homogeneous versus sampling|sampling calorimeters]] (such as in the D0&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Experiment at D0 to Study anti-Proton - Proton Collisions at 2-TeV: Design Report.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ZEUS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-zeus.desy.de/bluebook/ch05/chapter2_4.html|title=The ZEUS detector: Status Report 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; detectors) in due to its high density and natural radioactivity.

The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] claims that no human [[cancer]] of any type has been seen as a result of exposure to either natural or depleted uranium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Effects of Uranium&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 |author= Health Effects of Uranium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Militaries have long had risk-reduction procedures for their troops to follow,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zwijnenburg|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and studies are in consistent agreement that veterans who used DU-enhanced munitions have not suffered, so far, from an increased risk of cancer (see the Gulf War and Balkans sections below). The effects of DU on civilian populations are, however, a topic of intense and ongoing controversy.

As early as 1997, [[Royal Army Medical Corps|British Army doctors]] warned the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] that exposure to depleted uranium increased the risk of developing lung, lymph and brain cancer, and recommended a series of safety precautions.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/11/armstrade.world?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | publisher=[[The Guardian|theguardian.com]] | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=MoD knew shells were cancer risk | date=11 January 2001|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report issued summarizing the advice of the doctors, &quot;Inhalation of insoluble [[uranium dioxide]] dust will lead to accumulation in the lungs with very slow clearance—if any. … Although chemical toxicity is low, there may be localised radiation damage of the lung leading to cancer.&quot; The report warns that &quot;All personnel … should be aware that uranium dust inhalation carries a long-term risk … [the dust] has been shown to increase the risks of developing lung, lymph and brain cancers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt; In 2003, the [[Royal Society]] called, again, for urgent attention to be paid to the possible health and environmental impact of depleted uranium, and added its backing to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s call for a scientific assessment of sites struck with depleted uranium.&lt;ref name = &quot;Moszynski 2003 a&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Moszynski|2003}}.&lt;br&gt;The article quotes Professor Brian Spratt of the Royal Society's DU working group: &quot;It is highly unsatisfactory to deploy a large amount of material that is weakly radioactive and chemically toxic without knowing how much soldiers and civilians have been exposed to.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2004, the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service attributed [[birth defect]] claims from a February 1991 [[Gulf War]] combat veteran to depleted uranium [[poison]]ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;vitw.org&quot;&gt;Williams, M. (February 9, 2004) [http://vitw.org/archives/405 &quot;First Award for Depleted Uranium Poisoning Claim,&quot;] ''The Herald Online,'' (Edinburgh: Herald Newspapers, Ltd.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cadu.org.uk&quot;&gt;Campaign Against Depleted Uranium (Spring, 2004) [http://www.cadu.org.uk/news/17.htm#icbuw &quot;MoD Forced to Pay Pension for DU Contamination,&quot;] ''CADU News 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a 2005 [[epidemiology]] review concluded: &quot;In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindin&quot; /&gt; Studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of [[leukemia|leukemogenic]], [[gene]]tic, [[reproduction|reproductive]], and [[neurological]] effects from chronic exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;MillerMcClain&quot;/&gt;

===Chemical toxicity===
The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is about a million times greater ''in vitro'' than its radiological hazard,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|Stewart|Brooks|Shi|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the kidney considered to be the main target organ.&lt;ref name = &quot;RSDUWG 2002a 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Health effects of DU are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external. Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur: [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]], and embedded fragments or [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Livengood|1996|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Properties such as phase (e.g. particulate or gaseous), oxidation state (e.g. metallic or ceramic), and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]], [[Distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]], translocation, [[Clearance (medicine)|elimination]] and the resulting toxicity. For example, metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent uranium(VI) [[uranyl]] compounds such as [[uranium trioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;«Gmelin Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie» 8th edition, English translation, ''Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry,'' vol.

Uranium is pyrophoric when finely divided.&lt;ref&gt;US Dept. of Energy Handbook, [http://hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081.html &quot;Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity&quot;], Chapter [http://hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081e.html#ZZ30 &quot;Uranium&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; It will corrode under the influence of air and water producing insoluble uranium(IV) and soluble uranium (VI) salts. Soluble uranium salts are toxic. Uranium slowly accumulates in several organs, such as the [[liver]], [[spleen]], and kidneys. The [[World Health Organization]] has established a daily &quot;tolerated intake&quot; of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5&amp;nbsp;µg/kg body weight, or 35&amp;nbsp;µg for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult.

Approximately 90 [[microgram]]s of natural uranium, on average, exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water, food and air. Most is in the [[skeleton]]. The [[biochemistry]] of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium.

===Radiological hazards===

The primary radiation danger from pure depleted uranium is due to [[alpha particle]]s, which do not travel far through air, and do not penetrate clothing. However, in a matter of a month or so, a sample of pure depleted uranium will generate small amounts of [[thorium-234]] and [[protactinium-234]], which emit the more penetrating [[beta particle]]s at almost the same rate as the uranium emits alpha rays. This is because uranium-238 decays directly to thorium-234, which with a half-life of 24 days decays to protactinium-234, which in turn decays in a matter of hours to the long-lived uranium-234. A quasi-steady state is therefore reached within a few multiples of 24 days.&lt;ref&gt;The amounts of both thorium-234 and protactinium-234 after the first days and for millions of years thereafter will be approximately proportional to 1−2&lt;sup&gt; −t / (24 days)&lt;/sup&gt;. See {{cite book|author1=Kenneth S. Krane|title=Introductory Nuclear Physics|date=1988|isbn=978-0-471-80553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available evidence suggests that the radiation risk is small relative to the chemical hazard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Surveying the veteran-related evidence pertaining to the Gulf War, a 2001 editorial in the ''[[BMJ]]'' concluded that it was not possible to justify claims of radiation-induced lung cancer and leukaemia in veterans of that conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDiarmid|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While agreeing with the editorial's conclusion, a reply noted that its finding in the negative was guaranteed, given that &quot;global dose estimates or results of mathematical modelling are too inaccurate to be used as dose values for an individual veteran&quot;, and that, as of April 2001, no practical method of measuring the expected small doses that each individual veteran would receive had been suggested.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mould 2001&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mould|2001}}.&lt;br&gt;Mould's suggestion was [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] [[dosimetry]] using tooth enamel. He also wrote that the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] was able, using this method, to measure doses as low as 20&amp;nbsp;mSv, and that, if it were asked to, the NIST would be able to get involved, meaning at least one centre could help undertake a screening programme for veterans.&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the reply, a radiation scientist, went on to suggest a method that had been used several times before, including after the 1986 Chernobyl accident.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mould 2001&quot;/&gt; Despite the widespread use of DU in the [[Iraq War]], at least a year after the conflict began, testing for UK troops was still only in the discussion phase.&lt;ref name = &quot;GIUHW 2004&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Greenberg|Iversen|Unwin|Hull|2004}}, which found that perhaps a quarter of all UK troops would have been interested in undergoing DU-related monitoring, although &quot;the desire for DU screening is more closely linked to current health status rather than plausible exposure to DU.&quot;&lt;p&gt;Confusingly, {{Harvnb|Moszynski|2003}} reports that &quot;testing is now available to all troops that served in Iraq&quot;, and does not say if this is testing à la Mould.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Society DU Working Group concluded in 2002 that there were &quot;very low&quot; health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium, though also ventured that, &quot;[i]n extreme conditions and under worst-case assumptions&quot; lung and kidney damage could occur, and that in &quot;worst-case scenarios high local levels of uranium could occur in food or water that could have adverse effects on the kidney&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The study is mentioned by {{Harvnb|Patel|2006}}.&lt;br&gt;According to Patel, &quot;[t]he majority evidence and expert opinion on the lack of a clear association between depleted uranium are quite consistent&quot;. Similarly, {{Harvnb|Murphy|Greenberg|Bland|2009}}: &quot;[T]here is now a large body of evidence to suggest that, whatever the cause of the ill‐health experienced by Gulf War veterans, neither DU nor vaccinations are likely to have caused them.&quot;&lt;p&gt;The Working Group study he mentions is {{Harvnb|Royal Society DU Working Group|2002b}}, which is a summary of the second part of the Working Group's look at the health effects of DU: Part&amp;nbsp;1: {{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2001}}; Part&amp;nbsp;2: {{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Royal Society issued another urgent call to investigate the actual health and environmental impact of depleted uranium.&lt;ref name = &quot;Moszynski 2003 a&quot;/&gt; The same year, a [[cohort study]] of Gulf War veterans found no elevated risks of cancer generally, nor of any specific cancers in particular, though recommended follow up studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macfarlane|Biggs|Maconochie|Hotopf|2003}}: &quot;There is no current excess risk of cancer overall nor of site specific cancers in Gulf war veterans. Specific exposures during deployment have not resulted in a subsequent increased risk of cancer. The long latent period for cancer, however, necessitates the continued follow up of these cohorts.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], a [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]] [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from it would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass; the [[radiological]] dangers are lower due to its longer half-life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes.

{{Main article|Gulf War syndrome}}

Since 1991, the year the [[Gulf War]] ended, veterans and their families voiced concern about subsequent health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murphy|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, an assessment of the first 1,000 veterans involved in the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s Gulf War medical assessment programme found &quot;no evidence&quot; of a single illness, physical or mental, that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coker|Bhatt|Blatchley|Graham|1999}}: &quot;As the veterans assessed by the programme were all self selected, the prevalence of illness in Gulf war veterans cannot be determined from this study. Furthermore, it is not known whether the veterans in this study were representative of sick veterans as a group.&quot;&lt;br&gt;To recapitulate using {{Harvnb|Murphy|1999}}: &quot;[T]hough Gulf War veterans' illnesses are real and sometimes disabling, they do not seem to constitute a unique illness.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1999, [[MEDACT]] petitioned for the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and Iraqi civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stott|Holdstock|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A major 2006 review of peer-reviewed literature by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] committee concluded that, &quot;[b]ecause the symptoms vary greatly among individuals&quot;, they do not point to a syndrome unique to Gulf War veterans, though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre-deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charatan 2006 a&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Charatan|2006}}. The quote is of [[Lynn Goldman]], who chaired the IOM committee that carried out the review.&lt;p&gt;{{Harvnb|Iversen|Chalder|Wessely|2007}} notes that &quot;despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being&quot; among Gulf War veterans, &quot;exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group. Likewise, there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Wessely]] praised the IOM's review, and noted that, despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed, its other findings made it &quot;equally clear that service in the Gulf war&lt;!--not a typo; the article uses a lower case 'w'--&gt; did aversely affect health in some personnel&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charatan 2006 b&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Charatan|2006}}. The quote is of Wessely himself.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans' postwar health, because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service, another major stumbling block with some studies, like the thousand-veteran one, is that the subjects are self-selected, rather than a random sample, making general conclusions impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coker|Bhatt|Blatchley|Graham|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Murphy|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased rates of [[immune system]] disorders and other wide-ranging symptoms, including chronic pain, fatigue and memory loss, have been reported in over one quarter of combat veterans of the 1991 [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (2004) [http://www1.va.gov/rac-gwvi/docs/ReportandRecommendations_2004.pdf &quot;Scientific Progress in Understanding Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Report and Recommendations&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Combustion products&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murphy|Greenberg|Bland|2009}}: &quot;Metallic DU is weakly radioactive and therefore contact with unbroken skin is an extremely low risk to health. However, when a DU round strikes an armoured target, it undergoes spontaneous partial combustion resulting in a fine aerosol of largely insoluble uranium oxides. Presence of this aerosol elevates the risk of potentially chemotoxic or radiotoxic exposure via inhalation or ingestion&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; from depleted uranium munitions are being considered{{needs update|date=August 2015}} as one of the potential causes by the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, as DU was used in 30&amp;nbsp;mm and 25&amp;nbsp;mm cannon rounds on a large scale for the first time in the Gulf War.

[[File:DoD Environmental Uranium Gulf.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Excerpt from a 1998 evaluation of environmental exposure to depleted uranium in the Persian Gulf by the US Department of Defense]]
The U.S. Army has commissioned ongoing research into potential risks of depleted uranium and other projectile weapon materials like tungsten, which the U.S. Navy has used in place of DU since 1993. Studies by the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant [[toxicology|toxicological]] threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/mcclain_NATO_2005.pdf |title=Status of Health Concerns about Military Use of Depleted Uranium and Surrogate Metals in Armor-Penetrating Munitions |author1=D.

In 2003, Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman of the [[Royal Society]]'s working group on depleted uranium, said: &quot;The question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean-up is a political rather than scientific question,&quot; and &quot;[[Multinational force in Iraq|the coalition]] needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in-roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gaurdian2003&quot; /&gt;

A 2008 review of all relevant articles appearing in the peer-reviewed journals on [[MEDLINE]] through to the end of 2007, including multiple cohort studies of veterans, found no consistent evidence of excess risks of [[neoplasms]] that could have some link to DU, and that &quot;[t]he overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of Gulf war and Balkans veterans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagorio|Grande|Martina|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a more comprehensive assessment is possible, a 2011 update on a cancer scare regarding Italian soldiers who had served in the Balkans found lower than expected incidence rates for all cancers, a finding &quot;consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo, where armour-penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peragallo|Urbano|Sarnicola|Lista|2011}}: &quot;[T]he excess of reported cases for this malignancy [lymphoma] in 2001–2002 was probably due to a peak that occurred in 2000 among the whole military; it is therefore unrelated to deployment in the Balkans, and probably represents a chance event.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular subgroup of veterans that may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of DU from shrapnel wounds. A laboratory study on rats produced by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute showed that, after a study period of 6 months, rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets, comparable to the average levels in the urine of [[Desert Storm]] veterans with retained DU fragments, had developed a significant tendency to lose weight with respect to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/pellmar.pdf |title=Toxicological Evaluation of Depleted Uranium in Rats: Six Month Evaluation Point |author1=T.

Substantial amounts of uranium were accumulating in their [[Human brain|brain]]s and [[central nervous system]]s, and showed a significant reduction of [[neurone|neuronal]] activity in the [[hippocampus]] in response to external stimuli. The conclusions of the study show that brain damage from chronic uranium intoxication is possible at lower doses than previously thought. Results from computer-based neurocognitive tests performed in 1997 showed an association between uranium in the urine and &quot;problematic performance on automated tests assessing performance efficiency and accuracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordujenko|first= A.|date=September 2002|url= http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_sep02/ADFHealth_3_2_50-57.pdf | title=Military medical aspects of depleted uranium munitions|journal=ADF Health|publisher=Australian Defence Forces|volume = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraqi population===
Since 2001, medical personnel at the [[Basra]] hospital in [[southern Iraq]] have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the Gulf War. Iraqi doctors attributed these malformations to possible long-term effects of DU, an opinion that was echoed by several newspapers.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bostonglobe&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Neuffer [http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0126-03.htm Iraqis Trace Surge in Cancer to US Bombings] ''Boston Globe'' January 26, 2003, Page: A11 Section: National/Foreign&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Johnson [http://www.seattlepi.com/national/95178_du12.shtml Iraqi cancers, birth defects blamed on U.S. depleted uranium] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' November 12, 2002.

A medical survey, &quot;[[Cancer]], [[Infant Mortality]] and Birth [[Human sex ratio|Sex Ratio]] in [[Fallujah]], Iraq 2005–2009&quot; published in July 2010, states that the &quot;…increases in cancer and [[birth defects]]…are alarmingly high&quot; and that infant mortality 2009/2010 has reached 13.6%.

In 2001, the [[World Health Organization]] reported that data from [[Kosovo]] was inconclusive and called for further studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/entity/ionizing_radiation/pub_meet/en/Report_WHO_depleted_uranium_Eng.pdf Report of the WHO's Depleted Uranium Mission to Kosovo (pdf 123kb)] January 22–31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] stated that low levels of contaminate were found in drinking water and air particulate at DU penetrator impact points. The levels were stated as not a cause for alarm. Yet, [[Pekka Haavisto]], chairman of the UNEP DU projects stated, &quot;The findings of this study stress again the importance of appropriate clean-up and civil protection measures in a post-conflict situation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=298&amp;ArticleID=3926&amp;l=en Low-level DU contamination found in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNEP calls for precaution] ''United Nations Environment Programme'', 25 March 2003. Retrieved 25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of Italian scientists from the [[University of Siena]] reported in 2005 that, although DU was &quot;clearly&quot; added to the soil in the study area, &quot;the phenomenon was very limited spatially and the total uranium concentrations fell within the natural range of the element in soils. Moreover, the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Di Lella|Nannoni|Protano|Riccobono|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contamination as a result of the Afghan War===
The Canadian Uranium Medical Research Centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in [[Jalalabad]] that showed concentrations of 80–400&amp;nbsp;ng/L of undepleted uranium, far higher than the typical concentration in the British population of ~5&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durakovic | first1 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The Quantitative Analysis of Uranium Isotopes in the Urine of the Civilian Population of Eastern Afghanistan after Operation Enduring Freedom | url = | journal = Military Medicine | volume = 170 | issue = 4| pages = 277–284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies indicating negligible effects===
Studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that DU ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects.

A 1999 [[literature review]] conducted by the [[Rand Corporation]] stated: &quot;No evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium, whether inhaled or ingested, even at very high doses,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/randrep/du/cover.html|title=&quot;A Review of the Scientific Literature as it Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses,&quot; Rand Report, 1999.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a RAND report authored by the U.S. Defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating DU hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard D. Rostker]] [https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8066/ Depleted Uranium, A Case Study of Good and Evil]. RAND Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 [[oncology]] study concluded that &quot;the present scientific consensus is that DU exposure to humans, in locations where DU ammunition was deployed, is very unlikely to give rise to [[cancer induction]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[IAEA]] reported in 2003 that, &quot;based on credible scientific evidence, there is no proven link between DU exposure and increases in human cancers or other significant health or environmental impacts,&quot; although &quot;Like other [[heavy metals]], DU is potentially poisonous. In sufficient amounts, if DU is ingested or inhaled it can be harmful because of its chemical toxicity. High concentration could cause kidney damage.&quot; The IAEA concluded that, while depleted uranium is a potential [[carcinogen]], there is no evidence that it has been carcinogenic in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2005 study by [[Sandia National Laboratory|Sandia National Laboratories']] Al Marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War.

Marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2005/def-nonprolif-sec/snl-dusand.pdf An Analysis of Uranium Dispersal and Health Effects Using a Gulf War Case Study], Albert C.

===Atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions===
Elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment at several monitoring sites in Britain. These elevated readings appear to coincide with [[Operation Anaconda]] in Afghanistan, and the [[Shock and Awe]] bombing campaign at the start of the Second Gulf War.&lt;ref name=&quot;unidir.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2759.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321184057/http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2759.pdf |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Busby and S. Morgan, 2006, Did the Use of Uranium Weapons in Gulf War 2 Result in Contamination of Europe? Evidence from the Measurements of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston,
Aberystwyth, Green Audit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other contamination cases===
On 4 October 1992, an [[El Al]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-F]] cargo aircraft ([[El Al Flight 1862|Flight 1862]]) crashed into an apartment building in [[Amsterdam]]. Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues, which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires. Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by the accident. The study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium (used as counterbalance weights on the elevators of the plane) to any of the reported health complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uijt de Haag P.A. and Smetsers R.C. and Witlox H.W. and Krus H.W. and Eisenga A.H. 2000&quot;/&gt;

=== Safety and environmental issues ===

About 95% of the depleted uranium produced until now is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]], (D)UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 US tons) of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. In the U.S. alone, 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; had accumulated by 1993. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near [[Portsmouth, Ohio]], [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The long-term storage of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air and produces UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride), both of which are highly soluble and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieer.org/sdafiles/vol_5/5-2/deararj.html|title=» Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship (Vol. 5, No. 2)|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 | title = FAQ 30-Have there been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride?

 | accessdate = 21 August 2013
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The vulnerability of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; storage cylinders to terrorist attack is apparently not the subject of public reports. However, the U.S. government has been converting DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to solid uranium oxides for disposal.&lt;ref&gt;

 | date = 
 | accessdate = 21 August 2013
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Disposing of the whole DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; inventory could cost anywhere from 15 to 450 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;
