== Dereliction of Duty II quote re Petraeus is misrepresented ==

Based off a quick skim it seems that Davis is describing the political climate at the time, not his personal views, when he says Petraeus was a real war hero. The article makes it sound like the latter is true.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/128.135.100.112|128.135.100.112]] ([[User talk:128.135.100.112|talk]]) 21:44, 11 April 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== MacArthur provoking China ==

In his 1996 book, ''Inchon to Wonsan: From the Deck of a Destroyer in the Korean War'', Alexander says &quot;In short, MacArthur was undertaking to carry out his own foreign policy program independent of, and in direct contravention to, the administration in Washington, D.C., which he felt was controlled by subversives.&quot;

[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=President_Truman%27s_relief_of_General_Douglas_MacArthur&amp;diff=619376437&amp;oldid=619222727 The recent edits] by {{u|Winslowl}} appear at first to contravene Wikipedia's rules about [[WP:SYNTHESIS]] or [[WP:No original research]], since they are anchored by citations to Navy action reports and deck logs. However, the attendant citations of books and articles by William Manchester, Edward J. Marolda and James Edwin Alexander are where you'll find the connection made between the destroyers assigned dangerous duty in Chinese territorial waters near Swatow, and MacArthur's attempt to rework foreign policy by inviting a hostile reaction from China. 

Perhaps the recent text is too detailed, but if we rework it, let's keep the basic idea, that MacArthur was provoking a larger war. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User 
talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 04:43, 1 August 2014 (UTC)
:Winslowl makes a fundamental mistake: the Seventh Fleet and the naval forces around Formosa were not under MacArthur's command. They were part of CINCPAC. The action must have been ordered by Washington. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 13:01, 1 August 2014 (UTC)
::When we talk about a &quot;larger war&quot;, we have to keep this in perspective. MacArthur did not believe that expanding the war with China would could a war in Europe with the Soviet Union. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 13:16, 1 August 2014 (UTC)
:::Aside from content concerns as noted above, the formatting and expression is not suitable for a Featured Article. I'm sure it's been added in good faith but I'd recommend removing these recent edits and, if the gist of it is in fact deemed appropriate, re-writing and re-adding subsequently. Cheers, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) 01:52, 2 August 2014 (UTC)
::::Yeah, true. And after seeing the new autobiography of our friend [[User:Winslowl]], I am even more concerned about whether this material has never been published, in which case we would be in violation of [[WP:No original research]]. Action reports and deck logs do not on their own make a story into something that has been published—they are primary sources. This story ought to be taken, at least the main thrust of it, from books and articles in [[WP:SECONDARY]] sources. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 04:49, 2 August 2014 (UTC)
:::::The most relevant source I can find is the article by James Edwin Alexander. 
:::::*{{cite journal |last=Alexander |first=James Edwin |title='Who's In Charge Here?' – The destroyer John A.

:::::I have the article. It can be downloaded from http://www.usni.org/proceedings-and-naval-history-archives. Cost is $4. [[User:Winslowl|Winslowl]] ([[User talk:Winslowl|talk]]) 12:53, 2 August 2014 (UTC)
::::::Thanks for the link! I now have the article, too, after spending four bucks. The magazine article was three pages long, but its text, rewritten by Alexander in condensed form to fit the magazine, is largely contained within Alexander's 1996 book, ''Inchon to Wonsan'', spread out from pages 67 to 85 to 91 and then more specifically 166–173. So if you are looking for bang for your buck, get the whole book. New, it's $29; used it's anywhere from $3 to $17 on Amazon.
::::::Alexander certainly fingers MacArthur as having tried to goad China into firing upon American naval units, which they refused to do. There's no original research being done on Wikipedia with regard to that idea. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 16:18, 2 August 2014 (UTC)
I avoided using Alexander's 1996 book, ''Inchon to Wonsan'' as a reference since, although the pertinent information is factual, some of the writing is fiction, e.g. the ship's name, the narrator's name and rate, his sweetheart, the month the ship arrived in Korean waters, etc.  All of the significant incidents are factual, but many occurred on other ships and some combat activities described in the book had occurred while the John A. Bole was still in California. 

None of what I wrote is based on personal observation.  I had reported aboard the Bole 16 days before 11 April as assistant engineering officer.  The morning of 11 April, I was aware that we were close to the Chinese coast on a secret and potentially dangerous mission. My General Quarters station was in the after engine room and I recall it as being the longest and most boring General Quarters period of my life, 5-3/4 hours. Noon meal was brought to us on station. Crew members going up for a pit stop reported seeing the junks and I assumed they were curious fishing vessels.  Later they reported a lot of aircraft. After we secured from General Quarters I considered the whole operation to be a non-event. Since it was secret it was not discussed and I forgot about it until 43 years later when Jim Alexander at a ship's reunion told me he had succeeded in getting the operation declassified under the Freedom of Information Act and was preparing to write about it.  I was flabbergasted and confirmed his description of events with others whom I knew had been in a position to see what was occurring.[[User:Winslowl|Winslowl]] ([[User talk:Winslowl|talk]]) 02:49, 3 August 2014 (UTC)
:Would be interested in this. On the ground, Ridgway had prepared an offensive known as [[Operation_Courageous#Operations_Rugged_and_Dauntless|Operation Rugged]], and pressed MacArthur for permission to launch it. On 15 March 1951, the day after Seoul had be recaptured a second time, Truman had responded to a reporter's question about whether UN forces would again be allowed to move north of the 38th Parallel by saying that it would be &quot;a tactical matter for the field commander&quot;. MacArthur thereupon gave Ridgway permission to launch his attack, setting an objective line north of the 38th Parallel that would secure Seoul's water supply. He did so without consulting with Washington until the attack actually began on 5 April 1951. It was making steady progress when MacArthur was relieved on 11 April.
:The Naval operations that we are talking could have been part of MacArthur putting pressure on the Chinese. (Alexander's claim that Taiwanese troops were highly trained and well-equipped is wrong.) And while MacArthur did press Washington to authorise covert operations against mainland China, he was unaware that these operations were already being carried out! We really need a better source. The connection with MacArthur's dismissal remains a hypothesis, and is Original Research. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 05:06, 3 August 2014 (UTC)
::Wikipedia's rule against users engaging in their own original research does not apply to authors such as James Edwin Alexander. Alexander did perform his own research and he did put forward his explicit conclusion that MacArthur wanted to goad China into firing upon US forces. Is it a hypothesis? Certainly. But it's not against Wikipedia policy to mention it, I think with attribution to Alexander as it is not a widely held notion. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 06:00, 3 August 2014 (UTC)
:::That sounds reasonable. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 07:27, 3 August 2014 (UTC)
::::It is not a widely held notion because the incident remained secret for 43 years. My reviews of the Navy deck logs make it evident to me that there was an attempt by involved senior naval authorities to prevent the role of the three destroyers from ever becoming pubic. After all, most, if not all, shared MacArthur's views concerning the handicap placed on them by the restrictions Washington was placing on operations. Very few, if any, approved of MacArthur's actions in publicly defying the Commander-in-Chief. Assuming they had been operating under the direct orders of MacArthur, orders that they personally approved of and would, themselves, have been insubordinate with respect to MacArthur had they not carried them out, nevertheless could have been implicated had the roles of the destroyers become public.

::::Had it not been for Alexander this incident would never have come to light. Unfortunately, Alexander's revelations did not reach a large audience. Deck logs are required to document the presence of other vessels that might affect the navigation of a vessel. The logs of the Bole make no mention of the 47 junks that impeded the Bole's navigation.  In 1951, deck logs were hand written, then within a day or two, typed by the ship's office and signed a day or more later by the officer who wrote them. This left a lot of opportunity for &quot;cooking the books&quot; and it appears to me this was done on orders of higher authority. I personally knew there were numerous junks out there that should have been logged. They were not logged.  The above is one item of several I discovered in the deck logs and will be subjects of further research, but not suitable for Wikipedia at this point.[[User:Winslowl|Winslowl]] ([[User talk:Winslowl|talk]]) 16:02, 3 August 2014 (UTC)
:::::There are several reasons that I, personally, cannot accept the probability or even the possibility, that MacArthur was unaware of what the Navy was doing. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and MacArthur were very concerned about reports that China might be preparing for an invasion of Taiwan. The order for redeployment of Task Force 77 to the Formosa strait could possibly have originated in Washington and most certainly approved by Washington.  

:::::With respect to the stationing of the destroyers near the mainland, I cannot conceive of that order originating from either Washington, ComNavFE or ComSeventhFleet considering the temperament of the latter two and the policies of the administration. Only MacArthur had the temperament to place a ship with over 250 crewmembers at high risk of capture or loss of life. Washington wanted to contain the war, so such a move would have been counterproductive in its eyes. The admirals may have agreed with their theater commander that the risk was worth the potential benefit in terms of total lives lost and resources expended by war's end, but would never have assumed the responsibility without the the theater commander's approval, particularly since they would have been acting counter to national policy.

:::::&amp;nbsp;The deck logs of the Bole match the movements and events on the fictitious Borland in Alexander's 1996 book, ''Inchon to Wonsan'' beginning 24 September when the Borland received orders to immediately proceed to Sasebo, which they did, leaving behind several crew members on authorized liberty. Alexander cites evidence that preparation for the heightened possibility of the Bole being captured by the Chinese may have been initiated at that point with planning being initiated at an earlier date. VADM A. D. Struble was relieved by VADM H. M. Martin as Com7thFlt on 28 March, 4 days after Bole seems to have commenced preparation for its role in the 11 April action, thus involving yet another admiral in an action counter to national policy. I cannot perceive of anyone but MacArthur ordering the action, especially since it was MacArthur who was reported as having alerted the right wing governments of Spain and Portugal.[[User:Winslowl|Winslowl]] ([[User talk:Winslowl|talk]]) 04:11, 4 August 2014 (UTC)

::::::I did a re-edit. I had to eliminate mention of the other two destroyers since I am not aware of any published article mentioning them. I also removed all references to logs, etc. The formatting of the references may require some correcting.[[User:Winslowl|Winslowl]] ([[User talk:Winslowl|talk]]) 17:16, 7 August 2014 (UTC)

I am proposing to delete the first paragraph of this sub-section and add a new sub-section entitled &quot;Diplomatic dispatch intercepts&quot; immediately before this one. The proposed sub-section to read as follows:

In 1951 the National Security Agency (NSA) routinely eavesdropped on foreign diplomatic dispatches to their capitals of friends and foes alike. Knowledge of the NSA's practice was a tightly held secret at the time known to only a very few, not even MacArthur. 
March 1951 intercepts of dispatches from the Tokyo embassies of Spain and Portugal, both run by right-wing dictatorships, described conversations with General MacArthur in which the general expressed confidence that he would succeed in expanding the Korean War into a full-scale conflict with the Chinese Communists. The information was passed to Truman in mid-March and only he and 3 or 4 of his closest advisers were aware of its nature. Truman was enraged to learn that MacArthur was not only trying to increase public support for his position on conducting the war, but had informed foreign governments that he planned to initiate actions that were counter to United States policy. Truman had no choice but to relieve MacArthur of his commands at the first opportunity, but was unable to act immediately since he could not reveal the existence of the intercepts and because of MacArthur's popularity with the public and political support in Congress.
 
Following the release on April 5th by Representative Martin of MacArthur's letter dated March 20th, Truman concluded he could relieve MacArthur of his commands without unacceptably damaging his own ability to successfully govern.

== Nuclear Weapons ==
Is someone able to check the references on Macarthur's denial he ever advocated the us of nuclear weapons?  The reason I ask is that in &quot;The Origins of the Korean War, Volume 2&quot; (Princeton), p.750, author Bruce Cumings says the following:
&quot;According to British sources, on December 9, 1950, MacArthur requested commander's discretion to use atomic weapons. On December 24 he submitted a &quot;a list of retardation targets&quot; for which  he needed twenty six atomic bombs.  He also wanted four to drop on the &quot;invasion forces&quot; and four more for &quot;critical concentrations of enemy air power.&quot;&quot;
AND
&quot;The United States came closest to using atomic weapons in early April 1951, precisely the time that Truman removed MacArthur.  Although the documents are sketchy on this episode, it would appear that, as with the removal of rollback-advocate Louis Johnson, Truman nearly traded MacArthur for his atomic policies.  On March 10, 1951, MacArthur asked for something he called a &quot;'D'Day atomic capability&quot; to retain air superiority in the Korean theatre (meaning he would hit Manchurian airfields with atomic weapons).&quot;  
Archival references are given.   (Aside: it does seem odd the Cumings is forced to rely on British sources).
Given the JCS recommended their use perhaps the Wikipedia article is technically correct that MacArthur never advocated the use of nuclear weapons but that would only be because he didn't have to.
:A common criticism of Cumings was his heavy reliance on British sources; but the article is written from American sources, so perhaps there is a bias the other way. (Cumings' claims that the south attacked the north attracted most of the controversy about his book.) Schnabel is very highly reliable, as he was an official historian both of the Korean War and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have double-checked much of it against the primary documents. The British source of the 9 December 1950 comment probably arises from notes of the December 1950 meetings between British and US officials. This is intriguing, but I am not given a lot of confidence from what I have been able to double-check (such as the plan to seal off the peninsula, and Ridgway's consideration of tactical nuclear weapon use in June 1951). I haven't got Cumings here, so I'll have to get hold of a copy and find out what sources her was using. If need be, we can get a British Wikipedian to check with Kew. I am willing to add the above to the article, sourced to Cumings; but not to change the conclusion, which remains the consensus among historians, and is not necessary in conflict with the above. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 22:10, 29 February 2016 (UTC)
::Cumings puts in quote marks &quot;'D'Day atomic capability&quot; so presumably this is from a document MacArthur wrote or authorised.  This indicates a fact in contradictions with 'consensus among historians' you mention.
:::Not necessarily. It seems to be in relation to the possibility of a Soviet attack already mentioned, which caused Truman to release bomb assemblies from the stockpile and send them to Guam. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 20:24, 1 March 2016 (UTC)

:::The FO message is the source of the 9 December 1950 claim. Checked the second part. It is about the plan to seal off Korea with radioactive poisons, as already mentioned in the article.

::::That's definitely the pages in the reference which are repeated in the ''Bulletin of Atomic Scientists'' article mentioned above.  Oddly I can't see Poole's book listed in Cuming's bibliography.    I added the next sentence to the first quote which is &quot; ... On December 24 he submitted a &quot;a list of retardation targets&quot; for which  he needed twenty six atomic bombs.  He also wanted four to drop on the &quot;invasion forces&quot; and four more for &quot;critical concentrations of enemy air power.&quot;&quot;   On face value he seems surreal that Cumings can quote a document like this, unless this quote is just the second hand British notes, and MacArthur can confidently deny he ever advocated the use of nuclear weapons.   Given the military crisis facing the UN forces at the end of 1950 I was actually surprised to hear MacArthur's claim he hadn't advocated their use.    FYI: The Wikipedia article on MacArthur himself repeats the points of this article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur#South_to_the_Naktong.2C_North_to_the_Yalu.

== Dates &amp; Nuclear Weapons  ==

In the Nuclear weapons section in mentions  &quot;In 1985 Richard Nixon recalled discussing the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with MacArthur&quot; That got to be a typo, 1965 is more believable - briefly by months before MacArthur's death.

:The statement is saying that in 1985 Nixon recalled the discussion, not that the discussion took place in 1985. Of course if the reference mentions when the discussion with Mac ''did'' take place, it might be worth adding but I don't have access to the book.

== Does not follow ==
&quot;An apolitical military was an American tradition, but one that was difficult to uphold in an era when American forces were employed overseas in large numbers. The principle of civilian control of the military was also ingrained, but the rising complexity of military technology led to the creation of a professional military. This made civilian control increasingly problematic when coupled with the constitutional division of powers between the President as commander-in-chief, and the Congress with its power to raise armies, maintain a navy, and wage wars.&quot;

I'd like to suggest a re-write of the above paragraph. The conclusions do not at all follow from the facts given. The US armed forces have indeed been apolitical. There is nothing inherent in overseas deployment that should change that, whether in large or small numbers. Likewise, the complexity of modern technology and the rise of a professional military are not, in any way, a force that weakens civilian control. Indeed one could argue the opposite - that modern technology makes civilian control easier, not harder. Consider the obvious example of LBJ's personal involvement in selection of bombing targets in Vietnam; this is a level of tactical control that, say, Woodrow Wilson could not have had. Finally, the separation of powers is written into the Constitution and the President has been understood as commander in chief since the 1790s when George Washington personally led troops while sitting as President (the only President to do so).

MacArthur had a long history both of insubordination and of pretty openly advocating insubordination. He had allowed his name to be circulated as a Presidential candidate. MacArthur, not the system, was deeply at fault. I'd like to at least break the implied causal chains in that paragraph as a start.

:The issue is why the dismissal is so important, and that goes to the constitutional crisis. The matter is about the very meaning of the president's role as commander in chief, and of that of the Congress (not the president) to wage wars. Historians have argued the &quot;commander in chief&quot; was intended to largely symbolic, like that exercised by the British monarch. And the apolitical military was an ideal, rather than a reality throughout the history of the republic; war is inherently political in nature, and there has been a long history of military involvement in domestic matters. As the article makes clear, MacArthur did ''not'' have a long history of &quot;insubordination&quot;.  [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 22:14, 3 June 2016 (UTC)

:: Of course he did. My god. At any rate, the cited paragraph is nonsensical.  [[User:DMorpheus2|DMorpheus2]] ([[User talk:DMorpheus2|talk]]) 13:16, 6 June 2016 (UTC)</text>
