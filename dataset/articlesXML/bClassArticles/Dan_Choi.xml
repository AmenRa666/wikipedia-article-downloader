==Early life==
Choi is a native of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[California]], the son of a [[Korean American|Korean-American]] [[Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Crary | first= David | title=Gay West Point grads target ban on serving openly |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2009/04/12/national/a102259D00.DTL | date=April 12, 2009 |  work=San Francisco Chronicle| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5oM3eygbY |archivedate=2010-03-19| accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from [[Tustin High School]]  then attended the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy at West Point]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCRegister&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Gay soldier's discharge delivered to parents' Tustin home | publisher = The Orange County Register |author=James, Elysse |date=July 23, 2010 | url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/choi-259042-don-military.html | accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choi was very active with extracurriculars during his high school years. He served as student body president, was on the varsity swim team, and was the marching band drum major. During his senior year, after watching ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', he decided to attend West Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iamkoream.com/outspoken/ |title=Outspoken « KoreAm Journal – Korean America's Premier Magazine |publisher=Iamkoream.com |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military education and career==
[[File:Dan Choi West Point.jpg|thumb|left|Cadet Choi on his West Point graduation portrait, 2003]]
Choi graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 2003 with degrees in [[Arabic]] and [[environmental engineering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmyTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = West Point grads form gay support group | publisher = Army Times |author=McMichael, William |date=March 18, 2009 | url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/03/military_westpoint_knightsout_031609w/ | accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choi served as an infantry officer in [[Iraq]] with the [[10th Mountain Division]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmyTimes&quot;/&gt; in 2006 and 2007. In June 2008, he transferred from active duty Army to the [[New York Army National Guard]]. Choi served as an Army guardsman with the 1st Battalion, [[69th Infantry Regiment (United States)|69th Infantry]], based in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmyTimes&quot;/&gt;

Choi received a discharge letter following his coming out on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]''. In response, Choi penned an [[open letter]] to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] and the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7569476&amp;page=1|author=Choi, Daniel| title=Lt. Daniel Choi Begs to Keep His Job in National Guard|date=May 11, 2009|work=Open Letter to President Obama and Every Member of Congress|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, Choi challenged the morality and wisdom of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, writing that the policy is &quot;a slap in the face to me. It is a slap in the face to my soldiers, peers and leaders who have demonstrated that an infantry unit can be professional enough to accept diversity, to accept capable leaders, to accept skilled soldiers.&quot;

Despite his appeal and a [[Courage Campaign]] petition signed by almost 162,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couragecampaign.org/page/s/SupportDanSign the Statement of Support for Lt. Dan Choi]. [[Courage Campaign]].&lt;/ref&gt; on June 30, 2009, a panel of New York National Guard officers recommended that Choi be discharged from the military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/30/discharge-recommended-for-gay-army-officer-supporters-say/ Discharge recommended for gay Army officer, supporters say]. CNN. June 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2010, Choi was serving again in his Army National Guard unit, the discharge having not yet been &quot;finalized&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Montopoli, Brian (February 9, 2010).[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-6191549-503544.html Openly Gay Soldier Dan Choi Back in Uniform].

Choi is among 59 gay Arabic linguists, along with nine gay [[Persian language|Farsi]] linguists, who have faced a discharge from the U.S. military from 2004 through 2009, according to the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/29/gay-veteran-us-army-choi | title=Don't ask, don't tell: gay veteran of Iraq takes on US army |last=Nasaw | first=Daniel | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location = London | accessdate=November 6, 2009 | date=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gay rights activism==
[[File:KoreAm 2009-08 Cover.jpg|thumb|left|On the cover of ''[[KoreAm]]'', August 2009]]
Since Choi's coming out, 38 West Point alumni also came out and announced the formation of [[Knights Out]], an organization of West Point alumni who support the rights of LGBT soldiers to serve openly. Choi was one of the founding members and is the spokesperson for the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnightsOut&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Knights Out|title=West Point Alumni supporting the LGBT soldiers|work=Home page|url=http://knightsout.org/|accessdate=2009-10-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130222859/http://www.knightsout.org/|archivedate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization offers &quot;to help their alma mater educate future Army leaders on the need to accept and honor the sacrifices of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender troops.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KnightsOut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KOmission-Advocate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=West Point Grads Form Gay Support Group |last=Dizon|first=Rhiza|date=March 17, 2009|publisher=Advocate|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2009/03/17/West_Point_Grads_Come_Out,_Form_Support_Group/|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choi has also spoken at numerous gay rights events, including a march in Los Angeles following the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]]'s affirmation of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].  On May 27, 2009, he addressed a demonstration of gay activists outside the [[Beverly Hilton Hotel]], where President [[Barack Obama]] was speaking at a [[Democratic National Committee]] fund raising event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lieutenant Dan Choi Takes 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' Directly To Obama| author=Milazzo, Linda|url=http://www.laprogressive.com/2009/05/30/dan-choi-takes-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-obama/|publisher=L.A.

On July 16, 2009, Choi was in [[Culver City, California]], to introduce the premiere of Abe Forman-Greenwald's documentary called ''Silent Partners''.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Silent partner' examines what happens when people 'don't tell'|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gay-military18-2009jul18,0,848628.story|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 18, 2009|first=Alexandra|last=Zavis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary is the fourth episode in the ''[[In Their Boots]]'' series, with the episode focusing on the partners of [[LGBT]] soldiers deployed to Iraq and [[Afghanistan]]. In the episode, Choi criticizes the U.S. military's neglect of the partners of service members.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes&quot;/&gt;

In February 2010 Choi was selected to be a Grand Marshal of the 41st Annual New York [[Pride parade|LGBT Pride March]] by its producers, [[Heritage of Pride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Heritage of Pride, Inc. |work=NYC Pride |date=February 9, 2010|title=Lieutenant Dan Choi to serve as Grand Marshal |url=http://www.nycpride.org/pressrelease/DC_PressRelease.pdf| format=PDF|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lezgetReal02&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Lt.

In June 2013, Choi and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for [[Chelsea Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys |title=Celeb video: ‘I am Bradley Manning’ - Patrick Gavin |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=UFFkcCh-pCc |title=I am Bradley Manning (full HD) |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 protests and arrests===
On March 18, 2010, Choi and another ousted military officer, Capt. Jim Pietrangelo, handcuffed themselves to the fence of the [[White House]].

On April 20, 2010, Choi and Pietrangelo again participated in a self-chaining protest on the White House fence with Petty Officer Larry Whitt, Petty Officer (Rtd.) [[Autumn Sandeen]], Cadet Mara Boyd and Cpl. Evelyn Thomas. All six were removed with a master hand-cuff key and arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title='Dan Choi, Other Gay Rights Protesters Arrested After Chaining Selves to White House Fence'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20002942-503544.html|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=April 20, 2010|first=Brian|last=Montopoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newsweek]].com.&lt;/ref&gt; They ended the hunger strike seven days later, with Choi saying, &quot;The fast of the past seven days has been a success because people have been educated to the use of fasting as a tool to bring attention to a set of clear political and social demands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/06/02/Choi_Ends_DADT_Hunger_Strike/ &quot;Choi Ends DADT Hunger Strike&quot;].

In November, 2010, Choi again handcuffed himself to the White House fence with 12 other protestors. He was subsequently arrested and charged in Federal court. The case of [[United States v.
