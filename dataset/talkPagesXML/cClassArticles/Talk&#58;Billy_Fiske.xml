==Citizenship==
&quot;Although the RAF would only accept applicants of British citizenship&quot;

Well during the battle of britian canadians, austrialians and polish to name a few fought in the raf. You als contradict yourself saying he falsified saying he was canadian when only british nationals were allowed to fight.

:Thank you for your comments - in future, please could you sign them?  The RAF did only except those who were British, and you will find that the Polish, Canadians and Australians were afflilated but not part of the RAF and wore their own uniform.  This continues today when members of the RAF do 'exchange' tours with, for example, the RAAF.  --[[User:KizzyB|KizzyB]] ([[User talk:KizzyB|talk]]) 17:01, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

::Also remember that in the 1940s that Canadians, Australian etc would have been treated as British citizens. Fiske said he was a Canadian. [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] ([[User talk:MilborneOne|talk]]) 18:15, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

He would have been considered 'British by marriage' through his marriage in 1938 to Rose, Countess of Warwick. [[Special:Contributions/86.140.128.91|86.140.128.91]] ([[User talk:86.140.128.91|talk]]) 16:34, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

==Edits of 060606==
1. I deleted the sentence: &quot;Both of these planes (ME Bf 110 and Ju 88) are long range bombers&quot;. This is not accurate. The Wikipedia articles on the two aircraft describe them as a 'twin engine heavy fighter' and a 'multi-role aircraft' respectively. In 1940, the Ju 88 ''could'' be described as a bomber, but the ME 110?  No way!

2.I replaced 'launch' with 'scramble' ; 'launch' in a 1940's aviation context sounds too modern.

==The Few==
Any news of this movie? I assume the project was cancelled? [[User:Drutt|Drutt]] ([[User talk:Drutt|talk]]) 16:52, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

:According to internet sources it's been put back to release 2009... but with the nature of the reception it's receieved so far, who knows???? --[[User:KizzyB|KizzyB]] ([[User talk:KizzyB|talk]]) 17:05, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

==Allegiance==
According to the rules, it says &quot;country or power the person was fighting for&quot;. As Fiske says he was Canadian, this must be the British Commonwealth. So, if no one has any objections, I will change it to this. Thanks. [[User:Wallie|Wallie]] ([[User talk:Wallie|talk]]) 12:55, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

:Fiske, to take a direct quote from the article, &quot;'''pretended''' to be a Canadian&quot;.  He was in fact of American nationality and was married to a British citizen and lived for many years before the war in Britain, hence what is believed to be his reasoning for joining the war.  He was fighting with the RAFVR, NOT the RCAF so his allegience should be United Kingdom.  He is officially listed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission as British&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2722693&lt;/ref&gt;.  I have reverted to my last edit.  I hope that no offence is caused by this.  --[[User:KizzyB|KizzyB]] ([[User talk:KizzyB|talk]]) 12:59, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

::I didn't change any wording, just removed the flags, as I think this is overkill. [[User:Wallie|Wallie]] ([[User talk:Wallie|talk]]) 16:27, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

:::The flags keep the format of the infobox the same as all the other Battle of Britain pilots.  --[[User:KizzyB|KizzyB]] ([[User talk:KizzyB|talk]]) 20:27, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

==Rewrite==
The article is in need of some experienced editors to help its development. Any takers? FWiW, I am offering... [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 00:50, 1 April 2009 (UTC).

==Opinions as to ability==
Why is this even mentioned here? I know of no other pilot in the battle where this is even discussed. [[User:Wallie|Wallie]] ([[User talk:Wallie|talk]]) 09:11, 3 April 2009 (UTC)
:It is not so much a value judgment on the pilot as much as it was a consideration of whether his exploits were noteworthy. The original statement indicated that there is a contention that Fiske was a minor figure due to his limited action while the counter statement indicates his direct commanding officer at least held him in high regard. If anything that last statement is immaterial to his noteability. FWiw [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 11:15, 3 April 2009 (UTC).

:::The reasoning behind the comments on Fiske are mostly to do with popular reference - Fiske has been held up by some to be almost the person who saved Britain in the BoB, mostly due to the film industry's interpretations.  It's nothing personal about Fiske - he did a good job, but it is relevant to point out that he was one of many and no more special than the other pilots, and only noteable as he was American by birth.  Personally I find his bobsleighing exploits far more of note!  --[[User:KizzyB|KizzyB]] ([[User talk:KizzyB|talk]]) 15:59, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

::::He didn't die bobsledding.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/50.32.16.178|50.32.16.178]] ([[User talk:50.32.16.178|talk]]) 15:46, 25 September 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Birth place ==

The birth place of Billy Fiske as shown here: http://www.boxgrovepriory.co.uk/pilot_officer_billy_fiske_RAF.html
is listed as Chicago, not New York. Someone ought to look into this and establish which is correct.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/143.117.54.156|143.117.54.156]] ([[User talk:143.117.54.156|talk]]) 15:31, 16 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Social connections to movie stars==

Maybe somebody can research or knows any published source of Fiske's friends in Hollywood?  I collect Mary Pickford letters; In one letter that she wrote to Mildred Zukor Loew, she says that Douglas (Fairbanks) brought Billie Fiske to the house.

== Moving ==

I've moved a couple pictures (to reduce white space), but I would also like to move the medal table up and to the left, for the same reason; but I can't, as I lack the expertise. Any takers ? Thanks in advance.
