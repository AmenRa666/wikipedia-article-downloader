==Merger with [[CG-4 Haig]]==
These two articles are close to identical - merger - yes! - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 00:19, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

:Looks like a botched move attempt from CG-4 Haig to Waco CG-4. No need for to articles on the same aircraft, I have no problem with just merging them now. THe only discussion needed would probably be on the final name. My preference is for [[Waco CG-4]]. - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] ([[User talk:BillCJ|talk]]) 00:27, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

::[[Waco CG-4]] sounds good to me - it should be done soon, before they diverge too much!! Do you want to take it on, Bill? - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 00:46, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

:OK, will do now. I'm going to copy [[CG-4 Haig]] over this page, then compare the history to get the final version. You might want to double check my merge when I'm finished to see if I missed anything. Thanks! - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] ([[User talk:BillCJ|talk]]) 01:04, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

Gents, this article should be renamed &quot;WACO CG-4A&quot; with a cross-reference to the Hadrian, as this aircraft was never designated as CG-4 by the USAAF. I have this from the USAAF official history of the procurement, which I've referenced in the article notes.[[User:Maclir2001|Maclir2001]] ([[User talk:Maclir2001|talk]]) 00:54, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

==Cargo Question/Omission?==
I visited the Silent Wings Museum in Lubbock, Texas today. This glider also delivered a small, Clark-built (Cleveland, OH) crawler tractor &quot;bulldozer,&quot; weighing about 4,100 lbs.  Perhaps the staff there can get their website operational and join us here for more official details.  Later models of the glider had a &quot;Griswold nose,&quot; which was more pointed (and structurally more substantial--and protective for the pilots in the event of a crash landing--which were very common), with the pull point for the tow rope being located in the center of the nose.  The Museum might be able to provide construction details and photo, as well.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.66.94.2|67.66.94.2]] ([[User talk:67.66.94.2|talk]]) 03:49, 22 July 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Name==
Why was it called &quot;Haig&quot;? [[User:Drutt|Drutt]] ([[User talk:Drutt|talk]]) 11:07, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

:I think that is a good question and one that the article should answer. I checked though my own library of aviation books and also did a pretty extensive internet search and have not found the answer to this. A US Glider is unlikely to have been named after [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], WWI British General. There is a list of possible people at [[Haig (surname)]] but that doesn't answer the question. Perhaps another editor can add the answer and a ref to the article? - [[User:Ahunt|Ahunt]] ([[User talk:Ahunt|talk]]) 14:35, 2 November 2008 (UTC)
: I suggest that quite possibly it IS Douglas Haig that it is named after. Sez the Wiki article on the general:

After the war Haig was praised by the American [[General of the Armies|General]] [[John Pershing]], who remarked that Haig was &quot;the man who won the war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corrigan, Gordon|Gordon Corrigan]], ''Mud, Blood and Poppycock'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[User:Mark Sublette|Mark Sublette]] ([[User talk:Mark Sublette|talk]]) 01:19, 30 March 2010 (UTC)Mark Sublette[[User:Mark Sublette|Mark Sublette]] ([[User talk:Mark Sublette|talk]]) 01:19, 30 March 2010 (UTC) {{reflist}}

==Haig or Hadrian?==

I keep coming across both Haig and Hadrian in reference to British CG-4s.  Which was it?  Or both?  Can anyone come up with a reference that clears this up?

Article now makes no mention of Haig anywhere. [[User:Drutt|Drutt]] ([[User talk:Drutt|talk]]) 06:28, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

::The type ''was'' called 'Haig' for a time but whether it was an unofficial US name or whether it was the initial unofficial British name by which it was referred-to by the British officials in the US before ''Hadrian'' was decided upon, I don't know. It may have been the former rather in the same manner that the Mustang was called 'Apache' and the Lightning was called 'Atlanta', or it may just have been the initial British name that was later changed to 'Hadrian' by the [[MoS]] when the type entered service with the RAF. FWIW, I have a circa 1943 copy of ''The Aircraft and Spotters Notebook'' (an aircraft recognition book) with all the various aircraft, both Allied and Axis, and it refers to the CG-4 as, IIRC, '''Hadrian (Haig)'''  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.4.57.101|80.4.57.101]] ([[User talk:80.4.57.101|talk]]) 18:09, 18 September 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Is 'CF4-A' a variant? ==
Heinz (the food company) history page states:

http://www.heinz.com/data/pdf_files/Heinz_CSR_WEB.pdf
&quot; 1942 Heinz forms a War Production
Division and employees,
primarily women, are trained
to make wings for airplanes,
including the U.S. Army’s
top-secret CF4-A Glider.&quot;

Is this an error, or points to a different glider model, or is CF4-A a variant of CG4-A?

:Seems a typo to me, given that in the QWERTY keyboard the letters &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are contiguous. Regards, [[User:DPdH|DPdH]] ([[User talk:DPdH|talk]]) 13:29, 23 January 2014 (UTC)
