'''John Loring''' (died 9 November 1808) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]] who served during the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Loring was a descendant of a naval officer, with his first-cousin also making a successful career in the Navy. John Loring saw some service in the American War of Independence, being promoted to lieutenant during the war, but remained at this rank until shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He went out to the Mediterranean with his first command and served at the [[Siege of Toulon]] under Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]]. His ship was under repair when the city fell to French forces, and he was forced to burn her to keep her out of enemy hands. His service continued though, and he became acting-captain of the 74-gun {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} for a brief period before a new officer was appointed to replace her original captain.

Loring went on to command several ships of the line, before once again taking over HMS ''Bellerophon'', this time as a full [[post-captain]]. He served in the West Indies, and distinguished himself after the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars by superintending the [[Blockade of Saint-Domingue]], with the post of [[commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]]. During the blockade a number of French warships, merchants and [[privateer]]s were taken by his squadron, and he oversaw the surrender and evacuation of the French garrison of [[Haiti]]. He finally returned to Britain in 1805 and paid his ship off. He does not appear to have served in a seagoing command again, but commanded the Plymouth [[guardship]] for two years and took up a shore-based position as commander of a unit of the [[Sea Fencibles]]. He died in 1808, still with the rank of captain. He was succeeded by at least two sons, who followed their father into the navy.

==Family and first commands==
Loring's origins are obscure. He was the grandson of [[Joshua Loring]], a naval officer who had served in North America during the [[Seven Years' War]] and had commanded a squadron on the [[Great Lakes]] during the [[American War of Independence]]. He was also the first-cousin of [[John Wentworth Loring]], who also embarked on a naval career and rose to the rank of [[admiral (Royal Navy)|admiral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Byrne&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Byrne|title=A Naval Biographical Dictionary|page=672}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Loring was commissioned as a lieutenant on 3 December 1779.  He still held this rank by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and in January 1793 was appointed to command the [[fireship]] {{HMS|Conflagration|1783|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield369&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to commander on 16 May 1793, he sailed ''Conflagration'' to the Mediterranean on 22 May and was part of [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood's]] fleet at the [[Siege of Toulon|occupation and siege of Toulon]]. She was under repair there when the city was evacuated, and was burnt on Hood's orders to avoid falling into French hands on 18 December 1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield369&quot;/&gt; He returned to England and was given command of the 16-gun sloop {{HMS|Hazard|1794|6}}, which he served in from April 1794 until 1795.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield235&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loring was made acting-captain of the 74-gun {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 12 April 1796 while ''Bellerophon'' was serving off [[Ushant]] on the [[Brest, France|Brest]] blockade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin67&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bellerophon''{{'}}s nominal commander, Captain [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun]], had been appointed [[Governor of Grenada]] and left the ship to prepare to take up his post.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} Loring was in command until being superseded by Cranstoun's replacement, Captain [[Henry D'Esterre Darby]], on 11 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin67&quot;/&gt;  He seems to have left the ship shortly after this and by October 1796 had presumably been promoted to captain as he commissioned the 32-gun {{HMS|Proselyte|1796|6}} and prepared her for service. He took her out to Jamaica in February 1797 and there had some success against [[privateer]]s, capturing the French 6-gun privateer [[schooner]] ''Liberté'' later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield197&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799 he is recorded as taking command of the 74-gun {{HMS|Carnatic|1783|6}} at [[Jamaica]], holding the post until 1800.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield53&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took over the 74-gun {{HMS|Hannibal|1786|6}} that year, but paid her off later in 1800.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield57&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have briefly commissioned the 98-gun {{HMS|Prince|1788|6}} in early November 1801, but had received a new appointment before the end of the month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield24&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HMS ''Bellerophon''==
[[File:HMS Bellerophon and Napoleon-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Oil painting of a three-masted sailing ship seen from side against a background of cliffs, with many small boats filled with people in the foreground|HMS ''Bellerophon'', detail from ''Scene in Plymouth Sound in August 1815'', an 1816 painting by [[John James Chalon]]. Loring commanded her both as an acting-captain for a few months in 1796, and as a full post-captain between 1801 and 1805.]]
Loring was appointed to take over his former command, HMS ''Bellerophon'', on 25 November 1801, superseding Captain [[George Stewart, 8th Earl of Galloway|Lord Garlies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin68&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=The Ships of Trafalgar|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bellerophon'' was serving at this time with the [[Channel Fleet]], but in early 1802 Loring received new orders. ''Bellerophon'' was among five ships ordered to join Admiral [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Duckworth's]] squadron in the West Indies, and having stored, she sailed from [[Torbay]] on 2 March 1802.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly159&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Billy Ruffian|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of her arrival on 27 March, the [[Treaty of Amiens]] had been signed, and Britain and France were at peace. For the next eighteen months ''Bellerophon'' took part in cruises in the [[Jamaica Channel|Jamaica Passage]] and escorted merchant convoys between Jamaica and [[City of Halifax|Halifax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly163&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Billy Ruffian|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bellerophon'' was in the West Indies when the [[Napoleonic Wars]] broke out in May 1803. Loring was appointed [[commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]] of the British squadron, which quickly went on the offensive against French shipping in the [[Blockade of Saint-Domingue]]. The [[corvette]] [[French corvette Mignonne (1797)|''Mignonne'']] and a brig were captured in late June, after which the British patrolled off [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-François]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin68&quot;/&gt; On 24 July the squadron, made up of ''Bellerophon'' and the 74-gun ships {{HMS|Elephant|1786|6}}, {{HMS|Theseus|1786|6}} and {{HMS|Vanguard|1787|6}}, came across two French 74-gun ships, [[French ship Duquesne (1787)|''Duquesne'']] and [[HMS Implacable (1805)|''Duguay-Trouin'']], and the frigate [[HMS Guerriere (1806)|''Guerrière'']], attempting to escape from Cap-François.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly165&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Billy Ruffian|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron gave chase, and on 25 July overhauled and captured ''Duquesne'' after a few shots were fired, while ''Duguay-Trouin'' and ''Guerrière'' managed to evade their pursuers and escape to France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin68&quot;/&gt; One man was killed aboard ''Bellerophon'' during the pursuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly165&quot;/&gt;  Loring remained blockading Cap-François until November, when the French commander of the garrison there, General [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]], approached him and requested to be allowed to evacuate his men, which were being besieged by a native Haitian force led by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]]. The French were allowed to evacuate on three frigates, [[French frigate Surveillante (1802)|''Surveillante'']], [[French frigate Clorinde (1801)|''Clorinde'']] and [[French frigate Vertu (1794)|''Vertu'']], and a number of smaller ships, and were escorted to Jamaica by the squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield51&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly severe outbreak of [[malaria]] struck the ship in early February 1804, with 212 members of ''Bellerophon''{{'}}s crew falling ill. 17 died aboard the ship, while 100 had to be transferred to a shore-based hospital, where a further 40 died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly166&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Billy Ruffian|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loring was ordered to sail her back to Britain in June, escorting a large convoy, and arrived in the Downs on 11 August. He briefly paid her off and she was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit, before rejoining the Channel Fleet, still off Brest, and under the command of Admiral [[William Cornwallis|Sir William Cornwallis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Billy Ruffian|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; These duties lasted until early 1805, with Loring being superseded by Captain [[John Cooke (Royal Navy officer)|John Cooke]] on 24 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodwin68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cordingly178&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |title=Billy Ruffian|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Loring was then appointed to command the 112-gun {{HMS|Salvador del Mundo}}, the Plymouth [[guardship]], later that month, holding the post until being superseded in June 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winfield16&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793–1814|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then in command of the [[Sea Fencibles]] covering the district between [[Emsworth]] and [[Calshot]], and died in this post on 9 November 1808, still a captain, at [[Fareham]], [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Byrne&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall|title=Royal Naval Biography|page=815}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described as &quot;a most zealous, brave, and humane officer&quot; in John Marshall's ''Royal Naval Biography''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNB&quot;/&gt; He had at least two sons, who followed him into the Navy. Both survived him, with the eldest, John, dying of [[yellow fever]] while a [[midshipman]] aboard {{HMS|Euryalus|1803|6}} in 1820. His second son, Hector, became a commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Byrne&quot;/&gt;

==Notes==
