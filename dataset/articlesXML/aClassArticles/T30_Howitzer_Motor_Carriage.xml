The '''T30 Howitzer Motor Carriage''' (HMC) was a [[United States Army]] [[Self-propelled artillery|self-propelled gun]] used in [[World War II]]. Its design was based on requirements for an assault gun issued by the [[Armor Branch (United States)|Armored Force]] in 1941 and it was built as an interim solution until a fully tracked design was complete.

Produced by the [[White Motor Company]], the vehicle was simply a [[M116 howitzer|75&amp;nbsp;mm Pack Howitzer M1]] mounted on a modified [[M3 Half-track]]. It was first used in combat in the [[North African Campaign]] in November 1942. It later served in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]] and [[Operation Overlord|France]], and possibly in the Pacific. Some were later leased to [[French Fourth Republic|French]] forces and the type was used as late as the [[First Indochina War]] in the 1950s.

== Specifications ==
Based on the [[M3 Half-track]], the T30's specifications were similar to its parent vehicle. It was 20&amp;nbsp;ft 7&amp;nbsp;in (6.28&amp;nbsp;m) long, 6&amp;nbsp;ft 5&amp;nbsp;in (1.96&amp;nbsp;m) wide,&lt;ref name=Ness207&gt;Ness (2002), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; 8&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in (2.51&amp;nbsp;m) and high, and weighed 10.3&amp;nbsp;short tons (9.3&amp;nbsp;t).&lt;ref name=Bishop81&gt;Bishop (1998), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension consisted of [[Vertical volute spring suspension|vertical volute springs]] for the tracks and [[leaf spring]]s for the wheels, while the vehicle had a fuel capacity of 60&amp;nbsp;US gallons (230&amp;nbsp;l). It had a range of {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} and had a speed of 40&amp;nbsp;mph (64&amp;nbsp;km/h),&lt;ref name=Berndt152&gt;Berndt (1993), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and was powered by a White 160AX, 147&amp;nbsp;hp (110&amp;nbsp;kW),&lt;ref name=Bishop81 /&gt; 386&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (6,330&amp;nbsp;cc), six-cylinder, [[petrol engine|gasoline engine]], with a [[compression ratio]] of 6.3:1. It had a [[power-to-weight ratio]] of 15.8&amp;nbsp;hp/ton.&lt;ref name=Berndt152 /&gt;

=== Gun specifications ===
{{Main|M116 howitzer}}
The T30's main armament was a short barreled {{convert|75|mm|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[mountain gun|pack howitzer]]. The 75&amp;nbsp;mm Pack Howitzer M1 as mounted could depress nine degrees, elevate 50 degrees, and traverse 22.5 degrees to each side. The vehicle had stowage for sixty rounds of 75&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition and, although it was not designed for anti-tank use, it had a [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) shell that could penetrate {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} of armor. The gun shield had 0.375&amp;nbsp;in (9.5&amp;nbsp;mm) thick armor, designed to stop a .30 cal (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm) bullet from {{convert|250|yd|m}} away.&lt;ref name=Yeide40&gt;Yeide (2008), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The T30 HMC was originally conceived in 1941 as an interim design to fulfil the [[Armor Branch (United States)|Armored Force]]'s requirement for an [[assault gun]] to equip tank and armored reconnaissance units.&lt;ref name=Hoffman149&gt;Hoffman &amp; Staary (2013), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torriami &amp; Dennis (2014), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordnance Department design was based on the M3 Half-track in order that it could be brought into service quickly. A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75&amp;nbsp;mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was designed to fit on a simple box structure in the back of an M3 Half-track.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt118 /&gt;

Authorization for the production of two prototypes was given in January 1942;&lt;ref name=Chamberlain189&gt;Chamberlain &amp; Ellis (1969), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Initially, the prototype vehicles lacked a [[gun shield]]. The Ordnance Department added them after its authorization.&lt;ref&gt;Mesko (1996), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}} first deliveries of the vehicle were made the following month from the [[White Motor Company]].&lt;ref name=Doyle393&gt;Doyle (2011), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was seen as a temporary solution it was never given type classification.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36&gt;Zaloga (1994), pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1942, the T30 was partially replaced by the [[M8 Scott|Howitzer Motor Carriage M8]] (the same gun on an [[M3 Stuart]]). After that, it was declared as &quot;[[limited standard]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Green45&gt;Green &amp; Green (2000), pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 500 were produced,&lt;ref name=Ness193&gt;Ness (2002), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; all by the White Motor Company.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt118&gt;Hunnicutt (2001), pp. 118–121&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service history ==
The T30 HMC entered service in November 1942, seeing action for the first time in the [[North African Campaign]]. In the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], each armored regiment was issued twelve T30s. Of these, three were used in each battalion headquarters platoon and three were used in each regimental reconnaissance platoon. In addition, the 6th and 41st Armored Infantry Regiments were each issued with nine T30 HMCs, with three of them being allocated to the headquarters platoon in each armored infantry battalion.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36 /&gt;

Most infantry divisions in the North African Campaign deployed a &quot;cannon company&quot;&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;Zaloga (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; equipped with six T30s and two [[T19 Howitzer Motor Carriage|105&amp;nbsp;mm T19 HMCs]]. In one encounter in North Africa, the T30 was used in an attempt to destroy German tanks. Although the T30s fired several volleys, the German tanks were barely damaged and the T30s were ordered to retreat under the cover of smoke to prevent losses. After several similar experiences, U.S. forces ceased the practice of employing [[self-propelled artillery|self-propelled howitzers or mortars]] in direct combat with tanks.&lt;ref name=Zaloga21&gt;Zaloga (1999), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The T30 also served during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in 1943, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|war in Italy in 1944]],&lt;ref name=Zaloga_21&gt;Zaloga (2013), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Hunnicutt (1992), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; It was removed from infantry division use in March 1943, following changes in the organization of US infantry battalions, and was replaced by towed howitzers. The T30 was eventually replaced by the M8 HMC, which was based on the [[M3 Stuart|M5 Stuart]] light tank, and which began entering service around the same time as the T30. Only 312 T30 HMCs were delivered in their original configuration, as the last 188 were converted back into M3 Half-tracks before they were delivered. Later on, the U.S. leased several to [[French Fourth Republic|French forces]] and some were used as late as the [[First Indochina War]] before the vehicle was retired from service in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Zaloga36 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green (2014), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;
