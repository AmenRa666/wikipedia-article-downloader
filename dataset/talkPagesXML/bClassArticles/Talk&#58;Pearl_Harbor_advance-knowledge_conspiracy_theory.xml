== Title ==

Shouldn't it be shortened to simply &quot;Pearl Harbor conspiracy theory&quot;? That seems to be normal for these topics. [[User:Green547|Green547]] ([[User talk:Green547|talk]]) 00:53, 17 October 2015 (UTC)

: Since the conspiracy revolves around the notional advance-knowledge, no.

What specific advanced knowledge.   We know factually from the McCollum memo that Naval Intelligence belived that a Japanese attack was possible, and that the US Government was engaged in acts that made such an attack more likely.  Including &quot;advanced knowledge&quot; is ambigious.  What specific &quot;advanced knowledge&quot;.   Detailed knowlege of the exact date and time and composition of attacking forces is one thing.  Having knowlege that a Japanese suprise attack to US forces somewhere in the pacific was likely, is another.  I think you should clarify, or remove it.

This article appears to be very biased and innaccurate.  As one example, the article claims that MacArthur had acess to all Purple decrypts. Clausen and Lee, in their book PEARL HARBOR: FINAL JUDGMENT claim that MacArthur and his intelligence chief swore exactly the opposite: they did NOT have access to all material. Further, MacArthur testified that the information provided him was sufficient to alert him that war was imminent.

This article appears to need extensive revision by someone who isn't trying to push an agenda.[[User:Saintonge235|Saintonge235]] ([[User talk:Saintonge235|talk]]) 13:49, 11 January 2016 (UTC)

: ♠Clausen &amp; Lee have been superseded, I'd say. (It's been too long since I read it to recall what they actually said on it.) I'd also wonder if Fabian &amp; others weren't inclined to lie to Clausen, based on his lack of clearance for Ultra. Every source I've seen says Cast had the Purple &amp; JN-25 books, &amp; Hypo didn't; I'll believe Blair &amp; Prange before Clausen.
: ♠If MacArthur was truthful, why wasn't he ready when Japan attacked the P.I., over eight hours after he got word of the attack on Pearl Harbor, &amp; about as long after he was ''expressly ordered'' to execute the standing war plan?

History is full of official mythologies with differing perspectives that may all have elements of truth and/or lies even if contradictory.  This article is biased contradicting the official story because many people don't believe government propaganda and corporate media, rightly or wrongly or for whatever reasons they feel distrustful and oppressed.  But articles can always be improved.  [[User:JasonCarswell|JasonCarswell]] ([[User talk:JasonCarswell|talk]]) 10:47, 13 July 2016 (UTC)


== Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge in popular culture ==

Not for or against conspiracy but to document popular awareness, starting this talk page list may grow into something, though doubtfully as large as [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy in popular culture]].  Perhaps it belongs on another article I'm not aware of.  [[User:JasonCarswell|JasonCarswell]] ([[User talk:JasonCarswell|talk]]) 10:47, 13 July 2016 (UTC)

In a June 21, 2016 video [[Stephen Colbert]] mocks [[Scott Baio]]'s June 15, 2016 appearance on [[Fox News]] to discuss his opinion, saying that &quot;he's been doing this his entire career&quot; and plays a vintage [[sitcom]] clip from [[Charles In Charge]] with Scott Baio's voice overdubbed with &quot;Well FDR knew Pearl Harbor was coming and did nothing to stop it!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's Happening Inside The Trump Campaign|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWU8FMT5f4Y|website=YouTube|publisher=The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[User:JasonCarswell|JasonCarswell]] ([[User talk:JasonCarswell|talk]]) 10:47, 13 July 2016 (UTC)

== McCollum memo ==

The memo was written and is established as a bonefied US Government document. Circumstantial evidence exists that the president saw it and implimented it.  That circumstantial evidences consists of several facts.

1-  all eight of the advised policies were followed by the Roosevelt administration over the 14 months between the circulation of the memo, and the Pearl Harbor attack.

2- the memo remained classified for over 50 years after it was written, one does not classify trivia.

No this is not smoking gun proof that FDR read and was influenced by it, but the fact that all 8 of the proposals were followed is circumstantial evidence he did.  Thus the burdon of proof should be on establishing some evidence that all of those policies would have been followed anyway.

Additional information.  In looking at some of thedocuments proportingto &quot;refute&quot; the McCollum memo I note that the memo was not declassified till1994, while McCollum dies in the 1970s.  At no could McCollum have legally discussed his memo in piblic. Thus &quot;the assertion of other statements by McCollum as bein refutation of his memo are suspect   -[[User:Montestruc|Montestruc]] ([[User talk:Montestruc|talk]]) 03:32, 28 September 2016 (UTC) [[User:Montestruc|Montestruc]] ([[User talk:Montestruc|talk]]) 03:32, 28 September 2016 (UTC)

== The art &amp; science of document classification. ==

As someone who handled classified material in the military for a number of years I can tell you that, within a classified area, section or department, the urge to classify *everything* is almost irresistible. In addition, it is assumed that when a document is classified, 1. it is often over-classified, and, 2. it will remain classified, ideally forever. Added to this is inter-service rivalry and bureaucracy. The general thinking is, This is our document; let others prove they have the 'need to know' - the holiest of mantras in the intelligence community. (This childish attitude continues to the present, unfortunately.) This is why one will note that documents from World War II and after being declassified in 2008, 2012, etc. The thinking is often the same as a pack rat - we used to call it 'classified clutter'. There is extreme reluctance to declassify anything for fear that 'we may need to keep this a secret a little bit longer'. The moral here is that much information needs some level of classification, absolutely. The problem occurs when the over-classification bug rears its ugly head. This behavior degrades and trivializes the entire concept of document secrecy. And that is never good.
