==Untitled==
This is a very one-sided biased article making little or no effort to look at the Ottoman Turkish references. It has no reference of Turkish origin, even though one side in this battle is Ottoman Turks. If the Turkish references were used, the bias of this article will be self-evident. The reason is that Turkish historians do not  include a battle that is given the name of ''Maritsa Battle'' or ''Chernomen Battle'' that has taken place on 26 September 1371. In Ottoman-Turkish history books there is a battle called ''Sirp Sindigi (Rout of the Serbs)'' which has taken place on 26 September 1364. References in English are found in S.J.Shaw (1976) ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey Vol.1 Empire of Gazis'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p.18 and  D.Nicolle, (1983), ''Armies of the Ottoman Turks 1300-1774'', Osprey Pub. London, p.28. [[User:Noyder|Noyder]] ([[User talk:Noyder|talk]]) 02:04, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
::Please improve the article if you can. The lack of Turkish sources is motivated by the inaccesibility of such sources to the editors who have worked on this article (either because of the language barrier, or their unavailability in local libraries). A referenced Turkish perspective is more than welcome (this doesn't mean such perspective should remove the Bulgarian perspective from the article, both POVs should be presented).[[User:Baltaci|Baltaci]] ([[User talk:Baltaci|talk]]) 20:45, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

'''Battle of Chernomen has nothing to do with Bulgarians because it's part of Serbian/Turkish history.'''--[[Special:Contributions/79.175.118.32|79.175.118.32]] ([[User talk:79.175.118.32|talk]]) 01:24, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

True, the Christian armies were led by princes of Serbian origin, but they ruled principalities populated mostly by Bulgarian population, and definitely not Serbia proper. The aftermath of the battles is that territories populated by Bulgarians came under the Ottoman realm. Also, as the article states, parts of the armies consisted of Bulgarian soldiers, so to state that the battles have nothing to do with Bulgarians is incorrect. But feel free to add the above to the article as it most certainly helps clarify the picture. If you look at Битката при Марица &lt;ref&gt;http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt; in Bulgarian, this is pretty well explained.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.77.255.63|184.77.255.63]] ([[User talk:184.77.255.63|talk]]) 18:43, 29 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Balkan wars==
Please, do not re-insert biased off-topic info about the Balkan wars. If you want, just add this article in See also section. Thank you. [[User:Jingiby|Jingiby]] ([[User talk:Jingiby|talk]])

:You are not explaining why are you deleting the Balkan Wars. They were Ottoman-Bulgarian.--[[User:Ceco31|Ceco31]] ([[User talk:Ceco31|talk]]) 10:17, 1 February 2013 (UTC)

::I have deleted them because they were not Bulgarian-Ottoman, but Balkan Wars, i.e. their historicll background is unrelated to the Medieval Bulgarian-Ottoman wars. [[User:Jingiby|Jingiby]] ([[User talk:Jingiby|talk]])

:::Thank you, for the  hat-note, Future. [[User:Jingiby|Jingiby]] ([[User talk:Jingiby|talk]])

They were not Bulgarian Ottoman is a nonsense. If they were not such what were the Balkan Wars then? Because they were between the states with the name Bulgaria and Ottoman Empire they were '''Bulgarian-Ottoman''', so I do not understand what do you mean and what is your point is, so, explain, thanks.--[[User:Ceco31|Ceco31]] ([[User talk:Ceco31|talk]]) 10:51, 1 February 2013 (UTC)

: While the Balkan wars also involved Bulgarians and Ottomans, they are not conventionally called &quot;Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars&quot; (partly because, obviously, there were other parties involved too); their universal name is &quot;Balkan Wars&quot;. In any case, even if the term &quot;Bulgarian-Ottoman wars&quot; were commonly applied to them – which I don't see as being the case –, this article is still not about them. Encyclopedia articles are structured by factual topics, not by names, so even if two wars in two different periods shared the same name, we would still not have a common article about them; at most, we would introduce some means of disambiguation. I've inserted the dab hatnote for that purpose now. [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 10:57, 1 February 2013 (UTC)

::This is clear that the Balkan Wars involved Ottomans Bulgarians and other Balkan nations. The name Second Bulgarian empire should be corrected to Bulgarian city states because several independent city states each with its own army, which is not an empire at all, were those that were warring with the Ottoman empire, this was not an Bulgarian empire at all.--[[User:Ceco31|Ceco31]] ([[User talk:Ceco31|talk]]) 11:55, 1 February 2013 (UTC)
