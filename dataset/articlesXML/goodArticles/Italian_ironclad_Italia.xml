'''''Italia''''' was an Italian [[ironclad warship|ironclad battleship]] build for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy), the lead ship of the {{sclass-|Italia|ironclad|4}}. She and her single [[sister ship]], {{ship|Italian battleship|Lepanto||2}}, had lengthy construction times. ''Italia'' was laid down in January 1876, launched in September 1880, and completed in October 1885. She was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|17|in|abbr=on|0}} guns mounted in a central [[barbette]] and was capable of a top speed of {{convert|17.8|kn|lk=in}}. Unusually, for ships of that era, ''Italia'' had an armored deck rather than the typical [[belt armor]].

''Italia'' spent the first two decades of her career in the Active and Reserve Squadrons, where she took part in annual training maneuvers with the rest of the fleet. She was withdrawn from service in 1905 for a significant modernization. Upon returning to service in 1909, ''Italia'' was employed as a [[training ship]]. During the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911&amp;ndash;12, the ship provided [[naval gunfire support|fire support]] to Italian troops defending [[Tripoli]] in Libya. She was used as a [[floating battery]] at [[Brindisi]] after Italy entered [[World War I]] in 1915. The ship was rebuilt as a grain carrier in December 1917 &amp;ndash; June 1918. ''Italia'' served in this capacity for only a short time, being stricken in November 1921 and then [[ship breaking|scrapped]].

==Design==
[[File:Lepanto Brassey's.png|left|thumb|Line drawing of the ''Italia'' class]]
{{main|Italia-class ironclad}}

''Italia'' was {{convert|124.7|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22.54|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.75|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|13678|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|15407|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of four [[compound engine|compound]] [[steam engine]]s each driving a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by eight coal-fired, oval [[boiler]]s and sixteen [[fire-tube boiler]]s. Her engines produced a top speed of {{convert|17.8|kn|lk=in}} at {{convert|11986|ihp|lk=in}}. She could steam for {{convert|5000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She had a crew of 669&amp;ndash;701&amp;nbsp;officers and men.&lt;ref name=G341&gt;Gardiner, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

''Italia'' was armed with a [[main battery]] of four {{convert|17|in|abbr=on|0}} guns, mounted in two pairs ''en echelon'' in a central [[barbette]]. Three guns were 26-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns, while the fourth was a slightly longer 27-caliber version. She carried a secondary battery of seven {{convert|5.9|in|abbr=on|0}} 26-caliber guns and four {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on|0}} 23-caliber guns. As was customary for [[capital ship]]s of the period, she carried four {{convert|14|in|abbr=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s. Unlike other ships built at the time, ''Italia'' dispensed with vertical [[belt armor]]. Her designer, [[Benedetto Brin]], believed that contemporary steel alloys could not effectively defeat [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] shells of the day, and so he discarded it completely. ''Italia'' was instead protected by an armored deck that was {{convert|4|in|abbr=on|0}} thick. Her [[conning tower]] was armored with 4&amp;nbsp;in of steel plate. The barbette had {{convert|19|in|abbr=on|0}} of steel armor.&lt;ref name=G341/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Italia battleship 1880 01.jpg|thumb|left|''Italia'' at her launching]]

''Italia'' was under construction for nearly 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;In comparison, the preceding ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}} took only seven years to build, and the subsequent ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ruggiero di Lauria||2}} took less than six and a half years. See Gardiner, pp. 340&amp;ndash;342&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Keel laying|laid down]] at [[Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia]] shipyard on 3 January 1876, originally under the name ''Stella D'Italia''. She then spent over four-and-a-half years on the [[Slipway#Ship_construction|building ways]] and was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 September 1880. She was not completed for another five years, her construction finally being finished on 16 October 1885. She nonetheless was completed 22 months before her sister ''Lepanto'', which took almost 11 years to build. After ''Italia'' was completed, several smaller caliber guns were added, including two {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} guns, twelve {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} 40-caliber guns, twelve {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} [[revolver cannon]], and two [[machine gun]]s.&lt;ref name=G341/&gt;

''Italia'' took part in the annual 1888 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Lepanto||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|San Martino||2}}, a [[protected cruiser]], four [[torpedo cruiser]]s, and numerous smaller vessels. The maneuvers consisted of close-order drills and a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia. Later that year, the ship was present during a naval review held for the German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] during a visit to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey 1889, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; ''Italia'' served as the [[flagship]] of the 2nd Division of the Active Squadron during the 1893 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Andrea Doria||2}}, the [[torpedo cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Iride||2}}, and four [[torpedo boat]]s. During the maneuvers, which lasted from 6 August to 5 September, the ships of the Active Squadron simulated a French attack on the Italian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Thursfield, pp. 202&amp;ndash;203&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Italian battleship Italia (1880) after refit.jpg|thumb|''Italia'' as she appeared after her 1905–1908 refit]]

In 1895, ''Italia'' and ''Lepanto'' were assigned to the Reserve Squadron, along with the ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ruggiero di Lauria||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re Umberto||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey 1896, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; ''Italia'' was not assigned to either the Active or Reserve Squadrons in 1898, though she took part in the annual fleet maneuvers that year.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett 1898, pp. 200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1890s, the Italian Navy considered rebuilding ''Italia'' along the same lines as {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}},&lt;ref name=I46/&gt; which had received new, quick-firing {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} guns in place of her slow 17-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 340&amp;ndash;341&lt;/ref&gt; ''Italia'' and her sister were to have their guns replaced with new {{convert|13.4|in|adj=on}} guns,&lt;ref name=I46&gt;&quot;Italy&quot;, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1902 this plan had been abandoned as too costly.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett 1902, p. 1076&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, ''Italia'' went into drydock for a major reconstruction that lasted into 1908. Her six funnels were reduced to four, and a second mast was erected. One of her 5.9&amp;nbsp;in guns, six of the 57&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and eight of the 37&amp;nbsp;mm revolver cannon were removed. After returning to service in 1909, she served as a torpedo [[training ship]]; she served in this capacity through 1910.&lt;ref name=G341/&gt; At the start of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911&amp;ndash;12, ''Italia'' was assigned to the 5th Division of the Italian fleet, along with her sister ''Lepanto'' and ''Enrico Dandolo''.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1911, ''Italia'' and ''Lepanto'' were sent to [[Tripoli]], replacing the three {{sclass-|Re Umberto|ironclad|1}}s, to support the Italian garrison that had captured the city. The two ships were sent in large part because the Italian Navy had a large stockpile of 17&amp;nbsp;in shells.&lt;ref&gt;Beehler, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

She was employed as a training ship for [[petty officer]]s in 1912, and by 1914 she was stationed in [[Taranto]] as a [[guard ship]]. ''Italia'' was [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] on 1 June 1914 and stricken from the [[naval register]] three days later. Despite having all of her secondary guns removed, the ship was towed to [[Brindisi]] on 20 April 1915, shortly before Italy entered [[World War I]], to defend the harbor. She was formally returned to the naval register on 23 May, the day Italy declared war on [[Austria Hungary]], and was recommissioned on 1 June as a &quot;first class auxiliary&quot;. She remained at Brindisi until 16 December 1917, when she was taken to [[La Spezia]] for conversion into a grain carrier, retaining only two of her 4.7&amp;nbsp;in guns. She was transferred initially to the Ministry of Transport on 1 June but was quickly reassigned to the State Railways on 27 July 1919. She remained there briefly, returning to the Navy on 13 January 1921. ''Italia'' was finally stricken on 16 November 1921 and subsequently [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.&lt;ref name=G341/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;
