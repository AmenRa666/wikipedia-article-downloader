The '''North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest''' ([[Site of Special Scientific Interest|SSSI]]) is an area of European importance for wildlife in [[Norfolk]], England. It comprises 7,700&amp;nbsp;ha (19,027&amp;nbsp;acres) of the county's north coast from just west of [[Holme-next-the-Sea]] to [[Kelling]], and is additionally protected through [[Natura 2000]], [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA) listings; it is also part of the [[Norfolk Coast AONB|Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB).  The North Norfolk Coast is also designated as a wetland of international importance on the [[Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance|Ramsar list]] and most of it is a [[Biosphere Reserve]].

Habitats within the SSSI include [[reed bed]]s, [[salt marsh]]es, freshwater [[lagoon]]s and sand or [[shingle beach]]es. The wetlands are important for wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as [[pied avocet]]s, [[western marsh harrier]]s, [[Eurasian bittern]]s and [[bearded reedling]]s. The location also attracts [[bird migration|migrating birds]] including [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] rarities. Ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several [[nature reserve]]s provide suitable conditions for [[European water vole|water vole]]s, [[natterjack toad]]s and several scarce plants and [[invertebrate]]s.

The area is [[archaeology|archaeologically]] significant, with [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] dating back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. The mound of an [[Iron Age]] fort is visible at [[Holkham]], and the site of a 23 ha (57 acres) [[Roman Britain|Roman]] naval port with a fort built on the [[castrum]] pattern is just outside [[Brancaster]]. The site of the medieval &quot;[[Blakeney Chapel|chapel]]&quot; (probably a domestic dwelling) at [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]] is no longer accessible. Remains of military use from both [[world war]]s include an [[armoured fighting vehicle]] gunnery range, a hospital and bombing ranges, as well as passive defences such as [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes]], barbed wire and [[Dragon's teeth (fortification)|tank traps]].

The SSSI is economically important to the area because of the tourists it attracts for [[birdwatching]] and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from the large numbers of visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The [[Environment Agency]] considers that [[managed retreat]] is likely to be the long-term solution, and is working with the [[Norfolk Wildlife Trust]] to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.

== Description ==

The SSSI is a long, narrow strip of coast that starts at the eastern boundary of [[The Wash]] between [[Old Hunstanton]] and [[Holme-next-the-Sea]], and runs east for about 43&amp;nbsp;km (27&amp;nbsp;mi) to [[Kelling]]. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the [[A149 road|A149 coast road]].&lt;ref name = sssimap&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= North Norfolk Coast SSSI| work= Nature on the map| url=http://archive.is/Djk1| publisher = Natural England}} Retrieved 23 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSSI has a wide variety of habitats, with bare mud, sand and shingle characterising the [[intertidal zone]] along the whole of the coast, although higher areas may have [[algae]] or [[Zostera marina|eelgrass]] that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter. The [[salt marsh]]es which form on sheltered coasts, in the lee of islands, or behind spits are described in the SSSI notification document as &quot;among the best in Europe&quot; due to their exceptionally diverse flora. Sand dunes occur at several places along the coast, but the best examples are at [[Holme Dunes]], [[Holkham]], [[Blakeney Point]], and [[Scolt Head Island]]. The latter two sites are also important for [[geomorphology]] research purposes as structures consisting mainly of shingle ridges. [[Reed bed]]s are fairly localised, but substantial areas occur at [[Titchwell Marsh]], Brancaster and [[Cley Marshes]]. Grassland is represented by grazing pasture reclaimed from former salt marsh, with wetter areas at Cley and [[Salthouse]] marshes. Woodland is limited in the SSSI, although a belt of [[Pinus nigra|Corsican pine]] planted at Holkham has provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established.&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt;

== History ==

=== To 1000 AD ===

[[File:Holkham iron age fort.jpg|The mound of Holkham fort is visible at the end of the raised track, formerly its only access.|thumb]]
Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]], and including significant [[archaeology]]. Both [[anatomically modern humans|modern]] and [[Neanderthal]] people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, before the last [[glacial period|glaciation]], and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The [[Archaeology|archaeological]] record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the [[Mesolithic]] (10,000â€“5,000&amp;nbsp;BCE), the [[sea level]] rose, filling what is now the [[North Sea]]. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are under the sea.&lt;ref name= NAE9&gt;Robertson ''et al.'' (2005) pp. 9â€“22.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Mesolithic [[flint]] tools with characteristic [[Blade (archaeology)|long blades]] up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name= murphy14&gt;Murphy (2009) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was {{convert|60|â€“|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (50,000â€“10,000&amp;nbsp;BCE) to the [[Neolithic]] (5,000â€“2,500&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt;

By 11,000 BC, the makers of the long blades had gone.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; Two timber platforms have been identified within the [[peat]] at Titchwell, and may possibly be rare [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] (2,500â€“800&amp;nbsp;BCE) survivals.&lt;ref name= NAE149&gt;Robertson (2005) p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seahenge]] is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998. It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049&amp;nbsp;BC;&lt;ref name= seahenge&gt;{{cite journal | last= Brennand | first= Mark |author2=Taylor, Maisie  | year=2000 | title=  Seahenge | journal= Current Archaeology | volume= 14 |language = | issue =11 | pages= 417â€“424 | url = | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar nearby structure, Holme II, may be almost two centuries older.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; A large [[Iron Age]] fort at Holkham enclosed 2.5&amp;nbsp;ha (6.1&amp;nbsp;acres) at the end of a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh, and remained in use until the defeat of the [[Iceni]] in 47&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name = ironagefort&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Iron Age fort 900m north east of Dale Hole Cottage | work= List entry summary | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1018014 | publisher= English Heritage}} Retrieved 20 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman period settlements have been discovered all along the Norfolk Coast,&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; notably the complex at [[Branodunum]], which covered at least 23&amp;nbsp;ha (57&amp;nbsp;acres) near Brancaster. This site included a fort built on the [[castrum]] pattern enclosing 2.6&amp;nbsp;ha (6.3&amp;nbsp;acres) within its walls, 2.9&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) wide. The fort had internal turrets at the corners and was backed by an earth rampart.&lt;ref&gt;Fields (2006) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= brano&gt;Edward, Derek A; Green, Christopher J S &quot;The Saxon Shore fort and settlement at Brancaster&quot; pp. 21â€“28 in Johnson (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[Saxon]] sites are scarce close to the Norfolk coast,&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; but a gold [[bracteate]] found near [[Blakeney Chapel]] was a rare and significant 6th-century find,&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; and there is a somewhat later Saxon cemetery at Thornham.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; The [[Danelaw]] left few tangible traces within the SSSI, but place names such as Holkham (&quot;ship town&quot;) reflect the Viking influence.&lt;ref name = holkfront&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Welcome to Holkham | work= Holkham National Nature Reserve| url=http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve| archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130131061849/http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve| archivedate=2013-01-31 | publisher= Holkham Estate}} Retrieved 20 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Saxon building foundations were described as the ruins of &quot;Cley Chapel&quot; on a 1797 map, although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt;

=== Medieval to nineteenth century ===

[[File:1586map.jpg|thumb|[[Blakeney Haven]] in 1586]]
An &quot;eye&quot; is an area of higher ground in the marshes, dry enough to support buildings. Cley Eye had been farmed since the earliest human habitation, and  was 28&amp;nbsp;ha (70&amp;nbsp;acres) in extent in 1651, but is much reduced by coastal erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks (2011) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= bishop130&gt;Bishop (1983) pp. 130â€“133.&lt;/ref&gt; The Eye and its Saxon barn were accessed by an ancient [[causeway]], passable at low tide.&lt;ref name= bishop130/&gt; A 1588 map showed &quot;Black Joy Forte&quot; in the same area, which may have been intended as a defence against the [[Spanish Armada]], but was never completed.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt;&lt;ref name =blackjoy&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Black Joy Fort | work= Pastscape | url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=1394969 | publisher= English Heritage }} Retrieved 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as &quot;Blakeney Chapel&quot;, which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century. Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function. Nearly a third of the mostly 14th-to-16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent,&lt;ref name= lee&gt;{{cite journal| last= Lee | first= Richard | year= 2006 | title =  A report on the archaeological excavation of 'Blakeney Chapel' | journal= Glaven Historian | volume= 9 | pages= 3â€“21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birks10&gt;Birks (2003) pp. 1â€“28.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the Glaven ports' importance in international trade at this time.&lt;ref name= Robinson3/&gt;&lt;ref name = pevsner394/&gt;

The sheltered waters of [[Blakeney Haven]] had brought prosperity to the internationally important [[River Glaven|Glaven]] ports of [[Cley-next-the-Sea|Cley]], [[Wiveton]] and Blakeney. Blakeney gained its [[market charter]] in 1222, and the three ports,  along with Salthouse, were jointly required to provide three ships for [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1322,&lt;ref name= Lambert&gt;Lambert, Craig (2012) &quot;The contributions of the Cinque Ports to the wars of Edward II and Edward III&quot;, p. 65 in Gorski (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; having previously contributed to his father's navy in 1301.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; By the early 15th century, Blakeney  was one of the few ports permitted to trade in horses, gold and silver, through &quot;merchants sworn by oath to the king&quot;, which contributed to the town's growing wealth.&lt;ref name= Robinson3&gt;Robinson (2006)  pp. 3â€“5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1640, [[land reclamation]] schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the [[wharf]],&lt;ref name= pevsner435&gt;Pevsner &amp; Wilson (2002) p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; and further reclamation east of the Glaven meant that all the Glaven ports declined;&lt;ref name= labrum&gt;Labrum (1993) pp. 113â€“114.&lt;/ref&gt; Cley and Wiveton silted up in the 17th century, but Blakeney had [[packet ship]]s until 1840.&lt;ref name = pevsner394&gt;Pevsner &amp; Wilson (2002) pp. 394â€“397.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar marsh reclamation schemes took place elsewhere, often with the same consequence for the local harbours, as for example at Holkham. Only [[Wells-next-the-Sea]] had significant trade into the late 20th century.&lt;ref name = holkfront/&gt;

=== Twentieth century coastal defences ===

[[File:WW2 Pillbox at Cley-next-the Sea - geograph.org.uk - 11710.jpg|thumb|Ruined [[World War II]] [[pillbox (military)|pillbox]] at Cley]]
Artillery may been installed at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the [[Napoleonic wars]], but there were no modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of [[World War I]]. Following [[Raid on Yarmouth|the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth]] in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries,&lt;ref name = NAE9/&gt; but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as a [[bombing range]]. A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the [[British Army]] returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period.&lt;ref name= beforerspb&gt;''Titchwell Marsh before the RSPB''. RSPB information sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no new fortifications along this coast at the start of [[World War II]]. After the fall of France in 1940, the threat of invasion led to the creation of new defences. In addition to the installation of anti-tank and other passive obstacles, fourteen coastal batteries, each of two guns, were constructed. Some of these emplacements and other military bases fell within the SSSI area.&lt;ref name = NAE9/&gt; Four [[spigot mortar]] base plates found at Holme dunes may not have originated at that site, since there is no record of such armament there.&lt;ref name = NAE60&gt;Birks (2003) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The marsh at Titchwell was reflooded,&lt;ref name = rspbarch&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Archaeology and history | work= Titchwell Marsh | url= http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/t/titchwellmarsh/archaeology.aspx | publisher= RSPB}} Retrieved 5 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes]] built into the beach bank.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; Between 1942 and 1945, the marsh was used by the [[Royal Tank Regiment]];&lt;ref name=beforerspb/&gt; an [[armoured fighting vehicle]] gunnery range was established and banks were constructed for firing practice, with targets set at {{convert|900|m|yd|abbr=on}} intervals. Some of the still extant islands were built to hold &quot;pop-up&quot; targets, operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations now lie below a bird hide. Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive.&lt;ref name=beforerspb/&gt;&lt;ref name = rspbarch/&gt; Military activities continued in the area after the war, and the [[Royal Air Force]] returned to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959. Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower, which was demolished in 1962, leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell's west bank.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt;&lt;ref name=beforerspb/&gt; The remains of two World War II [[Covenanter tank]]s, probably used as targets, are sometimes exposed at low tide.&lt;ref name = rspbarch/&gt; The SS ''Vina'', an 1894 cargo steamer, was anchored offshore in 1944 for use as an RAF target, but a gale dragged her to the sands off Titchwell, where the wreck can still be seen  at low tide.&lt;ref name =dowse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?69922 |title=SS ''Vina'' (+1944) |author=Dowse, Julian  |work= | publisher= Wreck Site | accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brancaster beach had a base including three pillboxes, [[Nissen hut]]s and two gun emplacements, and another possible base, comprising about fifty different structures, was located in a salt marsh north-east of Burnham Overy Staithe. A wreck at the west end of Scolt Head Island was used as a bombing target, and the remains of a [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim bomber]] were found at the north of the island in 2004.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt;

[[Royal Artillery]] military fortifications were established at Cley beach, including two 6-inch (15.24&amp;nbsp;cm) guns, five buildings, two [[pillbox (military)|pillboxes]], a [[minefield]],&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; and concrete anti-tank blocks. A [[Blacker Bombard|spigot mortar emplacement]] and an [[Alan Williams turret|Allan Williams Turret]] [[machine gun]] emplacement were sited closer to the village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012.&lt;ref name = nhe&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Cley next the Sea | work=Norfolk Heritage Explorer | url=http://www.heritage.norfolk.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=TNF267 | publisher= Norfolk Landscape Archaeology }} Retrieved 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Near the end of the war, the camp was used to house East European [[refugee]]s, and was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1955, but the [[Electric generator|generator]] house was taken over by the [[coastguard]] service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a look-out, while the larger lower section became a beach cafÃ©.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks (2011) p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008, and subsequently demolished.&lt;ref name = parish&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Cley Parish News, May 2008| work= | url= http://www.cley.org.uk/webpics/parishnews08.pdf | publisher=Cley Parish Council }} Retrieved 4 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation ===

[[File:Seals Blakeney Point.jpg|Seals at Blakeney Point, the first protected area of the coast|thumb]]
The first step towards the protection of this coast by a national conservation body was the purchase of Blakeney Point from the [[Baron Calthorpe|Calthorpe family]]  by banker [[Charles Rothschild]] in 1912. Rothschild gave the property to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1912, which has managed it  since.&lt;ref name = blakeneypoint/&gt;  In 1926, another early protected area was created  when Norfolk [[birdwatcher]] Dr Sydney Long bought the land which makes up the Cley Marshes reserve for the sum of Â£5,100, to be held &quot;in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary&quot;. Long then went on to establish the [[Norfolk Wildlife Trust]] (NWT).&lt;ref name = &quot;Naturalworld&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title= Â£2.5m for Cley Marsh |journal = Natural World | date = Winter 2005  |pages=8â€“9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = nwt100&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= The Wildlife Trusts celebrate 100 years of nature conservation| work= News, 15 May 2012 | url= http://archive.is/2012.12.24-112538/http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Home/News/The-Wildlife-Trusts-celebrate-100-years-of-nature-.aspx| publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust}} Retrieved 26 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current SSSI was created in 1986 from pre-existing SSSIs at Blakeney Point, Holme Dunes, Cley, and Salthouse Marshes (all designated in 1954), Morston Saltmarshes and [[Brancaster Manor]] (1968), [[Stiffkey]] Saltmarshes (1969), [[Thornham, Norfolk|Thornham]] Marshes (1972) and Titchwell Marshes (1973),&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; together with the [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]s (NNRs) at Scolt Head Island (1967)&lt;ref name= allen148&gt;Allen &amp; Pye (1992) p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; and Holkham (1968),&lt;ref name= scoltbook&gt;Rowley (2006) p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; and substantial formerly undesignated areas.&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt;

In spring and early summer, [[bird migration|migrant birds]] including the [[little gull]], [[black tern]], [[Temminck's stint]] and [[garganey]] may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as [[whimbrel]]s, [[curlew sandpiper]]s and [[little stint]]s, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, [[great skua|great]] and [[Arctic skua]]s, [[northern gannet]]s and [[black-legged kittiwake]]s may pass close by in favourable winds.

[[File:Dune front - geograph.org.uk - 1022731.jpg|thumb|Marram grass binds the dunes]]
On exposed parts of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no vegetation except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains [[Salicornia|glassworts]] and [[Spartina anglica|common cord grass]] in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first [[Aster tripolium|sea aster]], then mainly [[Limonium binervosum|sea lavender]], with [[Halimione portulacoides|sea purslane]] in the creeks and smaller areas of [[Plantago maritima|sea plantain]] and other common marsh plants.&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; The uncommon [[Ruppia cirrhosa|spiral tasselweed]] and [[Carex extensa|long-bracted sedge]] are other lower salt marsh specialists. [[Suaeda vera|Scrubby sea-blite]] and [[Limonium bellidifolium|matted sea lavender]] are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast.&lt;ref name= holkham/&gt; They may occur alongside scarce species including [[Centaurium pulchellum|lesser centaury]], [[Parapholis incurva|curved hard-grass]] and [[Sagina maritima|sea pearlwort]], with [[Ceratophyllum submersum|soft hornwort]] in the dykes.&lt;ref name= dear/&gt;

Grasses such as [[Agropyron pungens|sea couch grass]] and [[Puccinellia maritima|sea poa grass]] are important in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where [[Ammophila arenaria|marram grass]], [[Elymus farctus|sand couch-grass]], [[Leymus arenarius|lyme-grass]] and [[Festuca rubra|red fescue]] help to bind the sand. [[Eryngium maritimum|Sea holly]] and [[Carex arenaria|sand sedge]] are other specialists of this arid habitat, and [[Petalophyllum ralfsii|petalwort]] is a nationally rare [[bryophyte]] found on damper dunes.&lt;ref name = nbp/&gt; [[Lotus corniculatus|Bird's-foot trefoil]], [[pyramidal orchid]],&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] and [[Carlina|carline thistle]] flower on the dunes,&lt;ref name = holhdunes&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Dunes | work= Holkham National Nature Reserve| url=http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/dunes.html| archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20121215095447/http://www.holkham.co.uk/naturereserve/dunes.html| archivedate=2012-12-15 | publisher= Holkham Estate }} Retrieved 18 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter [[Goodyera repens|creeping lady's tresses]] and [[Monotropa hypopitys|yellow bird's nest]] orchids.&lt;ref name= holkham/&gt; The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract [[Sedum acre|biting stonecrop]], [[Silene maritima|sea campion]], [[Glaucium flavum|yellow horned poppy]], [[Armeria maritima|sea thrift]] and [[sea beet]].&lt;ref name = encitation/&gt; [[Hordeum marinum|Sea barley]] is a scarcer species of this habitat.&lt;ref name= dear/&gt;

== Recreation ==

[[File:Dune edge on the Norfolk coast. - geograph.org.uk - 164964.jpg|thumb|[[Birdwatching]] visitors help to support the local economy.]]
A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39&amp;nbsp;per cent of visitors gave [[birdwatching]] as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7&amp;nbsp;million day visitors and 5.5&amp;nbsp;million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent Â£122&amp;nbsp;million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh RSPB, Cley Marshes NWT and Holkham NNR each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually.&lt;ref name =liley4&gt;Liley (2008) pp. 4â€“6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The small village of Titchwell shows the effect that wildlife visitors can have locally. It adjoins the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh, and a 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent Â£1.8&amp;nbsp;million in the area in 1998.&lt;ref name = economy&gt;Shiel ''et al.''  (2002) pp. 6â€“16.&lt;/ref&gt; The village has two three-star hotels and a shop selling [[telescope]]s and [[binoculars]], although it does not have a general store or a [[public house]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titchwellmanor.com/ Titchwell Manor] Titchwell Manor.

The large number of visitors sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as Ringed Plovers, Little Terns and Common Seals, but also wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle.&lt;ref name =liley10&gt;Liley (2008) pp. 10â€“14.&lt;/ref&gt; Damage is reduced by measures such as wardening breeding colonies, using fences, boardwalks and signs to control access, and appropriate positioning of car parks.&lt;ref name =liley19&gt;Liley (2008) pp. 19â€“20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast into zones for tourism development purposes. Holme dunes, Holkham dunes and Blakeney Point, sensitive habitats suffering from visitor pressure, were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. &quot;Orange&quot; locations had fragile habitats, but were under less tourism pressure, or, as with the large nature reserves, were equipped to cope with many visitors. The most robust sites, mainly outside the SSSI, were placed in the green zone.&lt;ref name= zones&gt;Scott Wilson Ltd (2006) pp. 5â€“6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Shingle spit.jpg|The shingle ridge at Cley is moving southwards through the marshes.|thumb]]
One of the most vulnerable stretches is that between Blakeney Point and [[Weybourne, Norfolk|Weybourne]], which included the Cley and Salthouse Marsh reserves.&lt;ref name= smp527&gt;East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The coast here is protected by a shingle ridge, but the sea attacks the ridge and spit through tidal and storm action, with a single storm sometimes moving a &quot;spectacular&quot; amount of shingle.&lt;ref name = blakeneypoint/&gt; The Blakeney Point spit has sometimes been breached, becoming an island for a time, and this may happen again.&lt;ref name =may&gt;May, V J (2003) &quot;[http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2038.pdf North Norfolk Coast]&quot; in May (2003) pp. 1â€“19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= wrightchap/&gt; The northernmost part of nearby [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]] was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages, probably due to a storm.&lt;ref name= muir&gt;Muir (2008) p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1&amp;nbsp;m (1&amp;nbsp;yd) per year,&lt;ref name= gray&gt;Gray (2004) pp. 363â€“365.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel was 400&amp;nbsp;m (440&amp;nbsp;yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195&amp;nbsp;m (215&amp;nbsp;yd) by the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=wrightchap&gt;{{cite journal| last= Wright | first= John | year= 1999 |title = The chapel on Blakeney Eye: some documentary evidence | journal= Glaven Historian |volume= 2 | pages= 26â€“33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landward movement of the shingle means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village.&lt;ref name=carnell&gt;{{cite journal| last= Carnell | first= Peter | year= 1999 | title = The chapel on Blakeney Eye: initial results of field surveys |journal= Glaven Historian |volume= 2 | pages= 34â€“45|url=http://www.history-blakeney-area.org.uk/GH-Files/GH1-5/GH%202.7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environment Agency]] considered several remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas,&lt;ref name= gray/&gt; and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about Â£1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name = defra&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Case Study Report 2 Blakeney Freshes River Glaven Realignment and Cley to Salthouse Drainage Improvements | work = Coastal Schemes with Multiple Funders and Objectives FD2635 | url= http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=CaseStudy2BlakeneyFreshesRGlavenRealignmentFD2635.pdf | publisher= Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Environment Agency, Maslem Environmental }} Retrieved 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environment Agency's long-term policy is to hold the line only to protect communities and infrastructure,&lt;ref name= smp562&gt;East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[managed retreat]] as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere,&lt;ref name = EA&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Long term planning: North Norfolk coast|work= | url= http://environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/108980.aspx | archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20121216153828/http://environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/108980.aspx | archivedate= 2012-12-16 | publisher= Environment Agency}} Retrieved 11 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences.&lt;ref name= turner&gt;Turner ''et al.''

Another strategy is to create new reserves inland. To compensate for the inevitable loss of the important reedbeds at Cley, the Environment Agency and the Norfolk Wildlife Trust have been working since 2010 to make a new wetland near [[Hilgay]]. The {{convert|60|ha|acre|adj=on}} Hilgay Wetland Creation Project is converting former farmland into a variety of wetland habitats by using banks, ditches and a lake to manage water levels.&lt;ref name = nwtfens&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Fens | work= Wildlife in Norfolk | url=http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Wildlife-in-Norfolk/Habitat-explorer/Fens.aspx | publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust}} Retrieved 28 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust sees this as the first stage of a long-term plan to create a roughly {{convert|10000|ha|acre|adj=on}} Wissey Living Landscape.&lt;ref name = nwtwissey&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Wissey Living Landscape | work= Conservation |url= http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Conservation/A-Living-Landscape/Wissey.aspx |archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120611073352/http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Conservation/A-Living-Landscape/Wissey.aspx |archivedate= 2012-06-11  | publisher= Norfolk Wildlife Trust}} Retrieved 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
