Heinrich Ehrler biography and article.

Hallo out there... you WW2 pilot guys, I'm Dennis Kenyon, an ex Royal Air Force, English pilot who is about to retire into writing.  I've been flying for a little over 53 years.

I've been commissioned to write an article and possibly and aviation book on the wonderful German Ace, Heinrich Ehrler and am seeking information from others, and in particular from any family descendents.

I am currently working with another English pilot, who is rebuilding an ME109, which was formally flown by Ehrler.  I have a significant amount of information and history of the 109, but need to know dates, history, squadrons, locations, etc, and when Ehrler was flying the type.

I have a story that somewhat conflicts with the information provided on this site.  

I understand that he was not Court Marshalled for failing to act correctly with the interception of RAF 617 Lancasters headed for the Tirpitz. My researches reveal, that on that operation he instructed his squadron to continue to the allocated target which was to protect the Tirpitz, and broke off to engage the IL2 aircraft he had sighted.  It was this IL2 that gave him his 200th 'Kill.'  However, the Russian aircraft was carrying very senior Russian Officers, who were on their way to a meeting with Adolph Hitler to discuss a possible Truce programme.  It was for this offence, which had significant political implications, that he was Court Marshalled. 

I believe, that Heinrich Ehrler felt that since he had been treated so badly by the German war machine, and knew the war was lost, that he subsequently made his 208th kill by flying into the tail of the RAF aircraft.  

If any aviation history experts can help me with any item regarding this great German pilot, or his aircraft and missions, I would really appreciate them making contact.  Please use e-mail. DennisRKenyon @aol.com  For some details of myself, kindly link to www.dennis-kenyon.com   

Great flying to you all.

Dennis Kenyon.

* &quot;... the Russian aircraft was carrying very senior Russian Officers, who were on their way to a meeting with Adolph Hitler to discuss a possible Truce programme.&quot; WHAT comment should I write? B*llsh*t?!?! Or simply HOAX???? Why should a Russian delegation have flown over Norway instead of taking the direct way over Poland to Germany? And Adolph Hitler willing ro tiscuss a possible Truce with the Soviets? Dennis, think about it and/or read the Wikipedia ;-)  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.12.116.212|91.12.116.212]] ([[User talk:91.12.116.212|talk]]) 14:30, 26 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

* &quot;Heinrich Ehrler felt that since [i.e. from November 1944 onwards] he had been treated so badly by the German war machine, and knew the war was lost, that he subsequently made his 208th kill by flying into the tail of the RAF aircraft.&quot; Subsequently ... hmmmm ... Ehrler had 7 kills with a Me 262 jet fighter before. During his last sortie on 4 April 1945 he was running out of ammunition and intended to ram the bomber.
Was it only then [= 4 months later] that poor Ehrler felt that he &quot;subsequently&quot; had to ram an aircraft (BTW: it was no RAF flown aircraft, but an American B-24 Liberator from the 448th Bombardment Group - RAF Seething -, 2d Bombardment Division, Eighth US Air Force!)??? 
(Again) Dennis, think about it!
Your LINK www.dennis-kenyon.com is DEAD! &quot;Dennis Kenyon, an ex Royal Air Force, English pilot who is about to retire into writing. I've been flying for a little over 53 years.&quot; HAHAHA ... I'm in doubt about your identity! You're a FAKER!

==Kills==
1. According to the article, Ehrler had 11 kills on 22 April 1942, which rose to 64 by 4 September 1942. This works out to about 53 kills in ''13'' days. Is this correct ?

:: I do believe there is an error there - and that the correct date is 20 or 22 July for his 11 kills and promotion. The problem is different sources vary. [[User:Abel29a|Abel29a]] 20:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
:::I have changed it to the more probable 20 July date, however I have also added a note describing the uncertainty. If somebody could offer a definitive answer it would be good. 

2. In the 'Continued flying' section, para 1, it states: &quot;bringing his total tally to 208&quot;. In the next paragraph it states: &quot;shooting down 2 B17 bombers&quot;. Does that not make his total 210 ?

::I see what you mean - I'll rewrite for better language. What is meant is that he had a further 8 kills from being transfered to JG 7 and until the end of the war. The shooting down two and ramming a third part was merely the last three of the 8 kills.[[User:Abel29a|Abel29a]] 20:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

To Dennis, ex-RAF
Hallo, Dennis. I understand youÂ´re doing a book on Ehrler and you need tons of information. I was the VDK-casualty officer whose team recovered W/Co. WarburtonÂ´s remains some time ago. It is not clear what happened, the day the Tirpitz went down. I wouldnÂ´t buy the story of the Russian plane Ehrler allegedly shot down and the delegation killed by him either. To me the Tirpitz affair was sheer bungling. General Kammhuber who had been JafÃ¼ Nord before Ehrler had failed to establish adequate communications between the relevant commands. Ehrler never had a Lagezentrum at his disposal and couldnÂ´t sort out how many attackers the British had up and where they were headed. Significantly Kammhuber later was in charge of the court martial and benefittet from this to bleach himself. He made it to C-in-C of the Bundeswehr. Ehrler is said to have flown his &quot;Turbo&quot; into a B-17. Sources differ as to the date. April 4/6/7 and 10 are given by the sources. A stele on Stendal cemetery says April 10. To me April 7 seems the most likely option as then the &quot;Kommando Elbe&quot; did their rammings. Well, donÂ´t know if youÂ´re still out there listening. If you think I can help get in touch under h.laage@web.de

== EhrlerÂ´s grave ==

I tried in vain to locate EhrlerÂ´s grave at Stendal municipal cemetery some years ago. Your article says there is one however. All I could find at the time was an inscription at the Memorial for the Missing giving the name of Heinrich Ehrler. Bizarrely it gives 10-4-45 as his dying date, which doesnÂ´t match any of the versions about his death. Even more intriguing there is a headstone / memorial stone (?) in his home town cemetery in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
Anybody can clear this up ? h.laage@web.de  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/217.238.3.7|217.238.3.7]] ([[User talk:217.238.3.7|talk]]) 09:23, 18 August 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
