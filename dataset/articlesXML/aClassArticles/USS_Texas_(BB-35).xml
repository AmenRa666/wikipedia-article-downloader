'''USS ''Texas'' (BB-35)''', the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] named in honor of the [[US state]] of [[Texas]], is a {{sclass-|New York|battleship}}. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 18 May 1912 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 12 March 1914.{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=420}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=115}}

Soon after her commissioning, ''Texas'' saw action in Mexican waters following the &quot;[[Tampico Affair|Tampico Incident]]&quot; and made numerous sorties into the North Sea during [[World War I]]. When the United States formally entered [[World War II]] in 1941, ''Texas'' [[Battle of the Atlantic|escorted war convoys]] across the Atlantic, and later shelled [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]-held beaches for the [[North African campaign]] and the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Landings]] before being transferred to the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific Theater]] late in 1944 to provide [[naval gunfire support]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Battles of Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]]. ''Texas'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1948, having earned a total of five [[battle star]]s for service in World War II, and is now a [[museum ship]] near [[Houston]], Texas.

Among the world's remaining battleships, ''Texas'' is notable for being the only remaining World War I-era [[dreadnought]] battleship, though she is not the oldest surviving battleship: {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, a [[predreadnought]] battleship ordered in 1898 by the [[Empire of Japan]], and [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], launched in 1765 (Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar), are both older than ''Texas''. She is also noteworthy for being one of only six remaining ships and the only remaining capital ship to have served in both World Wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;The other five surviving vessels that hold the distinction of serving in both World Wars are the ''[[Medea (yacht)|Medea]]'', which served both the [[French Navy]] and [[Royal Navy]], British Monitor {{HMS|M33}}, the British light cruiser {{HMS|Caroline|1914|6}}, the Greek armored cruiser [[Greek cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']], and the [[Drazki torpedo boat|''Drazki'']], a Bulgarian torpedo boat.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among US-built battleships, ''Texas'' is notable for her sizeable number of firsts: the first US Navy vessel to house a permanently assigned contingent of [[US Marine]]s, the first US battleship to mount [[anti-aircraft]] guns, the first US ship to [[fire-control system|control gunfire with directors and range-keepers]] (analog forerunners of today's computers), the first US battleship to launch an aircraft,&lt;ref name=&quot;HNSVG&quot; /&gt; from a platform on Turret 2,&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; one of the first to receive the CXAM-1 version of [[CXAM radar|CXAM]] production [[radar]] in the US Navy,&lt;ref group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;CXAM was the first nonexperimental, nonprototype radar system developed by the US Navy. It was produced in small numbers for the US Navy and installed aboard certain capital ships, including battleships, [[heavy cruiser]]s, and [[aircraft carrier]]s. An upgraded version (CXAM-1) was later installed aboard other US Navy vessels, including a few ships that carried the original version.&lt;/ref&gt; the first US battleship to become a permanent museum ship,&lt;ref group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;The first steel battleship to become a permanent museum ship was ''Mikasa''; the first US battleship to become a museum ship was {{USS|Oregon|BB-3|2}}. However, ''Oregon'' was placed on loan to the state of Oregon and at the outbreak of World War II, she was offered back into service and later sunk and scrapped. As a result, ''Texas'' is the first permanent US battleship museum ship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HNSVG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=USS ''Texas'' (BB-35) |url=http://www.hnsa.org/ships/texas.htm |work=Historic Naval Ships Visitors Guide |publisher=Historic Naval Ships Association |accessdate=2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first battleship declared to be a US [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;See [[List of U.S. National Historic Landmark ships, shipwrecks, and shipyards]] for documentation that ''Texas'' is the first declared National Historic Landmark.{{unreliable source?|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
''Texas'' was the first&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; of two ''New York''-class battleships authorized on 24 June 1910.{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=93}}{{sfn|Wiper|Flowers|2006}}{{clarify |reason=First authorized? New York was authorized later that day? |date=September 2012}} Bids for ''Texas'' were accepted from 27 September to 1 December with the winning bid of $5,830,000—excluding the price of armor and armament—submitted by [[Newport News Shipbuilding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=420}} The contract was signed on 17 December and the plans were delivered to the building yard seven days later.{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=93}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=115}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}} ''Texas''{{'}}s [[Keel laying|keel was laid down]] on 17 April 1911 at [[Newport News, Virginia]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 18 May 1912, sponsored by Miss Claudia Lyon, daughter of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Cecil Lyon, Republican national committeeman from Texas. The ship was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 12 March 1914 with [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|Captain]] [[Albert W. Grant]] in command.{{sfn|Wiper|Flowers|2006}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}}{{sfn|Pater|1968}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers133&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Powers|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPWIsucIbAcC&amp;pg=PA133 133]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Texas''{{'}}s main battery consisted of ten [[14&quot;/45 caliber gun|{{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}}/45 caliber Mark 1 guns]],{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=436}} which could fire {{cvt|1400|lb|0|lk=on}} [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]]{{sfn|Egan|Lott|Sumrall|1976|p=45}} shells to a range of {{cvt|13|mi|nmi km|0}}. Her secondary battery consisted of twenty-one [[5&quot;/51 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}}/51 caliber guns]].{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=205}} She also mounted four {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s for the [[Bliss-Leavitt Mark 8 torpedo]], one each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern. The torpedo rooms held 12 [[torpedo]]es total, plus 12 [[naval mine|naval defense mines]].{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=436}} ''Texas'' and her sister {{USS|New York|BB-34|2}} were the only battleships to store and hoist their 14-inch ammunition in cast-iron cups, nose-down.{{sfn|Wiper|Flowers|2006}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1984|p=115}}
{{sfn|Egan|Lott|Sumrall|1976|p=44}}

==Service history==
On 24 March 1914, ''Texas'' departed [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] and set a course for New York City, making an overnight stop at [[Tompkinsville, New York]], on the night of 26 March. Entering [[New York Navy Yard]] on the next day, she spent the next three weeks there undergoing the installation of [[Fire-control system|fire-control equipment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS |title=Texas |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/texas-ii.html |accessdate=2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her stay in New York, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] ordered a number of ships of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]] to Mexican waters in response to tension created when a detail of Mexican federal troops detained an American [[gunboat]] crew at [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]]. The problem was quickly resolved locally, but [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Henry T. Mayo]] sought further redress by demanding an official disavowal of the act by the [[Victoriano Huerta|Huerta]] regime and a [[21-gun salute]] to the [[American flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

President Wilson saw in the incident an opportunity to put pressure on a government he felt was undemocratic. On 20 April, Wilson placed the matter before the [[United States Congress]] and sent orders to Rear Admiral [[Frank Friday Fletcher]], commanding the naval force off the Mexican coast, instructing him to land a force at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and to seize the customs house there in retaliation for what is now known as the &quot;[[Tampico Affair|Tampico Incident]]&quot;. That action was carried out on 21–22 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

Due to the intensity of the situation, ''Texas'' put to sea on 13 May and headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual [[shakedown cruise]] and post-shakedown repair period. After a five-day stop at [[Hampton Roads]] from 14–19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on 26 May. She remained in Mexican waters for just over two months, supporting the American forces ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a course for [[Nipe Bay]], [[Cuba]], and from there steamed to New York, where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The battleship remained there until 6 September, when she returned to sea, joined the Atlantic Fleet, and settled into a schedule of normal fleet operations. In October, she returned to the Mexican coast. Later that month, ''Texas'' became station ship at [[Tuxpan, Veracruz|Tuxpan]], a duty that lasted until 4 November, when she steamed for [[Galveston, Texas]]. While at Galveston on 7 November, Texas Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] presented the ship's silver service to Captain Grant. The Young Men's Business League of [[Waco, Texas]], raised the $10,000 to purchase the silver.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}}

''Texas'' sailed for Tampico on 14 November and thereafter to Veracruz, where she remained for a month.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}} The ship left Mexico on 20 December and set a course for New York. The battleship entered New York Navy Yard on 28 December and remained there undergoing repairs until 16 February 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; On 25 May, ''Texas'', along with battleships {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}}, {{USS|Louisiana|BB-19|2}}, and {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|2}}, rescued 230 passengers from the damaged [[Holland America Line]] passenger ship {{SS|Ryndam||2}}, which had been rammed by [[Norway|Norwegian]]-flagged fruit steamer ''Joseph J. Cuneo''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9A0DE0DA1338E633A25754C2A9639C946496D6CF |format=pdf |title=Ryndam rammed at sea |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 May 1915 |accessdate=2008-04-17 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In gratitude, Holland America Line presented ''Texas'' with a model of a 17th-century warship, which is displayed with the wardroom silver as of 2014. In 1916, ''Texas'' became the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns with the addition of two [[3&quot;/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}/50 caliber guns]] on platforms atop the boat cranes, and the first to control gunfire with directors and rangefinders, analog forerunners of today's computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;HNSVG&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=177}}&lt;ref&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:USS Texas (BB-35).jpg|thumb|upright|''Texas'' in World War I (after July 1916 and before October 1917): The two large steel towers are her [[lattice mast]]s, which were replaced with a tripod version during her modernization overhaul in 1925–1926.]]
[[File:Popular science monthly (1872) (14596330249).jpg|thumb|150px|3&quot;/50 caliber antiaircraft gun on platform atop a boat crane on ''Texas'', installed in 1916 and said to be the first AA gun installation on a US battleship.]]
Upon her return to active duty with the fleet, ''Texas'' resumed a schedule alternating between training operations along the [[New England]] coast and off the [[Virginia Capes]] and winter fleet tactical and gunnery drills in the [[West Indies]]. That routine lasted just over two years until the [[World War I#Entry of the United States|February-to-March crisis]] over [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] catapulted the US into World War I in April 1917. The 6 April declaration of war found ''Texas'' riding at anchor in the mouth of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] with the other Atlantic Fleet battleships. She remained in the [[Virginia Capes]]–[[Hampton Roads]] vicinity until mid-August, conducting exercises and training Naval Armed Guard gun crews for service onboard merchant ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; One of the gun crews trained aboard ''Texas'' was assigned to the merchant vessel {{SS|Mongolia|1903|2}} at the beginning of the war. On 19 April, the crew of ''Mongolia'' sighted a surfaced German [[U-boat]] and the gun crew trained aboard ''Texas'' opened fire on the U-boat, averting an attack on ''Mongolia'' and firing the first American shots of World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers-P11-12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Powers|1993|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPWIsucIbAcC&amp;pg=PA11 11–12]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, arriving at Base 10&lt;ref group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;This was most likely a facility in the New York area for offloading ammunition prior to a repair period, probably associated with the [[Picatinny Arsenal|Lake Denmark Naval Ammunition Depot]] in New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]] that same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; During the mid-watch on 27 September, she ran hard aground on [[Block Island]]. Captain [[Victor Blue]] and his [[navigator]], confused about shore lights and more concerned about the minefield at the opening of [[Long Island Sound]], made the turn at the wrong time and ran the ship aground on the island from the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] all the way [[aft]] beyond midships.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=40}} For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 September, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damage dictated a return to the yard, and extensive repairs precluded her departure with [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division 9]] (BatDiv 9) for the [[United Kingdom|British Isles]] in November.{{sfn|Wiper|Flowers|2006}} The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5-inch guns in October 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;commons.wikimedia.org&quot;&gt;

By December, she had completed repairs and moved south to conduct [[military simulation]]s out of the York River. Mid-January 1918 found the battleship back at New York preparing for the voyage across the Atlantic, including the removal of two more 5-inch guns, reducing the total number aboard to 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;commons.wikimedia.org&quot; /&gt; She departed New York on 30 January 1918, arrived at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] off the coast of Scotland on 11 February, and rejoined BatDiv 9, by then known as the [[6th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|6th Battle Squadron]] of Britain's [[Grand Fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

''Texas''{{'}}s service with the Grand Fleet consisted entirely of convoy missions and occasional forays to reinforce the British squadron on blockade duty in the [[North Sea]] whenever German heavy units threatened. The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the [[Firth of Forth]] in Scotland. ''Texas'' began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Battle Squadron]], then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow the next day and remained until 8 March, when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March. ''Texas'' and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April, but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American battleships returned to base on 20 April. Four days later, ''Texas'' again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German [[High Seas Fleet]] had sortied from [[Jadebusen|Jade Bay]] toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units caught sight of the retiring Germans on 25 April, but at such an extreme range,  bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet was not possible. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including ''Texas'', did likewise on the next.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

''Texas'' and her division mates passed a relatively inactive May in the Firth of Forth. On 9 June, she got underway with the other warships of the 6th Battle Squadron and headed back to the anchorage at Scapa Flow, arriving there the following day. From 30 June to 2 July, ''Texas'' and her colleagues acted as escort for American minelayers adding to the [[North Sea Mine Barrage|North Sea mine barrage]]. After a two-day return to Scapa Flow, ''Texas'' put to sea with the Grand Fleet to conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games. At the conclusion of those drills on 8 July, the fleet entered the Firth of Forth. For the remainder of World War I, ''Texas'' and the other battleships of Division&amp;nbsp;9 continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. With the German Fleet increasingly tied to its bases in the estuaries of the [[Jade (river)|Jade]] and the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] rivers, the American and British ships settled into a routine schedule of operations with little-to-no hint of combat operations. That state of affairs lasted until the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] ended hostilities on 11 November 1918. At 03:35 on 21 November, she got underway to accompany the Grand Fleet to meet the surrendering German Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;

}}{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; she entered Norfolk Navy Yard for a major modernization overhaul. The overhaul, which replaced both [[lattice mast|cage masts]] with [[tripod mast]]s, replaced her 14 [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[coal-fired]] [[boilers]] with 6 Bureau Express oil-fired boilers,&lt;ref name=&quot;HNSVG&quot; /&gt; and upgraded her fire-control equipment, was completed on 23 November 1926. Also, her AA armament was increased to eight 3-inch guns, and the torpedo tubes were removed. Six of the 5-inch guns were relocated to new main deck [[Casemate#Single casemates (1889 onwards)|casemates]] at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

Following completion of her overhaul, ''Texas'' was designated the [[flagship]] of the [[United States Fleet]] and resumed duty along the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]]. She kept at that task until late 1927, when she did a brief tour of duty in the Pacific from late September-early December.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; In 1927, ''Texas'' set another first with the showing of [[sound film|&quot;talking&quot; pictures]] for crew entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;HNSVG&quot; /&gt; Near the end of the year, ''Texas'' returned to the Atlantic and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet.

She returned to New York early in 1929 for her annual overhaul and had completed it by March when she began another brief tour of duty in the Pacific. She returned to the Atlantic in June and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet. In April 1930, she took time from her operating schedule to escort {{SS|Leviathan||2}} into New York when that ship carried the returning US delegation to the [[London Naval Conference]]. In January 1931, she left the yard at New York as flagship of the United States Fleet and headed via the Panama Canal to [[San Diego, California]], and then on to Los Angeles (port of San Pedro) which became her home port for the next six years and three months.&lt;ref&gt;

Late in 1938 or early in 1939, the warship became flagship of the newly organized [[Atlantic Squadron]], built around BatDiv 5. Through both organizational assignments, her labors were directed primarily to training missions, Midshipman cruises, Naval Reserve drills, and training members of the [[Fleet Marine Force]].

===World War II===

====Early operations====
Soon after war broke out in Europe in September 1939, ''Texas'' began operating on the [[Neutrality Patrol]], an American attempt to keep the war out of the [[western hemisphere]]. Later, as the United States moved toward more active support of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cause, the warship began convoying ships carrying [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease matériel]] to the United Kingdom. In February 1941, the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|US 1st Marine Division]] was activated aboard ''Texas''. On 1 February, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King|Ernest J. King]] hoisted his flag as Commander-in-Chief of the re-formed Atlantic Fleet aboard ''Texas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; That same year, while on Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic, ''Texas'' was stalked unsuccessfully by the German submarine {{ship|German submarine|U-203||2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;HNSVG&quot; /&gt;

====Convoy duty====
Sunday, 7 December 1941, found the battleship at [[Casco Bay, Maine]], undergoing a rest and relaxation period following three months of watch duty at [[Naval Station Argentia]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. After 10 days at Casco Bay, she returned to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942, when she got underway to escort a convoy to England. After delivering her charges, the battleship patrolled waters near [[Iceland]] until March when she returned home.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; Around this time, the secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch guns and the light AA battery was greatly increased, with the two 1.1-inch/75 caliber quad mount guns replaced by 6 (later 10) quad mount [[40 mm Bofors|{{cvt|40|mm}} Bofors]] and 44 [[20 mm Oerlikon|{{cvt|20|mm}} Oerlikon]] cannons, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] having demonstrated the need for this.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=205}} For the next six months, she continued convoy-escort missions to various destinations. On one occasion, she escorted [[Guadalcanal]]-bound marines as far as [[Panama]]; on another, the warship screened service troops to [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], on the west coast of Africa. More frequently, she made voyages to and from the United Kingdom escorting both cargo- and troop-carrying ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

====Operation Torch====
{{main article|Operation Torch}}
On 23 October 1942, ''Texas'' embarked upon her first major combat operation when she sortied with Task Group 34.8 (TG 34.8), the Northern Attack Group for [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of North Africa. The objective assigned to this group was [[Port Lyautey]] in [[French protectorate of Morocco|French Morocco]]. The warships arrived off the assault beaches near the village of [[Mehdya|Mehedia]] early in the morning of 8 November and began preparations for the [[Battle of Port Lyautey|invasion]]. ''Texas'' transmitted [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s first &quot;Voice of Freedom&quot; broadcast, asking the French not to oppose Allied landings on North Africa. When the troops went ashore, ''Texas'' did not go into action immediately to support them. At that point in the war, the doctrine of amphibious warfare was still embryonic. Many Army officers did not recognize the value of prelanding bombardments. Instead, the Army insisted upon attempting a landing by surprise. ''Texas'' entered the battle early in the afternoon when the Army requested her to fire upon a [[Vichy France|Vichy French Army]] [[ammunition dump]] near Port Lyautey.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; One more gunfire mission was provided on the 10th before the cease fire on 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;

}}{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, unlike in later operations, she expended only 273 rounds of 14-inch shells and 6 rounds of 5-inch shells. During her short stay, some of her crewmen went ashore to assist in salvaging some of the ships that had been sunk in the harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; On 16 November, ''Texas'' departed [[North Africa]] for the East Coast of the United States in a [[task force]] along with {{USS|Savannah|CL-42|2}}, {{USS|Sangamon|CVE-26|2}}, {{USS|Kennebec|AO-36|2}}, four transports, and seven [[destroyer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

The young news reporter [[Walter Cronkite]] was on board ''Texas'' starting in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], through her service off the coast of North Africa, and thence back to the US On the return trip, Cronkite was flown off ''Texas'' in one of her [[OS2U Kingfisher]] aircraft when Norfolk was within flying distance. He was granted permission to be flown the rest of the distance to Norfolk so that he could outpace a rival correspondent on {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|2}} to return to the US and to issue the first uncensored news reports to published about Operation Torch.{{sfn|Cronkite|1996|p=89–90}} Cronkite's experiences aboard ''Texas'' launched his career as a [[war correspondent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HNSVG&quot; /&gt;

====Operation Overlord====
{{main article|Operation Overlord}}
Throughout 1943, ''Texas'' carried out the familiar role of convoy escort. With New York as her home port, she made numerous transatlantic voyages to such places as [[Casablanca]] and [[Gibraltar]], as well as frequent visits to ports in the British Isles. That routine continued into 1944 but ended on 22 April of that year when, at the European end of one such mission, she remained at the [[River Clyde|Clyde estuary]] in Scotland and began training for the invasion of [[Normandy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

=====Rehearsal=====
[[File:USS Texas-5.jpg|thumb|''Texas'' off [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 15 March 1943]]

During the next twelve days, ''Texas'' carried out many 14-inch gun-firing exercises with British battleships {{HMS|Ramillies|07|6}} and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}. The firing was done in conjunction with [[Royal Air Force]] airplanes as spotters. On 29 April, ''Texas'', {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}, and {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|2}} relocated to [[Belfast Lough]], [[Northern Ireland]]. There, final preparations were made, including the removal of the airplane catapult and the ship's OS2U Kingfisher observation planes. The three pilots who flew ''Texas''{{'}}s Kingfishers during this period were temporarily transferred to a newly formed squadron, [[VOS-7]], that was composed of the pilots who flew observation and scouting planes from the cruisers {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|2}}, {{USS|Quincy|CA-71|2}}, and {{USS|Tuscaloosa|CA-37|2}} and the battleships ''Arkansas'', ''Nevada'', and ''Texas''. VOS-7 received training in defensive fighter tactics, aerobatics, navigation, formation flying and spotting procedures in Royal Air Force [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]; they flew spotting missions in the Spitfires because of the threat from German fighters. The pilots of VOS-7 would fly spotting missions for the US warships off [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]] and [[Utah Beach]]es during D-Day.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during this time additional radio equipment was added, including a device to detect and jam radio-guided missiles.&lt;ref group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;Anti-ship missiles such as the [[Fritz X]] were among the first instances of short-range guided missiles during the Second World War. The [[Luftwaffe]] used them to some effect against Allied shipping, and sank or damaged some large warships successfully before the Allies devised countermeasures, principally radio jamming.&lt;/ref&gt; Final exercises were carried out to the south in Dundrum Bay and Belfast Lough. During the final preparations, General Eisenhower came aboard on 19 May to speak to the crew. On 31 May, the ship was sealed and a briefing given to the crew about the upcoming invasion. For the invasion, ''Texas'' was designated Bombardment Force Flagship for Omaha Beach, in the Western Taskforce. Her firing area of Omaha was the western half, supporting the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|US 29th Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|US 2nd Ranger Battalion]] at [[Pointe du Hoc]], and the [[5th Ranger Battalion (United States)|US 5th Ranger Battalion]], which had been diverted to Western Omaha to support the troops at Pointe du Hoc.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Charles |title=Battleship Texas (BB-35) |url=http://users3.ev1.net/~cfmoore/history/1944normandy.html |publisher=Charles Moore |accessdate=2006-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923092736/http://users3.ev1.net/~cfmoore/history/1944normandy.html |archivedate=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of ships in Omaha Bombardment Group|Omaha Beach bombardment force]] consisted of two sections with ''Texas'' and the British light cruiser {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} responsible for the western half with ''Arkansas'', and the French light cruisers {{Ship|French cruiser|Georges Leygues||2}} and {{Ship|French cruiser|Montcalm||2}} responsible for the east.

At 02:09 on 3 June, ''Texas'' and the rest of the Western Taskforce sailed from Belfast Lough for Normandy. In sight, on a parallel course was a group of British ships, including the battleships {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}} and ''Ramillies''. At 07:10 on 4 June, the taskforce had to reverse course due to unacceptable weather in Normandy. Later that evening, off Lundy Island, the taskforce reversed course and headed for and joined the invasion fleet gathering at Area Z.{{clarify |reason=Where was Area Z? |date=September 2012}} The invasion fleet then headed south toward Normandy and navigated the German [[minefield]], through which [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s had cleared channels; not a single Omaha Beach vessel was lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDay&quot; /&gt;

The initial bombardment commenced at 05:50, against the site of six {{convert|15|cm|in|adj=on|0}} guns, atop Pointe du Hoc.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; When ''Texas'' ceased firing at the Pointe at 06:24, 255 14-inch shells had been fired in 34 minutes—an average rate of fire of 7.5 shells per minute, which was the longest sustained period of firing for ''Texas'' in World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDay&quot; /&gt; While shells from the main guns were hitting Pointe du Hoc, the 5-inch guns were firing on the area leading up to Exit D-1, the route to get inland from western Omaha. At 06:26, ''Texas'' shifted her main battery gunfire to the western edge of Omaha Beach, around the town of [[Vierville, Manche|Vierville]]. Meanwhile, her secondary battery went to work on another target on the western end of &quot;Omaha&quot; beach, a ravine laced with strong points to defend an exit road. Later, under control of airborne spotters, she moved her major-caliber fire inland to interdict enemy reinforcement activities and to destroy batteries and other strong points farther inland.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

By noon, the assault on Omaha Beach was in danger of collapsing due to stronger than anticipated German resistance and the inability of the Allies to get needed [[Tank|armor]] and [[artillery]] units on the beach. In an effort to help the infantry fighting to take Omaha, some of the destroyers providing gunfire support closed near the shoreline, almost grounding themselves to fire on the Germans. ''Texas'' also closed to the shoreline; at 12:23, ''Texas'' closed to only {{cvt|3000|yd}} from the water's edge, firing her main guns with very little elevation to clear the western exit D-1, in front of Vierville. Among other things, she fired upon [[sniper]]s and machine gun nests hidden in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] just off the beach. At the conclusion of that mission, the battleship attacked an enemy anti-aircraft battery located west of Vierville.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDay&quot; /&gt;

On 7 June, the battleship received word that the [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]] battalion at Pointe Du Hoc was still isolated from the rest of the invasion force with low [[ammunition]] and mounting casualties; in response, ''Texas'' obtained and filled two [[LCVP (United States)|LCVPs]]&lt;ref&gt;

Along with the Rangers, a deceased Coast Guard sailor and twenty-seven [[POW|prisoners]] (twenty Germans, four Italians, and three French) were brought to the ship. The prisoners were fed, segregated, and not formally interrogated aboard ''Texas'', due to the ship bombarding targets or standing by to bombard, before being loaded aboard an [[Landing ship tank|LST]] for transfer to England.&lt;ref&gt;

That evening, she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach. Not long after midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of them swooped in low on ''Texas''{{'}}s starboard quarter. Her anti-aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder. On the morning of 8 June, her guns fired on [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]], then on a shore battery, and finally on Trévières once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;

After that, she retired to [[Plymouth]] to rearm, returning to the French coast on 11 June. From then until 15 June, she supported the army in its advance inland. By 15 June, the troops had advanced to the edge of ''Texas''{{'}}s gun range; her last fire support mission was so far inland that to get the needed range, the starboard [[torpedo blister]] was flooded with water to provide a list of two degrees which gave the guns enough elevation to complete the fire mission. With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on 16 June, ''Texas'' left Normandy for England on 18 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Battle of Cherbourg====
{{main article|Bombardment of Cherbourg}}
[[File:USS Texas-11.jpg|thumb|A heavy German coast artillery shell falls between ''Texas'' (in the background) and {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|2}} while the two battleships were engaging Battery Hamburg during the battle of [[Cherbourg, France]], 25 June 1944.]]

On the morning of 25 June ''Texas'', in company with ''Arkansas'', ''Nevada'', four cruisers and eleven destroyers, closed in on the vital port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] to suppress the fortifications and batteries surrounding the town while the US Army's [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] attacked the city from the rear. While en route to Cherbourg, the bombardment plan was changed and Task Group 129.2 (TG 129.2), built around ''Arkansas'' and ''Texas'', was ordered to move {{cvt|6|mi}}{{clarify |reason=Nautical or statute miles? |date=September 2012}} to the east of Cherbourg and engage the guns of Battery Hamburg, a large shore battery composed of four {{convert|24|cm|in|adj=on|0}} guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navweaps&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Morison|2001|p=496}}{{sfn|McManus|2004|p=496}} At 12:08, ''Arkansas'' was the first to fire at the German positions, while the German gunners waited for ''Arkansas'' and ''Texas'' to be well in range to return fire. At 12:33, ''Texas'' was straddled by three German shells; five minutes later ''Texas'' returned fire with a continuous stream of two-gun [[salvo]]s. The battleship continued her firing runs in spite of shell geysers blossoming about her and difficulty spotting the targets because of smoke; however, the enemy gunners were just as stubborn and skilled. At 13:16, a German 24-cm shell skidded across the top of her [[conning tower]], sheared the top of the fire control periscope off (the periscope remains fell back into the conning tower and wounded the gunnery officer and three others), hit the main support column of the navigation bridge and exploded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navweaps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=DiGiulian |first=Tony |title=German 24cm.40 (9.4&quot;) SK L/40 |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_945-40_skc94.htm |publisher=Tony DiGiulian |accessdate=2009-01-12 |archiveurl=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_945-40_skc94.htm |archivedate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harrison|1951|p=519}}{{sfn|Kaufmann|2002|p=432}} The explosion caused the deck of the pilot house above to be blown upwards approximately {{cvt|4|ft|m}}, wrecked the interior of the pilot house, and wounded seven.

Throughout the three-hour duel, the Germans straddled and near-missed ''Texas'' over sixty-five times, but she continued her mission firing 206 14-inch shells at Battery Hamburg until ordered to retire at 15:01.{{sfn|Morison|2001|p=496}}{{sfn|McManus|2004|p=496}}

====Operation Dragoon====
{{main article|Operation Dragoon}}
After ''Texas'' underwent repairs at Plymouth from damage sustained at Cherbourg, she drilled in preparation for the invasion of southern France. On 16 July, she departed Belfast Lough and headed for the Mediterranean. After stops at Gibraltar and [[Oran]], [[Algeria]], the battleship arrived in [[Taranto]], [[Italy]] on 27 July.&lt;ref&gt;

}}{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departing Taranto on 11 August, ''Texas'' rendezvoused with three French destroyers off [[Bizerte]], [[Tunisia]], and set a course for the [[French Riviera]]. She arrived off [[Saint-Tropez]] during the night of 14 August and was joined early the next morning by battleship ''Nevada'' and cruiser {{USS|Philadelphia|CL-41|2}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Powers|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPWIsucIbAcC&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 04:44 on 15 August, she moved into position for the pre-landing bombardment and, at 0651, opened up on her first target, a battery of five 15-cm guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers31&quot; /&gt; The beaches had been fortified and heavy resistance was expected. Due to very poor visibility that morning, ''Texas'' relied on her SG radar equipment to determine her position and track for both navigation and gunnery purposes. No landmarks were visible during the firing and for the greater part of the forenoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hnsa.org/doc/cic/cic-44-12.pdf |format=pdf |chapter=PPI View of Southern France |title=C.I.C. - Combat Information Center |date=December 1944 |publisher=Office of the Chief of Naval Operations |accessdate=2009-05-22 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heavy opposition that was expected never materialized, so the landing forces moved inland rapidly. As fire support from ''Texas''{{'}}s guns was no longer required, she departed the southern coast of France on the early morning of 17 August.&lt;ref&gt;

====Operations Detachment and Iceberg====
{{main article|Battle of Iwo Jima}}
{{main article|Battle of Okinawa}}
At New York, ''Texas'' underwent a 36-day repair period during which the barrels on her main battery were replaced. After a brief refresher cruise, she departed Maine in November and set a course, via the Panama Canal, for the Pacific. She made a stop at [[Long Beach, California]], and then continued on to [[Oahu]]. She spent Christmas at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and then conducted maneuvers in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] for about a month at the end of which she steamed to [[Ulithi Atoll]]. She departed Ulithi on 10 February 1945, stopped in the [[Mariana Islands]] for two days of invasion rehearsals, and then she set a course for [[Iwo Jima]]. She arrived off Iwo Jima on 16 February, three days before the [[amphibious landing]]s began. She spent just three days pounding the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese defenses]] on Iwo Jima in preparation for the landing of three Marine Corps Divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; After the Marines stormed the beaches on 19 February, ''Texas'' switched to providing naval gunfire support for them. &quot;On-call fire&quot; in response to requests from Marine units continued through 21 February.&lt;ref&gt;

Though the island of Iwo Jima was not declared to be captured until 16 March, ''Texas'' departed from the [[Volcano Islands]] on 7 March,&lt;ref&gt;

}}{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Ulithi Atoll to prepare for the invasion of [[Okinawa]] ([[Operation Iceberg]]). She departed from Ulithi with Task Force 54, the gunfire support unit, on 21 March, and arrived in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] on the 26th. ''Texas'' moved in close to Okinawa and began her prelanding bombardment that same day. For the next six days, she fired multiple salvos from her main guns to prepare the way for several [[United States Army|Army]] and Marine divisions to make their amphibious landings on 1 April.

Each evening, ''Texas'' retired from her [[bombardment]] position close to Okinawa, but returned the next morning to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a [[defense-in-depth]] strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several [[kamikaze]] raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. ''Texas'' escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, ''Texas'' remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Report: Okinawa 21 March - 14 May 1945|url=http://battleshiptexas.info/images/Documents/ActionReports/Okinawa.html|date=26 May 1945|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====End of the war====
On 17 May,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; ''Texas'' arrived at [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] in the Philippines and remained there until after the Japanese capitulation on 15 August. She returned to Okinawa toward the end of August and stayed in the Ryukyu Islands until 23 September. On that day, she set a course for the United States with homeward bound troops embarked as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet]]. The battleship delivered her passengers to [[San Pedro, California]] on 15 October, and celebrated [[Navy Day#United States|Navy Day]] there on 27 October before resuming her mission to bring American troops home. She made two round-trip voyages between California and Oahu in November and a third in late December.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt; On 21 January 1946, ''Texas'' departed San Pedro and steamed via the Panama Canal to Norfolk where she arrived on 13 February, and soon began preparations for inactivation. On 18 June, she was placed officially in reserve at [[Baltimore, Maryland]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}}

==Museum ship==
On 17 April 1947, the Battleship ''Texas'' Commission was established by the Texas Legislature to care for the ship. The $225,000 necessary to pay for towing her from Baltimore to San Jacinto was the Commission's first task.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}} On 17 March 1948, ''Texas'' began her journey to her new anchorage along the busy [[Houston Ship Channel]] near the [[San Jacinto Monument]], at [[San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site|San Jacinto State Park]], arriving on 20 April, where she was turned over to the State of Texas the next day to serve as a permanent memorial.{{sfn|Wiper|Flowers|2006}}&lt;ref name=&quot;TXSite&quot; /&gt; The date of 21 April is significant in that it was the date of the decisive 1836 [[Battle of San Jacinto]] that ended the [[Texas Revolution|War for Texas Independence]] and led to the creation of the [[Republic of Texas]], which joined the US as a state in 1845. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 30 April 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;DANFS&quot; /&gt;  ''Texas'' was the first permanent battleship memorial museum in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;TXSite&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Battleship Texas State Historic Site |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/battleship_texas/ |publisher=[[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] |accessdate=2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{USS|Oregon|BB-3}} was displayed as a floating museum in Portland, Oregon from 1925 to 1941 but was scrapped in 1956. When the battleship was presented to the State of Texas, she was commissioned as the flagship of the [[Texas Navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TXSite&quot; /&gt;

===Battleship ''Texas'' Commission===
The funding produced by the Battleship ''Texas'' Commission was not up to the task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;UHJournal2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1968, the wooden main deck of the ship was so rotted that rainwater was leaking through the deck into the interior of the ship and pooling in various compartments. The Commission found that replacing the decayed deck timbers was prohibitively expensive. The solution at the time was to remove the wooden deck and replace it with concrete. The concrete eventually cracked, and again, rainwater began to leak through the main deck into spaces below. In 1971, three local charitable institutions, the Brown Foundation, the [[Moody Foundation]], and the [[Houston Endowment Inc.|Houston Endowment]], together contributed $50,000 to the ship to enable the Commission to sandblast and paint the hull.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}} By this time, newspaper articles reported that ''Texas'' was &quot;under attack&quot; from neglect and insufficient funding.&lt;ref&gt;

===Transfer to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department===
By 1983, concerns with the leadership of the Battleship ''Texas'' Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] (TPWD).&lt;ref name=&quot;UHJournal2&quot; /&gt; The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983, and TPWD assumed operational control the next day. One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship. The survey revealed that the ship's watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing rain water. The architects determined that the ship needed to go to dry dock for major repairs to the hull and to keep rain water from coming through the porous concrete deck.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007}} As part of this plan, serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;UHJournal2&quot; /&gt; After a five-year-long fund-raising campaign, $15 million was collected to dry dock the ship and complete necessary repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;UHJournal1&quot;&gt;

===1988–1990 dry dock period===
On 13 December 1988, ''Texas'' was pulled from her berth with great difficulty over the course of six hours by six large tugboats to begin the {{cvt|56|mi|nmi km}} trip from her berth to [[Todd Pacific Shipyards|Todd Shipyards]] in Galveston, Texas. Once under tow in the Houston Ship Channel she started taking on water, with a serious breach just forward of the engine rooms. The crew had three {{convert|4|in|adj=on}} pumps and two {{convert|2|in|adj=on}} pumps in continuous service to combat the flooding. During the nine-plus hour transit, the ship's draft increased {{cvt|18|to|20|in}} in the stern.

''Texas'' entered the yard's floating drydock at approximately 22:30 on 13 December, at high tide with only {{cvt|6|in}} to spare between her hull and the blocks she would sit on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historic Structures&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; She underwent a 14-month refit that sought to restore the ship to her 1945 condition. While under refit, yard workers sand-blasted paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull. Inside the ship, welders and fabricators replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted-out deck plates. Topside, workers removed the concrete from the main deck and made repairs.

===Dry berth project===
[[File:Monument in Texas.jpg|thumb|Battleship ''Texas'']]
After many years of evaluating a wide range of alternative plans to address the ship's problems (as well as other issues at San Jacinto), TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the [[San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site]], adopted a Master Plan that called for placing ''Texas'' into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters [[Texas constitutional amendment election, 2007|approved]] $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dry-Berth Project Rationale&quot;&gt;

One of the provisions of the bond legislation is the Battleship TEXAS Foundation (BTF), a non-profit support organization, raise $4 million in private funds to supplement the $25 million in bond funds. This will provide a total of $29 million to accomplish the goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dry-Berth Project Rationale&quot; /&gt;

With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF contracted with an independent maritime engineering firm to make a survey of the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dry-Berth Project Rationale&quot; /&gt;

Once it was determined that dry berthing was physically possible for the ship, it was necessary to make a preliminary evaluation of the engineering viable ways in which dry berthing could actually be accomplished. Again, an independent maritime engineering firm was contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives and to present a report of their findings to BTF and to TPWD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dry-Berth Project Rationale&quot; /&gt;

TPWD, acting on the report of the ship's condition, and on the report of the engineering viable dry berth alternatives, and on their internal studies and reports, prepared a progress report which they presented to the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) in late July 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dry-Berth Project Rationale&quot; /&gt;

In March 2009 the LBB released the funds for the dry berthing project to commence.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After a lengthy selection process and fee negotiations, TPWD signed a contract with [[AECOM]], on 26 October 2010, to design and develop the plans for ''Texas''{{'}}s dry-berth. The contract called for AECOM to have its preliminary design completed by spring 2011.{{clarify |reason=Was it? |date=September 2012}} Following a federally mandated environmental assessment for  that is expected to take about two years, the bidding process for construction of the dry berth and temporarily mooring ''Texas'' is expected to begin in mid-2014 with construction to be completed by the summer of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaks===

In June 2010, a leak on the starboard side of the ship caused ''Texas'' to sink two to three feet in her mooring. The leak was precipitated by a burned out pump, which allowed the ship to take on more water than usual. Consequently, a seam separation was pulled below the waterline creating a second leak. Once the leak was discovered, the broken pump was replaced. {{cvt|105000|USgal|lk=on}} of water had to be pumped from the ship. After the leak was above the waterline again, a rag was stuffed in it as a temporary fix.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  On 9 June 2012 (almost two years to the day later), about 30 new leaks, between {{cvt|1|in}} holes and {{cvt|2|sqft|sqm}} gaps, were discovered, ultimately necessitating a three-week closure of the ship to visitors; removal of water and repair of these leaks was complicated by the presence of residual oil in ''Texas''{{'}}s fuel bunkers.&lt;ref&gt;

''Texas'' was the first and oldest of the eight US battleships that became permanent floating museums; the other battleships honored in this way are {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|2}}, {{USS|Alabama|BB-60|2}}, {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|2}}, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}, and {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}.{{sfn|Westwood|1975|p=23}}&lt;ref group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;''Iowa'' opened to the public 7 July 2012 in Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Texas'' is also one of the oldest surviving modern naval ships, having turned 100 years old on 12 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Pomp-emotion-greet-old-sailors-as-Battleship-5311283.php |title=Pomp, emotion greet old sailors as Battleship Texas turns 100 |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |first=Allan |last=Turner |date=12 March 2014 |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio commemorations occur on ''Texas'' yearly during Museum Ship Weekend and [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Day]]. [[Amateur Radio]] operators from the Battleship Texas Amateur Radio Station (BTARS website between 8 and 3 years out of date) operate on those two occasions under the [[Federal Communication Commission]] [[callsign]] NA5DV, similar to the original callsign NADV.&lt;ref&gt;

''Texas'' has appeared in several films prior to and since her retirement. Her cinema debut, though brief, was in the final scene of the 1937 film ''Boy Of The Streets'' starring [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[Maureen O'Conner]].&lt;ref&gt;″Boy Of The Streets″ 1937&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1966 [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] film [[The Sand Pebbles (film)|''The Sand Pebbles'']].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 film [[Pearl Harbor (film)|''Pearl Harbor'']], ''Texas'' stood in for the various battleships that were attacked on Dec. 7, 1941. Some of the ship's interiors were also used to portray the interior of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} later in the film. ''Texas'' also appears as herself in the 2006 films ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''; in both movies the ship is depicted shelling [[Iwo Jima]] in preparation for the Marines' amphibious assault.

''Texas'' was a central plot element in the 1985 science fiction book &quot;The Ayes Of Texas&quot; by Daniel da Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Ayes-Texas-Daniel-Da-Cruz/dp/0345332822&lt;/ref&gt; who served on the Texas in World War II.

''Texas'' is available in the MMO ''[[World of Warships]]'' as a premium battleship alongside her credit-earned sister the ''New York''. Like many &quot;museum ships&quot; in the game, proceeds for purchases of some of these premium ships are donated towards the preservation of the real ships, or towards various foundations.
