[[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] '''Sir Frederick Lewis Maitland''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KCB}} (7 September 1777 – 30 November 1839) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[French Revolutionary War|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]].  He rose to the rank of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|rear admiral]] and held a number of commands.  The most famous event of his career occurred when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] surrendered to him aboard {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}}, marking the final end of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Family and early life==
Maitland was born at Rankeilour, [[Fife]] on 7 September 1777, as the third son of [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Captain)|Frederick Lewis Maitland]] (1730–1786), himself a distinguished naval officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Laughton|Morriss|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other members of Maitland's family were serving officers in the army, including his uncle, General [[Sir Alexander Maitland, 1st Baronet]] and his cousin, General [[Frederick Maitland]] (1763–1848).  Having received an education at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, Maitland followed his father into the Navy, spending his first years aboard the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Martin|1761|6}}, under Captain [[George Duff]], followed by a period aboard the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Southampton|1757|6}} with Robert Forbes.  Whilst aboard ''Southampton'', Maitland was present at the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

==Promotion to lieutenant==
Maitland was promoted to lieutenant on 3 April 1795 and appointed to {{HMS|Andromeda|1784|6}}.  He soon moved to {{HMS|Venerable|1784|6}}, which was then in the [[North Sea]], serving as the [[flagship]] of [[Admiral]] [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown|Adam Duncan]].  Maitland then moved to the Mediterranean in April 1797, joining the fleet under [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]], Lord St Vincent.  Jervis appointed him to the sloop {{HMS|Kingfisher|1782|6}}.  Maitland was part of several successful cruises, and assisted in the capturing of several [[privateer]]s.  He quickly became noted for his courage, and the ships' company subscribed £50 to present him with a sword.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; He did not spend long with ''Kingfisher'' though, as she was wrecked on 3 December 1798 as she was leaving the [[Tagus]].  Maitland had been in temporary command at the time, and received the customary [[court-martial]].  He was honourably acquitted and appointed to serve at [[Gibraltar]] as [[flag lieutenant]] to Lord St Vincent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

==A spell in captivity and first commands==
The combined fleets of France and Spain were retiring from the Mediterranean by mid-1799, and on 7 July St Vincent ordered Maitland to go aboard the [[hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''Penelope'' with orders for her to carry out reconnaissance on the enemy fleets, as St Vincent put it, 'to go, count and dodge them'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; When Maitland arrived however, he found the ''Penelope's'' lieutenant was sick and unable to take command. Maitland took over instead and attempted to follow his orders.  He was apparently hampered by the cowardice and disobedience of the crew of the cutter, and the next day the Spanish [[Action of 7 July 1799|captured]] ''Penelope'' and brought her into [[Cadiz]] as a prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; There Maitland met the Spanish admiral, Mazaredo. Mazeredo discovered that Maitland was Lord St Vincent's flag lieutenant. Being under an obligation to St Vincent, Mazaredo set Maitland free and returned him to Gibraltar without requesting an exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

On his return, St Vincent promoted Maitland to [[commander]] and gave him the sloop {{HMS|Cameleon|1795|6}}, with the promotion being backdated to 14 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; Maitland commanded her off the coast of [[Egypt]], under [[William Sidney Smith|Sir Sidney Smith]] until the signing of the convention of al-'Arish on 24 January 1800. Maitland was sent home overland with dispatches, but quickly returned to his command. He spent the rest of 1800 aboard the ''Cameleon'', before [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]] moved him to the command of the storeship {{HMS|Wassenar|1797|6}}. The ''Wassenar'' was at that time moored at [[Malta]], and had been deemed unfit for service. Maitland was given permission instead to accompany the expedition to Egypt. He was appointed to command the boats that were covering the landings and acquitted himself well. He then moved to support the army's right flank during operations on 13 March, and at the [[Battle of Alexandria]] on 21 March 1801. His service was specially acknowledged by the commanders-in-chief, and he was mentioned in Sidney Smith's report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; These actions caused him to be rewarded with a promotion to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|post rank]], dated to 21 March.  He temporarily took command of the [[74-gun]] {{HMS|Dragon|1798|6}}, but had moved to command [[HMS Carrere (1801)|HMS ''Carrère'']] in August.  He returned with her to England, and she was paid off in October 1802.

==Further action==
[[File:Lady Maitland.jpg|thumb|200px|Maitland's wife, Catherine]]
Maitland married Catherine, the second daughter of Daniel Connor of [[Ballybricken]], [[County Limerick]], [[Ireland]] in April 1804.  They had only one child, which died in infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; By this time Maitland's patron St Vincent had been made [[Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty|first lord of the Admiralty]].  With the outbreak of war he appointed Maitland to the 38-gun [[French frigate Loire (1796)|HMS ''Loire'']], which Maitland sailed off the west coast of France and the north coast of Spain.  Maitland spent three years with the ''Loire'', during which time he captured or destroyed a number of privateers and coastal batteries.  He was involved in a particularly heroic action on 4 June 1805 in Muros Bay, south of [[Cape Finisterre]], for which he received the thanks of the [[City of London]], the freedom of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], and a sword from the Patriotic Fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; He also took part in the capture of the French frigate ''Libre'' on 24 December 1805.  His next command was the 36-gun {{HMS|Emerald|1795|6}}, which he took up in November 1806.  The service was the same as the ''Loire's'', and Maitland continued his successes aboard her.  He was at the [[Battle of the Basque Roads]] in April 1809, but due to the confusion ''Emerald'' was one of the ships that were not sent in until 12 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

==Aboard the ''Bellerophon''==
Maitland was given command of the 58-gun {{HMS|Goliath|1781|6}} between 1813 and 1814, and was sent aboard her to the 
[[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and West Indian stations.  He was appointed to the 98-gun {{HMS|Boyne|1810|6}} in November 1814 and ordered to sail to North America.  Maitland spent the early part of 1815 gathering a fleet of transports and merchants in Cork harbour in preparation for crossing the Atlantic, but found himself unable to set sail due to a succession of strong westerly winds.  Before he could sail, news reached England of Napoleon's escape from [[Elba]] and his [[Hundred Days|return as Emperor of the French]].  Maitland's orders were immediately countermanded, and he was moved to the 74-gun {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}}.  He sailed aboard her from [[Plymouth]] on 24 May, under the orders of Sir [[Henry Hotham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

The ''Bellerophon'' was stationed off [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], watching the French warships in the harbour. Whilst the ''Bellerophon'' was off Rochefort, Napoleon was defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]].  News of this reached Maitland on 28 June, followed by a letter from [[Bordeaux]] that warned him that Napoleon was planning an escape to America from the French Atlantic coast, probably from Bordeaux.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; Maitland believed that Rochefort was the more likely point of escape, but took the precaution of sending two smaller craft to cover other ports, one to Bordeaux, and another to [[Arcachon]].  He kept the ''Bellerophon'' herself off Rochefort. Hotham was aboard {{HMS|Superb|1798|6}} covering [[Quiberon Bay]], whilst a string of British frigates, [[corvette]]s, and [[brig]]s were watching all along the coast.  Hotham told Maitland that should he intercept Bonaparte, he was to take the former emperor to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

==Maitland and Napoleon==
[[File:NapBellerophon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Napoleon and his officers aboard the ''Bellerophon'']]
[[File:Tumbler given to Maitland.jpg|thumb|200px|Tumbler given to Maitland by Napoleon]]
Maitland's instincts proved correct, and Napoleon arrived at Rochefort in early July.  By this time, he was in an untenable position.  He could no longer remain in France without risking arrest; indeed, Prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive.  However, the ''Bellerophon'' and the rest of Hotham's fleet were blocking every port.  He therefore authorised the opening of negotiations with Maitland.  The negotiations opened on 10 July.  Maitland refused to allow Napoleon to sail for America, but offered to take him to England instead.  The negotiations went on for four days, but eventually Napoleon acquiesced.  He surrendered to Maitland on 15 July and embarked on the ''Bellerophon'' with his staff and servants.{{sfn|Cordingly|2004|p=254}}

Maitland placed his cabin at the former emperor's disposal and sailed the ''Bellerophon'' to England. She reached [[Torbay]] on 24 July, but was ordered to [[Plymouth]], whilst a decision was made by the government over Bonaparte's fate.  She sailed again on 4 August and whilst off [[Berry Head]] on 7 August, Napoleon and his staff were removed to {{HMS|Northumberland|1798|6}}, which conveyed him to his final exile on [[Saint Helena]].  Maitland later wrote a detailed narrative of Bonaparte's time on the ''Bellerophon'', which he subsequently published in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{gutenberg|bullet=none|no=28934|name=The Surrender of Napoleon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal duties and rise to rear admiral==
Maitland took command of the 74-gun {{HMS|Vengeur|1810|6}} in October 1818, and in 1819 sailed her to South America.  He took [[Lord George Beresford]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to [[Lisbon]] in 1820, and then returned to the Mediterranean. He then carried [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand I]], king of the [[Two Sicilies]] from [[Naples]] to [[Livorno]].  The passage was rough and lasted seven days, but they arrived safely on 20 December.  As a token of gratitude the king invested Maitland with the insignia of a knight commander of the [[Order of Saint Ferdinand and of Merit|Order of St Ferdinand and Merit]], and presented him with his portrait, set with diamonds, in a gold box.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; Maitland then returned to England, and was appointed to command the 74-gun {{HMS|Genoa|1814|6}}, the [[guardship]] at [[Portsmouth]].  He spent three years aboard her, leaving her in August 1823.  He commanded {{HMS|Wellesley|1815|6}} in the Mediterranean between 1827 and 1830, and was promoted to [[Rear Admiral of the Blue]] on 22 July 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=18709|startpage=1540|endpage=1541|date=23 July 1830|accessdate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rear Admiral of the Red on 10 January 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=19456|startpage=70|date=10 January 1837|accessdate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) on the restructuring of the Order in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=17061|startpage=1877|date=16 September 1815|accessdate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 17 November 1830 he was advanced to Knight Commander (KCB).&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=18779|startpage=362|date=25 February 1831|accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of the County of Fife on 5 March 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=18793|startpage=716|date=15 April 1831|accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian service==
He was admiral superintendent of the [[HMNB Portsmouth|dockyard at Portsmouth]] between 1832 and 1837.  He was appointed [[commander-in-chief]] in the [[East Indies and China Station]] in July 1837, and raised his flag in the ''Wellesley'' again.  He co-operated with the army during its advance from [[Bombay]] towards [[Afghanistan]] in February 1839, and captured the town and fort of [[Karachi]], going on to oversee the landing of troops and supplies.  News then reached him of disturbances at [[Bushehr]], so he set off to investigate.  He landed [[Royal Marines|Marines]] and evacuated the [[Resident (title)|resident]] and his staff, without punishing the rioters.  The Anglo-Indian press subsequently criticised this action as being injudiciously lenient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
Maitland died on 30 November 1839 whilst at sea on board the ''Wellesley'', off Bombay. He was buried at Bombay. A monument was later erected by subscription to his memory in the [[St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai|cathedral]]. His wife, Lady Maitland, died in 1865 at [[Lindores]], Fife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;
