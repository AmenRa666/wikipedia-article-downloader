==Renaming==
Seems a shame to leave the Ostfriesland under USS when they only had it for a year. [[User:GraemeLeggett|GraemeLeggett]] 12:37, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Progressive flooding and sinking==
What is meant by progressive flooding? Were the ship's hatches left open or were all interior and exterior hatches secured? [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] 14:37, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

==Combat record==
Did SMS Ostfriesland Sink any enemy ships while she was commisioned with Germany.--[[Special:Contributions/121.209.65.203|121.209.65.203]] ([[User talk:121.209.65.203|talk]]) 13:28, 22 March 2008 (UTC)ps

:As far as I can tell, no she did not. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 13:36, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

== Ambiguity ==

In the section about using the ship for bombing tests:
&quot;Carefully edited footage of the sinking of the Ostfriesland was made public after the experimental attack and was highly influential on US Naval decision makers.[citation needed]&quot;

Not only is a citation needed, but this sentence is ambiguous; did it influence people into believing that bombing was effective OR ineffective against the ship?
--[[User:Bobbozzo|Bobbozzo]] ([[User talk:Bobbozzo|talk]]) 01:52, 20 November 2009 (UTC)

:I am unable to answer your question, but ''am'' able to delete the fact-challenged sentence. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 16:45, 20 November 2009 (UTC)

== What? ==

&quot;Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow.[53] On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships. In the span of a few hours, ten battleships and five battlecruisers sank in the shallow waters of Scapa Flow.[55] KzS Karl Windm√ºller served as Ostfriesland's final commander,[3] until she was stricken from the navy list on 5 November 1919. She was then surrendered to the Allies as &quot;H&quot;. The ship remained in Germany until 7 April 1920, when a German crew took her to Rosyth. She was ceded to the United States as war reparations, and on 9 April an American crew arrived to bring her to the US.[50]&quot;

This passage is completely confusing. Was the Ostfriesland at Scapa? If not, why is any of this mentioned in the same paragraph (or at all)? If so, how did she end up back in Germany? Generally, what do the two halfs of this paragraph have to do with each other, if anything?

[[User:Maury Markowitz|Maury Markowitz]] ([[User talk:Maury Markowitz|talk]]) 10:39, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
:No, she wasn't at Scapa - it's there because the ''Helgoland'' and ''Nassau'' class ships were surrendered after the scuttling as replacements for the ships that were lost. That should be clearer now. Thanks. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 12:34, 27 May 2014 (UTC)</text>
