[[File:Salle Assemblee nationale Quebec.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The National Assembly of Quebec, formerly the Parliament of Lower Canada, first convened by Sir Alured Clarke in December 1792 (the painting in the background depicts one of the first sittings of the Parliament of Lower Canada in January 1793)]]
[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''Sir Alured Clarke''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCB}} (24 November 1744 &amp;ndash; 16 September 1832) was a [[British army]] officer. He took charge of all British troops in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in May 1780 and was then deployed to [[Philadelphia]] to supervise the evacuation of British [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at the closing stages of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He went on to be [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Governor of Jamaica]] and then [[List of lieutenant governors of Quebec|lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada]] in which role he had responsibility for implementing the [[Constitutional Act 1791]]. He was then sent to India where he became Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]], then briefly [[Governor-General of India]] and finally [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief of India]] during the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]].

==Military career==
Born the son of [[Charles Clarke (judge)|Charles Clarke]] (c.1702–1750) and Jane Clarke (née Mullins),&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5485|title=Clarke, Alured|first=Robert|last=Brown|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alured Clarke was educated at [[Eton College]] and was commissioned as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot|50th Regiment of Foot]] on 20 March 1759.&lt;ref name=heath89&gt;Heathcote, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he served in [[Germany]] under the [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby|Marquess of Granby]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant]] in the 50th Regiment of Foot on 10 May 1760 and to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Regiment of Foot]] on 30 December 1763, he transferred to the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers|5th Regiment of Foot]], stationed in [[Ireland]], in January 1767 and was then promoted to [[major]] in the [[54th (West Norfolk) Regiment of Foot|54th Regiment of Foot]] in 1771.&lt;ref name=heath89/&gt;

Promoted to [[lieutenant-colonel]] and given the command of the [[Royal Fusiliers|7th Regiment of Foot]], serving in America, on 13 May 1777,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=11770|supp=|startpage=2|date=13 May 1777|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke took charge of all British troops in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in May 1780 and, having been promoted to [[colonel]] on 16 May 1782, he was then deployed to [[Philadelphia]] to supervise the evacuation of British [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in May 1783.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Clarke became [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Governor of Jamaica]] in Summer 1784.&lt;ref name=heath89/&gt; Promoted to [[major-general]] on 1 May 1790,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13196|supp=|startpage=258|date=27 April 1790|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he acquitted himself well enough as Governor of Jamaica that he was recommended to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] as a suitable person to become [[List of lieutenant governors of Quebec|lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada]] in October 1790.&lt;ref name=cdb&gt;{{Cite DCB|2804}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of the [[List of Governors General of Canada|Governor]], who had departed for England in August 1791, he took command of British forces and set about implementing the [[Constitutional Act 1791]] which involved settling geographical boundaries (between [[Lower Canada]] and the United States and between Lower Canada and the rest of Canada), offering land to settlers and convening the first [[National Assembly of Quebec|legislature of the Province]].&lt;ref name=cdb/&gt; Clarke served as lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada until Summer 1793, when the Governor returned to Canada and Clarke could return to England.&lt;ref name=heath89/&gt;

Clarke was sent to India in 1795 with instructions to interrupt his voyage at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] where he and his force defeated a Dutch army at [[Wynberg, Cape Town|Wynberg]] on 16 September 1795 and then spent the next two months on arranging administrative matters before proceeding to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15434|supp=|startpage=1465|date=8 December 1801|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival in India in early 1796 he became Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]]. He was promoted to the local rank of [[lieutenant-general]] on 3 May 1796 and, having been appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 14 January 1797, he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general on 4 February 1797.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13976|supp=|startpage=106|date=31 January 1797|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became acting [[Governor-General of India]] in March 1798 (in which capacity he also served as acting Commander-in-Chief of the [[Bengal Army]]) and then became [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] in May 1798.&lt;ref name=heath89/&gt; Although Clarke was not present at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Siege of Seringapatam]] in April 1799, his army was victorious thereby successfully concluding the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He returned to England in March 1801 and was promoted to full [[general]] on 11 May 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15478|supp=|startpage=466|date=8 May 1802|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a re-organisation of the order, he was advanced to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] on 4 January 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=16972|supp=|startpage=18|date=4 January 1815|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke also served as honorary colonel of 1st Battalion [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|60th Royal American Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13324|supp=|startpage=399|date=9 July 1791|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry)|68th Regiment of Foot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13693|supp=|startpage=828|date=12 August 1794|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers|5th Regiment of Foot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13718|supp=|startpage=1076|date=28 October 1794|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then of the [[Royal Fusiliers|7th Regiment of Foot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=15400|supp=|startpage=1035|date=22 August 1801|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In retirement Clare lived at Mansfield Street in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/sir-alured-clarke-manuscript-material-1-item-1819/oclc/608094147|title=Sir Alured Clarke manuscript material : 1 item, 1819|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on the occasion of the [[coronation]] of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] on 22 July 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=18709|supp=|startpage=1534|date=23 July 1830|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Llangollen]] in [[Wales]] on 16 September 1832 while visiting his niece.&lt;ref name=heath90&gt;Heathcote, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
