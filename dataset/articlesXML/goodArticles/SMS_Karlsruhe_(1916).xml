'''SMS ''Karlsruhe''''' was a [[light cruiser]] of the {{sclass-|Königsberg|cruiser (1915)|4}}, built for the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) during [[World War I]]. She was named after the earlier {{SMS|Karlsruhe|1912|2}}, which had sunk in November 1914, from an accidental explosion. The new cruiser was laid down in 1914 at the ''[[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Kaiserliche Werft]]'' shipyard in [[Kiel]], launched in January 1916, and commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in November 1916. Armed with eight [[15 cm SK L/45|15&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45]] guns, the ship had a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn|abbr=on}}.

She saw relatively limited service during the war, due to her commissioning late in the conflict. She was present during a brief engagement with British light forces in August 1917, though she did not actively participate in the battle. She joined the large task force assigned to [[Operation Albion]] in October 1917, but did not see significant action during that operation either. She was assigned to what was to have been the final sortie of the [[High Seas Fleet]] in the closing days of the war, but a large-scale mutiny in significant parts of the fleet forced the cancellation of the plan. ''Karlsruhe'' was interned in [[Scapa Flow]] after the end of the war, and [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled there]] on 21 June 1919. Unlike most of the other ships sunk there, her wreck was never raised.

==Construction==
{{main|Königsberg-class cruiser (1915)}}
''Karlsruhe'' was ordered under the contract name &quot;Ersatz {{SMS|Niobe|1899|2}}&quot; and was laid down at the ''[[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Kaiserliche Werft]]'' shipyard in [[Kiel]] in 1915. She was launched on 31 January 1916, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 15 November 1916. The ship was {{convert|151.4|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.2|m|abbr=on|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.96|m|abbr=on|ftin}} forward. She displaced {{convert|7125|MT|LT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of [[steam turbine]]s powered by ten coal-fired and two oil-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s. These provided a top speed of {{convert|27.5|kn|lk=in}} and a range of {{convert|4850|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=G113&gt;Gröner, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with eight [[15 cm SK L/45|15&amp;nbsp;cm SK L/45]] guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were arranged in a [[superfire|super-firing pair]] aft.&lt;ref name=C162&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; They were supplied with 1,040 rounds of ammunition, for 130 shells per gun. ''Karlsruhe'' also carried two {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} L/45 anti-aircraft guns mounted on the [[wikt:centerline|centerline]] astern of the funnels. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s with eight torpedoes in deck-mounted swivel launchers [[amidships]]. She also carried 200 [[naval mine|mines]]. The ship was protected by a waterline [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with 60&amp;nbsp;mm thick armor plate.&lt;ref name=G113/&gt;

==Service history==
On 16 August 1917, ''Karlsruhe'' participated in a mine-sweeping operation in the North Sea. The minesweepers were clearing Route Yellow, one of the channels in the minefields used by [[U-boat]]s to leave and return to port. ''Karlsruhe'' was joined by the cruiser {{SMS|Frankfurt}} and three [[torpedo boat]]s. At 12:55, lookouts on one of the minesweepers spotted a British squadron of three light cruisers and sixteen [[destroyer]]s approaching.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The minesweepers fled south under cover of smoke screens, after which the British broke off the attack. ''Karlsruhe'' and the rest of the escort failed to come to their aid, however, and the commander of the operation was subsequently relieved of command.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The ''Admiralstab'' (Navy High Command) planned [[Operation Albion]] to seize the Baltic island of [[Saaremaa|Ösel]], and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the [[Sõrve Peninsula|Sworbe Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and [[Muhu|Moon]] Islands; the primary naval component comprised the [[flagship]], the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Moltke||2}}, along with the III and IV&amp;nbsp;Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karlsruhe'' and the rest of the [[II Scouting Group]] provided the cruiser screen for the task force.&lt;ref name=B127&gt;Barrett, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when ''Moltke'' and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while the IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the [[Sworbe Peninsula]] on Ösel.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; On 18&amp;ndash;19 October, ''Karlsruhe'' and the rest of the II Scouting Group covered [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] operating off the island of [[Hiiumaa|Dagö]], but due to an insufficient number of minesweepers and bad weather, the operation was postponed.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 October, the islands were under German control and the Russian naval forces had either been destroyed or forced to withdraw. The ''[[Admiralstab]]'' then ordered the naval component to return to the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1918, ''Karlsruhe'' and the rest of the II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy. ''Karlsruhe'', {{SMS|Nürnberg|1916|2}}, and {{SMS|Graudenz||2}} were to bombard targets in [[Flanders]] while {{SMS|Pillau||2}}, {{SMS|Cöln|1916|2}}, {{SMS|Dresden|1917|2}}, and {{SMS|Königsberg|1915|2}} were to attack merchant shipping in the [[Thames estuary]], to draw out the British [[Grand Fleet]].&lt;ref name=W116&gt;Woodward, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Admirals [[Reinhard Scheer]] and [[Franz von Hipper]] intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to secure a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on {{SMS|Thüringen||2}} and then on several other battleships [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, pp. 281–282&lt;/ref&gt; The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.&lt;ref name=T282&gt;Tarrant, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow.&lt;ref name=T282/&gt; ''Karlsruhe'' was among the ships interned.&lt;ref name=G113/&gt; The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships;&lt;ref name=H256&gt;Herwig, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karlsruhe'' sank at 15:50. She was never raised for scrapping. The rights to her wreck were sold in 1962.&lt;ref name=G113/&gt;
