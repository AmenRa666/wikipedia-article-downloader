[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] '''Edward Charles Ingouville-Williams''' [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (13 December 1861 – 22 July 1916) was a [[British Army]] officer of the First World War. He was killed in action while serving as commander of the [[34th Division (United Kingdom)|34th Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;worcester&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcestershireregiment.com/wr.php?main=inc/o_ingouville_williams|title=Major-General Edward Charles Ingouville-Williams, C.B., D.S.O.|publisher=[[Worcester Regiment]]|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Ingouville-Williams was born in [[Purbrook]], Hampshire, to General Sir [[John William Collman Williams]], KCB, JP, and Georgiana Isabella, the daughter of a wealthy landowner.&lt;ref name=&quot;worcester&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/74559/INGOUVILLE-WILLIAMS,%20EDWARD%20CHARLES|title=INGOUVILLE-WILLIAMS, EDWARD CHARLES|publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[East Kent Regiment]] (3rd Regiment of Foot; known as &quot;the Buffs&quot;) on 23 April 1881. He participated in the [[Nile Expedition]] (1884–1885) and served as [[adjutant]] to the regiment from 1894 to 1898 after promotion to [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. He was seconded to the [[Egyptian Army]] in 1898 and 1899, during which time he took part in the [[Battle of Atbara]] and the [[Battle of Khartoum]], for which he was [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;worcester&quot;/&gt;

From 1899 to 1902, he served under [[Sir Charles Warren]] in the [[Second Boer War]]. He was present at the [[Relief of Ladysmith]] and was twice mentioned in despatches during the war. His brother George, a major in the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]] was killed in action during the conflict. By the end of the war, he had been awarded the [[Queen's South Africa Medal]] [[King's South Africa Medal]], and the [[Distinguished Service Order]], and had been promoted to local [[lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]]. He changed his name to Ingouville-Williams in 1902, apparently in memory of his mother, whose maiden name was Ingouville.&lt;ref name=&quot;worcester&quot;/&gt;

In 1903, Ingouville-Williams was transferred to command 2nd Battalion, the [[Worcestershire Regiment]], with whom he spent much of the following five years in India. After completing his tour as a battalion commander, he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1910 and went on to serve as Commandant of the School of Mounted Infantry and then to command the [[16th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Infantry Brigade]] from 1912 until the outbreak of the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;worcester&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28388|supp=yes|startpage=4476|date=24 June 1910|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
Ingouville-Williams (now a [[Brigadier general#United Kingdom|brigadier-general]]) and his brigade were ordered to France on the outbreak of war, and he remained in command of the 16th until 1915, when he was promoted to major-general and sent to command the newly formed [[34th Division (United Kingdom)|34th Division]]. After training, he took the 34th to the Western Front in January 1916 and led the division at the beginning of the [[Battle of the Somme]] in summer 1916. He earned another four mentions in despatches during the war. On 22 July, Ingouville-Williams and his [[aide-de-camp]] personally inspected the ground on which the division was expected to fight the following week. On his way back, he was caught in an artillery barrage and was killed instantly after being struck by a piece of shrapnel. He was buried at [[Warloy-Baillon]] Communal Cemetery extension in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;worcester&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespear|first=Lieutenant Colonel J|year=1921|title=The Thirty-Fourth Division, 1915–1919|publisher=H.
