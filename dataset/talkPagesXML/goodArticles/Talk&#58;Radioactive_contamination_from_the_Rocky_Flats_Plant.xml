== Lede section edits ==

I have edited the lede section for accuracy, and am adding this to the talk page due to VQuaker's unsubstantiated wholesale removal of my edits.  

The latter part of the lede has most of my attention, partly because it was flat-out incorrect:  the Rocky Flats plant site is not part of the new &quot;Refuge,&quot; which is actually a perimeter area.  Moreover, the refuge is off-limits to humans due to its contamination, much of which is underground.  

Am unsure as to what agenda VQuaker is pushing, but in my life I have seen many times that the one who first points the finger (VQuaker:  &quot;POV&quot;, etc.) is usually the culprit.

Cheers,

P.S.  To hold out an olive branch to the clearly emotional VQuaker:  let's take the edits one at a time, please, and stick to cited facts in the process.  That might prove helpful.  --[[Special:Contributions/2605:6000:630E:E300:68E8:3BAC:1F55:D2C0|2605:6000:630E:E300:68E8:3BAC:1F55:D2C0]] ([[User talk:2605:6000:630E:E300:68E8:3BAC:1F55:D2C0|talk]]) 00:59, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

:The peripheral outer unit was still part of the plant, it just didn't have buildings on it. We accurately summarize this in the lede and go into more detail in the body of the article already, including noting that the DOE still manages the substantially contaminated central operable unit. Please read [[WP:AGF]]. The refuge is off limits due to funding, not contamination despite what some activists believe. We already talk about the contamination of Denver in the lede and your addition was not in improvement - particularly, we don't need to cite a general interest mag (''The Atlantic'') when we already have Martel's and Johnson's published papers.

::This statement:  &quot;The land formerly occupied by the plant is now the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge.&quot; is rubbish.  The plant was in a relatively small area, and is the area that the DOE now manages.  And the &quot;refuge&quot; does have  plutonium contamination underground.  As the original creator of this article, it's fair to say that I am also more than a bit aware of the published papers it cites.  --[[Special:Contributions/2605:6000:630E:E300:7C78:87E0:28B3:B881|2605:6000:630E:E300:7C78:87E0:28B3:B881]] ([[User talk:2605:6000:630E:E300:7C78:87E0:28B3:B881|talk]]) 04:36, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

:::Irrelevant. See [[WP:OWN]]. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 07:51, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

:::It's every bit as relevant as your humorously citing Martel and Johnson, whom I first added to the page.  Address the facts I've added, please...and stop deleting them. --[[Special:Contributions/2605:6000:630E:E300:A57D:FA9B:80B6:52EA|2605:6000:630E:E300:A57D:FA9B:80B6:52EA]] ([[User talk:2605:6000:630E:E300:A57D:FA9B:80B6:52EA|talk]]) 15:17, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

::::A statement doesn't become fact just because you say so. The lede needs to summarize the body. Material added needs to be [[WP:NPOV|neutral]], [[WP:V|verifiable]], and based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. You need to get [[WP:CON|consensus]] for contested changes rather than edit warring. You haven't addressed any of this in your responses so far. Do you think getting a [[WP:3O|third opinion]] would be helpful in this case? [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 17:21, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

:::::The big facts:  parts of Denver and the surrounding area were contaminated by plutonium, and the &quot;Wildlife Refuge&quot; does not include the original plant site, but rather encompasses the perimeter area which was somewhat less contaminated by plutonium and other radionuclides. The Johnson material, which I included when originating this article, supports this and more.  You seem to be emotionally tied to some sort of ego-centric outcome that frankly escapes me in terms of refuting any facts I've presented...including, very much, Johnson.  If your real issue is style, that's no justification for deleting my edits in their entirety.  You're hardly the final arbiter for style on an article that you are simply one more contributor to.  --[[Special:Contributions/2602:306:BC24:8C00:7C9E:3940:E204:4980|2602:306:BC24:8C00:7C9E:3940:E204:4980]] ([[User talk:2602:306:BC24:8C00:7C9E:3940:E204:4980|talk]]) 04:57, 7 March 2016 (UTC)

:::::P.S.  To avoid edit warring in the future, may I suggest that you not delete entire sets of edits by authors you haven't even communicated with.  That's edit warring at the outset. Not a good quality to embrace. --[[Special:Contributions/2602:306:BC24:8C00:7C9E:3940:E204:4980|2602:306:BC24:8C00:7C9E:3940:E204:4980]] ([[User talk:2602:306:BC24:8C00:7C9E:3940:E204:4980|talk]]) 04:59, 7 March 2016 (UTC)

::::::You didn't answer my question or address any of the issues I brought up. A statement doesn't become fact just because you say so. You are presupposing a conclusion and ignoring the sources. When you do that you are not editing an encyclopedia; you are publishing your opinion. This is not a blog or forum for your opinions. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 05:55, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
::::::PS no, I [[WP:BRD|reverted a proposed change]], which is a [[WP:STATUSQUO|a normal part of the editing process]]. I also only reverted the parts that were problematic (which admittedly was almost all in this case). It became edit warring when you attempted to &quot;force it through&quot; rather than seeking [[WP:CON|consensus]] here.
