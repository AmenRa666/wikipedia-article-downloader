==Comments in the original story moved here:==

[editor's note:  I'm unable to verify the info about these &quot;tenth troops&quot;, or even whether they should be called the National Guard.  help?] 

(translator's note: not sure what that is so I kept it intact, if someone more versed in history could translate, that would be great!)(&quot;Dong Tiao Nei Ge&quot;: [Tojo Hideki]'s cabinet) 

(translator: not sure--simply faking?)(&quot;wang wei&quot;: Japanese puppet Central China government based in Nanjing, led by Wang Jingwei)

(translator: name of a treaty, not sure what the English name for it is) agreement and return to the pre-war situation of [[1931]].

== I hope someone fix this eventually ==

I hope someone fix this article eventually; none of this stuff can be true --- 5 million casualties?? and then a second wave of 10 million Japanese troops?? I don't even believe part about Japan transferring troops to China in 1944 is true because by then, the Japanese empire is crumbling. If there is any transfer, it would be transferring troops from China and Korea to the home islands to defend against an expected US attack.

I'm slowly knocking it into shape but I haven't got much info. Very little seems to be on the web about the sino-japanese war in 1944. It's also difficult to ascertain the truth because the Chinese Nationalist (KMT) and Communists (CCP) have their own agendas - if anyone has any info they could let me know...

== Major cleanup ==

This article needs a major cleanup. I'm don't have a wikipeida account, so I can't do it myself. Firstly, the grammar needs some work. It looks like it's fresh out of some translator software, and some parts are particularly hard to understand.  Secondly, the infobox says it was a Chinese victory.  Tell me if I'm wrong, but if you read the article, it implies it was a very costly, maybe even pyhrric Japanese victory. It says the Japanese captured the city and a top Chinese general named Zhang De-neng. From what I see, the Japanese completed their objectives in the end, while at a high cost. The Chinese, while able to maintain guerilla forces in the countryside, ultimatly failed to hold the city.  I don't know about anyone else, but that does NOT constitue a Chinese victory to me. It does say in the aftermath that the Japanese refused any plans to take more Chinese territory, that the Wang Jiwei government's priviliges were useless, and during the final Japanese push to Zhijiang and the Japanese troops being wiped out by the Chinese National Guard, etc. but those events happened AFTER the conclusion of this battle and therefore irrelevant to the result of the battle.  And lastly, it says that this battle was &quot;This was also the only battle where Japanese casualties was higher than the Chinese during the entire war&quot;. But in the infobox, it puts Japanese casualties at 25000, with 20,000 of those at Hengyang. But the Chinese casualties are put at 67,000. If there are an unknown number of other Japanese casualties, then it should say so in the infobox, as it is very misleading otherwise. If someone could adress these issues, that would be great. Another source might be helpful, too.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.91.92.166|66.91.92.166]] ([[User talk:66.91.92.166|talk]]) 08:36, 3 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

* If I am not mistaken, Zhang De-neng and Fang Xianjue were both Corp commanders. Maybe their forces were understrength but they commanded several division commanders at that time. [[User:Chcyang|Chcyang]] ([[User talk:Chcyang|talk]]) 09:42, 19 September 2009 (UTC)</text>
