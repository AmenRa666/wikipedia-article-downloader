==Development==

[[File:J-20s.jpg|thumb|The two Chengdu J-20s that made its first public appearance at Airshow China 2016]]
===Origins===
The [[J-XX]] program was started in the late 1990s. A proposal from [[Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group|Chengdu Aerospace Corporation]], designated Project 718, won the PLAAF endorsement following a 2008 competition against a Shenyang proposal that was larger than the J-20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.warchina.com/news/ent/2010-11-05/124805.html | date = 2010-11-05 |title=中国空军选定下一代战机由611所方案胜出 | language = zh | work = War China |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a senior PLAAF official revealed that the first flight was expected in 2010–11, with an service entry date by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-248553676.html|title=Chinese Fifth Generation Fighter Unveiled|work=SP's Aviation|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=14 June 2015|subscription=yes|via= [[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2010, the first J-20 prototype underwent high speed [[taxiing]] tests outside the [[Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Australian Aviation&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2010/12/chinese-stealth-fighter-unveiled/ |title=Chinese Stealth Fighter Unveiled?|work=Australian Aviation |date= 30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/video/hub-extra-chinese-stealth-fighter-jet-video/665194B3-77F1-435F-9D9D-83E1C63AE052.html &quot;Video: Chinese Stealth Fighter.&quot;] ''Wall Street Journal''.  Retrieved 10 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight testing===
On 11 January 2011, the J-20 made its first flight, lasting about 15 minutes, with a [[Chengdu J-10S]] serving as the [[chase aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704428004576075042571461586.html |title=Chinese Stealth Fighter Makes First Test Flight |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wall|first= Robert |url= http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3Afea956a2-94a3-4110-a4d2-880ae0b7d3bd |title=J-20 Completes First Flight|work=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the successful flight, a ceremony was held, attended by the pilot, Li Gang, Chief Designer Yang Wei and General Li Andong, Deputy-Director of General Armaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforceworld.com/pla/j20-stealth-fighter-first-flight-celebration.htm &quot;Chinese J-20 Fighter First Flight Ceremony.&quot;] ''AirForceWorld.com''.

On 16 January 2014, a J-20 prototype was revealed, showing a new intake and stealth coating, as well as redesigned vertical stabilizers, and an [[Electro-Optical Targeting System]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Medium&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://medium.com/war-is-boring/6b8ebf775795 |title=China’s Latest Stealth Fighter Prototype Has, Well, Actual Stealth Features. |last1=Axe |first1=David |website=medium.com |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theaviationist.com/2014/02/21/j-20-2011-ready/ &quot;Upgraded, third prototype.&quot;] ''The Aviationist'', 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evfbbOgJ9cY &quot;J-20 Prototype 2011 Taxi Test.&quot;] ''Youtube''. Retrieved 24 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This particular aircraft, numbered '2011', performed its maiden flight on 1 March 2014 and is said to represent the initial pre-serial standard. By the end of 2014, three more pre-serial prototypes were flown: number '2012' on 26 July 2014, number '2013' on 29 November 2014 and finally number '2015' on 19 December 2014.

On 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked '2016', begun testing. It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently changed DSI bumps on the intakes, which save weight, complexity and radar signature. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than on its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian [[AL-31]] or Chinese [[Shenyang WS-10]] turbofan engines, though, by 2020 the J-20 is planned to use the 18-19 ton [[WS-15]] engine, enabling the jet to super-cruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards facing radars or electronic jamming equipment. The fuselage extends almost entirely up to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its &quot;2014&quot; and &quot;2015&quot; predecessors, the J-20's fuselage contains more of engine's surface area inside the stealthy fuselage, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.popsci.com/stealthier-stealth-seventh-upgraded-chinese-stealth-fighter-prototype-aims-to-take-flight | title = Stealthier stealth: seventh upgraded Chinese stealth fighter prototype aims to take flight | newspaper = Popular sciende}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered '2017', took to the sky. The most significant change in the new prototype is the reshaped cockpit canopy, which provides the pilot with greater visibility. The lack of other design changes suggest that &quot;2017&quot; is very close to the final J-20 production configuration. Since '2017' is likely the last J-20 prototype, low rate initial production of the J-20 is likely to begin in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/2017-prototype-heralds-end-an-era-for-j-20-fighter-jet-testing-start-another-era&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the design of J-20 is already mature and will not directly use the 117S engine.&lt;ref name= &quot;mil.news.sina.com.cn&quot;&gt;{{Citation |contribution = Mil |title = News |publisher = Sina |date = 25 November 2015 |contribution-url = http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/2015-11-25/0848844774.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
In late December 2015, a new J-20 numbered 2101 was spotted; it is believed to be the low rate initial production (LRIP) version of the aircraft.&lt;ref name= &quot;ifeng20151226&quot;&gt;{{cite web | language = zh |url= http://news.ifeng.com/a/20151226/46845415_0.shtml |title= 新歼-20照片曝光 黄皮机身编号2101或已开始量产 |publisher= Ifeng |date=26 December 2015 |accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That aircraft performed its maiden flight on 18 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://plarealtalk.com/2016/01/27/j-20-first-lrip-airframe-maiden-flight-serial-number-2101/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
[[File:J-20_2011.jpg|thumb|Chengdu J-20 side view]]
[[File:Chengdu J-20.svg|thumb|Chengdu J-20 prototype]]
The J-20 has a long and wide [[fuselage]], with the chiseled [[Nose cone|nose section]] and a [[bubble canopy|frameless canopy]] resembling that of the F-22 Raptor. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by [[Leading-edge extension|leading edge extensions]] merging into [[delta wing]] with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section features twin, outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional round engine exhausts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlo Kopp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.digitalglobe.com/lp/worldviewreport/worldviewreport-vol15.html &quot;Worldview Report | Vol. 14&quot;] {{wayback|url=http://learn.digitalglobe.com/lp/worldviewreport/worldviewreport-vol15.html |date=20130104005858 |df=y }} ''digitalglobe.com'' 2 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

One important design criterion for the J-20 describes [[Relaxed stability|high instability]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Song Wecong1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Translation of J-20 Article by Dr. Song Wencong&quot; /&gt; This requires sustained pitch authority at a high angle of attack, in which a conventional tail-plane would lose effectiveness due to [[Stall (aerodynamics)|stalling]]. On the other hand, a canard can deflect opposite to the angle of attack, avoiding stall and thereby maintaining control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/EP0202020A1?cl=en &quot;Super Agile aircraft and method of flying it in supernormal flight.&quot;] ''Google Patents''. Retrieved 20 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A canard design is also known to provide good supersonic performance, excellent supersonic and transonic turn performance, and improved short-field landing performance compared to the conventional delta wing design.&lt;ref&gt;Probert, B.

Retrieved: 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leading edge extension]]s and [[Lifting body|body lift]] are incorporated to enhance performance in a canard layout. This combination is said by the designer to generate 1.2 times the lift of an ordinary canard delta, and 1.8 times more lift than an equivalent sized pure delta configuration. The designer claims such a combination allows the use of a smaller wing, reducing supersonic drag without compromising transonic lift-to-drag characteristics that are crucial to the aircraft's turn performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Song Wecong1&quot;&gt;[http://ishare.iask.sina.com.cn/f/23321633.html &quot;一种小展弦比高升力飞机的气动布局研究 A High Lift Low-Aspect Ratio Aerodynamic Configuration&quot;] ''sina.com'' Retrieved 20 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Translation of J-20 Article by Dr. Song Wencong&quot;&gt;[http://www.defence.pk/forums/chinese-defence/165231-translation-j-20-article-dr-song-wencong.html &quot;Translation of article 一种小展弦比高升力飞机的气动布局研究&quot;] ''http://www.defence.pk''{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 20 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wenku.baidu.com/view/1aae34a6f524ccbff12184b3.html &quot;一种小展弦比高升力飞机的气动布局研究 A High Lift Low-Aspect Ratio Aerodynamic Configuration&quot;] ''baidu.com'' Retrieved 20 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
The main weapon bay is capable of housing both short and long-range [[air-to-air missile]]s (AAM) ([[PL-9]], [[PL-12]]C/D &amp;PL15 - [[PL-21]]).

Two smaller lateral weapon bays behind the air inlets are intended for short-range AAMs (PL-9).
