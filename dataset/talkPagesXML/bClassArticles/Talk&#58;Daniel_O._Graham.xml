==Book dedication==
Would this be appropriate in the History section?

[[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]] dedicated his 1985 novel [[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]] to
Graham and eight others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Heinlein, Robert A | title=The Cat Who Walks Through Walls | publisher=New England Library | year=1986 | id=ISBN 0-450-39315-1}}

==Book dedication==

:It would be. What does &quot;in part&quot; mean? Did he dedicate part of the book to him? Or was the dedication to several people? And who is &quot;Ing&quot;? [[Special:Contributions/Will_Beback| ·:· ]][[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] [[User talk:Will Beback|·:·]] 01:51, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

Sorry, my bad. Ing was one of the others in the dedication, which is reproduced in full below

:To

::Jerry and Larry and Harry
::Dean and Dan and Jim
::Poul and Buz and Sarge
::(''Men to have at your back'')
:::R.A.H.

Dan is Daniel O. Graham according to Jane Davitt &amp; Tim Morgan at http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/dedications.html The rest (Jerry, Larry et al) can be found there as well.

*Great. Rather than saying &quot;dedicated in part&quot; perhaps it'd be clearer to say, &quot;...dedicated to Graham and five others.&quot; [[Special:Contributions/Will_Beback| ·:· ]][[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] [[User talk:Will Beback|·:·]] 16:41, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

:OK done. Could you check the format for the website reference for me? Thanks for helping an old newbie! [[User:JustJimWillDo|JustJimWillDo]] ([[User talk:JustJimWillDo|talk]]) 07:27, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

::It looks fine. But now that I re-read the source it occurs to me that we're omitting a significant detail, of which the dedication is just a part. We're not mentioning Pournelle's Citizens Advisory Group for Space. The book was dedicated to the members of that committee. It's odd because his technological work is split from his political work, though that is an arbitrary division. (It's almost always best to organize biographies chronologically.) Anyway, short of re-writing this maybe we can say somthing like, &quot;Heinlein dedicated... to Graham and the eight other members of the Citizens Advisory Group for Space&quot;. I've added that. [[Special:Contributions/Will_Beback| ·:· ]][[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] [[User talk:Will Beback|·:·]] 08:20, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

:::Good thinking. Of course now we need an article on the Citizens Advisory Group for Space!! [[User:JustJimWillDo|JustJimWillDo]] ([[User talk:JustJimWillDo|talk]]) 00:50, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

==High Frontier Inc.==
I notice that the link to Hight Frontier Inc points to a troubled youth facility in Fort Davis, Tx. Was it always thus? [[User:JustJimWillDo|JustJimWillDo]] ([[User talk:JustJimWillDo|talk]]) 05:34, 22 August 2008 (UTC) (ps the youth are troubled, not the facility!)
*I think that &quot;[[High Frontier]]&quot; was redlinked (nonexistent) until May 2008, when someone created the article on the clinic. There's some doubt as to whether that topic is notable, but there's little doubt that this &quot;HF&quot; is more notable than that one. I'll move the clinic to a new name and set up a disambguation page. If you're into the topic perhaps you could write an article on this &quot;HF&quot; to fill the void. There are plenty of sources available. [[Special:Contributions/Will_Beback| ·:· ]][[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] [[User talk:Will Beback|·:·]] 06:33, 22 August 2008 (UTC)
*After a bit of research I'm not sure that this &quot;HF&quot; is really notable enough, independently of Graham. Maybe the best thing would be to develop a section either here or at [[SDI]], and then once we're sure that there are enough sources that directly adress the &quot;HF&quot; we can split it off. For the time being, I'll link &quot;HF&quot; here. [[Special:Contributions/Will_Beback| ·:· ]][[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] [[User talk:Will Beback|·:·]] 06:57, 22 August 2008 (UTC)
:*I'm doing a bit of research on the Citizens' Group etc at the moment in my sandbox, I might just put it out for perusal tonight then everybody can have a go. (I'm corresponding with Jerry Pournelle fercryingoutloud! Does little happy dance. Well I sent him an e-mail, still awaiting a reply, happy dance slows a little.) &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JustJimWillDo|JustJimWillDo]] ([[User talk:JustJimWillDo|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustJimWillDo|contribs]]) 12:12, 22 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy==
I didn't know where else to put this. I started the [[Citizens'_Advisory_Council_on_National_Space_Policy|above named article]] and have stated my plan of attack on the [[Talk:Citizens'_Advisory_Council_on_National_Space_Policy|discussion page for it]].

==Wasted a lot of Money==
I hope I do not cross any sort of NPOV line here, but the guy advocated a program that spent billions thirty years ago and came to naught. Our limited SDI is ground-, not space-based. I am sure he was a swell guy, but he was quite wrong. [[User:PaulinSaudi|Paul, in Saudi]] ([[User talk:PaulinSaudi|talk]]) 09:10, 27 March 2012 (UTC)</text>
