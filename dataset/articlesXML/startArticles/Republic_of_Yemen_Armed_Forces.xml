The '''armed forces of Yemen''' include the [[Yemen Army]] (includes [[Republican Guard (Yemen)|Republican Guard]]), Navy (includes Marines), 1st Armored Division, [[Yemeni Air Force]] (Al Quwwat al Jawwiya al Yamaniya, which includes the Air Defense Force) (2008).  A major reorganization of the armed forces continues. The unified air forces and air defenses are now under one command. The navy has concentration in [[Aden]]. Total armed forces manning numbers about 401,000 active personnel, including conscripts. The [[Yemen Arab Republic]] and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] joined to form the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationmaster.com&quot;&gt;http://www.nationmaster.com/country/ym-yemen/mil-military&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]] - it cites Wikipedia as one of its sources, doesn't make clear where specific numbers came from.|date=January 2016}}

The supreme commander of the armed forces is Field Marshal Abd Rabbuh Mansur Al-Hadi, the President of the Republic of Yemen.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The number of military personnel in Yemen is relatively high; in sum, Yemen has the second largest military force on the Arabian Peninsula after Saudi Arabia. In 2012, total active troops were estimated as follows: army, 66,700; navy, 7,000; and air force, 5,000. In September 2007, the government announced the reinstatement of compulsory military service. Yemen’s defense budget, which in 2006 represented approximately 40 percent of the total government budget, is expected to remain high for the near term, as the military draft takes effect and internal security threats continue to escalate. By 2012 Yemen now has 401,000 active personnel.

Yemen used [[child soldiers]] between 2001 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Bush Signs Law on Child Soldiers
 |url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/10/03/united-states-bush-signs-law-child-soldiers| publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child soldiers were also used by organized forces and tribal militia as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United States State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===North Yemen Civil War===
[[Image:North Yemen Civil War.jpg|thumb|300px|Fighting during the North Yemen Civil War]]

The [[North Yemen Civil War]] began in 1962 and ended in 1970. It took place between the North Yemen republican forces and the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]]. The Royalists received support from [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]] while the Republicans received support from [[Egypt]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. the Royalists used local [[tribesmen]]. The Republicans also used about 55,000 [[Military of Egypt|Egyptian troops]].

The Royalists were commanded by [[Muhammad al-Badr]] of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.

The Republican commanders were [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] and [[Abdul Hakim Amer]] from Egypt and [[Abdullah as-Sallal]] from the North Yemen republic. During the conflict over 50,000 of Egypt's troops were tied down in Yemen, which proved to be a disadvantage to Egypt during the [[Six-day war]] in 1967. The war concluded when the Republican forces won, and this resulted in transformation of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen into North Yemen. Over 100,000 died on both sides during the conflict.

===Chemical warfare during North Yemen Civil War===
The first attack took place on June 8, 1963 against Kawma, a village of about 100 inhabitants in northern Yemen, killing about seven people and damaging the eyes and lungs of twenty-five others. This incident is considered to have been experimental, and the bombs were described as &quot;home-made, amateurish and relatively ineffective&quot;. The Egyptian authorities suggested that the reported incidents were probably caused by napalm, not gas. The Israeli Foreign Minister, Golda Meir, suggested in an interview that Nasser would not hesitate to use gas against Israel as well.

There were no reports of gas during 1964, and only a few were reported in 1965. The reports grew more frequent in late 1966. On December 11, 1966, fifteen gas bombs killed two people and injured thirty-five. On January 5, 1967, the biggest gas attack came against the village of Kitaf, causing 270 casualties, including 140 fatalities. The target may have been Prince Hassan bin Yahya, who had installed his headquarters nearby. The Egyptian government denied using poison gas, and alleged that Britain and the US were using the reports as psychological warfare against Egypt. On February 12, 1967, it said it would welcome a UN investigation. On March 1, U Thant said he was &quot;powerless&quot; to deal with the matter.

On May 10, the twin villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, killing at least seventy-five. The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2, it issued a statement in Geneva expressing concern. The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was likely to have been halogenous derivatives - phosgene, mustard gas, lewisite, chloride or cyanogen bromide.

The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen. Casualty estimates vary, and an assumption, considered conservative, is that the mustard and phosgene-filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries.

===1994 Civil War===
During the [[1994 civil war in Yemen]] almost all of the actual fighting in the 1994 civil war occurred in the southern part of the country despite air and missile attacks against cities and major installations in the north. Southerners sought support from neighboring states and received billions of dollars of equipment and financial assistance, mostly from Saudi Arabia, which felt threatened during Gulf War in 1991 when Yemen supported Saddam Hussien. The United States repeatedly called for a cease-fire and a return to the negotiating table. Various attempts, including by a UN special envoy, were unsuccessful to effect a cease-fire.

Southern leaders declared secession and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen (DRY) on 21 May 1994, but the DRY was not recognized by the international community. Ali Nasir Muhammad supporters greatly assisted military operations against the secessionists and Aden was captured on 7 July 1994.[1] Other resistance quickly collapsed and thousands of southern leaders and military went into exile.[1]

===2011 Yemeni Revolution===
{{Main article|Yemeni Revolution}}
[[File:Yemeni soldiers from the 1st Armoured Division.JPG|thumb|Yemeni soldiers from the 1st Armoured Division on 60th Street in Sana'a, 22 May 2011]]
In March 2011, a month after the beginning of an [[2011 Yemeni uprising|uprising]] against President Salehs rule, Maj. Gen. [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]], the commander of the 1st Armoured Division, defected to the side of the protesters taking hundreds of troops and several tanks to protect protesting citizens. Rival tanks of the 1st Armoured Division and the [[Republican Guard (Yemen)|Republican Guard]] faced off against each other in San'na.&lt;ref&gt;Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yemeni Army's 119th Brigade, which had defected to the opposition, launched a joint operation with 31st and 201st Brigades which were still loyal to Saleh and retook the city of Zanjibar on 10 September from Islamist militants who were exploiting the chaos in the country to expand their influence. The offensive relieved  besieged army units in the process.&lt;ref name=ZiljibarRecapturedCNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Almasmari|first=Hakim|title=Yemen army recaptures provincial capital of Abyan|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/09/10/yemen.siege.zinjibar/index.html?iref=allsearch|work=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=10 September 2011|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September, at least one rebel soldier was killed in clashes with loyalists in San'na near the city's central square, trying to protect the protest camp there from security forces.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/dissident-soldier-killed-clash-yemen-army-113255905.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti government tribesmen overran a loyalist army base north of San'na on 20 September, capturing 30 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204422404576594413336931554.html?mod=googlenews_wsj }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{update|section|date=May 2015}}

Beginning in October 2015, the Saudi-led coalition transitioned from direct fighting to providing support and training for Yemeni forces loyal to President Hadi's government. They helped form a new Yemeni National Army (YNA), which they trained at the [[Al Anad Air Base]] in the [[Lahij Governorate]]. These consisted of Hadi loyalist units, popular mobilization militias and [[Eritrea]]n and [[Somalia|Somali]] recruits. Eight brigades were trained in total. The Gulf coalition-trained YNA order of battle is as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;groundops&quot;&gt;Mello, Alexandre. Knights, Michael.

In addition to ground forces, the [[United Arab Emirates Air Force|UAE air force]] trained pilots to form a new [[Yemeni Air Force]] using [[Air Tractor AT-802]] light craft. By late October these were reported to be in operation and assisting Hadi loyalist army units near [[Taiz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;groundops&quot; /&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:Soldiers - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|200px|Yemeni soldiers, August 2011]]
{{see also|Military equipment of Yemen}}
Yemen’s military is divided into an army, navy, air force, and border guard.

The army is organized into eight armored brigades, 16 infantry brigades, six mechanized brigades,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.criticalthreats.org/yemen/caris-yemen-order-battle-february-23-2015&lt;/ref&gt; two airborne commando brigades, one surface-to-surface missile brigade, three artillery brigades, one central guard force, one Special Forces brigade, and six air defense brigades, which consist of four antiaircraft artillery battalions and one surface-to-air missile battalion.&lt;ref name=LOCYEM&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Yemen.pdf Country profile: Yemen]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A military takeover could only realistically be launched by one of the five Area Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Wikileaks/U.S. Department of State, [http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2005/09/05SANAA2766.html 05SANAA2766.html], September 2005 ([[United States diplomatic cables leak]])&lt;/ref&gt; Having himself come to power by coup, Saleh has been extremely careful to select Commanders whose loyalty is ensured by tribal bonds. Members of Saleh's [[Sanhan, Yemen|Sanhan]] tribe control all military districts and most high security posts, with the commanders enjoying blood and/or close ties to Saleh. The Commanders report directly to the President, outside the normal channels of the Ministry of Defense and without constitutional mandate. They are the final authority in nearly every aspect of regional governance. In practice, they behave like tribal sheikhs and super-governors, parceling out new schools, water projects, and money. Despite periodic efforts to integrate military units, the Commanders recruit largely from regional tribes.&quot;

As of September 2005, &quot;Brigadier General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, Commander of the Northeastern region, is the most powerful of these military elites. The commander of the Eastern Area is BG Mohammed Ali Mohsen. The Eastern Area includes the governorates of [[Hadramawt]] and al-Mahra. Ali Faraj is commander for the Central Area, which includes Al-Jawf, Maarib, al-Bayda, and [[Shabwah Governorate|Shabwa]], while the Southern Commander, controlling the Aden, Taiz, Lahaj, al-Dhala and Abyan, is Abd al-Aziz al-Thabet. Finally, BG Awadh bin Fareed commands the Central Area, including the capital Sanaa. With the exception of Ali Mohsen, all of these commands are subject to periodic change or shuffle.&quot;

The air force includes an air defense force.&lt;ref name=LOCYEM /&gt; Yemen recently placed an order for TOR air defence systems, which will be far more advanced than the current air defense systems in place. The TOR order has been completed. The Yemeni Army has a total strength of 137,900 troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yemeni military strength&quot; /&gt;{{better source|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]] - it cites Wikipedia as one of its sources, doesn't make clear where specific numbers came from. Admits it is only for entertainment value.|date=January 2016}}

In 2001, Yemen’s National Defense Council abolished the existing two-year compulsory military service, relying instead on volunteers to fill posts in the military and security forces. In 2007, the Yemeni government announced that it would reinstate the draft to counter unemployment; approximately 70,000 new recruits were expected to join the military.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Defense budget==
Yemen’s defense spending has historically been one of the government’s three largest expenditures and is expected to remain high as a result of the reinstatement of conscription and security threats posed by terrorism and tribal conflict. The defense budget increased from US$540 million in 2001 to an estimated US$2 billion–US$2.1 billion in 2006, to which it is probably $3.5 billion by 2012. According to the U.S. government, the 2006 budget represents about 6 percent of gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulgaria&quot; /&gt;

==Paramilitary forces==
Yemen’s paramilitary force has about 71,000 troops. Approximately 50,000 constitute the Central Security Organization of the Ministry of Interior; they are equipped with a range of infantry weapons and armored personnel carriers. An additional 20,000 are forces of armed tribal levies. Yemen is building up a small [[Yemeni Coast Guard|coast guard]] under the Ministry of Interior, training naval military technicians for posts in Aden and Al Mukalla.&lt;ref name=YemenPost2009-02-09&gt;

{{main article|Yemeni Navy}}

Yemen's navy was created in 1990 when North and South Yemen united. The navy’s major bases are located in Aden and Al Hudaydah; there are also bases in Al Mukalla, Perim Island, and Socotra that maintain naval support equipment.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Yemen's navy uses +2,000 officers and seamen to support their main bases at Aden and Hodeida. A naval fortress is in construction at Hodeida.

Yemen early on had problems with trying to keep drugs from entering Yemen by sea. In 2006, Yemen purchased ten [[patrol boat]]s based on the Australian [[Bay class patrol boat|Bay class]], which were very effective at stopping smugglers from entering Yemen.

In the [[Hanish Islands conflict]], Yemen prepared its navy for an assault on the Hanish islands and on [[Eritrea]]. Eritrea accidentally destroyed a Russian ship thinking it was a Yemeni ship. The invasion however never happened since Eritrea made agreements with Yemen which involved Eritrea taking over the islands. Yemen however, later took over Zukur-Hanish archipelago island which created further tensions with the Eritrean government but it didn't lead to another war.
