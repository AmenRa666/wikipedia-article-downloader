'''HMCS ''Iroquois''''' was a {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1936)|0}} [[destroyer]] that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]] and [[Korean War]]. She was named for the [[Iroquois]] First Nations. ''Iroquois'' was the first ship to bear this name and the first ship of the class to serve with the Royal Canadian Navy.&lt;ref name=m1&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and description==
The Tribals were designed to fight heavily armed destroyers of other navies, such as the Japanese {{sclass-|Fubuki|destroyer|4}}.&lt;ref name=chesneau&gt;Chesneau, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Canada chose the design based on its armament, with the size and power of the Tribal class allowing them to act more like small cruisers than as fleet destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iroquois'' was among the first batch of Tribal-class destroyers ordered by the RCN in 1940–1941. They were ordered with modified ventilation and heating systems for [[North Atlantic]] winter service. Design modifications were made after deficiencies were noted in ''Iroquois'', the lead ship of the Canadian Tribals.

''Iroquois'', as one of the British-built Tribal-class destroyers, was {{convert|335|ft|6|in|m}} [[Length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|377|ft|m}} [[Length overall|long overall]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|ft|6|in|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|13|ft|m}}. As built, the destroyer [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|1927|LT|t}} standard and {{convert|2745|LT|t}} at deep load.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;&lt;ref name=mac59&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iroquois'' had a complement of 14 officers and 245 ratings.&lt;ref name=mac59/&gt;

The destroyer was propelled by two shafts driven by two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[Steam turbine|geared turbines]] powered by steam created by three [[Three-drum boiler#Admiralty boiler|Admiralty-type three drum boilers]]. This created {{convert|44000|shp|lk=in}} and gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|36.5|kn|lk=in}}. The destroyers could carry {{convert|505|-|516|LT|t}} of fuel oil.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;

As built, ''Iroquois'' was fitted with six [[Quick-firing gun|quick firing]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark IX &amp; XII|{{convert|4.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} Mk XII]] guns placed in three twin [[Gun turret|turrets]], designated 'A', 'B' and 'Y' from bow to stern.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Mark XII = Mark 12. Britain used [[Roman numeral]]s to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II.&lt;/ref&gt; The turrets were placed on 40° mountings with open-backed shields.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt; The ship also had one twin turret of [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|0}} Mk XVI guns]] in the 'X' position.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;&lt;ref name=mac59/&gt; For secondary [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament, the destroyer was equipped with four single-mounted [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns]]. The vessel was also fitted with four {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s for Mk IX torpedoes.&lt;ref name=chesneau/&gt;

==Service history==
''Iroquois'' was ordered on 5 April 1940 as part of the 1940 shipbuilding programme.&lt;ref name=u1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4443.html |title=HMCS Iroquois (G89) |work=uboat.net |accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 19 September 1940 by [[Vickers-Armstrong]] at [[Newcastle on Tyne]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] 23 September the following year.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt; ''Iroquois'' was originally laid down as ''Athabaskan''. However, due to bomb damage, she and her [[Sister ship|sister]] had their names switched in order to ensure ''Iroquois'' commissioned first.&lt;ref&gt;Boutiller, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Royal Canadian Navy at Newcastle on Tyne on 30 November 1942. The destroyer was not completed until 30 January 1943.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;

Following her completion, ''Iroquois'' began [[sea trials]], suffering storm damage near the [[Faroes]] which included a bent keel and requiring repairs. Further trials continued in the North Sea until May 1943 when she departed for [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Schull, pp. 188-90&lt;/ref&gt; From Plymouth the destroyer was used as a convoy escort on [[Gibraltar]] convoys. On 11 June, three [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor]]s from [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] attacked a troop transport convoy west of [[Oporto]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. ''Iroquois'' was attacked by the aircraft, missing the destroyer with bombs {{convert|200|yd|m}} astern.&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The German aircraft hit {{SS|California|1923|6}} and {{SS|Duchess of York}} which were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iroquois'' rescued 628 survivors from ''Duchess of York''.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt; On 19 July an event termed &quot;incident&quot; in official reports took place where according to the inquiry afterwards, a large section of the ship's company refused to perform their duties.&lt;ref&gt;Boutiller, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iroquois'' was among the destroyers deployed to cover escort forces attacking [[U-boat]]s in the Bay of Biscay from 12 June to 2 August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern operations===
Following her return to the UK, ''Iroquois'' was assigned to escort [[Arctic convoys of World War II|convoys]] heading to the [[Soviet Union]] over the following months. From 1–11 October, ''Iroquois'' and the destroyers {{HMCS|Huron|G24|2}} and {{HMS|Onslaught|G04|2}} transported supplies to [[Murmansk]] for the escorts that remained there in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in November ''Iroquois'' provided support to Russian convoys, beginning with convoy JW 54A from [[Loch Ewe]] on 18–24 November and convoy RA 54B from [[Molotvsk]] on 28 November.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; In late December, ''Iroquois'' escorted the convoy JW 55B. The convoy came under air attack on 23 December, but was unscathed.&lt;ref name=rohwer292&gt;Rohwer, pp. 292-93&lt;/ref&gt; The convoy sailed as a lure for the {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst}}, which was sunk by British forces on 26 December.&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December, the warship was among the escort for RA 55B which departs [[Kola Inlet]] on 31 December and reaches Loch Ewe on 8 January without loss.&lt;ref name=rohwer292/&gt;

===English Channel and end of war===
In February 1944, she sailed to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] to undergo a refit that would keep her out of action until early June.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to the UK and was assigned to the [[10th Destroyer Flotilla]] in preparation for the [[Invasion of Normandy]]. After D-day, she carried out patrols of the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt; During this period, ''Iroquois'' took part in many operations including ''Kinetic'' the objective of which was to eliminate the German navy all along the French Atlantic ports taking part in three actions including the [[Battle of Audierne Bay]] in August 1944.

On 5 August 1944, a force comprising the [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Bellona|63|2}} and the destroyers {{HMS|Tartar|F43|2}}, {{HMS|Ashanti|F51|2}}, {{HMCS|Haida||2}} and ''Iroquois'' engaged and sank the German [[minesweeper]]s ''M 263'' and ''M 486'' and the [[patrol boat]] ''V 414'', coastal launch ''Otto'' from a German convoy north of [[Île d'Yeu]].&lt;ref name=rohwer347&gt;Rohwer, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iroquois'' was responsible for the sinking of two of the vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August, ''Iroquois'' joined with the destroyer {{HMS|Ursa|R22|2}} and cruiser {{HMS|Mauritius|80|2}} to attack a German force of [[Les Sables d'Olonne]] and sink ''Sperrbrecher 157'', badly damage ''M 275'' and run ''M 385'' aground. On 22–23 August ''Mauritius'', ''Ursa'' and ''Iroquois'' sink ''V 702'', ''V 717'', ''V 720'', ''V 729'' and ''V 730'' of Audierne.&lt;ref name=&quot;rohwer347&quot;/&gt; The destroyer continued patrolling the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel until October 1944 when she transferred to Scapa Flow.&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iroquois'' rejoined the [[Home Fleet]] in March 1945 at Scapa Flow.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt; The destroyer was part of the screening force for [[aircraft carrier]]s on 19 March and again on 24 March, which were performing air strikes along coastal Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; She then escorted one more convoy to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt; On 16 April ''Iroquois'' departed as part of the escort of JW 66.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; From 29 April-2 May ''Iroquois'' participated in the last convoy battle of war as part of the escort for convoy RA 66. ''Iroquois'' and ''Haida'' were just missed by torpedoes in an attack by {{GS|U-427||2}}. They in turn pursued the submarine in which by the end of the engagement, 678 depth charge explosions are counted without sinking the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iroquois'' remained in British waters until the [[German Instrument of Surrender|surrender of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Schull, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the surrender, ''Iroquois'' was part of [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]]'s return to Norway after its liberation and then she sailed on to [[Copenhagen]] where she was an escort to German [[cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Nürnberg||2}} until their formal surrender.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyer returned to Canada and began a tropicalization refit that was halted upon the [[surrender of Japan]]. ''Iroquois'' was then [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] on 22 February 1946.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;

===Cold War service===
Beginning in 1947, ''Iroquois'' underwent conversion to a destroyer escort, the first of her class to undergo the alterations. The changes involved her 4.7-inch main armament were replaced with 4-inch guns in the 'A' and 'B' turret positions, in the 'X' a twin [[3″/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|0}}/50 calibre gun]] mount  was installed and in the 'Y' site, two [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] anti-submarine mortars were situated.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 50 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]] denotes the length of the gun. This means that the length of the gun barrel is 50 times the bore diameter.&lt;/ref&gt; Other alterations included an aluminum lattice with new radar.&lt;ref&gt;Boutiller, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gardiner&gt;Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iroquois'' was equipped with Type 275, SPS-10, SPS-6, Type 293 and 262 radars and Type 140 and 174 sonars.&lt;ref name=gardiner/&gt; She emerged from her refit on 24 June 1949 and was recommissioned as a [[training ship]].&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;

''Iroquois'' served off Korea during the [[Korean War]], commanded by [[William Landymore]].&lt;ref&gt;Milner, p. 1173&lt;/ref&gt; She served three tours, the first from 12 June until 26 November 1952. It was on this tour that on 2 October 1952, the ship was hit by enemy shore batteries, killing 3 and wounding 10. These were the only Royal Canadian Navy casualties in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/collections/korea/events/1952 |work=Historical Calendar – 1952 |date= |title=Land of the Morning Calm: Canadians in Korea 1950–1953 |publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second tour lasted from 18 June 1953 until 1 January 1954 and the third took place later that year, from 22 August to 26 December 1954.

She returned to her training role and remained as such until 1962. ''Iroquois'' was paid off at Halifax on 24 October 1962 and laid up at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]]. In 1966 the vessel was taken to [[Bilbao]], Spain and [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in September.&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;&lt;ref name=c1&gt;Colledge, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ship badge==
The ship's badge is described as a Blazon Or, the head of an Iroquois brave, couped at the base of the neck, properly coloured and wearing two eagle feathers in his hair and a gold ring pendant from the ear.&lt;ref name=l1/&gt;
