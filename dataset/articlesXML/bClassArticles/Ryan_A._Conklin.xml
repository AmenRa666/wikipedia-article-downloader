==Military and reality television career==
===First tour of duty===
Conklin enlisted in the [[United States Army]] at age 17,&lt;ref name=BrooklynPaper&gt;Portlock, Sarah (December 1, 2008).

''[[The Brooklyn Paper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; having been inspired to do so by the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=TRW:Bep5&gt;{{Cite episode| title= Friends and Enemies| episodelink  =| url= http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-brooklyn-ep-5-friends-and-enemies/1603847/playlist.jhtml| series=The Real World: Brooklyn|credits=|network=MTV|station=|city=|airdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered Basic Training at [[Fort Benning|Fort Benning, Georgia]] in 2003 and was stationed at [[Fort Campbell|Fort Campbell, Kentucky]]

Ryan was an infantryman in the [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)]], 3rd Brigade of the famed [[101st Airborne Division]]. In 2005, he deployed with the division to [[Iraq]], guarded [[Saddam Hussein]] at his [[Trial of Saddam Hussein|trial]] in Baghdad, but his company spent most of their year deployment patrolling [[Tikrit]] and experienced a number of near-death experiences from IEDs, drive-by shootings, VBIEDs, suicide bomber, and a sniper.&lt;ref name=RyanBio&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/shows/real_world/brooklyn/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10601 &quot;Real World: Brooklyn: Cast: Ryan&quot;]. MTV. Retrieved November 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time on ''The Real World'', it was also revealed that he suffered attacks of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]] as a result of his tour of duty.&lt;ref name=TRW:Bep11/&gt; He was honorably discharged in 2006.&lt;ref name=AngelBio/&gt;

Conklin's book [http://www.AnAngelFromHell.com ''An Angel From Hell''] (2010) chronicles himself and his platoon during this chaotic tour.

===''The Real World: Brooklyn''===
{{Main|The Real World: Brooklyn}}
In 2008, after returning from his first tour in Iraq, Conklin was cast on the [[The Real World: Brooklyn|21st season]] of the [[MTV]] [[reality series]], ''[[The Real World]]'' in 2008. On being selected, Conklin said that it almost started as a joke. MTV was casting at a bar he was visiting, and he decided to apply. He says that he was stunned to learn he made the final cut.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;Collins, Elizabeth M. [http://www.army.mil/-news/2009/11/10/30161-mtv-documentary-follows-soldiers-return-to-iraq/ &quot;MTV documentary follows Soldier's return to Iraq&quot;], United States Army, November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His cast biography is as follows: {{cquote|A small-town Pennsylvania boy with a laid-back personality, Ryan has had his share of action. After enlisting in the army at the age of 17, he served in Iraq and got an eyeful. Now 23, he has returned from his duty with a newfound appreciation for life and a better perspective on the world around him, despite having lived through many near-death experiences, as well as the death of a close friend. A class clown who juggles his time between amateur filmmaking, guitar playing and pranking those around him, Ryan is currently in his first-ever relationship.&lt;ref name=RyanBio/&gt;}}

During his time on [http://www.mtv.com/shows/real_world/brooklyn/series.jhtml ''The Real World: Brooklyn''], Conklin related his experiences in the [[Iraq War]] and became a candid and creative representative of today's veterans. As a former soldier with job skills and experiences that could still help the war effort, in 2008 President [[George W. Bush]] recalled thousands of former soldiers in the [[inactive ready reserve]] as part of a surge on both battlefields, which happened to unfold during the filming of ''The Real World'', and Conklin was recalled to deploy to Iraq.&lt;ref name=TRW:Bep11/&gt;

===Second tour of duty===
In November 2008, while filming ''The Real World'', Conklin found out, much to his shock, that he was being called back to active duty. On April 1, 2009, the day he was supposed to report to [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]] before leaving, Conklin surprised his ''Real World'' castmates by appearing on the reunion show.&lt;ref name=RWReunion&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-brooklyn-reunion/1607912/playlist.jhtml ''The Real World: Brooklyn Reunion'']. MTV. Retrieved December 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Iraq later that month, serving in the southern Saydiyah section of Baghdad as an infantryman, and was eventually promoted to the rank of Sergeant.&lt;ref name=AngelBio/&gt;

Before deploying, MTV and the producers of the ''Real World'' pitched him the idea for a documentary following his returning to Iraq as well as his family members' reactions. Though initially reluctant, Conklin agreed.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The documentary, fully titled ''The [http://www.mtv.com/videos/the-real-world-presents-return-to-duty/1625494/playlist.jhtml Real World Presents: Return to Duty''], aired on November 11, 2009.&lt;ref name=ReturnToDutyMTV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realtelevision.net/2009/11/05/return-to-duty/ ''Return to Duty''].

In January 2010 Conklin was again honorably discharged from the Army.&lt;ref name=AngelBio/&gt;

==Later work==
Conklin has traveled throughout the country and gave lectures to colleges and universities and spoke to students about his time in Iraq.&lt;ref name=AngelBio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olin, Nicol.
