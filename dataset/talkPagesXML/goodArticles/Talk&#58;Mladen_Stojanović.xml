== placeofburial field in infobox ==

Regarding [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mladen_Stojanovi%C4%87&amp;diff=582121010&amp;oldid=582091155 this edit], isn't it obvious that the placeofburial field is intended to explain the person's place of burial in current terms, rather than historical terms, which were in use when the person was interred? [[User:VVVladimir|&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot; style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Vladimir&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:VVVladimir|talk]]) 14:11, 18 November 2013 (UTC)
: on the contrary, it is obvious that, consistent with the place of birth field, it refers to the place he was re-interred at in 1961. Prijedor, to which could be added its location in the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, not the RS. Referring him as having been buried in the RS in completely ahistorical. It didn't exist when he was first buried, and didn't exist when he was re-interred. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 00:15, 19 November 2013 (UTC)
::The birth_place field is shown in the infobox in combination with the birth_date field. It is logical to designate a person's place of birth in historical terms which were actual at the date of his birth (this provides a historical context in which the person was born, which is obviously important for his biography). The placeofburial field quite expectedly has not a corresponding &quot;burial_date&quot; field, as the historical context of the point in time when the person was interred is not so important. The [[Template:Infobox military person]] explains: &quot;'''placeofburial''' – ''optional'' – the place where the person's remains are buried or otherwise interred&quot; (note the present tense). The placeofburial field should designate the location of the person's grave (if it exists). In the case of Mladen Stojanović, his grave is located in Prijedor, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Stating that his grave is located in Yugoslavia is &quot;ahistorical&quot;, in fact downright nonsensical, as that state no longer exists.

== Tennis club of Prijedor ==

Re the comment: ''a tennis club, or the tennis club? I thought a tennis club was founded in 1914? See http://www.tenis-prijedor.com/tennis/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=34 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mladen_Stojanovi%C4%87&amp;diff=583011231&amp;oldid=582563078]''. It seems that you didn't quite understand that sentence on the page you cited. It says: ''Počeci teniskog sporta datiraju od 1914. godine, a 1932. godine dr Mladen Stojanović osniva teniski klub, koji postaje jedan od najstarijih u bivšoj Jugoslaviji.'' Translated: &quot;The beginnings of the tennis sport [in Prijedor] date back from 1914, and in 1932 Dr Mladen Stojanović founded the tennis club, which [thus] became one of the oldest [tennis clubs] in the former Yugoslavia.&quot; As I suppose you can see now, people began playing tennis in Prijedor in 1914, but there was not a tennis club there until 1932, when Stojanović founded it. [[User:VVVladimir|&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot; style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Vladimir&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:VVVladimir|talk]]) 14:07, 24 November 2013 (UTC)

I see that there is the claim on the [[Prijedor]] page that the tennis club was founded in 1914, but it is not sourced. The page you cited also says that the first players of tennis in Prijedor were some Austrian officers, but it does not say that they founded a club. Also, the tennis court was not built until 1927. You speak Serbo-Croatian? [[User:VVVladimir|&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot; style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;&quot;&gt;Vladimir&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:VVVladimir|talk]]) 15:17, 24 November 2013 (UTC)
:I wasn't aware of the Prijedor claim regarding the tennis club. I wish I could speak Serbo-Croatian. No, my Serbo-Croatian is limited to &quot;stani ili pucam&quot; and similar phrases, so clearly my mistake. Thanks for clarifying.
