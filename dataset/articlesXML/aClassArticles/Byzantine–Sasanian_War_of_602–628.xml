{{Campaignbox Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628}}
The '''Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628''' was the final and most devastating of the [[Byzantine–Sassanid Wars|series of wars]] fought between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]] and the [[Sasanian Empire]] of [[Persia]]. The [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591|previous war]] between the two powers had ended in 591 after [[Maurice (emperor)|Emperor Maurice]] helped the Sasanian king [[Khosrau II]] regain his throne. In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival [[Phocas]]. Khosrau proceeded to declare war, ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice. This became a decades-long conflict, the longest war in the series, and was fought throughout the Middle East and eastern Europe: in [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Anatolia]], [[Armenia]] and even before the walls of [[Constantinople]] itself.

While the Persians proved largely successful during the first stage of the war from 602 to 622, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, and parts of Anatolia, the ascendancy of emperor [[Heraclius]] in 610 led, despite initial setbacks, to the Persians' defeat. Heraclius' campaigns in Persian lands from 622 to 626 forced the Persians onto the defensive, allowing his forces to regain momentum. Allied with the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]], the Persians made a final attempt to [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|take Constantinople]] in 626, but were defeated there. In 627 Heraclius invaded the heartland of the Persians and forced them to [[suing for peace|sue for peace]].

By the end of the conflict both sides had exhausted their human and material resources. Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic [[Rashidun Caliphate]], whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war. The [[Rashidun army|Muslim forces]] swiftly [[Muslim conquests|conquered]] the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|entire Sasanian Empire]] and [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|deprived]] the Byzantine Empire of its [[Muslim conquest of Syria|territories in the Levant]], [[Arab conquest of Armenia|the Caucasus]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]]. Over the following centuries, half the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the entire [[Sasanian Empire]] came under Muslim rule.

==Background==

After decades of inconclusive fighting, [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] ended the [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591]] by helping the exiled Sassanid prince Khosrau, the future [[Khosrau II]], to regain his throne from the usurper [[Bahrām Chobin]]. In return the [[Sassanids]] ceded to the Byzantines parts of northeastern [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], much of [[Persian Armenia]] and [[Caucasian Iberia]], though the exact details are not clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich87&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ElLZK1EOjHsC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA151 151]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zoZIxpQ8A2IC&amp;pg=PA174 174]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly for the Byzantine economy, they no longer had to pay tribute to the Sassanids.{{cref|b}}  Emperor Maurice then began new campaigns in the [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns|Balkans]] to stop incursions by the Slavs and Avars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zoZIxpQ8A2IC&amp;pg=PA175 175]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA152 152]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnanimity and campaigns of emperor [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius II]] had eliminated the surplus in the treasury left from the time of [[Justin II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 149]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xfV0LkMNaLUC&amp;pg=PA205 205]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to generate a reserve in the treasury, Maurice instituted strict fiscal measures and cut army pay; which led to four mutinies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1998|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xfV0LkMNaLUC&amp;pg=PA205 205–206]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final mutiny in 602 resulted from Maurice ordering his troops [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns|in the Balkans]] to live off the land during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Treadgoldhistory235&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&amp;pg=PA235 235]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army proclaimed [[Phocas]], a Thracian [[centurion]], as emperor.&lt;ref name = &quot;Norwich87&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Treadgoldhistory235&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA153 153]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice attempted to defend [[Constantinople]] by arming the Blues and the Greens - supporters of the two major chariot racing teams of the [[hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] - but they proved ineffective. Maurice fled but was soon intercepted and killed by the soldiers of Phocas.&lt;ref name =&quot;Treadgoldhistory235&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA154 154]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir7CKnBxRXwC&amp;pg=PA83 83]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ElLZK1EOjHsC&amp;pg=PA88 88]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of the conflict==
[[File:Byzantine and Sassanid Empires in 600 CE.png|thumb|left|350px|Byzantine and Sassanid Empires in 600]]
Upon the murder of Maurice, [[Narses (general under Maurice)|Narses]], governor of the Byzantine province of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], rebelled against Phocas and seized [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], a major city of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|pp=183–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Phocas instructed general [[Germanus (general under Phocas)|Germanus]] to besiege Edessa, prompting Narses to request help from the Persian king Khosrau II. Khosrau, who was only too willing to help avenge Maurice, his &quot;friend and father&quot;, used Maurice's death as an excuse to attack the Roman Empire, trying to reconquer Armenia and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman155&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155 155]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss722&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|1975|p=722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Germanus died in battle against the Persians. An army sent by Phocas against Khosrau was defeated near [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] in Upper Mesopotamia, leading to the capture of that important fortress in 605. Narses escaped from [[Leontius (general under Phocas)|Leontius]], the eunuch appointed by Phocas to deal with him,&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier184&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when Narses attempted to return to Constantinople to discuss peace terms, Phocas ordered him seized and burned alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich89&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Narses along with the failure to stop the Persians damaged the prestige of Phocas' military regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier184&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi39&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA39 39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraclius' rebellion==
[[File:Phocas.jpg|alt=A copper coin with the bust of Phocas. His eyes form the central focus of the image|thumb|right|A copper coin of the [[Phocas|Emperor Phocas]]]]
In 608, general [[Heraclius the Elder]], [[Exarch of Africa]], revolted, urged on by [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]], the [[Count of the Excubitors]] and son-in-law of Phocas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi37&quot;/&gt; Heraclius proclaimed himself and his [[Heraclius|son]] of the same name as [[Roman consul|consuls]]&amp;mdash;thereby implicitly claiming the imperial title&amp;mdash;and minted coins with the two wearing the consular robes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time rebellions began in [[Roman Syria]] and [[Palaestina Prima]] in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II, died. Many sources claim that the Jews were involved in the fighting, though it is unclear where they were members of factions and where they were opponents of Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier187&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phocas responded by appointing Bonus as ''[[comes Orientis]]'' (Count of the East) to stop the violence. Bonus punished the Greens, a horse racing party, in Antioch for their role in the violence in 609.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier187&quot;/&gt;

Heraclius the Elder sent his nephew [[Nicetas (cousin of Heraclius)|Nicetas]] to attack [[Egypt]]. Bonus went to Egypt to try to stop Nicetas, but was defeated by the latter outside Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier187&quot;/&gt; In 610, Nicetas succeeded in capturing the province, establishing a power base there with the help of [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarch]] [[John the Merciful|John the Almsgiver]], who was elected with the help of Nicetas.&lt;ref name = &quot;Oman156&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA156 156]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi53&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA53 53]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zoZIxpQ8A2IC&amp;pg=PA194 194]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE942&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ElkwedRWCXkC&amp;pg=PA942 942]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main rebel force was employed in a naval invasion of Constantinople, led by the younger [[Heraclius]], who was to be the new emperor. Organized resistance against Heraclius soon collapsed, and Phocas was handed to him by the patrician Probos (Photius).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA49 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phocas was executed, though not before a celebrated exchange of comments between him and his successor:{{quotation|&quot;Is it thus&quot;, asked Heraclius, &quot;that you have governed the Empire?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Will you,&quot; replied Phocas, with unexpected spirit, &quot;govern it any better?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich90&quot;/&gt;}}

The elder Heraclius disappears soon afterward from sources, supposedly dying, though the date is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After marrying his niece [[Martina (empress)|Martina]] and being crowned by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]], the 35-year-old Heraclius set out to perform his work as emperor. Phocas' brother, [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]], commanded a sizable force in central Anatolia but was assassinated by the Armenian commander Justin, removing a major threat to Heraclius' reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi53&quot;/&gt; Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to increase revenues and reduce costs, Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by not paying new staff from the imperial [[fisc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA63 63]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he secured a reputation for justice to strengthen his grip on power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA64 64]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian ascendancy==
[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier in Late Antiquity.svg|thumb|right|alt=Geophysical map of the southern Caucasus and northern Middle East|280px|Map of the Roman-Persian frontier during [[Late Antiquity]], including the 591 border between the two empires]]
The Persians took advantage of this civil war in the Byzantine empire by conquering frontier towns in Armenia and Upper Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi65&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi67&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA67 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the Euphrates, in 609, they conquered [[Mardin]] and Amida ([[Diyarbakır]]). [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], which some Christians are said to have believed would be defended by Jesus himself on behalf of King [[Abgar V of Edessa]] against all enemies, fell in 610.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier186&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Churchill|Jeffrey|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rjzBMLaT_lcC&amp;pg=PA176 176]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Armenia, the strategically important city of Theodosiopolis ([[Erzurum]]) surrendered in 609 or 610 to [[Ashtat Yeztayar]], because of the persuasion of a man who claimed to be [[Theodosius (son of Maurice)|Theodosius]], the eldest son and co-emperor of Maurice, who had supposedly fled to the protection of Khosrau.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier186&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA67 67–68]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 608, the Persians launched a raid into Anatolia that reached [[Chalcedon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman155&quot;/&gt; across the [[Bosphorus]] from Constantinople.{{cref|c}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman156&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgeon 2002 185&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian conquest was a gradual process; by the time of Heraclius' accession the Persians had conquered all Roman cities east of the Euphrates and in Armenia before moving on to Cappadocia, where their general [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] took Caesarea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier186&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgeon 2002 185&quot;/&gt; There, Phocas' son-in-law Priscus, who had encouraged Heraclius and his father to rebel, started a year-long siege to trap them inside the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi37&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA68 68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier188&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraclius' accession as Emperor did little to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting to make peace with the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original ''[[casus belli]]'', had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi65&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA65 65]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Walter Kaegi]], it is conceivable that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi65&quot;/&gt;
[[File:KhusrauII.jpg|alt=A silver coin with a face of [[Khosrau II]] surrounded by a double ring and some symbols|thumb|180px|left|A silver coin of [[Khosrau II]]]]
By established practice, Byzantine emperors did not personally lead troops into battle.{{cref|d}} Heraclius ignored this convention and joined with his general Priscus' siege of the Persians at Caesarea.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier188&quot;/&gt; Priscus pretended to be ill, however, and did not meet the emperor. This was a veiled insult to Heraclius, who hid his dislike of Priscus and returned to Constantinople in 612. Meanwhile, Shahin's troops escaped Priscus' blockade and burned Caesarea, much to Heraclius' displeasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi69&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA69 69]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priscus was soon removed from command, along with others who served under Phocas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippicus (general)|Philippicus]], an old general of Maurice's, was appointed as commander-in-chief, but he proved himself incompetent against the Persians, avoiding engagements in battle.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi75&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA75 75]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heraclius then appointed himself commander along with his brother [[Theodore (brother of Heraclius)|Theodore]] to finally solidify command of the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi75&quot;/&gt;

Khosrau took advantage of the incompetence of Heraclius' generals to launch an attack on [[Syria (Roman province)|Byzantine Syria]], under the leadership of the Persian general [[Shahrbaraz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA74 74]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heraclius attempted to stop the invasion at [[Antioch]], but despite the blessing of  [[Saint Theodore of Sykeon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi75&quot;/&gt; Byzantine forces under Heraclius and Nicetas [[Battle of Antioch (613)|suffered a serious defeat]] at the hands of Shahin. Details of the battle are not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA76 76–77]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this victory the Persians looted the city, slew the Patriarch of Antioch and deported many citizens. Roman forces lost again while attempting to defend the area just to the north of Antioch at the [[Cilician Gates]], despite some initial success. The Persians then captured [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] and the Cilician plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi77&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA77 77]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This defeat cut the  Byzantine empire in half, severing Constantinople and Anatolia's land link to Syria, Palestine, [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]], and the [[Exarchate of Carthage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi77&quot;/&gt;

==Persian dominance==

===Capture of Jerusalem===

[[File:Byzantine-persian campaigns 611-624-mohammad adil rais.PNG|alt=This map shows the approximate campaign paths of Persian and Roman Generals from 611 to 624 as described in the text.|thumb|right|300px|Campaign map from 611 to 624 through Syria, Anatolia, Armenia, and Mesopotamia]]
Resistance to the Persians in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] was not strong; although the locals constructed fortifications, they generally tried to negotiate with the Persians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi77&quot;/&gt; The cities of [[Damascus]], [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]], and [[Homs|Emesa]] fell quickly in 613, giving the Sasanian army a chance to strike further south into [[Palaestina Prima]]. Nicetas continued to resist the Persians but was defeated at [[Deraa|Adhri'at]]. He managed to win a small victory near Emesa, however, where both sides suffered heavy casualties—the total death count was 20,000.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi78&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA78 78]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More seriously, the weakness of the resistance enabled the Persians and their Jewish allies to capture [[Siege of Jerusalem (614)|Jerusalem]] following a three weeks siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir7CKnBxRXwC&amp;pg=PA95 95]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources claim 57,000 or 66,500 people were slain there; another 35,000 were deported to Persia, including the Patriarch Zacharias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi78&quot;/&gt;

Many churches in the city (including the Church of the Resurrection or [[Holy Sepulchre]]) were burned, and numerous relics, including the [[True Cross]], the [[Holy Lance]], and the [[Holy Sponge]], were carried off to the Persian capital [[Ctesiphon]]. The loss of these relics was thought by many Christian Byzantines to be a clear mark of divine displeasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich90&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ElLZK1EOjHsC&amp;pg=PA90 90]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some blamed the Jews for this misfortune and for the loss of Syria in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports that Jews helped the Persians capture certain cities and that the Jews tried to slaughter Christians in cities that the Persians had already conquered but were found and foiled from doing so. These reports are likely to be greatly exaggerated and the result of general hysteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi77&quot;/&gt;

===Egypt===
{{main|Sassanid conquest of Egypt}}
In 618 Shahrbaraz's forces invaded Egypt, a province that had been mostly untouched by war for three centuries.&lt;ref name = &quot;Oman206&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA206 206]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monophysites]] living in Egypt were unhappy with [[Chalcedonian]] orthodoxy and were not eager to aid Byzantine imperial forces. Afterward they were supported by Khosrau,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman206&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fouracre|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JcmwuoTsKO0C&amp;pg=PA296 296]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but they did not resist imperial forces between 600 and 638, and many saw the Persian occupation in negative terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|1995|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reinink|Stolte|Groningen|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ytkockAajMC&amp;pg=PA235 235]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine resistance in Alexandria was led by Nicetas. After a year-long siege, resistance in Alexandria collapsed, supposedly after a traitor told the Persians of an unused canal, allowing them to storm the city. Nicetas fled to Cyprus along with Patriarch [[John the Merciful|John the Almsgiver]], who was a major supporter of Nicetas in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA91 91]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of Nicetas is unclear, since he disappears from records after this, but Heraclius was presumably deprived of a trusted commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of Egypt was a severe blow to the Byzantine empire, as [[Constantinople]] relied on grain shipments from fertile Egypt to feed the multitudes in the capital. The free grain ration in Constantinople, which echoed the earlier [[Grain supply to the city of Rome#Politics and the grain supply|grain dole in Rome]], was abolished in 618.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi88&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA88 88]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After conquering Egypt, Khosrau sent Heraclius the following letter:
{{quotation|Khosrau, greatest of Gods, and master of the earth, to Heraclius, his vile and insensate slave. Why do you still refuse to submit to our rule, and call yourself a king? Have I not destroyed the Greeks? You say that you trust in your God. Why has he not delivered out of my hand [[Kayseri|Caesarea]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Alexandria]]? And shall I not also destroy Constantinople? But I will pardon your faults if you submit to me, and come hither with your wife and children; and I will give you lands, vineyards, and olive groves, and look upon you with a kindly aspect. Do not deceive yourself with vain hope in that [[Christ]], who was not able to save himself from the [[Jews]], who killed him by nailing him to a cross. Even if you take refuge in the depths of the sea, I will stretch out my hand and take you, whether you will or no.|[[Khosrau II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA206 206–207]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies245&quot;/&gt;}}

===Anatolia===
{{main|Shahin's invasion of Asia Minor (615)}}
When the Sasanians reached [[Chalcedon]] in 615, it was at this point, according to [[Sebeos]], that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was about ready to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Roman Empire to become a Persian [[client state]], as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|page=141}}{{sfn|Pourshariati|2010|page=1}} Things began to look even more grim for the Byzantines when Chalcedon fell in 617 to Shahin, making the Persians visible from Constantinople.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman207&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahin courteously received a peace delegation but claimed that he did not have the authority to engage in peace talks, directing Heraclius to Khosrau, who rejected the peace offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi84&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA84 84]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the Persian forces soon withdrew, probably to focus on their invasion of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|1975|p=724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3cBjc6QCBXkC&amp;pg=PA398 398]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Persians retained their advantage, capturing [[Ancyra]], an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. [[Rhodes]] and several other islands in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople.{{sfn|Kia|2016|page=223}}{{sfn|Greatrex|Lieu|2005|page=197}}{{sfn|Howard-Johnston|2006|page=33}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|1975|p=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to [[Carthage]] in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi88&quot;/&gt;

==Byzantine resurgence==

===Reorganization===
&lt;!--This is where the coin with the &quot;May God help the Romans&quot; image should go--&gt;
Khosrau's letter did not cow Heraclius but prompted him to try a desperate strike against the Persians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman207&quot;/&gt; He now reorganized the remainder of his empire to allow his forces to fight on. Already, in 615, a new, lighter (6.82&amp;nbsp;grams) [[Hexagram (currency)|silver imperial coin]] appeared with the usual image of Heraclius and his son [[Constantine III (Byzantine emperor)|Heraclius Constantine]], but uniquely carried the inscription of ''Deus adiuta Romanis'' or &quot;May God help the Romans&quot;; Kaegi believes this shows the desperation of the empire at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi90&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA90 90]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copper ''[[follis]]'' also dropped in weight from 11&amp;nbsp;grams to somewhere between 8 and 9&amp;nbsp;grams. Heraclius faced severely decreased revenues due to the loss of provinces; furthermore, a plague broke out in 619, which further damaged the tax base and also increased fears of divine retribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA105 105]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[debasement]] of the coinage allowed the Byzantines to maintain expenditure in the face of declining revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi90&quot;/&gt;

Heraclius now halved the pay of officials, enforced increased taxation, forced loans, and levied extreme fines on corrupt officials in order to finance his counter-offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich91&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite disagreements over the incestuous marriage of Heraclius to his niece Martina, the clergy of the Byzantine Empire strongly backed his efforts against the Persians by proclaiming the duty of all Christian men to fight and by offering to give him a war loan consisting of all the gold and silver-plated objects in Constantinople. Precious metals and bronze were stripped from monuments and even the [[Hagia Sophia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA110 110]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This military campaign has been seen as the first &quot;crusade&quot;, or at least as an antecedent to the [[Crusades]], by many historians, beginning with [[William of Tyre]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Davies245&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7zN4crdeEWoC&amp;pg=PA245 245]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman207&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chrysostomides|Dendrinos|Herrin|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xrbg8_8lrzoC&amp;pg=PA219 219]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Runciman|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_sWBOzEleMC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some, like Kaegi, disagree with this moniker because religion was just one component in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi126&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA126 126]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of volunteers were gathered and equipped with money from the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman207&quot;/&gt; Heraclius himself decided to command the army from the front lines. Thus, the Byzantine troops had been replenished, re-equipped, and were now led by a competent general&amp;mdash; while maintaining a full treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman207&quot;/&gt;

Historian [[George Ostrogorsky]] believed that volunteers were gathered through the reorganization of Anatolia into four [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themes]], where the volunteers were given inalienable grants of land on the condition of hereditary military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir7CKnBxRXwC&amp;pg=PA95 95&amp;ndash;98];[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir7CKnBxRXwC&amp;pg=PA101 101]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars generally discredit this theory, placing the creation of the themes later, under Heraclius' successor [[Constans II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&amp;pg=PA316 316]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldon|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA211 211&amp;ndash;217]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine counter-offensive===
{{Main|Heraclius' campaign of 622}}
By 622, Heraclius was ready to mount a counter-offensive. He left Constantinople the day after celebrating Easter on Sunday, 4 April 622.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His young son, [[Heraclius Constantine]], was left behind as regent under the charge of [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Sergius]] and the patrician [[Bonus (patrician)|Bonus]]. He spent the summer training to improve the skills of his men and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich91&quot;/&gt; This forced the Persian forces in Anatolia under [[Shahrbaraz]] to retreat from the front-lines of Bithynia and Galatia to eastern Anatolia in order to block his access to Persia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi115&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What followed next is not entirely clear, but Heraclius certainly won a crushing victory over Shahrbaraz in the fall of 622.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA112 114]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key factor was Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by [[feigned retreat|feigning retreat]] during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite [[Optimatoi]] assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi115&quot;/&gt; Thus he saved Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius had to return to Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], so he left his army to winter in [[Pontus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich91&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA116 116]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avar threat===
While the Byzantines were occupied with the Persians, the Avars and [[Slavs]] poured into the Balkans, capturing several Byzantine cities, including [[Singidunum]] (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (Kostolac), [[Naissus]] (Niš), and [[Serdica]] (Sofia), while destroying [[Salona]] in 614. [[Isidore of Seville]] even claims that the Slavs took &quot;Greece&quot; from the Byzantines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Avars also began to raid [[Thrace]], threatening commerce and agriculture, even near the gates of Constantinople.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi95&quot;/&gt; However, numerous attempts by the Avars and Slavs to take [[Thessalonica]], the most important Byzantine city in the Balkans after Constantinople, ended in failure, allowing the Empire to hold onto a vital stronghold in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir7CKnBxRXwC&amp;pg=PA93 93]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other minor cities on the [[Adriatic]] coast like [[Zadar|Jadar]] (Zadar), [[Tragurium]] (Trogir), [[Budva|Butua]] (Budva), [[Scodra]] (Skadar), and [[Lissus]] (Ljes) also survived the invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir7CKnBxRXwC&amp;pg=PA94 94]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the need to defend against these incursions, the Byzantines could not afford to use all their forces against the Persians. Heraclius sent an envoy to the Avar [[Khagan]], saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to withdraw north of the Danube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman207&quot;/&gt; The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at [[Marmara Ereğli|Heraclea]] in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius agreed to this meeting, coming with his royal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they could hold him for ransom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman208&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA208 208]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraclius was fortunately warned in time and managed to escape, chased by the Avars all the way to Constantinople. However, many members of his court, as well as an alleged 70,000 Thracian peasants who came to see their Emperor, were captured and killed by the Khagan's men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this treachery, Heraclius was forced to give the Avars a subsidy of 200,000 [[solidus (coin)|solidi]] along with his illegitimate son [[John Athalarichos]], his nephew Stephen, and the illegitimate son of the patrician Bonus as hostages in return for peace. This left him more able to focus his war effort completely on the Persians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman208&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi120&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine assault on Persia===
Heraclius offered peace to Khosrau, presumably in 624, threatening otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrau rejected the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi122&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople to attack the Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi122&quot;/&gt; marching through [[Armenia]] and modern [[Azerbaijan]] to assault the core Persian lands directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich91&quot;/&gt; According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army of no more than 40,000, and most likely between 20,000&amp;ndash;24,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi125&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA125 125]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, in defiance of the earlier letter that Khosrau had sent him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi125&quot;/&gt;

Heraclius advanced along the [[Aras River|Araxes River]], destroying Persian-held [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], the capital of Armenia, and [[Nakhchivan City|Nakhchivan]]. At [[Ganzak]]a, Heraclius met Khosrau's army, some 40,000 strong. Using loyal [[Arabs]], he captured and killed some of Khosrau's guards, leading to the disintegration of the Persian army. Heraclius then destroyed the famous [[fire temple]] of [[Takht-e Soleymān|Takht-i-Suleiman]], an important [[Zoroastrian]] shrine.{{cref|e}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi127&quot;/&gt; Heraclius' raids went as far as the [[Gayshawan]], a residence of Khosrau in [[Adurbadagan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi127&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA127 127]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohammad adil rais-map1.PNG|alt=This map shows the approximate campaign paths of Heraclius in 624, 625, and 627-628|thumb|left|300px|Campaign map of Heraclius in 624, 625, and 627&amp;ndash;628 through Armenia, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia]]
Heraclius wintered in [[Caucasian Albania]], gathering forces for the next year.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi128&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khosrau was not content to let Heraclius quietly rest in Albania. He sent three armies, commanded by Shahrbaraz, Shahin, and [[Shahraplakan]], to try to trap and destroy Heraclius' forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi129&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahraplakan retook lands up as far as [[Siwnik]], aiming to capture the mountain passes. Shahrbaraz was sent to block Heraclius' retreat through [[Caucasian Iberia]], and Shahin was sent to block the [[Bitlis|Bitlis Pass]]. Heraclius, planning to engage the Persian armies separately, spoke to his worried [[Lazica|Lazic]], [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abasgian]], and Iberian allies and soldiers, saying: &quot;Do not let the number of our enemies disturb us. For, God willing, one will pursue ten thousand.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kaegi129&quot;/&gt;

Two soldiers who feigned desertion were sent to Shahrbaraz, claiming that the Byzantines were fleeing before Shahin. Due to jealousy between the Persian commanders, Shahrbaraz hurried with his army to take part in the glory of the victory. Heraclius met them at [[Tigranakert (Amid)|Tigranakert]] and routed the forces of Shahraplakan and Shahin one after the other. Shahin lost his baggage train, and Shahraplakan (according to one source) was killed, though he re-appears later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi129&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi130&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DJL204&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this victory, Heraclius crossed the Araxes and camped in the plains on the other side. Shahin, with the remnants of both his and Shahraplakan's armies joined Shahrbaraz in the pursuit of Heraclius, but marshes slowed them down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DJL204&quot;/&gt; At Aliovit, Shahrbaraz split his forces, sending some 6,000 troops to ambush Heraclius while the remainder of the troops stayed at Aliovit. Heraclius instead launched a surprise night attack on the Persian main camp in February 625, destroying it. Shahrbaraz only barely escaped, naked and alone, having lost his [[harem]], baggage, and men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi130&quot;/&gt;

Heraclius spent the rest of winter to the north of [[Lake Van]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi130&quot;/&gt; In 625, his forces attempted to push back towards the Euphrates. In a mere seven days, he bypassed [[Mount Ararat]] and the 200 miles along the [[Murat River|Arsanias River]] to capture [[Diyarbakr|Amida]] and [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Martyropolis]], important fortresses on the upper [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich91&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman210&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210 210]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi131&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heraclius then carried on towards the Euphrates, pursued by Shahrbaraz. According to Arab sources, he was stopped at the Satidama or Batman Su River and defeated; Byzantine sources, however, do not mention this incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi131&quot;/&gt; There was then another minor skirmish between Heraclius and Shahrbaraz at the [[Seyhan River|Sarus river]] near [[Adana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi132&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahrbaraz stationed his forces across the river from the Byzantines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich91&quot;/&gt; A bridge spanned the river, and the Byzantines immediately charged across. Shahrbaraz feigned retreat to lead the Byzantines into an ambush, and the vanguard of Heraclius' army was destroyed within minutes. The Persians, however, had neglected to cover the bridge, and Heraclius charged across with the rearguard, unafraid of the arrows that the Persians fired, turning the tide of battle against the Persians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich92&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahrbaraz expressed his admiration at Heraclius to a renegade Greek: &quot;See your Emperor! He fears these arrows and spears no more than would an anvil!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich92&quot;/&gt; The [[Battle of Sarus]] was a successful retreat for the Byzantines that [[panegyrists]] magnified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi132&quot;/&gt; In the aftermath of the battle, the Byzantine army wintered at [[Trabzon|Trebizond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich92&quot;/&gt;

==Climax of the war==

===Siege of Constantinople===
{{main|Siege of Constantinople (626)}}
[[File:Moldovita murals 2010 16.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Siege of Constantinople in 626 by the combined Sassanid, Avar, and Slavic forces depicted on the [[murals]] of the [[Moldovița Monastery]], [[Romania]]]]
Khosrau, seeing that a decisive counterattack was needed to defeat the Byzantines, recruited two new armies from all the able men, including foreigners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich92&quot;/&gt; [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] was entrusted with 50,000 men and stayed in Mesopotamia and Armenia to prevent Heraclius from invading Persia; a smaller army under [[Shahrbaraz]] slipped through Heraclius' flanks and bee-lined for Chalcedon, the Persian base across the Bosphorus from Constantinople. Khosrau also coordinated with the Khagan of the Avars so as to launch a coordinated attack on Constantinople from both European and Asiatic sides.&lt;ref name = &quot;Oman210&quot; /&gt; The Persian army stationed themselves at Chalcedon, while the Avars placed themselves on the European side of Constantinople and destroyed the [[Valens Aqueduct|Aqueduct of Valens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&amp;pg=PA297 297]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[Byzantine navy]]'s control of the Bosphorus strait, however, the Persians could not send troops to the European side to aid their ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Kaegi140&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduced the effectiveness of the siege, because the Persians were experts in siege warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier179&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|pp=179–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Persians and Avars had difficulties communicating across the guarded Bosphorus—though undoubtedly, there was some communication between the two forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman210&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense of Constantinople was under the command of Patriarch [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Sergius]] and the patrician [[Bonus (patrician)|Bonus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman211&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 211]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the news, Heraclius split his army into three parts; although he judged that the capital was relatively safe, he still sent some reinforcements to Constantinople to boost the morale of the defenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman211&quot;/&gt; Another part of the army was under the command of his brother Theodore and was sent to deal with Shahin, while the third and smallest part would remain under his own control, intending to raid the Persian heartland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich92&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cherub plaque Louvre MRR245.jpg|alt=The right panel shows Emperor Heraclius, in armor, holding a sword and preparing to strike the submissive Khosrau. The left panel shows a cherub with palms open.|thumb|280px|left|[[Cherub]] and Heraclius receiving the submission of Khosrau II; plaque from a cross ([[Champlevé]] [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] over gilt copper, 1160-1170, [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]).]]

On 29 June 626, a coordinated assault on the walls began. Inside the walls, some 12,000 well-trained Byzantine cavalry troops (presumably dismounted) defended the city against the forces of some 80,000 Avars and Slavs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich92&quot;/&gt; Despite continuous bombardment for a month, morale was high inside the walls of Constantinople because of Patriarch Sergius' religious fervor and his processions along the wall with the icon of the [[Virgin Mary]], inspiring the belief that the Byzantines were under divine protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich93&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August, a fleet of Persian rafts ferrying troops across the Bosphorus were surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the [[Golden Horn]], while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from August 6 to the 7th also failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over.&lt;ref name = &quot;Oman211&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich93&quot;/&gt; In thanks for the lifting of the siege and the supposed divine protection of the Virgin Mary, the celebrated [[Akathist Hymn]] was written by an unknown author, possibly Patriarch Sergius or [[George of Pisidia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kimball|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1tV-Vb2EiRAC&amp;pg=PA176 176]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekonomou|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DWH3CDxSqpgC&amp;pg=PA285 285]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gambero|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dsZzsAtggnUC&amp;pg=PA338 338]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, after the emperor showed Shahrbaraz intercepted letters from Khosrau ordering the Persian general's death, the latter switched to Heraclius' side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, where he could easily decide to support either Khosrau or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrau's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy of some of his best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine-Turkic alliance===
{{Main|Third Perso-Turkic War}}
{{further information|Byzantine silk}}
During the siege of Constantinople, Heraclius formed an alliance with people Byzantine sources called the &quot;[[Khazars]],&quot; under [[Ziebel]], now generally identified as the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] of the [[Göktürks]], led by [[Tong Yabghu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; plying him with wondrous gifts and the promise of marriage to the ''[[porphyrogenita]]'' [[Eudoxia Epiphania]]. Earlier, in 568, the Turks under [[Istämi]] had turned to Byzantium when their relations with Persia soured over commerce issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Khanam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_189OeDwSMC&amp;pg=PA782 782]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Istämi sent an embassy led by the [[Sogdia]]n diplomat Maniah directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to [[Justin II]], but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct [[Silk Road|Chinese silk trade]] desired by the Sogdians.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Xinru, &quot;The Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Interactions in Eurasia&quot;, in ''Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History'', ed. Michael Adas, American Historical Association, Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael C., ''Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies: the Role of Cross Border Trade and Travel'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2012, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turks, based in the [[Caucasus]], responded by sending 40,000 of their men to ravage the Persian empire in 626, marking the start of the [[Third Perso-Turkic War]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Norwich92&quot;/&gt; Joint Byzantine and Göktürk operations were then focused on besieging [[Tiflis]], where the Byzantines used [[Trebuchet#Traction trebuchet|traction trebuchet]]s to breach the walls, one of the first known uses by the Byzantines.{{cref|f}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dennis|1998|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khosrau sent 1,000 cavalry under Shahraplakan to reinforce the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it nevertheless fell, probably in late 628.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziebel died by the end of that year, however, saving Epiphania from marriage to a barbarian.&lt;ref name = &quot;Norwich92&quot;/&gt; Whilst the siege proceeded, Heraclius worked to secure his base in the upper Tigris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman211&quot;/&gt;

===Battle of Nineveh===
{{main|Battle of Nineveh (627)}}
[[File:Battle of nineveh-mohammad adil rais.PNG|alt=Both Heraclius and the Persians approached from the east of Nineveh. Persian reinforcements were near Mosul. After the battle, Heraclius went back east while the Persians looped back to Nineveh itself before following Heraclius again.|thumb|right|Maneuvers before and after the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Battle of Nineveh]]]]

In mid-September 627, Heraclius invaded the Persian heartland in a surprising winter campaign, leaving [[Ziebel]] to continue the siege of Tiflis.  [[Edward Luttwak]] describes the seasonal retreat of Heraclius for the winters of 624–626 followed by a change in 627 to threaten Ctesiphon as a &quot;high-risk, ''relational'' maneuver on a theater-wide scale&quot; because it habituated the Persians to strategically ineffective raids that caused them to decide not to recall border troops to defend the heartland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; His army numbered between 25,000 and 50,000 Byzantine troops and 40,000 Göktürks that quickly deserted him because of the unfamiliar winter conditions and harassment from the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=158&amp;ndash;159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier213&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advanced quickly but was tailed by a Persian army under the Armenian [[Rhahzadh]], who faced difficulties in provisioning his army due to the Byzantines taking most of the provisions as they moved south toward [[Assyria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier213&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi159&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier215&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the year, near the ruins of [[Nineveh]], Heraclius engaged Rhahzadh before reinforcements could reach the Persian commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Battle of Nineveh]] took place in the fog, reducing the Persian advantage in missile troops. Heraclius feigned retreat, leading the Persians to the plains, before reversing his troops to the surprise of the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight hours of fighting, the Persians suddenly retreated to nearby foothills, but the battle did not become a rout.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, approximately 6,000 Persians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Patriarch Nikephoros]]' ''Brief History'' suggests that Rhahzadh challenged Heraclius to personal combat, and that Heraclius accepted and killed Rhahzadh in a single thrust; two other challengers fought against him and also lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he received an injury to his lip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farrokh|2007|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the war===
With no Persian army left to oppose him, Heraclius' victorious army plundered [[Dastagird]], which was a palace of Khosrau's, and gained tremendous riches while recovering 300 captured Byzantine flags.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi173&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khosrau had already fled to the mountains of [[Susiana]] to try to rally support for the defense of [[Ctesiphon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman211&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich93&quot;/&gt; Heraclius then issued an ultimatum to Khosrau:{{quotation|''I pursue and run after peace. I do not willingly burn Persia, but compelled by you. Let us now throw down our arms and embrace peace. Let us quench the fire before it burns up everything.''|Heraclius' ultimatum to Khosrau II, 6 January 628&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, Heraclius could not attack Ctesiphon itself, as the [[Nahrawan Canal]] was blocked due to the collapse of a bridge leading over it,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi173&quot;/&gt; and he did not attempt to bypass the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, the Persian army rebelled and overthrew Khosrau II, raising his son [[Kavadh II]], also known as Siroes, in his stead. Khosrau was shut in a dungeon, where he suffered for five days on bare sustenance&amp;mdash;he was shot to death slowly with arrows on the fifth day.&lt;ref name = &quot;Norwich94&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kavadh immediately sent peace offers to Heraclius. Heraclius did not impose harsh terms, knowing that his own empire was also near exhaustion. Under the terms of the peace treaty, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a [[war indemnity]], and most importantly for them, the [[True Cross]] and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich94&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman212&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA212 212]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA178 178], [https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA189 189–190]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

===Short-term consequences===

Saint Helena is prominently but anachronistically depicted on a white horse. An angel looks on above.]]
After some months of travel, Heraclius entered Constantinople in triumph and was met by the people of the city, his son Heraclius Constantine, and Patriarch Sergius, prostrating themselves in joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=185–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; His alliance with the Persians resulted in the recovery of the [[Holy Sponge]] which fastened to the True Cross in an elaborate ceremony on 14 September 629.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA189 189]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial parade went toward the [[Hagia Sophia]]. There, the True Cross was slowly raised up until it vertically towered over the high altar. To many, this was a sign that a new golden age was about to begin for the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich94&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bury|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wDIJNvWb48YC&amp;pg=PA245 245]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victorious conclusion of the war cemented Heraclius' position as one of history's most successful generals. He was hailed as &quot;the new [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]]&quot; for his six years of unbroken victories and for leading the Roman army where no Roman army had ever gone before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies245&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oman212&quot;/&gt; The triumphal raising of the True Cross in the Hagia Sophia was a crowning moment in his achievements. Had Heraclius died then, he would have been recorded in history, in the words of the historian [[Norman Davies]], as &quot;the greatest Roman general since [[Julius Caesar]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies245&quot;/&gt; Instead, he lived through the [[Arab invasions]], losing battle after battle against their onslaught and tarnishing his reputation for victory. John Norwich succinctly described Heraclius as having &quot;lived too long&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, the Sassanids struggled to establish a stable government. When [[Kavadh II]] died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. [[Ardashir III]], Heraclius' ally [[Shahrbaraz]], and Khosrau's daughters [[Purandokht]] and [[Azarmidokht]] all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when [[Yazdgerd III]], a grandson of Khosrau II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability, but by then it was too late to rescue the Sassanid kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uLARyWXlhDYC&amp;pg=PA121 121]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term consequences===
{{further|Muslim conquests|Islamic conquest of Persia|Byzantine–Arab Wars}}
The devastating impact of the war of 602–628, along with the cumulative effects of a century of almost continuous Byzantine-Persian conflict, left both empires crippled. The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation to finance Khosrau II's campaigns, religious unrest, and the increasing power of the provincial landholders at the expense of the [[Shah]].&lt;ref name = HJ291&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard-Johnston|2006|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Howard-Johnston: &quot;[Heraclius'] victories in the field over the following years and their political repercussions ... saved the main bastion of Christianity in the Near East and gravely weakened its old [[Zoroastrian]] rival. They may be shadowed by the even more extraordinary military achievements of the Arabs in the following two decades, but hindsight should not be allowed to dim their lustre.&quot;&lt;ref name = HJ9&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard-Johnston|2006|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Byzantine Empire was also severely affected, with the Balkans now largely in the hands of the Slavs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Haldon43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldon|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA43 43&amp;ndash;45], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA66 66], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA71 71], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA114 114&amp;ndash;115]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Anatolia had been devastated by repeated Persian invasions, and the empire's hold on its recently regained territories in the Caucasus, Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Egypt was loosened by years of Persian occupation.{{cref|g}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Haldon49–50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldon|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA49 49&amp;ndash;50]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their financial reserves exhausted, the Byzantines found difficulties paying veterans of the war with the Persians and recruiting new troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haldon43&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|1995|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|1995|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Foss called this war the &quot;first stage in the process which marked the end of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] in Asia Minor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|1975|p=747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither empire was given much chance to recover, as within a few years they were struck by the onslaught of the Arabs, newly united by [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|1975|pp=746–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Howard-Johnston likened to &quot;a human tsunami&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard-Johnston|2006|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Liska, the &quot;unnecessarily prolonged Byzantine&amp;ndash;Persian conflict opened the way for Islam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liska|1998|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sassanid Empire rapidly succumbed to these attacks and was completely destroyed. During the [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]], the exhausted Byzantine Empire's recently regained eastern and southern provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] were also lost, reducing the empire to a territorial rump consisting of Anatolia and a scatter of islands and footholds in the Balkans and Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haldon49–50&quot;/&gt; However, unlike Persia, the Byzantine Empire ultimately survived the Arab assault, holding onto its residual territories and decisively repulsing two Arab sieges of its capital in [[Siege of Constantinople (674)|674&amp;ndash;678]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|717&amp;ndash;718]].&lt;ref name= HJ9 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldon|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA61 61&amp;ndash;62]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Empire also lost its territories in [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy]] to the Arabs in [[Byzantine–Arab Wars (780–1180)|later conflicts]], though these too were ultimately [[Byzantine reconquest|recovered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Balearic Islands]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]] were captured by Arabs and [[Corsica]] by [[Lombards]] by 8th century. Also, [[Visigoths]] captured [[Spania]], Byzantine holdings in [[Spain]] by 629.

==Composition of the armies and strategy==
{{Main|Byzantine army|Byzantine battle tactics|Sassanid army}}
The elite cavalry corps of the Persians was the [[Savārān cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farrokh|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aQspOf291_cC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lance was probably their preferred weapon, having the power to skewer two men simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farrokh|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aQspOf291_cC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their horses were covered in [[lamellar armor]] to protect them from enemy archers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farrokh|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aQspOf291_cC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persian archers had a lethal range of about 175 meters and accurate range at about 50–60 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farrokh|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aQspOf291_cC&amp;pg=PA14 14]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Emperor Maurice's ''[[Strategicon of Maurice|Strategikon]]'', a manual of war, the Persians made heavy use of archers that were the most &quot;rapid, although not powerful archery&quot; of all warlike nations, and they avoided weather that hampered their bows.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier179&quot;/&gt; It claims that they deployed so that their formation was equal in strength in the center and the flanks. They also apparently avoided the charge of Roman lancers by using rough terrain since they tended to avoid hand-to-hand combat. Thus, the ''Strategikon'' advised fighting on level terrain with rapid charges to avoid the Persian arrows. They were seen as skilled in laying siege and liked to &quot;achieve their results by planning and generalship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier179&quot;/&gt;

The most important arm of the Byzantine army was its [[cataphract]] cavalry, which became a symbol of Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gabriel|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC&amp;pg=PA281 281]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wore chain mail, had heavily armored horses, and used lances as their primary weapon. They had small shields mounted on their arms, could also use bows, and carried a broadsword and an axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gabriel|2002|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavy Byzantine infantry, or ''scutati'', carried small round shields and wore lamellar armor. They carried many weapons against enemy cavalry such as spears to ward off cavalry and axes to cut the legs off of horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gabriel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC&amp;pg=PA282 282–83]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light Byzantine infantry, or ''psiloi'', primarily used bows and wore only leather armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gabriel|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine infantry played a key role in stabilizing battle lines against enemy cavalry and also as an anchor to launch friendly cavalry attacks. According to Richard A. Gabriel, the Byzantine heavy infantry &quot;combined the best capabilities of the Roman legion with the old Greek phalanx.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gabriel|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC&amp;pg=PA288 288]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Avars had mounted archers with composite bows that could double as heavy cavalry with lances. They were skilled in siegecraft and could construct trebuchets and siege towers. In their siege of Constantinople, they constructed walls of [[circumvallation]] to prevent easy counterattack and used mantelets or wooden frames covered with animal hides to protect against defending archers. Furthermore, like many nomads, they gathered other warriors such as Gepids and Slavs to assist them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3cBjc6QCBXkC&amp;pg=PA395 395–96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Avars depended on raiding the countryside for supplies, it was difficult for them to maintain long sieges, especially when considering their less mobile gathered allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kaegi, the Byzantines had &quot;an almost compulsive ... preference to avoid changing the essential elements of the status quo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|1995|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tried with all diplomatic means to secure allies and divide their enemies. Although they failed against Khosrau and the Avar Khagan, their ties with the Slavs who would become the Serbs and Croats and their decades-long negotiations with the Göktürks resulted in Slavs actively opposing the Avars in addition to a key alliance with the Göktürks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for any army, logistics were always a problem. In his initial campaigns in Byzantine territories, especially in Anatolia, Heraclius likely supplied his troops by requisitioning from his surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3cBjc6QCBXkC&amp;pg=PA400 400]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Heraclius' offensive raids into Persia, each time the harsh conditions of winter forced him to desist, partly because both his and the Persian horses needed stored fodder in winter quarters. Forcing his troops to campaign in the winter would be risky as Maurice had been overthrown due to his poor treatment of his troops in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3cBjc6QCBXkC&amp;pg=PA400 400–01]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Luttwak believes that the Göktürks with their &quot;hardy horses (or ponies)&quot; that could survive &quot;in almost any terrain that had almost any vegetation&quot; were essential in Heraclius' winter campaign in hilly northeast Iran in 627.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=403–04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign, they took the provisions from Persian lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi159&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;frontier215&quot;/&gt; With the victory at Nineveh and the capture of Persian palaces, they no longer had issues with supplying their troops in foreign territories and with winter conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=405–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The sources for this war are mostly of Byzantine origin. Foremost among the contemporary Greek texts is the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'' by an unidentified author from around 630.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier182&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zoZIxpQ8A2IC&amp;pg=PT214 182–83]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George of Pisidia]] wrote many poems and other works that were contemporary. [[Theophylact Simocatta]] has surviving letters along with a history that gives the political outlook of the Byzantines, but that history only really covers from 582 to 602.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier182&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frontierxxvi&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore the Synkellos has a surviving speech, which was made during the Siege of Constantinople in 626, that contains useful information for some events. There are some surviving papyri from Egypt from that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi7&quot;/&gt;

The Persian archives were lost so there are no contemporary Persian sources of this war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi65&quot;/&gt; However, [[al-Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' uses now lost sources and contains a history of the Sassanid dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontierxxvi&quot;/&gt; Non-Greek contemporary sources include the ''Chronicle'' of [[John of Nikiu]], which was written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]] but only survives in Ethiopian translation, and the ''History'' attributed to [[Sebeos]] (there is controversy over the authorship). The latter is an Armenian compilation of various sources, arranged in only rough chronological order. This gives it an uneven coverage of the war. Furthermore, it was put together with the purpose of correlating Biblical prophecy and contemporary times, making it most certainly not objective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA8 8]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some surviving Syriac materials from that period, which Dodgeon, Greatrex, and Lieu believe are the &quot;most important&quot; of the contemporary sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier182&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi8&quot;/&gt; These include the ''Chronicle of 724'' by [[Thomas the Presbyter]], composed in 640. The ''Chronicle of Guidi'' or ''Khuzistan Chronicle'' gives the perspective of a [[Nestorian Christian]] living in Persian territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier182&quot;/&gt;

Later Greek accounts include ''Chronicle'' of [[Theophanes the Confessor]] and the ''Brief History'' of Patriarch Nikephoros I. Theophanes' ''Chronicle'' is very useful in creating a framework of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually supplemented by even later Syriac sources like the ''Chronicle of 1234'' and the Chronicle by [[Michael the Syrian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier182&quot;/&gt; However, these sources, excepting the ''Brief History'' by Nikephoros, and the Christian Arab [[Agapius of Hierapolis]] all likely drew their information from a common source, probably the 8th-century historian Theophilos of Edessa.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier182&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi9&quot;/&gt;

The 10th-century Armenian ''History of the House of Artsrunik'' by [[Thomas Artsruni]] probably have similar sources to the ones that the compiler of Sebeos used. [[Movses Kaghankatvatsi]] wrote the ''History of Armenia'' in the 10th century and has material from unidentified sources on the 620s.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontierxxv&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard-Johnston considered the histories of Movses and Sebeos as &quot;the most important of extant non-Muslim sources&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard-Johnston|2006|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria]] contains many errors, but is a useful source. The Quran also provides some detail, but can only be used cautiously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi9&quot;/&gt;

The Byzantine [[hagiography|hagiographies]] (lives of saints), of Saints [[Theodore of Sykeon]] and [[Anastasios the Persian]] have proven to be helpful in understanding the era of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi9&quot;/&gt; The ''Life of George of Khozeba'' gives an idea of the panic at the time of the Siege of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier192&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some doubts as to whether hagiographic texts may be corrupted from 8th or 9th century interpolations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Numismatics]], or the study of coins, has proven useful to dating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss729&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|1975|pp=729–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigillography]], or the study of seals, is also used for dating. Art and other archaeological findings are also of some use. [[Epigraphic]] sources or inscriptions are of limited use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi10&quot;/&gt; Luttwak called the ''[[Strategicon of Maurice|Strategikon]]'' of Maurice the &quot;most complete Byzantine field manual&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttwak|2009|pp=268–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I don't have the exact page of the Luttwak quote, if anyone can edit that in it'd be awesome--&gt; it provides valuable insight into the military thinking and practices of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes and Citations==

===Notes===
{{cnote|a|All dates, especially between 602–620 are only approximate. This is primarily because many popular sources like [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]]' Chronicles are all drawn from a common source, thought to be a history by [[Theophilus of Edessa]]. Thus, there are few independent witnesses of the following events, making reliable dating difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;frontier182&quot;/&gt;}}
{{cnote|b|The war had originally begun when [[Justin II]] had refused to give the Sassanids the usual tribute dating from the time of [[Justinian I]]. The successful conclusion to that war meant that the tribute was no longer paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|pp=79&amp;ndash;80}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{cnote|c|Some authors, including Dodgeon, Greatrex, and Lieu, have expressed the belief that the raid on Chalcedon is fictitious.&lt;ref name = &quot;frontier186&quot; /&gt; Either way, by 610, the Persians captured all the Byzantine cities east of the Euphrates.}}
{{cnote|d|Since the time of [[Theodosius I]], no Roman emperor had personally led troops in battle. Heraclius was the first soldier-emperor since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi69&quot;/&gt;}}
{{cnote|e|Thebarmes, described in [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]]' Chronicles, is usually identified with Takht-i-Suleiman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zoZIxpQ8A2IC&amp;pg=PT232 200]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{cnote|f|That was the first known usage of the term [[helepolis]] to describe the trebuchet, though earlier uses may be attested to in Emperor Maurice's ''[[Strategicon of Maurice|Strategikon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dennis|1998|pp=99–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{cnote|g|Ambivalence toward Byzantine rule on the part of [[monophysitism|monophysites]] may have lessened local resistance to the Arab expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haldon49–50&quot;/&gt;}}
