The '''S-class submarines''' of the [[Royal Navy]] were originally designed and built during the modernisation of the [[submarine]] force in the early 1930s to meet the need for smaller boats to patrol the restricted waters of the [[North Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], replacing the [[British H class submarine]]s. As part of the major naval construction for the Royal Navy during the Second World War, the ''S'' class became the largest single group of submarines ever built for the Royal Navy. A total of 62 was constructed over a period of 15 years, with fifty of the &quot;improved&quot; ''S''-class being launched between 1940 and 1945.

==Service==
The submarines operated in the waters around the [[United Kingdom]] and in the [[Mediterranean]], and later in the Far East after being fitted with extra tankage.
[[File:British S-class submarines in Service.png|thumb|right|300px|Number of S-class submarines in service by year.]]
After the war S-class boats continued to serve in the Royal Navy until the 1960s. The last operational boat in the Royal Navy was {{HMS|Sea Devil|P244|2}}, launched in 1945 and scrapped in February 1966. {{HMS|Springer||2}} was in Israeli service as INS ''Tanin'' and was decommissioned in 1972.

Several S-class submarines were sold on or lent to other navies:
*Netherlands 1
*Portugal    3
*France      4
*Israel      2. (HMS ''Springer'' as INS ''Tanin'' (S71), landed commandos and fought with an Egyptian ship in the [[Six Day War]])&lt;ref name=&quot;dotan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://submarines.dotan.net/sclasse/|title=Israeli S Class Submarines|website=submarines.dotan.net|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nrg&quot; /&gt;

A modified version was ordered by the Turkish navy in 1939 as the {{sclass-|Oruç Reis|submarine|4}}.

==Service losses==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[HMS Salmon (N65)]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;

Of the twelve S-class boats that were in service in 1939, only three survived to see the end of [[World War II]], a loss rate that inspired the song &quot;Twelve Little S-Boats&quot;, based on a [[nursery rhyme]] originally written by [[Septimus Winner]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Printed in Young (1952), who gives his source as Chief ERA &quot;Skips&quot; Marriott. {{cite book

The first group of S-class submarines consisted of four boats.  They were smaller and slower than later classes, and carried less armament, but could be crewed by fewer men.  All four were built at Chatham Dockyard, between 1930 and 1932.  During the war, they operated in home waters, particularly the [[English Channel]], and off the Scandinavian coast.  The later second and third groups of S-class submarines would have their fuel capacity expanded to allow them to operate further and overcome this limitation.

The mortality rate of these early boats was particularly high.  Only one, HMS ''Sturgeon'', survived to the end of the war.

=== Second group ===

The second group of S-class submarines consisted of eight boats.  They were larger than the preceding first group and required more men to crew, but carried a similar armament.  Construction was divided between Chatham Dockyard, and the yards of [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scotts]], of [[Greenock]] and [[Cammell Laird]] &amp; Co Limited, of [[Birkenhead]].  All the ships were built between 1934 and 1937.  During the war, they, like the submarines of the first group, mostly operated in home waters, ranging as far afield as the Bay of Biscay and the Scandinavian coast.  One, HMS ''Sunfish'', was assigned to the Soviet Navy (named ''V-1'') and was sunk by friendly aircraft on the transfer route from Dundee to [[Murmansk]].

A large percentage of these submarines were also lost during the war.  Only two, HMS ''Sealion'' and HMS ''Seawolf'' survived to the end of the war.

The third and by far the most numerous group of S-class submarines consisted of 50 boats.  They were the largest and most heavily armed of the S-class and required more men to crew.  They were one knot faster on the surface, but two knots slower when submerged.  Most of the group were built at the yards of either [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scotts]], of [[Greenock]] or [[Cammell Laird]] &amp; Co Limited, of [[Birkenhead]], with a handful being built at Chatham, or by [[Vickers Armstrongs|Vickers Armstrongs Ltd]], of [[Barrow-in-Furness]].  Construction was carried out throughout the war, particularly between 1941 and 1945.  Equipped with a greater fuel capacity than their predecessors, they operated much further afield, in the [[Mediterranean]] and in the [[Pacific]] far east.

There were two distinct subgroups. The first were boats of 842 tons, comprising those ordered under the 1939 War Emergency, 1940 and 1941 Programmes (except ''Sea Devil'' and ''Scotsman''), plus the ''Sturdy'' and ''Stygian'' of the 1942 Programme; these carried an external stern torpedo tube in addition to the six bow tubes. The second subgroup were boats of 814 tons, comprising the ''Sea Devil'' and ''Scotsman'' of the 1941 Programme, plus those ordered under the 1942 and 1943 Programmes (except ''Sturdy'' and ''Stygian''); these carried no external torpedo tube, but had a thicker welded pressure hull providing for an operational depth limit of 350 feet - compared with the 300 feet limit in the first subgroup.

Losses continued to be high.  Nine ships; ''P222'', ''Saracen'', ''Sahib'', ''Sickle'', ''Simoom'', ''Splendid'', ''Stonehenge'', ''Stratagem'' and ''Syrtis'' were lost during the war, and ''Shakespeare'' and ''Strongbow'' were so badly damaged that they were written off and scrapped.  Many surviving ships remained in service after the war.  ''Sportsman'', by now transferred to the French navy, was lost off Toulon in 1951 and ''Sidon'' was sunk after a torpedo malfunction in 1955.

Eight ships were ordered under the 1943 Programme, but only four were completed. The other four submarines was cancelled after the war ended in 1945, and they became surplus to peace time requirements.

* [[HMS Sanguine (P266)|HMS ''Sanguine'']]  Sold to Israel, recommissioned August 1959 as the INS Rahav &lt;ref name=&quot;dotan&quot; /&gt;
