The '''168th (2nd London) Brigade''' was an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] of the [[British Army]] that saw service during both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]]. Throughout its existence, serving under many different titles and designations, the brigade was an integral part of the [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]] throughout its existence, and again after the Second World War until it was finally disbanded in the 1960s.

==Formation==
The '''2nd London Brigade''' was first raised under the [[Haldane Reforms]] in 1908, upon the creation of the [[Territorial Force]] (TF) which was formed by the merger of the [[Yeomanry]] and the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]]. The 2nd London Brigade was assigned to the 1st London Division, one of fourteen [[Division (military)|division]]s of the peacetime Territorials. The brigade was composed of four volunteer battalions, three of the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and one of the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]], which later became the [[London Rifle Brigade|5th]], [[City of London Rifles|6th]], [[7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment|7th]] and [[Post Office Rifles|8th]] Territorial battalions of the [[London Regiment]].

==First World War==
The division was mobilised soon after the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]] in August 1914. According to the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] soldiers of the Territorial Force were only able for overseas service and, when asked to volunteer for [[Territorial Force Imperial Service Badge|overseas service]], the overwhelming majority of the men of the brigade (and the division) chose to do so. The men who didn't, together with the many new recruits, were formed into new 2nd Line battalions and brigades, the 2/2nd London Brigade, assigned to the 2/1st London Division, both later to become [[174th (2/2nd London) Brigade]] and [[58th (2/1st London) Division]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/58div.htm|title=The 58th (2/1st London) Division of the British Army in 1914-1918|work=1914-1918.net|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalions were also redesignated, adopting the '1/' prefix (1/5th Londons) to distinguish them from the 2nd Line battalions, which became '2/', 2/5th Londons.&lt;ref name=LLT_London&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1914-1918.net/london.htm | title=The London Regiment | last=Baker | first=Chris | publisher=The Long, Long Trail | accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|left|250px|British soldiers [[Chemical weapons in World War I|blinded by tear gas]]. [[Vera Brittain]] commented: ''&quot;Great mustard-coloured blisters, blind eyes, all sticky and stuck together, always fighting for breath, with voices a mere whisper, saying their throats are closing and they know they will choke.&quot;'']]

However, the 2nd London Brigade was broken up, as was the 1st London Division, in November 1914 when most of its battalions were posted elsewhere,&lt;ref name=&quot;1914-1918.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/56div.htm|title=The 56th (1st London) Division of the British Army in 1914-1918|work=1914-1918.net|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; either to reinforce the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] or to relieve troops of the [[Standing army|Regular Army]] around the [[British Empire]] for service in France and Belgium.

In February 1916, however, the division was reformed in France, to be known as the [[56th (London) Division|56th (1/1st London) Division]] and the brigade was reconstituted, now numbered as the '''168th (1/2nd London) Brigade''', with battalions from other brigades and divisions, the 1/4th London Regiment ([[Royal Fusiliers]]) originally coming from [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th (1/1st London) Brigade]],&lt;ref name=LLT_London/&gt; the [[The Rangers (British regiment)|12th]], [[Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment|13th]] and [[London Scottish (regiment)|14th Londons]]&lt;ref name=LLT_London/&gt; the latter two originally coming from [[140th (4th London) Brigade|140th (1/4th London) Brigade]], [[47th (1/2nd London) Division]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/47div.htm|title=The 47th (2nd London) Division of the British Army in 1914-1918|work=1914-1918.net|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 12th from [[169th (3rd London) Brigade|3rd London Brigade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;forces-war-records.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/units/4899/london-regiment/|title=London Regiment - Regiment History, War &amp; Military Records &amp; Archives|work=forces-war-records.co.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rest of the division, the brigade was destined to see service in the [[Trench warfare|trenches]] of the Western Front for the rest of the war, seeing first action at the [[First day on the Somme#Gommecourt|Gommecourt salient]], fighting in late June/early July 1916 alongside the [[46th (North Midland) Division]] in an diversionary attempt to distract the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s attention away from the impending [[Battle of the Somme|Somme offensive]]. The attack was a failure, and served only to cause heavy casualties on both attacking divisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gommecourt.co.uk/plan.htm|title=Gommecourt - Planning the Offensive|work=gommecourt.co.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 56th Division suffering nearly 5,000 losses.

The division also fought on the [[Hindenburg Line]] in March 1917, followed by the battles of [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]], [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Langemarck]], [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] (also known as Third Ypres), [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]] (which saw the first use of large numbers [[tank]]s in warfare), [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|Second battles of the Somme]], [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Albert]], and the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], which saw the First World War eventually ending on [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|11 November 1918]]. Throughout its two years of combat, the 56th (1/1st London) Division had suffered well over 35,000 casualties, with the great majority of them being in the infantry, commonly nicknamed the &quot;''Poor Bloody Infantry''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battlefields1418.50megs.com/56division.htm|title=56th (London) Division 1916-1918|work=50megs.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order of battle===
The brigade was composed as follows during the war:
* 1/5th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment ([[London Rifle Brigade]]) ''(left November 1914)''
* 1/6th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment ([[City of London Rifles]]) ''(left November 1914)''
* [[7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment|1/7th (City of London) Battalion]], London Regiment ''(left November 1914)''
* 1/8th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment ([[Post Office Rifles]]) ''(left November 1914)''
* 1/4th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment ([[Royal Fusiliers]]) ''(from February 1916)''
* 1/12th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment ([[The Rangers (British regiment)|The Rangers]]) ''(from February 1916, left January 1918)''
* [[Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment|1/13th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Kensington)]] ''(from February 1916)''
* 1/14th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment ([[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish]]) ''(from February 1916)''
* 168th Machine Gun Company, [[Machine Gun Corps]] ''(formed 16 March 1916, moved to 56th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 1 March 1918)''
* 168th Trench Mortar Battery ''(formed 13 June 1916)''&lt;ref name=&quot;1914-1918.net&quot;/&gt;

In early 1918, due to a [[Role of Douglas Haig in 1918#Manpower|manpower shortage]], it was decided to reduce British infantry brigades serving in France and Belgium from four to three battalions. As a consequence, on 31 January 1918, the 1/12th Londons were transferred to the [[175th (2/3rd London) Brigade]], 58th (2/1st London) Division where they absorbed the 2/12th Battalion and, once again, became the 12th Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;forces-war-records.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

==Between the wars==
The Territorial Force was disbanded after the Great War and later reformed in 1920 and renamed in the same year as the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The division and the brigade were also reformed as '''168th (2nd London) Infantry Brigade''', with the same composition it had before the First World War and would remain this way for much of the inter-war period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/56_Division__1930_36_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, however, the [[7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment]] and [[Post Office Rifles|8th (City of London) Battalion]] were amalgamated to create the [[7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment|7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Post Office Rifles)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L08PO.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227025146/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L08PO.htm|title=8th City of London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) [UK]|archivedate=27 December 2005|work=regiments.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th Battalion was replaced in the brigade by the [[Honourable Artillery Company|Honourable Artillery Company Infantry Battalion]]. The following year they dropped the 'battalion' from their title, becoming simply, for example, [[City of London Rifles|6th City of London Regiment (City of London Rifles)]].

In the late 1930s the need to increase the anti-aircraft defences of the United Kingdom, particularly so for London and Southern England, was addressed by converting a number of Territorial Army infantry battalions into anti-aircraft or searchlight units, of either the [[Royal Engineers]] or [[Royal Artillery]]. As a result, in 1935, the 6th City of London Regiment (City of London Rifles) was also converted, transferring to the Royal Engineers and becoming [[City of London Rifles|31st (City of London Rifles) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L06.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227002002/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L06.htm|title=6th City of London Regiment (City of London Rifles) [UK]|archivedate=27 December 2005|work=regiments.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining [[28th (Thames and Medway) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|28th (Themes and Medway) Anti-Aircraft Group]], part of [[1st Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|1st Anti-Aircraft Division]], converted from the Headquarters of [[47th (1/2nd London) Division|47th (2nd London) Infantry Division]]. In the same year the 7th London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) was transferred to the Royal Engineers and converted into [[7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment|32nd (7th City of London) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L07.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227015808/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L07.htm|title=7th City of London Regiment [UK]|archivedate=27 December 2005|work=regiments.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming part of [[27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Brigade|27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Group]] of the 1st Anti-Aircraft Division. With the disbandment of 47th (2nd London) Infantry Division in early 1936 the 56th Division was redesignated as [[56th (London) Division|The London Division]] and the brigade became simply the '''2nd London Infantry Brigade'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/The_London_Division__1937_38_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To replace those battalions converted were the [[Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment|13th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Kensington)]] and the [[London Scottish (regiment)|14th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (London Scottish)]], both previously from [[140th (4th London) Brigade|140th (4th London) Infantry Brigade]] of the now disbanded 47th Division.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/47_Division__1930_36_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 all British infantry brigades were reduced from four to three battalions and so the Honourable Artillery Company Infantry Battalion was transferred elsewhere to become an [[Officers' Training Corps|Officer Cadet Training Unit]]. In the same year the London Regiment was disbanded and the battalions all became part of their own parent regiments: the [[London Rifle Brigade]] became part of the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]] and was redesignated the London Rifle Brigade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L05LRB.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104205918/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L05LRB.htm|title=London Rifle Brigade [UK]|archivedate=4 January 2006|work=regiments.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 13th Londons became part of the [[Middlesex Regiment|Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own)]] and became the [[Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L13kens.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104051439/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L13kens.htm|title=Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment [UK]|archivedate=4 January 2006|work=regiments.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 14th Londons became part of the [[Gordon Highlanders]] and became the [[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L14scot.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104210517/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L14scot.htm|title=The London Scottish [UK]|archivedate=4 January 2006|work=regiments.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 1938 the Kensingtons was converted into a machine gun battalion and left the brigade, coming under command of [[London District (British Army)|London District]], and was replaced in the brigade by the [[Queen's Westminsters]] ([[King's Royal Rifle Corps]]), previously from the 140th (4th London) Infantry Brigade from the now disbanded 47th Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/1-London-Division-1939-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion had previously been the 9th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Queen Victoria's) and, in 1922, 9th London Regiment (Queen Victoria's)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L09QVR.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226172715/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-london/vinf/L09QVR.htm|title=Queen Victoria's Rifles [UK]|archivedate=26 December 2005|work=regiments.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final change of 1938 saw the brigade, in line with the rest of the London Division, reorganised and converted into a [[Motorized infantry|motorised infantry]] brigade/division, although with very little equipment.

==Second World War==
The brigade, together with the rest of the division and most of the rest of the Territorial Army, was mobilised between late August and early September 1939. On 1 September 1939 [[Invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded]] by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], and two days before the [[World War II|Second World War]] officially began, when both Britain and France declaring war on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Inadequately armed and equipped, the brigade began home defence and training duties and, as some units were understrength, had to be brought up to their War Establishment strength through large drafts of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militiamen]] (essentially [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscripts]] who had only just completed basic training in late October 1939).

The division was not sent to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in France, but instead moved to [[Kent]] in April 1940, joining [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]]. When most of the BEF was forced to [[Battle of Dunkirk|retreat to Dunkirk]] during the disastrous [[Battle of France]] in mid-1940 the division assumed a defensive posture and alternated between coastal defence duties and training to repel an expected [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]] which never arrived, due mainly to events that happened in the [[Battle of Britain]] and the German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in mid-1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

In June 1940 the division was reorganised as a standard infantry division&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; with the arrival of a third brigade, the [[35th Brigade (United Kingdom)|35th Infantry]], from the [[12th (Eastern) Division|12th (Eastern) Infantry Division]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/12-Infantry-Division-1940-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which had fought in France and suffered severe losses. On 18 November 1940 the division was redesignated [[56th (London) Infantry Division]]&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Joslen, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 28 November the 2nd London Infantry Brigade was renumbered as the '''168th (London) Infantry Brigade'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;Joslen, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; November 1940 also saw another change to the 168th Brigade, with both the 1st Battalion, [[Queen's Westminsters]] and 1st Battalion, [[London Rifle Brigade]] being posted elsewhere. They were replaced in the brigade by 1st Battalion, [[London Irish Rifles]], previously from the [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th (London) Infantry Brigade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonirishrifles.com/second-world-war/the-london-irish-at-war/1940|title=1940.|author=Administrator|work=londonirishrifles.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 18th Battalion, [[Royal Fusiliers]], a battalion raised specifically for war service only, created a few months before in June–July. The 18th were posted elsewhere in mid-February 1941 and replaced by 10th Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]], another unit raised for war service, created in September 1940. Prior to being the 10th Battalion, it was the 50th (Holding) Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/units/475/royal-berkshire-regiment/|title=Royal Berkshire Regiment - Regiment History, War &amp; Military Records &amp; Archives|work=forces-war-records.co.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th Royal Fusiliers was later transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] in late 1941 and converted into [[100th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA]] and became the light anti-aircraft regiment for the 56th Division when it joined in February 1942 and served for the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/laa/page94.html|title=RA 1939-45 100 LAA|work=blueyonder.co.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 168th Brigade and the rest of 56th Division, now composed largely of a mixture of pre-war [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorials]], [[Standing army|Regulars]] and wartime volunteers, moved to [[Suffolk]] in June 1942 where they were inspected by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Paget|Sir Bernard Paget]], at the time [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces]].

On 8 April 1943, however, the 168th Brigade was detached from the 56th Division and initially became an independent brigade group, with [[City of London Artillery|90th (City of London) Field Regiment]] of the Royal Artillery and 501st Field Company, of the [[Royal Engineers]], both under command.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/56-Infantry-Division-1942-43-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 1943, the brigade was transferred to the understrength [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], which had suffered heavy casualties and lost the [[150th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|150th Brigade]] the previous summer in [[Battle of Gazala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/50-Infantry-Division-1943-Sicily-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1943, with the 50th Division, the 168th Brigade fought in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]], landing on [[D-Day (military term)|D-Day]]+3, yet the brigade suffered comparatively light casualties in the short campaign (10th Royal Berkshires had suffered 109 casualties, 26 of them [[Killed in action|KIA]]&lt;ref name=&quot;thewardrobe.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewardrobe.org.uk/research/history-of-regiments/the-berkshire-regiment-1881-1885-the-royal-berkshire-regiment-1885-1959|title=The Berkshire Regiment 1881-1885 The Royal Berkshire Regiment 1885-1959|work=thewardrobe.org.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas 1st London Irish had 160, with 40 KIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonirishrifles.com/second-world-war/the-london-irish-at-war/august-1943|title=August/September 1943.|author=Administrator|work=londonirishrifles.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October the 50th Infantry Division,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegarrison.org.uk/history/50hist.php|title=The Garrison - The Divisional History of 50th Inf Div|work=thegarrison.org.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://51hd.co.uk/history/sicily|title=Operation Huskey - retake Sicily, July 1943 - 51st Highland Division|work=51hd.co.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertrats.org.uk/battles1943.htm#Italy|title=Battles 1943|work=desertrats.org.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was chosen by General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], Commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], to be returned to the United Kingdom to spearhead the [[invasion of Normandy]]. On 17 October the 168th Brigade rejoined the rest of the 56th Division [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fighting in Italy]] and making it a four-brigade division, as the [[22nd Guards Brigade|201st Guards Brigade]] joined on 23 July to replace the 168th and only left on 3 January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The division, part of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] and under command of [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]]'s [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], had just seen fierce fighting in the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno landings]]. Together with the rest of the division the brigade advanced up Italy, and [[Volturno Line|crossed the Volturno]]. By late 1943, however, together with the rest of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], the brigade was held up in front of the formidable [[Winter Line]] defences, with the brigade and division fighting near the [[Bernhardt Line]].

In mid-January 1944 the brigade, still fighting on the Bernhardt Line, crossed the [[Garigliano|Garigliano river]] as part of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino#First battle|First Battle of Monte Cassino]] where [[Private (rank)|Private]] [[George Allan Mitchell]] of the 1st Battalion, [[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish]] gained the [[Victoria Cross]], the first and only for the regiment and division during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Blaxland, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/bbmitchg.htm|title=GEORGE MITCHELL VC|work=victoriacross.org.uk|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, on 30 January, the Commander of British X Corps, Lieutenant-General Sir [[Richard McCreery]], was ordered to send a brigade to strengthen the [[Anzio]] bridgehead. The 168th Brigade was chosen and was, again, detached from the division to temporarily come under command of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]],&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; at the time [[Battle of Anzio|fighting at Anzio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battlefieldsww2.50megs.com/1st_division.htm|title=1st Division|work=50megs.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under command of [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The 168th Brigade landed at Anzio on 3 February&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; where, soon after arrival, the battalions were almost immediately thrown into battle as the Germans [[Battle of Anzio#German counterattacks|launched a counterattack]] and the London Scottish, as vanguard of the brigade and supported by [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]]s of the [[46th (Liverpool Welsh) Royal Tank Regiment|46th Royal Tank Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonirishrifles.com/history-2/significant-events/46-februay-march-1944-anzio|title=February 1944 - Anzio.|author=Administrattor|work=londonirishrifles.com|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched their own spirited counterattack in an attempt to relieve the [[3rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Brigade]] (1st [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|Dukes]], 2nd [[Sherwood Foresters|Foresters]], 1st [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry|KSLI]]), of British 1st Division, which was surrounded, in what was known to both sides as the &quot;Thumb&quot;, by [[Aprilia, Lazio|Campoleone]] station and the lateral road, and was virtually cut off, taking heavy casualties. The London Scottish, supported by 46th RTR, &quot;''fought their way forward over sodden ground under heavy German fire in a driving rain''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; ending up some 400 yards short of the lateral road which shored up the right flank long enough to enable the 3rd Brigade to withdraw, under cover of nightfall, without further loss.&lt;ref&gt;Blaxland, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the brigade had to leave behind much of its equipment and the London Scottish had, in just a few short hours of battle, sustained over 100 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, pps. 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In its first action at Anzio the brigade helped to repel a major counterattack, potentially saving the British 1st Division from destruction, in some of the fiercest fighting endured by soldiers of either side on the Italian Front thus far. Indeed, [[Albert Kesselring]], the Commander of the German forces in Italy &quot;''believed that the [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourteenth Army]] had overestimated the strength of VI Corps and that the attack should have commenced at least twenty-four hours earlier, before the arrival of the 168th Brigade''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt; The 168th Brigade reverted to control of 56th Division on 15 February when the 56th Divisional Headquarters began to land. The brigade continued to fight for nearly six weeks in the severe battles at Anzio where even senior officers were not always safe, such as was the case with [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Ronald Penney]], [[General officer commanding|GOC]] British 1st Division, wounded by shellfire on 17 February and the GOC 56th Division, Major-General [[Gerald Templer]], took command of both the 1st and 56th divisions,&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; until 23 February when Penney took command of 1st Division again.&lt;ref&gt;Joslen, pp 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Over a month later, the heavily battered brigade was relieved in the line by [[17th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|17th Infantry Brigade]], of the British 5th Infantry Division, in late March 1944 and was withdrawn to Egypt to rest and refit,&lt;ref&gt;Blaxland, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and was to remain there until mid-July.

The brigade had suffered 50% casualties,&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt; the highest casualty rate of the three brigades of 56th Division, and was brought up to strength mainly with mainly ex-anti-aircraft gunners of the Royal Artillery who had been retrained as [[line infantry]] (most of whom were commented by officers to be of excellent quality as infantrymen), together with those many wounded returning from hospital. In only six weeks at Anzio the brigade had seen extremely heavy casualties with one of its battalions – 1st [[London Irish Rifles]] – suffering 582 casualties (32 [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and 550 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]), with only 12 officers and 300 other ranks embarking for Egypt, most of them returning wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonirishrifles.com/second-world-war/the-london-irish-at-war/march-1944|title=March 1944.|author=Administrator|work=londonirishrifles.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even worse was suffered by the 10th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, which had been reduced to around 40 men fit for duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;thewardrobe.org.uk&quot;/&gt; As a result of its high casualty rate, and a growing shortage of infantry replacements, the battalion was disbanded, with most of its men volunteering as replacements for the other battalions of the brigade. To replace the Royal Berkshires was the 1st Battalion, [[Welch Regiment]], a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] unit which had already seen extensive service in the Middle East and [[Battle of Crete|Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaxland, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Egypt the brigade was inspected by General Sir Bernard Paget, now Commander-in-Chief, [[Middle East Command]]. He had visited them almost two years before in Suffolk when the division was preparing for overseas service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonirishrifles.com/second-world-war/the-london-irish-at-war/april-1944|title=April 1944.|author=Administrator|work=londonirishrifles.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reorganised brigade landed at [[Taranto]], Italy, on 17 July 1944 and soon afterwards were visited again by H.M. The King George VI, who visited them almost exactly two years before. Now under Eighth Army command, the division fought in the [[Gothic Line|battles for the Gothic Line]] (Operation ''Olive'', where the Eighth Army suffered 14,000 casualties, at nearly 1,000&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; a day), in particular the [[Battle of Gemmano]] which saw further heavy casualties, with nearly half the total casualties for Olive (6,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonirishrifles.com/second-world-war/the-london-irish-at-war/september-1944|title=September 1944.|author=Administrator|work=londonirishrifles.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56th Division. A complete reorganisation of the division was needed. The brigade was pulled out of the line on 21 September and due to the severe shortage of manpower, biting particularly hard in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]] (all available replacements had been used up and although 5,000 ex-anti-aircraft gunners had been transferred to the infantry&lt;ref&gt;Blaxland, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; to be retrained, they had yet to complete their training and would only be available in October), that plagued the British Army at this time, and the heavy casualties in the brigade (1st Welch only mustered 320 all ranks),&lt;ref&gt;http://royalwelsh.org.uk/downloads/E05-01-WelchR-WW2-1stBattalion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; it was decided to disband two brigades (the other being [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|18th Infantry]] of [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]]) to make up for the infantry shortage. As a consequence, the brigade became non-operational on 23 September 1944 and&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; both the 1st London Scots and 1st London Irish transferring to 167th (London) Brigade and 1st Welch Regiment reducing to a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of 5 officers and 60 other ranks, with the remainder transferring to the [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)|Queen's]] of [[169th (3rd London) Brigade|169th (Queen's) Brigade]] (as a Regular battalion it could not be disbanded) and later transferring to [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Brigade (Guards)]]. The 168th Brigade Headquarters was finally disbanded on 1 January 1945, as were all the units under command.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; To replace the brigade was [[43rd Independent Gurkha Infantry Brigade]] and later [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Infantry Brigade (Guards)]].
