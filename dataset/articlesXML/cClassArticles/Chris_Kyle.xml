'''Christopher Scott''' &quot;'''Chris'''&quot; '''Kyle''' (April 8, 1974 − February 2, 2013) was a [[United States Navy SEAL]] veteran and sniper. Kyle served four tours in the [[Iraq War]] and was awarded several commendations for acts of heroism and meritorious service in combat. He was awarded one [[Silver Star Medal]], four [[Bronze Star Medal]]s with [[&quot;V&quot; device]]s, a Navy and Marine Corps [[Achievement Medal]] and numerous other unit and personal awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brook2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brook|first1=Tom Vanden|title=Navy lowers medal count for SEAL Chris Kyle|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/08/navy-lowers-medal-count-seal-chris-kyle/86468402/|work=USA Today|accessdate=July 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708215219/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/08/navy-lowers-medal-count-seal-chris-kyle/86468402/|archivedate=July 8, 2016|date=July 8, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kyle was [[honorably discharged]] from the U.S. Navy in 2009 and published his bestselling autobiography, ''[[American Sniper (book)|American Sniper]]'', in 2012. An [[American Sniper|eponymous film adaptation]] of Kyle's book, directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], was released two years later. On February 2, 2013, Kyle  was murdered by Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range near [[Chalk Mountain, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post 2015-02-13&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamothe|first1=Dan|title=The fatal intersection of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and the Marine veteran who killed him|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/02/13/first-days-of-american-sniper-murder-trial-leave-questions-unanswered/|accessdate=January 14, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former Marine with PTSD, Routh was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eddie-ray-routh-found-guilty-in-death-of-american-snipers-chris-kyle-2015252 |title= Eddie Ray Routh Found Guilty of Murder in Shooting Death of American Sniper's Chris Kyle|work=Us Weekly |author=Madeline Boardman |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=March 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kyle was born in [[Odessa, Texas]], the first of two boys born to Deby Lynn ([[Name at birth|née]] Mercer) and Wayne Kenneth Kyle, a [[Sunday school]] teacher and [[deacon]].&lt;ref name=NYPBuiso/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V8KW-VP1|title=Christopher Scott Kyle, Texas, Birth Index, 1903-1997|publisher=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle's father bought his son his first rifle at 8 years old, a bolt-action [[.30-06 Springfield]] rifle, and later a shotgun, with which they hunted deer, [[pheasant]], and [[quail]].&lt;ref name=NYPBuiso&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/meet_the_big_shot_BxlVpxzQijkC9mwZcmwkrN?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost|title=Meet the big shot – SEAL is America's deadliest sniper|author=Buiso, Gray|date=January 1, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2012|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kyle and his brother grew up raising up to 150 head of cattle at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbr.com/en/news/features/other-features/2014/1/pbr-legends-ross-coleman-and-luke-snyder-assisting-with-chris-kyle-memorial-roping-auction.aspx|title=CHRIS KYLE HAD A LOVE FOR THE COWBOY LIFESTYLE|work=Professional Bull Riders|date=January 29, 2014|accessdate=May 28, 2016|first=Keith Ryan|last=Cartwright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle attended high school in [[Midlothian, Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2Op0C9hXA0C&amp;pg=PT13&amp;lpg=PT13&amp;dq=chris+kyle+high+school+football&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l4E_k-ST4r&amp;sig=MFx-x6eEGGK6QXInraVJ5h01KWs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wQ24VJSAO4apyQSjsYGAAg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chris%20kyle%20high%20school%20football&amp;f=false|title=The Life and Legend of Chris Kyle: American Sniper, Navy SEAL|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after graduating, became a professional [[bronco]] rodeo rider and ranch hand, but his professional rodeo career ended abruptly when he severely injured his arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;military.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/special-operations/special-operations-forces-veteran-chris-kyle.html |title=Special Operations Forces Profile: Chris Kyle|publisher=Military.com |accessdate=March 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
After his arm healed, Kyle went to a military recruiting office, interested in joining the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[special operations]]. A [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] recruiter convinced him to try, instead, for the [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]]. Initially, Kyle was rejected because of the [[Internal fixation|pins in his arm]], but he eventually received an invitation to the 24-week [[United States Navy SEAL selection and training#Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) Training (24 weeks)|Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL school (BUDS)]], which he joined in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;military.com&quot;/&gt;

Assigned to [[SEAL Team 3]], sniper element, platoon &quot;Charlie&quot; (later &quot;Cadillac&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Americansniper&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kyle, Chris |author2=McEwen, Scott |author3=DeFelice, Chris |title=American Sniper|publisher=Harper Collins|date=February 5, 2012|ISBN=0-06-208235-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|Naval Special Warfare Command]], and with four tours of duty, Kyle served in many major battles of the Iraq War.&lt;ref name=NYPBuiso/&gt; His first long-range kill shot was taken during the initial invasion when he shot a woman approaching a group of Marines while carrying a hand grenade. CNN reported that the woman was cradling a toddler in her other hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/03/us/texas-sniper-killed-kyle-profile/index.html |title = 'Chris Kyle, America's deadliest sniper, offered no regrets' |date=February 5, 2013|accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ordered, Kyle opened fire, killing the woman before she could attack.&lt;ref name=Telg8990552&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8990552/The-Devil-of-Rahmadi-named-Americas-deadliest-sniper.html|title='The Devil of Ramadi' named America's deadliest sniper|author=Sanchez, Raf|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=January 2, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated, &quot;the woman was already dead. I was just making sure she didn't take any Marines with her. It was clear that not only did she want to kill them, but she didn’t care about anybody else nearby who would have been blown up by the grenade or killed in the firefight. Children on the street, people in the houses, maybe her child.&quot;&lt;ref name=Americansniper/&gt;

Because of his track record as a marksman during his deployment to [[Ramadi]], the insurgents named Kyle ''Shaitan Ar-Ramadi'' (English: &quot;The Devil of Ramadi&quot;), and put a $21,000 bounty on his head that was later increased to $80,000. They posted signs highlighting the cross on his arm as a means of identifying him.&lt;ref name=NYPBuiso/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telg8990552/&gt;

In his book, ''American Sniper'', Kyle describes his longest successful shot: in 2008, outside [[Sadr City]], he killed an insurgent sniper aiming at other members of the US military with &quot;a straight-up luck shot&quot; from his [[McMillan Tac-50|McMillan Tac-338]] sniper rifle from about {{convert|2,100|yd|m|0}} away.&lt;ref name=Americansniper/&gt;

Kyle became known as &quot;The Legend&quot; among the general infantry and Marines he was tasked to protect. The nickname originated among Kyle's fellow SEALs following his taking of a sabbatical to train other snipers in [[Fallujah]], and he was sometimes called  &quot;The Myth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kyle, Chris|title=American Sniper|publisher=HarperCollins|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During four tours of duty in the Iraq War, he was shot twice and survived six separate [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] detonations.&lt;ref name=Telg8990552/&gt;

===Number of kills as a sniper===
While the Navy, Pentagon, and [[U.S. Special Operations Command]]s (SOC) have not challenged the claim that Kyle was the current top sniper, his exact number of sniper kills is obscure. To be counted as confirmed, &quot;They basically had to see the person fall and be clearly dead&quot;, according to [[Jim DeFelice]], one of the coauthors of Kyle's autobiography.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillBriggs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briggs |first1=Bill |title=Confirmed kills: A solemn secret for military snipers is becoming a pop-culture hit |url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/30/19679964-confirmed-kills-a-solemn-secret-for-military-snipers-is-becoming-a-pop-culture-hit? |accessdate=September 5, 2014 |publisher=NBC News |date=July 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902113212/http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/30/19679964-confirmed-kills-a-solemn-secret-for-military-snipers-is-becoming-a-pop-culture-hit? |archivedate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle's shooter's statements (shooter's statements are filled out by every sniper after a mission) were reported to higher command, who kept them in case any kill were contested as outside the [[Rules of Engagement|rules of engagement]] (ROE).&lt;ref name=&quot;Americansniper&quot;/&gt;  The publisher [[HarperCollins]] states: &quot;The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyle's kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the astonishing total number for this book.&quot;&lt;ref name=PublisherNote&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Book|url=http://harpercollins.com/books/American-Sniper/?isbn=9780062082350|work=American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=June 22, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111232749/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/American-Sniper/?isbn=9780062082350 |archivedate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Kyle wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Navy credits me with more kills as a sniper than any other American service member, past or present. I guess that's true. They go back and forth on what the number is. One week, it's 160 (the 'official' number as of this writing, for what that's worth), then it's way higher, then it's somewhere in between. If you want a number, ask the Navy—you may even get the truth if you catch them on the right day.&quot;&lt;ref name=Americansniper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehistoryreader.com/military-history/chris-kyle-al-shaitan-iraq/|title=Chris Kyle: al-Shaitan of Iraq|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On July 8, 2016, the U.S. Navy corrected Kyle's [[DD Form 214]] regarding some decorations listed on his original discharge document.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20160708&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Jamie|publisher=CNN|title=Navy: 'American Sniper' medal count corrected|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original discharge papers issued to him upon leaving the service (a DD-214) tally with his account given in his autobiography, of two Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars with valor. The Navy revised it to one Silver Star and four Bronze Stars with valor.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20160708&quot;/&gt; The Navy said &quot;Kyle would have played no role in the production of his personnel files other than signing the DD-214 upon his discharge&quot; and &quot;[a]fter thoroughly reviewing all available records, the Navy determined an error was made&quot; and &quot;issued a corrected copy of the DD214, which accurately reflects Kyle's years of honorable and extraordinary service.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn20160708&quot;/&gt;

===Weapons===
As a sniper, Kyle was often asked about his weapons. While in training, he used four different rifles in order to know which weapon was the most useful in the given situation. In the field, he used the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;Americansniper&quot;/&gt;
* a semi-automatic [[SR-25|7.62 NATO Mk 11]] sniper rifle (patrol)
* a [[Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle|5.56 NATO Mk 12 Designated Marksman Rifle]] modified with the lower receiver off a [[M4 carbine|M-4]] to get a collapsible stock and allow full auto (for urban patrol)
* a [[M24 Sniper Weapon System#M24A2|.300 Winchester Magnum M24]] sniper rifle with MacMillan stocks and customized barrels, later replaced with a [[Accuracy International AWM|.300 Winchester Magnum Accuracy International]]. These two rifles were the ones he mostly used while in overwatch.{{clarify|date=December 2015}}
*a [[.338 Lapua Magnum]] used for Long Range Targets

==Post-military life==
[[File:Taya Kyle 1.jpg|thumb|upright|float|left|[[Taya Kyle]] in August 2013]]

Kyle left the U.S. Navy in 2009 and moved to [[Midlothian, Texas]], with his wife, Taya, and two children.&lt;ref name=HarpCol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/American-Sniper/?isbn=9780062082350|title=American Sniper|author1=Kyle, Chris |author2=McEwen, Scott |author3=DeFelice, Chris |publisher=Harper Collins|date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was president of Craft International, a tactical training company for the U.S. military and law enforcement communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchiveproject.org/10904/|title=Craft International|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[HarperCollins]] released Kyle's autobiography, ''[[American Sniper (book)|American Sniper]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Americansniper&quot;/&gt; Kyle had initially hesitated to write the book but was persuaded to move forward because other books about SEALs were underway.&lt;ref name=NYTSniper&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez and Michael Schwirtz|first1=Manny|title=Untouchable in Iraq, Ex-Sniper Dies in a Shooting Back Home|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/us/chris-kyle-american-sniper-author-reported-killed.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=January 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Kyle wrote bluntly of his experiences.
