'''HMS ''Venerable''''' was a 74-gun [[third rate]] [[ship of the line]] of the [[Royal Navy]], launched on 12 April 1808 at [[Northfleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavery, SoLv1 p188&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
On 13 December 1810 ''Venerable'' was in company with the [[Hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] [[Hired armed cutter Nimrod|''Nimrod'']] and several other vessels at the capture of the ''Goede Trouw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16543|startpage=2244|date=19 November 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 1813, she captured the French [[letter of marque]] brig ''Jason'' which became {{HMS|Jason|1813|6}}. ''Jason'', of 264 tons (bm), was pierced for 22 guns but carried 14, 12 of which she had thrown overboard when ''Venerable'' chased her. She had left Bordeaux five days earlier and was sailing for New York with a cargo of silks, wines, and other articles of merchandise. There were 64 people on board, ten of whom were passengers. She was on her maiden voyage, [[copper sheathing|copper-bottom]]ed, and sailed so well, Captain Worth took her under protection, intending to go to Barbados.&lt;ref name=NC31&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 31, p.254-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Venerable'' was Admiral [[Philip Charles Durham|Durham's]] flagship when on 16 January 1814, ''Venerable'' and her prize ''Jason'', were in company with {{HMS|Cyane|1806|2}}. ''Cyane'' spotted two 44-gun French frigates, [[French frigate Alcmène (1811)|''Alcmène'']] and [[French frigate Iphigénie (1810)|''Iphigénie'']] and signaled to ''Venerable''. ''Venerable'' joined her and after a chase that left ''Cyane'' far behind, captured ''Alcmène'', though not without a fight. ''Venerable'' lost two men dead and four wounded, while the French lost 32 dead and 50 wounded. ''Alcmène'' had a complement of 319 men under the command of Captain Ducrest de Villeneuve, who was wounded when he brought her alongside ''Venerable'' and attempted a boarding.&lt;ref name=NC31/&gt;

''Jason'' and ''Cyane'' tracked ''Iphigénie'' and initially fired on her but broke off the engagement because they were outgunned. ''Cyane'' continued the chase for over three days until ''Venerable'' was able to rejoin the fight after having sailed 153 miles in the direction she believed that ''Iphigénie'' had taken. On 20 January 1814, after a 19-hour chase, or what amounted in all to a four-day chase ''Iphigénie'', ''Venerable'' captured the quarry, having again left ''Cyane'' behind. In the chase, ''Iphigénie'' cast off her anchors and threw her boats overboard in order to try to gain speed. She had a complement of 325 men, under the command of Captain Emerie. She apparently did not resist after ''Venerable'' came up.&lt;ref name=NC31/&gt;{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money for both vessels, including head money for ''Alcmène'', was [[£sd|£]]819 16[[shilling|s]] 4½[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, for ''Iphigénie'' was worth £2 1s 8¼d. For ''Alcmène'', a sixth-class share was worth £3 9s 4d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1599|issue=17048|date=5 August 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  Before meeting up with the British ships, the two French vessels had taken some eight prizes.&lt;ref&gt;James &amp; Chamier (1837), Vol. 6, pp.259-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The action resulted in the award in 1847, to any surviving claimants, of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Venerable 16 Jany. 1814&quot;.

''Venerable'' was able to locate ''Iphigénie'' because Commander Ducrest de Villeneuve of ''Alcmène'' was so angry at Captain Émeric, who was the senior French commander, for not having come alongside ''Venerable'' on the other side also to board, that he essentially revealed the rendezvous instructions to Durham. When some prisoners from ''Iphigénie{{'}}''s crew were brought on ''Venerable'', crew from ''Alcmène'' too were enraged. Durham had to station [[Royal Marines]] between them, with fixed bayonets, to prevent fighting from breaking out.&lt;ref&gt;Long (1895), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==

''Venerable'' was placed on harbour service in 1825, and was broken up in 1838.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavery, SoLv1 p188&quot; /&gt;
