==Coordinates==

It looks to me that the coordinates given are incorrect.  I believe that it should be SK14948260, but  TF66572455 is given, which I think is Castle Rising.  Could someone knowledgeable about the
locations and coordinate system make the change?
[[User:Tedclaymore|Tedclaymore]] ([[User talk:Tedclaymore|talk]]) 19:25, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

:You are absolutely right. I'm not sure how I got that wrong, but I've corrected the grid reference. [[User:Nev1|Nev1]] ([[User talk:Nev1|talk]]) 19:30, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

==Lose Hill==
Just a minor point, but the photograph is captioned &quot;Peveril Castle from Cavedale with Mam Tor in the background&quot;, however the hill in the background is Lose Hill (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lose_Hill), not Mam Tor.
[[Special:Contributions/85.210.166.171|85.210.166.171]] ([[User talk:85.210.166.171|talk]]) 17:17, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
:As best as I can tell you're correct. Thanks for pointing that out. [[User:Nev1|Nev1]] ([[User talk:Nev1|talk]]) 14:01, 4 January 2011 (UTC)

== A Plan ==

[[File:Castleton Castle, derived from Penny cyclopaedia (1836) V6 page 354.jpg|thumb|Here is a plan of the castle derived from the [[Penny Cyclopaedia]] (1836) V6 page 354]]
I'll leave it to others to decide if it should be used in the article. -- [[User:Philip Baird Shearer|PBS]] ([[User talk:Philip Baird Shearer|talk]]) 12:59, 16 September 2011 (UTC)

:Unfortunately, the plan bears little resemblance to the castle. It's a triangular enclosure rather than square as this plan shows, as [[:File:Model of Peveril Castle.jpg|this model]] of the castle shows (and backed up by the plan produced by English Heritage in its guidebook). Usually a plan is a very important piece of an article on a building, however in this case the reproduction does the job well enough. Though if a reliable free-use plan could be found it would certainly be a useful addition. I'd recommend great caution when adding plans from ''Penny Cyclopedia'', as when looking at some old antiquarian plans I sometimes wonder whether the draughtsman ever saw the castle. [[User:Nev1|Nev1]] ([[User talk:Nev1|talk]]) 19:47, 18 September 2011 (UTC)

::An alternative plan... [[File:Peveril castle plan.jpg|thumb|left]] [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 06:35, 19 September 2011 (UTC)

==Main page== 

Congratulations on another great castle article!  An enjoyable read!  

I f I were you, I would scrap the pin map. They are virtually useless, as the mark disappears when you click.  On the other hand, if you click the co-ordinates, you get any number of really good maps, hat will show the building, and facilitate going there. 

[[User:Amandajm|Amandajm]] ([[User talk:Amandajm|talk]]) 04:13, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

:I'm ambivalent about it. It's a useful guide and means the reader doesn't have to leave the article to get an idea of where the castle is, and when [[Rochester Castle]] was on the main page a little over a month ago one of the comments was that a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ArticleFeedbackv5/Rochester_Castle/147693 map] of some sort might have been useful. The reason I'm not entirely fussed either way is because, as you say,the co-ordinates link to a number of much more useful maps, but I wander how many of our readers know that. [[User:Nev1|Nev1]] ([[User talk:Nev1|talk]]) 17:02, 7 August 2012 (UTC)
::For the casual reader, I find them quite helpful (I can see at a glance where a location is, rather than having to click or read a coord). [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 17:13, 7 August 2012 (UTC)
==What, Nothing About the Peveril Brothers?==
Where do they keep the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Elder_Wand|Elder Wand]] and and the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Cloak_of_invisibility|Cloak of Invisibility]] if not at Peveril Castle? [[User:JSC ltd|JSC ltd]] ([[User talk:JSC ltd|talk]]) 17:33, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

:The wand and cloak are on permanent display in the museum at [[Cair Paravel]]. [[User:Nev1|Nev1]] ([[User talk:Nev1|talk]]) 17:55, 7 August 2012 (UTC)
::I'm afraid you're wrong, Nev. I've been to Cair Paravel, and I couldn't see the cloak of invisibility there at all. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 19:10, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

== Timeline... ==

Downsize43, morning! I know its under construction, so I'm jumping the gun a little, but I have two comment about the emerging timelines section. I'm a little concerned that it may be rather duplicative of the main text above it; you may also find that producing succinct but accurate text labels for some of the events may be challenging. If its going to take a lot of work to produce, I'd suggest it might be worth discussing it further here first. Either way, good to see folks responding to the reader feedback commentary! [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 06:24, 18 September 2012 (UTC)
:Thanks for your response. I believe that a timeline such as this must of necessity be duplicative of the text. I agree that completion of the table will be challenging, and welcome discussion thereon. [[User:Downsize43|Downsize43]] ([[User talk:Downsize43|talk]]) 23:45, 18 September 2012 (UTC)
::I've moved the table over from the main page for now. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 17:08, 30 September 2012 (UTC)
:::Is it your expectation that this will somehow promote discussion and/or assistance, or is there some other reason that you might care to share with us? [[User:Downsize43|Downsize43]] ([[User talk:Downsize43|talk]]) 00:11, 1 October 2012 (UTC)
::::I'd moved it over because it had been under construction for several weeks and work appeared to have paused. I think it is heavily duplicative of the text preceding it and from what I've seen so far would advise its removal, but since it's not finished it makes comment difficult. I'd moved it over this way because it makes it easy for it to be moved back over and completed. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 05:09, 1 October 2012 (UTC)
:::::We could debate forever whether or not this table is a good thing to have, but I am certain of one aspect:- A table such as this must contain a summary of the associated text, which makes your repeated comment that it is duplicative rather puzzling. Until some input from other interested editors is available I suggest we leave it as is. [[User:Downsize43|Downsize43]] ([[User talk:Downsize43|talk]]) 07:28, 1 October 2012 (UTC)
