'''USS ''Weight'' (ARS-35)''' was a [[Weight class rescue and salvage ship|''Weight''-class]] [[rescue and salvage ship]] acquired by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Her task was to come to the aid of stricken vessels. This narrative provides a detailed account of such a task conducted under battle conditions.

''Plymouth Salvor'' (a wooden-hulled salvage vessel originally earmarked for transfer to [[Great Britain]] under [[lend-lease]] and classified as BARS-7) was laid down on 7 April 1942 at [[Wilmington, Delaware]], by the [[American Car and Foundry Co.]]; reclassified ARS-35 on 11 January 1943 and named ''Weight'' on 15 March 1943. The ship was launched on 21 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. H. E. Haven, the wife of the Supervisor of Shipbuilding at the Dravo Corp. of Wilmington; and commissioned at her builder's yard on 14 August 1943, Lt. Frederick J. LeaMond, [[USNR]], in command.

== World War II service ==

''Weight'' shifted to the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 16 August, where she fitted out prior to moving to [[Cape May, New Jersey]], en route to [[New York City]]. Reaching [[New York City]] late on the 23d, the salvage vessel remained there until the 27th, when she sailed for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], in company with [[USS Extricate (ARS-16)|''Extricate'']] (ARS-16). After touching at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], en route on the 29th, the salvage ships reached Norfolk later that day.

Following a brief [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]], the ship was fitted out at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] from 5 to 13 September and remained in the [[Hampton Roads]] vicinity until late in the month. She departed her anchorage on 25 September and joined [[Convoy]] UGS-19, bound for [[North Africa]].

=== Italy and North Africa operations ===

Reaching [[Bizerte]], Tunisia, on the 16th, ''Weight'' sailed for [[Italy]] on the 27th and reached [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], on the 29th. For almost the next three months, the salvage ship performed harbor clearance and salvage operations, an existence frequently interrupted by air raid alerts, and by air raids themselves, and the results of those attacks. Late on 5 November, soon after reaching Naples, she was called upon to turn her monitors (fire-fighting equipment) upon a serious warehouse blaze. While the ship was maneuvering to get into the best possible position to fight the fire, her [[starboard]] [[propeller]] struck some submerged wreckage, bending one blade out of alignment and curling the others about three inches each. By 0415 on the 6th, the blaze was controlled.

Moored to the wreckage of the [[Italy|Italian]] ship [[SS Nirvo|SS ''Nirvo'']], ''Weight'' performed salvage operations on that vessel through mid-November, before she shifted berths alongside the wrecks of ''[[SS Irish Monarch]]'' and ''[[SS Silvano]]''. She also raised sunken ''LCVP's'' and fought a fire that had started in cargo carried by ''LCT-309'', spending much of her time on [[New Year's Eve]] fighting that blaze.

On 2 January 1944, ''Weight'' shifted to a berth alongside the wreck of the former [[Germany|German]] merchantman [[SS Resolute|SS ''Resolute'']] where, over the next few days, she tended to the mine damage suffered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] merchant vessel [[SS Largs Bay|SS ''Largs Bay'']]. ''Weight'' later provided fresh water to ''YMS-69'', repairs to ''LST-861'', ''LCT 285'', and freed the port screw of ''LCI-837''. She also conducted salvage and wreckage clearance operations on a sunken Italian [[destroyer]] and towed [[HMS Thruster|HMS ''Thruster'']] off a nearby beach where she had gone aground.

=== Anzio operations ===

''Weight'' sailed from Naples at 0755 on 28 January and, reaching the [[Anzio]] beachhead the next day, observed [[Germany|German]] bombers making direct hits on the British cruiser [[HMS Spartan (95)|HMS ''Spartan'']] and the American merchantman [[SS Samuel Huntington|SS ''Samuel Huntington'']]. ''Weight'' commenced salvage operations on the stranded ''LCT-223'' while explosions from the burning ''Samuel Huntington'' shook the area.

After dragging ''LCT-288'' clear, ''Weight'' got underway to fight the blaze on the wrecked Liberty ship, ''Samuel Huntington''. The salvage vessel trained both monitors (large deck-mounted water guns) and a 2Â½-inch hose on the wreck and between 1605 and 1745, fought the fire that ravaged the freighter. Securing at 1745 ''Weight'' moved briefly away with the wreck still smoking but returned at 2207 to anchor alongside and renew her efforts to contain the flames.

However, ''Weight's'' work off the [[Anzio]] beaches was not yet done. In company with the British salvage vessel [[Weazel (ship)|''Weazel'']] and aided by [[bulldozers]] ashore, she attempted to salvage the grounded British tank landing craft, ''LCT 542''. ''Weight's'' divers cleared the fouled screws of ''SC-497'', and the ship's force repaired ''LCT 288'' and again fought fires on ''Samuel Huntington''. ''Weight'' finally departed Anzio at 0845 on 5 February and returned to Naples later that day.

=== Naples operations ===

''Weight'' continued her vital but unglamorous salvage routine at Naples well into April. Between 10 and 25 February, she assisted and repaired [[HMS Kempenfelt (R03)|HMS ''Kempenfelt'']], the damaged minesweeper [[USS Pilot (AM-104)|''Pilot'']] (AM-104), and ''LCI-3'' as well as ''Weazel''. On the 26th, she got underway for the beach off [[Bagnoli]], Italy, to tow off stranded ships.

=== Collision during rescue attempt ===

Heavy seas and high winds proved a nemesis to the salvors. Shortly after 2000 on 26 February, ''Weight'' attempted to pass a line to a grounded [[U.S. Army]] [[tugboat|tug]], but in the initial attempt to do so, used up three spools of line. The second try ended also in failure when the boat went too close to shore and broached, pitching two men into the surf. Fortunately, all of the six men from ''Weight's'' motor launch reached shore safely, but the boat itself was smashed by the heavy surf.

''Weight'' again attempted to tow off the Army tug, alone on the next day and in company with [[HMS Barholm|HMS ''Barholm'']] on the 28th. Nevertheless, even after the joint attempt, the Army tug remained hard aground and defied all of the salvors' efforts, and the American salvage vessel subsequently returned to Naples to resume work on ''Pilot''.

=== Putting out fires on burning ships ===

In early March, ''Weight'' salvaged [[HMS Boxer (1942)|HMS ''Boxer'']] and [[HMS Quantock|HMS ''Quantock'']], and fought a fire that broke out on a nearby wreck. In the latter operation, the salvors had to cut holes in the deck to pass hoses. Late on 30 March coal gas ignited on board [[SS Richard Stockton|SS ''Richard Stockton'']], causing a serious fire and injuries to three men. ''Weight'' got underway at 2220 and went to the aid of the burning merchantman.

''Weight'' moved in close and brought her hoses to bear, using them to cool the side plates of the cargo vessel. She also took on board three injured men from ''Richard Stockton'' and later transferred them to an Army hospital ashore. At 0430 on 31 March, ''Weight'' labored to beach the stricken merchantman to help extinguish the fires by flooding the forward section of the blazing ship. ''Weight'' resumed fighting the fires at 0630 and, by 1356, finally had the blaze &quot;under control.&quot; After continuing salvage operations and unbeaching the ship, ''Weight'' returned to Naples on 1 April.

=== Reassignment to North Africa ===

Following a month of local salvage operations there, ''Weight'' departed Naples at 1139 on 1 May, in company with [[SS Carillo|SS ''Carillo'']] and ''SC-56l'', and headed for the coast of [[Morocco]]. She arrived at [[Algiers]] on 4 May and, the next day, entered [[drydock]] at [[Oran]] for repairs to her hull and propellers.

Shortly after noon on 29 May, ''Weight'' sailed in company with Convoy KMS 51. Steaming as last ship in the second column of the convoy, ''Weight'' received orders at 2310 on 30 May to make smoke. Shortly thereafter, she observed sporadic [[antiaircraft]] fire up ahead and at 2320 went to [[general quarters]]. At 0012 on the 31st, the convoy ceased making smoke; but, two minutes later, a white flare appeared overhead and brought the ship back to general quarters. An ensuing brief period of uneasy quiet was suddenly broken at 0020 by numerous flares (both red and white) which began dotting the sky above and began drifting down, illuminating the waters below.

=== Convoy hit by Luftwaffe torpedo planes ===

The [[torpedo planes]] (probably [[Junkers Ju 88|Junkers 88's]]) succeeded in hitting two ships. At 0030, ''Weight'' intercepted a radio dispatch reporting that two ships had been torpedoed and that survivors from one were already in the water. ''Weight'' immediately altered course, initiating a search for the men.

==== Rescuing survivors in the water ====

At 0037, the salvage vessel sighted some survivors and proceeded into the midst of them, commencing rescue operations. After four survivors had been hauled from the water, lookouts heard a plane approaching the ship from her [[starboard]] quarter. When the target became visible approximately {{convert|300|yd}} away, two 20-millimeter guns immediately swung around and commenced firing. ''Weight's'' heavy antiaircraft barrage managed to dissuade the German pilot from attempting a [[strafing]] run on the survivors; and the plane, sans [[torpedo]], swung away from the convoy. Soon thereafter, a second Ju 88 attacked, dropping a torpedo nearby that passed ahead of the rescue ship. ''Weight's'' [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikons]] again forced the Germans to clear the area.

Although the area was still brightly lighted by numerous flares, ''Weight'' continued rescue operations, picking up four more men from the water. Soon the [[United Kingdom|British]] tug ''[[HMRT Nenquist]]'' neared the salvage vessel and informed her that she would pick up the rest of the survivors. ''Weight'' learned that the men she had rescued were from the British merchantman [[SS Nordeflinge|SS ''Nordeflinge'']] which had taken an [[aerial torpedo]] [[amidships]] and gone down in two minutes.

After giving the survivors medical care, food, and clothing, ''Weight'' transferred the eight to the British Flower-class corvette [[HMS Hyderabad (K212)|HMS ''Hyderabad'']].

=== Return to Italian operations ===

Soon after reaching [[Augusta, Sicily]], on the morning of 3 June, ''Weight'' shifted to Naples, reaching that port on the 5th. She spent a month engaged in local ship repair and salvage jobs and then shifted briefly to [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], before returning to Naples, where she operated into early August.

=== Invasion of Southern France operations ===

Departing Naples on 5 August, ''Weight'' reached the Bay of [[Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]], late on the 6th. During the ensuing weeks, the salvage vessel supported the invasion of southern [[France]], earning her second [[battle star]] performing her vital but unsung salvage and repair deeds on ships ranging from [[landing craft]] to patrol vessels. She remained at [[Corsica]] for much of August, before she towed [[USS LST-690|''LST-690'']] to [[Palermo]], en route to Naples. Reaching that port on 1 September, in company with ''PC-1594'' and ''PC-1596'', ''Weight'' departed Naples on 6 September.

Arriving at [[St. Tropez]] on the 9th, the salvage vessel shifted to [[Toulon]], France, on the 13th, arriving the next day. There, she commenced salvage operations on the sunken French &quot;super-destroyer&quot; ''Vauban'' on the 14th and continued them for a fortnight, moored astern of the sunken ship. After a brief trip to [[Dellys]], Algeria, ''Weight'' returned to [[Toulon]], where she performed salvage and repair operations on the mine-damaged [[SS Eleanor Wylie|SS ''Eleanor Wylie'']] over ensuing days.

Departing [[Toulon]] at the end of October, the salvage vessel shifted to [[Marseille]] before moving down to [[Oran]] and [[Mers el-Kebir]]. She returned briefly to the [[Bay of Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]], before she put into [[Livorno]], Italy, to unload salvage gear there. Returning briefly to Naples and then to [[Arzew]], Algeria, ''Weight'' departed [[Oran]] on 27 January 1945 and headed home.

=== Homeward bound ===

She overtook Convoy GUS-68 on the 29th. The ship arrived at [[Fayal]], [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], in the [[Azores]], on 4 February and over the next two weeks' time, performed salvage operations on the damaged [[destroyer escort]] [[USS Fogg (DE-57)|''Fogg'']] (DE-57). She ultimately departed the Azores on the 23d bound for [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

=== Assigned to the Pacific Fleet ===

Following an overhaul at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], ''Weight'' sailed for the [[Pacific Ocean]] on 7 May. She then operated out of [[San Francisco, California]], and [[Pearl Harbor]] through the end of hostilities with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in mid-August 1945.

== Post-war decommissioning ==

Ultimately decommissioned at the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], [[Vallejo, California]], on 29 March 1946, ''Weight'' was struck from the [[Navy list]] on 1 May. Subsequently transferred to the United States [[Maritime Commission]], the ship was sold and, on 24 July 1947, was delivered to her purchaser, Mr. David Davidoff, at [[Suisun Bay, California]].

== Military awards and honors ==
''Weight'' won two [[battle stars]] for her [[World War II]] service. Her crew was eligible for the following medals and ribbons:
* [[Combat Action Ribbon]] (retroactive)
* [[American Campaign Medal]]
* [[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]] (2)
* [[World War II Victory Medal]]
