[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir Frederick Charles Doveton Sturdee, 1st Baronet''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|KCMG|CVO}} (9 June 1859 – 7 May 1925) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer. After training as a torpedo officer, he commanded two different cruisers and then three different battleships before becoming commander of the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]] of the [[Home Fleet]]. He went on to command the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and then the 2nd Cruiser Squadron.

Just before the start of the [[First World War]] Sturdee became Chief of War Staff at the [[Admiralty]]. In November 1914 the Royal Navy suffered a serious defeat at the [[Battle of Coronel]]. In response Sturdee was sent to the [[South Atlantic Station|South Atlantic]] to seek out the German squadron, commanded by Graf [[Maximilian von Spee]], which had caused the damage at Coronel. On 8 December 1914, while coaling at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], Sturdee encountered von Spee and the subsequent action became known as the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. Von Spee, finding that he was engaged with a superior force, was forced to flee. In the course of the pursuit Sturdee's forces sank almost the entire German squadron. Only one light cruiser escaped but she was hunted down in March 1915.

In the closing years of the war Sturdee served as commander of the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Battle Squadron]] in the [[Grand Fleet]] and then as [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore]].

In November 1914 the Royal Navy suffered a serious defeat when it lost two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]]. After [[Winston Churchill]] insisted that Sturdee should not be made a scapegoat for the events at Coronel, Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Lord Fisher]] sent a squadron commanded by Sturdee, with his flag in the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}}, to the [[South Atlantic Station|South Atlantic]] to seek out the German squadron, commanded by Graf [[Maximilian von Spee]], which had caused the damage at Coronel.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December 1914, while coaling at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], Sturdee encountered von Spee and the subsequent action became known as the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. Von Spee, finding that he was engaged with a superior force, was forced to flee. In the course of the pursuit Sturdee's forces sank almost the entire German squadron, including the [[Scharnhorst-class cruiser|armoured cruiser]]s, {{SMS|Scharnhorst||6}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||6}}.
