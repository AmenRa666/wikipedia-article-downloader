He fought in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913 as company and battalion commander, and was wounded at the [[Battle of Kilkis–Lachanas]]. After the wars he was attached as [[aide de camp]] to the chiefs of the [[French military mission to Greece (1911–1914)|French military mission to Greece]], generals [[Joseph-Paul Eydoux]] and [[Étienne de Villaret]], and was promoted to Major (1914).&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Συνοπτική Ιστορία του Γενικού Επιτελείου Στρατού 1901–2001 | trans_title = A Concise History of the Hellenic Army General Staff 1901–2001 | year = 2001 | publisher = Army History Directorate | location = Athens | language = Greek | chapter=Αντιστράτηγος ΜΑΝΕΤΑΣ ΚΩΝΣΤΑΝΤΙΝΟΣ του ΠΑΝΑΓΙΩΤΟΥ, ΑΜ 4908. | page=153 | chapterurl =http://www.sse.gr/files/19.ΜΑΝΕΤΑΣ_ΚΩΝΣΤΑΝΤΙΝΟΣ.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He held the post until August 1923, when he was appointed CO of the [[II Army Corps (Greece)|II Army Corps]] and soon after named Minister for Military Affairs in the [[Stylianos Gonatas]] cabinet, a post he held until January 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ggk.gov.gr/?p=933 | title = Κυβέρνησις ΣΤΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΓΟΝΑΤΑ - Από 14.11.1922 έως 11.1.1924 | publisher=General Secretariat of the Government | language=Greek | accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manetas was then promoted to Lieutenant General and sent to [[Paris]] as military attaché, and returned in 1925 to re-assume command of II Corps, until 1926, when he was appointed commander of [[I Army Corps (Greece)|I Army Corps]]. He held this post until 1933, with the exception of June–August 1931, when he was appointed Chief of the General Staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; He served as Transport Minister (and interim Justice Minister for a day) in the interim government of [[Alexandros Othonaios]] in March 1933, formed in response of an abortive [[Venizelist]] coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ggk.gov.gr/?p=1000 | title = Κυβέρνησις ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ ΟΘΩΝΑΙΟΥ - Από 6.3.1933 έως 10.3.1933 | publisher=General Secretariat of the Government | language=Greek | accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then assumed the post of Inspector of the Infantry in the General Staff, until March 1935 when he was involved in another [[1935 Greek coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful Venizelist coup attempt]]. Following the coup's suppression, he was dismissed from the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;
