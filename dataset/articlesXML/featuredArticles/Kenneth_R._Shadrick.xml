'''Kenneth R. &quot;Kenny&quot; Shadrick''' (August 4, 1931{{spaced ndash}}July 5, 1950) was a [[United States Army]] soldier who was killed at the onset of the [[Korean War]]. He was widely but incorrectly reported as the first American soldier [[killed in action]] in the war.

Shadrick was born in [[Harlan County, Kentucky]], one of 10 children. After dropping out of high school in 1948, he joined the U.S. Army, and spent a year of service in Japan before being dispatched to South Korea at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 along with his unit, the [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry Regiment]], [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]]. During a patrol, Shadrick was killed by the machine gun of a [[North Korea]]n [[T-34]] tank, and his body was taken to an outpost where journalist [[Marguerite Higgins]] was covering the war. Higgins later reported that he was the first soldier killed in the war, a claim that was repeated in media across the United States. His life was widely profiled, and his funeral drew hundreds of people.

His death is now believed to have occurred after the first American combat fatalities in the [[Battle of Osan]]. Since the identities of other soldiers killed before Shadrick remain unknown, he is still often incorrectly cited as the first U.S. soldier killed in the war.

==Early life and education==
Shadrick was born on August 4, 1931, in [[Harlan County, Kentucky]]. He was the third of 10 children born to Lucille Shadrick and Theodore Shadrick, a coal miner. Growing up during the [[Great Depression]], Kenneth Shadrick moved with his family to [[Wyoming, West Virginia]], then to an outlying town called Skin Fork, {{convert|20|mi}} away, as his father was looking for coal mining jobs. Shadrick was described by his family as &quot;an avid reader&quot; throughout his childhood, who had a variety of interests, including [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvmemory/vets/shadrickkenneth/shadrickkenneth.html |title=Kenneth Shadrick Biography |publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-08-05 |last=Baston |first=Constance}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also enjoyed riding his bicycle and, occasionally, hunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;

Shadrick enrolled in [[Pineville High School (West Virginia)|Pineville High School]] in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During his [[Tenth grade#United States|sophomore]] year in 1948, he developed an interest in [[American football|football]] and made the school's team, though he was small for his age. The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it&lt;!--the money, or the uniform?--&gt; was stolen from his locker in October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt; The incident upset Shadrick so much he dropped out of school, reportedly refusing to return from that day forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt; One month later, he and a friend enlisted in the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt; Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and said he felt it indirectly caused his son's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;

On November 10, 1948, Shadrick left for [[basic training|basic combat training]] at [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]]. As he was 17 years old, Shadrick had to convince his parents to sign papers allowing him to [[enlist]]. Shadrick completed this training in February 1949, and sailed for Japan to join the [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry Regiment]], [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]], for [[Occupation of Japan|post–World War II occupation duties]]. Shadrick spent a year on [[Kyushu]] island with the division.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt; According to his family, Shadrick enjoyed his tour in Japan at first, but by June 1950 he was growing tired of the country, and indicated in letters he was feeling depressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;
&lt;ref name=WVA /&gt;

==Career==
{{main article|Korean War}}
On the night of June 25, 1950, 10 divisions of the [[Korean People's Army|North Korean army]] launched a full-scale invasion of South Korea. Advancing with 89,000&amp;nbsp;men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] by surprise and routed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the opposing 38,000 front-line South Korean men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the South Korean forces retreated in the face of the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the southern capital, [[Seoul]], and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw southward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted to send assistance to the collapsing country and U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered ground troops to the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the warzone. Under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William F. Dean]], the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the [[Eighth United States Army]] could arrive and establish a defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean's plan was to airlift one [[battalion]] of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via [[C-54 Skymaster]] transport aircraft and to block advancing North Korean forces while the remainder of the division was transported on ships. The [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]] was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAJ&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usarj.army.mil/history/tfsmith.aspx |title=Task Force Smith Informational Paper |publisher=[[United States Army Japan]] |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, [[Task Force Smith]] engaged North Korean forces at the [[Battle of Osan]], delaying 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being defeated. The 540-man force suffered 60 killed, 21 wounded and 82 captured, a very heavy casualty rate. In the chaos of the retreat, most of the bodies were left behind, and the fates of many of the missing were unknown for several weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time, the 34th Infantry Regiment set up a line between the villages of [[Pyongtaek]] and [[Ansong]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of Osan, to fight the next delaying action against the advancing North Korean forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 34th Infantry Regiment was similarly unprepared for a fight, with few soldiers experienced in combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fehr74&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Shadrick was part of an [[M9A1 Bazooka]] team with 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt;

== Death ==
{{main article|Battle of Pyongtaek}}
[[File:Osan Bazooka Team.jpg|alt=Two soldiers standing in brush, one aiming a bazooka|thumb|Moments before his death, Shadrick (right) looks on as another soldier fires a bazooka.]]
About 90 minutes after Task Force Smith began its withdrawal from the Battle of Osan, the 34th Infantry sent Shadrick as part of a small scouting force northward to the village of Sojong-ni, {{convert|5|mi}} south of Osan.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt; The small force, under the command of Lieutenant Charles E. Payne and consisting mostly of bazooka teams and infantry, halted at a graveyard in the village,&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple78&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they spotted a North Korean [[T-34/85]] tank on a road to the north. Shadrick and the other bazooka operators began firing on the tank from long-range concealed positions&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt; at around 16:00.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple79&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; With them was Sergeant Charles R. Turnbull, a US Army [[combat photographer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/photographs/view.php?id=25072 |title=First casualty of the Korean War |publisher=[[Truman Presidential Library]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnbull asked Shadrick to time a bazooka shot so its flash could be caught in Turnbull's photograph, and Shadrick complied.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple78&quot;/&gt; Shadrick made the shot and paused, then rose from his concealed position to see if he had successfully hit the tank, exposing himself. The T-34 returned fire with its machine gun, and two bullets struck Shadrick in the chest and arm. Shadrick died moments later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;

Payne's patrol retreated without destroying the tank, taking Shadrick's body with them as the only casualty. The force returned to the 34th Infantry Command post in Pyongtaek to report to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] George B. Barth and [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Harold B. Ayres, who were commanding the troops in the town. Also present was [[Marguerite Higgins]], a [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''. Higgins subsequently reported Shadrick's death, referring to him as the first American killed in the Korean War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple78&quot;/&gt;

Shadrick's family was informed of his death by a neighbor who had heard his name on a radio broadcast, and the news from the military came via [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] several days later. The family was immediately inundated by reporters and local well-wishers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt; Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951, a funeral attended by hundreds of local residents was held in [[Beckley, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt; The service was set to coincide with the anniversary of the start of the war. His flag-draped casket was escorted down the streets of the town on a horse-drawn carriage,&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Peace Move|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m04EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |date=July 9, 1951 |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |issn=0024-3019 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was buried at the [[American Legion]] cemetery in the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVA&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
Higgins' account of Shadrick's death was widely republished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Har270&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harrity|2005|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a story about Shadrick's death on July 17, 1950, citing Shadrick as the first &quot;reported&quot; death in Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=The 8 O'clock Broadcast |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934948,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 17, 1950 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine reported Shadrick for up to a year as the first US soldier to die in the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt; and the claim has often been repeated,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrity|2005|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; including as recently as July 4, 2011, in the local newspaper in [[Huntington, West Virginia]], ''[[The Herald-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=This Week in West Virginia History |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/x2067712/This-week-in-West-Virginia-History |work=[[The Herald-Dispatch]] |date=July 4, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Legion]] Post 133 erected a monument to Shadrick at the [[Wyoming County, West Virginia|Wyoming County]] courthouse. The monument cites Shadrick's unit, date of death, and notes him as the &quot;first casualty of the Korean conflict&quot; with an epitaph that reads, &quot;He stands first in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live, grow and increase its blessings. Freedom lives and through it he lives – in a way that humbles the undertakings of most men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several memorials to local residents who served in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2005|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent publications have shed doubt on the accuracy of the claims of Shadrick's distinction. Eyewitness accounts at the Battle of Osan point to the first death as a machine gunner in the [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]], who had been killed at around 08:30, eight hours before Shadrick's death. This soldier was killed when a different T-34 tank was disabled at the battle and one of its crew members attacked nearby troops with a [[PPSh-41|PPSh-41 &quot;Burp Gun&quot;]]. In the confusion of the battle, many of the wounded and dead troops were left behind by retreating American troops, and a large part of the force was also captured; consequently, the identity of this first combat fatality remains a mystery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Har270&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadrick's awards and decorations include:&lt;ref name=&quot;ABMC&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abmc.gov/search-korean-war-veterans-memorial-honor-roll/detail/Korea_28888#.U3wmXvldXUU |title=Korean War Honor Roll listing: Kenneth R.
