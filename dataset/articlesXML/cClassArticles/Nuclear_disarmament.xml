'''Nuclear disarmament''' refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating [[nuclear weapon]]s and to the end state of a nuclear-weapons-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.
[[List of anti-nuclear groups|Nuclear disarmament groups]] include the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Peace Action]], [[Greenpeace]],  [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], [[Mayors for Peace]], [[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]], the [[International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons]], and the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]]. There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapon]]s and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Spirit of June 12&quot;&gt;Jonathan Schell. [http://www.thenation.com/article/spirit-june-12 The Spirit of June 12] ''The Nation'', July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;icanw.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/1982 1982 - a million people march in New York City]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, some U.S. elder statesmen have also advocated nuclear disarmament. [[Sam Nunn]], [[William Perry]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and [[George Shultz]] have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in various op-ed columns have proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the [[Nuclear Security Project]] to advance this agenda. Organisations such as [[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]], an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament, have also been established.

Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] occurring, especially accidentally. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].

==History==

It was the first U.S. nuclear field exercise conducted on land; troops shown are {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the blast.]]

In 1945 in the [[New Mexico]] desert, American scientists conducted &quot;[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]],&quot; the first [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons test]], marking the beginning of the [[atomic age]].&lt;ref name=pal/&gt; Even before the Trinity test, national leaders debated the impact of nuclear weapons on domestic and foreign policy. Also involved in the debate about nuclear weapons policy was the scientific community, through professional associations such as the [[Federation of Atomic Scientists]] and the [[Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]].&lt;ref name=brow/&gt;

On August 6, 1945, towards the end of [[World War II]], the [[Little Boy]] device was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]]. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[headquarters]] of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]]) and killed approximately 75,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese soldiers and 20,000 Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Uranium |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A to Z Guide to the Elements |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=0-19-850340-7 |authorlink=John Emsley |first=John |last=Emsley |pages=478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detonation of the [[Fat Man]] device exploded over the Japanese city of [[Nagasaki]] three days later on 9 August 1945, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200-28,200 Japanese civilian munitions workers and 150 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers &amp; Artists Against Nuclear Energy &amp; Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22–29 |date=May 1, 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the world’s nuclear weapons stockpiles grew.&lt;ref name=pal&gt;Mary Palevsky, Robert Futrell, and Andrew Kirk.

[[Operation Crossroads]] was a series of [[nuclear weapon]] tests conducted by the [[United States and nuclear weapons|United States]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to test the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. Pressure to cancel Operation Crossroads came from scientists and diplomats. [[Manhattan Project]] scientists argued that further nuclear testing was unnecessary and environmentally dangerous. A Los Alamos study warned &quot;the water near a recent surface explosion will be a 'witch's brew' of radioactivity&quot;. To prepare the atoll for the nuclear tests, Bikini's native residents were evicted from their homes and resettled on smaller, uninhabited islands where they were unable to sustain themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when a Hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific contaminated the crew of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Lucky Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=rudig2/&gt; One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later. The incident caused widespread concern around the world and &quot;provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries&quot;.&lt;ref name=rudig2&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-nuclear weapons movement grew rapidly because for many people the atomic bomb &quot;encapsulated the very worst direction in which society was moving&quot;.&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982).

Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified &quot;Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs&quot;. Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and &quot;an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;falkj&quot;/&gt; In the United Kingdom, the first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] organised by the [[Direct Action Committee]] and supported by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CND organised Aldermaston marches into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day events.&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt;

On November 1, 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]]. It was the largest national women's [[peace march|peace protest]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=dagmar2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dagmar-wilson-20110130,0,5499397.story |title=Dagmar Wilson dies at 94; organizer of women's disarmament protesters |author=Woo, Elaine |date=January 30, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24wilson.html |title=Dagmar Wilson, Anti-Nuclear Leader, Dies at 94 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=January 23, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to [[nuclear testing|nuclear-weapon testing]]. The &quot;[[Baby Tooth Survey]],&quot; headed by Dr [[Louise Reiss]], demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of [[nuclear fallout|radioactive fallout]] spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/134/3491/1669.pdf | title=Strontium-90 Absorption by Deciduous Teeth: Analysis of teeth provides a practicable method of monitoring strontium-90 uptake by human populations | accessdate=October 13, 2009 | author=Louise Zibold Reiss | date=November 24, 1961 | publisher=Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page26.html | title=Strontium-90 | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page27.html | title=The Right to Petition | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public pressure and the research results subsequently led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in 1963 by [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that the treaty went into force, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Pauling the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], describing him as &quot;Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only against the spread of these armaments, not only against their very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts.&quot;&lt;ref name=brow&gt;Jerry Brown and [[Rinaldo Brutoco]] (1997).

He was president of the scientific advisory board of the [[World Union for Protection of Life]] and also one of the signatories of the [[Dubrovnik-Philadelphia Statement]].

In the 1980s, a movement for nuclear disarmament again gained strength in the light of the weapons build-up and statements of [[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan had &quot;a world free of nuclear weapons&quot; as his personal mission,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/07/giulianis-obama-nuke-crit_n_528439.html Giuliani's Obama-Nuke Critique Defies And Ignores Reagan], Huffington Post 04- 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy], Heritage.org, July 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS9510/&gt; and was largely scorned for this in Europe.&lt;ref name=HS9510/&gt; Reagan was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=HS9510&gt;&quot;Hyvästi, ydinpommi&quot;, [[Helsingin Sanomat]] 2010-09-05, p.

===World Peace Council===

One of the earliest peace {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} organisations to emerge after the Second World War was the [[World Peace Council]], which was directed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] through the [[Soviet Peace Committee]].  Its origins lay in the [[Communist Information Bureau]]'s (Cominform) doctrine, put forward 1947, that the world was divided between peace-loving progressive forces led by the Soviet Union and warmongering capitalist countries led by the United States. In 1949, Cominform directed that peace &quot;should now become the pivot of the entire activity of the Communist Parties&quot;, and most western Communist parties followed this policy.&lt;ref name=deery&gt;[http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000637202 Deery, P., &quot;The Dove Flies East: Whitehall, Warsaw and the 1950 World Peace Congress&quot;, ''Australian Journal of Politics and History'', Vol. 48, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence S. Wittner|Lawrence Wittner]], a historian of the post-war peace movement, argues that the Soviet Union devoted great efforts to the promotion of the WPC in the early post-war years because it feared an American attack and American superiority of arms&lt;ref name=wittner/&gt; at a time when the USA possessed the [[atom bomb]] but the Soviet Union had not yet developed it.&lt;ref name=santi&gt;[http://santibox.ch/Peace/Peacemaking.html#5.%20A%20New%20Start Santi, Rainer, ''100 years of peace making: A history of the International Peace Bureau and other international peace movement organisations and networks'', Pax förlag, International Peace Bureau, January 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arms reduction treaties==

After the 1986 [[Reykjavik Summit]] between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and the new Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded two  important nuclear arms reduction treaties: the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] (1987) and [[START I]] (1991).  After the end of the Cold War, the United States and the Russian Federation concluded the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] (2003) and the [[New START]] Treaty (2010).

When the extreme danger intrinsic to nuclear war and the possession of nuclear weapons became apparent to all sides during the Cold War, a series of disarmament and nonproliferation treaties were agreed upon between the United States, the Soviet Union, and several other states throughout the world. Many of these treaties involved years of negotiations, and seemed to result in important steps in arms reductions and reducing the risk of nuclear war.

'''Key treaties'''
*[[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (PTBT) 1963: Prohibited all testing of nuclear weapons except underground.
*[[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT)—signed 1968, came into force 1970: An international treaty (currently with 189 member states) to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The treaty has three main pillars: nonproliferation, disarmament, and the right to peacefully use nuclear technology.
*[[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT I|Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms]] (SALT I) 1972: The Soviet Union and the United States agreed to a freeze in the number of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) that they would deploy.
*[[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) 1972: The United States and Soviet Union could deploy ABM interceptors at two sites, each with up to 100 ground-based launchers for ABM interceptor missiles. In a 1974 Protocol, the US and Soviet Union agreed to only deploy an ABM system to one site.
*[[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty]] (SALT II) 1979: Replacing SALT I, SALT II limited both the Soviet Union and the United States to an equal number of ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers. Also placed limits on Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles (MIRVS).
*[[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF) 1987: Created a global ban on short- and long-range nuclear weapons systems, as well as an intrusive verification regime.
*[[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START I)—signed 1991, ratified 1994: Limited long-range nuclear forces in the United States and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to 6,000 attributed warheads on 1,600 ballistic missiles and bombers.
*[[START II|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II]] (START II)—signed 1993, never put into force: START II was a bilateral agreement between the US and Russia which attempted to commit each side to deploy no more than 3,000 to 3,500 warheads by December 2007 and also included a prohibition against deploying multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
*[[SORT|Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] (SORT or Moscow Treaty)—signed 2002, into force 2003: A very loose treaty that is often criticized by arms control advocates for its ambiguity and lack of depth, Russia and the United States agreed to reduce their &quot;strategic nuclear warheads&quot; (a term that remain undefined in the treaty) to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. Was superseded by New Start Treaty in 2010.
*[[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT)—signed 1996, not yet in force: The CTBT is an international treaty (currently with 181 state signatures and 148 state ratifications) that bans all nuclear explosions in all environments. While the treaty is not in force, Russia has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1990 and the United States has not since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspw.org/index.php?title=Portal:Nuclear_Disarmament &quot;Nuclear Disarmament,&quot; US Policy World.  http://www.uspw.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[START treaty (2010)|New START Treaty]]—signed 2010, into force in 2011: replaces SORT treaty, reduces deployed nuclear warheads by about half, will remain into force until at least 2021
Only one country has been known to ever dismantle their nuclear arsenal completely&amp;mdash;the [[apartheid]] government of [[South Africa]] apparently developed half a dozen crude [[fission weapon]]s during the 1980s, but they were dismantled in the early 1990s.

==United Nations==
[[File:Angela Kane at Nagasaki Peace Memorial Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Angela Kane at a 2012 ceremony marking the anniversary of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings]]]]
{{Main|United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs}} 
In its landmark resolution 1653 of 1961, &quot;Declaration on the prohibition of the use of nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons,&quot; the UN General Assembly stated that use of nuclear weaponry “would exceed even the scope of war and cause indiscriminate suffering and destruction to mankind and civilization and, as such, is contrary to the rules of international law and to the laws of humanity”.&lt;ref name=burr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abolitionforum.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IHL-or-nuclear-weapons_choose-one.pdf |title=Humanitarian Law or Nuclear Weapons: Choose One |author=John Burroughs  |year=2012 |work=Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) is a department of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] established in January 1998 as part of the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]]'s plan to reform the UN as presented in his report to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] in July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N97/189/79/IMG/N9718979.pdf?OpenElement Renewing the United Nations: A Program for Reform (A/51/950)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its goal is to promote nuclear disarmament and [[non-proliferation]] and the strengthening of the disarmament regimes in respect to other [[weapons of mass destruction]], [[Chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]. It also promotes disarmament efforts in the area of [[conventional weapon]]s, especially [[land mine]]s and [[small arms]], which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts.

Following the retirement of [[Sergio Duarte]] in February 2012, [[Angela Kane]] was appointed as the new High Representative for Disarmament Affairs.

==U.S. nuclear policy==
Despite a general trend toward disarmament in the early 2000s, the [[George W. Bush administration]] repeatedly pushed to fund policies that would allegedly make nuclear weapons more usable in the post–Cold War environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/nov/30/usa.georgebush]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2099425/]&lt;/ref&gt; To date the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has refused to fund many of these policies. However, some &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0709-06.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; feel that even considering such programs harms the credibility of the United States as a proponent of nonproliferation.

===Recent controversial U.S. nuclear policies===

*[[Reliable Replacement Warhead Program]] (RRW): This program seeks to replace existing warheads with a smaller number of warhead types designed to be easier to maintain without testing.  Critics charge that this would lead to a new generation of nuclear weapons and would increase pressures to test.  Congress has not funded this program.
*'''Complex Transformation''': Complex transformation, formerly known as Complex 2030, is an effort to shrink the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and restore the ability to produce “pits” the fissile cores of the primaries of U.S. thermonuclear weapons.  Critics see it as an upgrade to the entire nuclear weapons complex to support the production and maintenance of the new generation of nuclear weapons.  Congress has not funded this program.
*[[Nuclear bunker buster]]: Formally known as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), this program aimed to modify an existing gravity bomb to penetrate into [[soil]] and [[Rock (geology)|rock]] in order to destroy underground targets.  Critics argue that this would lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons.  Congress did not fund this proposal, which was later withdrawn.
*[[National Missile Defense|Missile Defense]]: Formerly known as National Missile Defense, this program seeks to build a network of interceptor missiles to protect the United States and its allies from incoming missiles, including nuclear-armed missiles.  Critics have argued that this would impede nuclear disarmament and possibly stimulate a [[nuclear arms race]].  Elements of missile defense are being deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic, despite Russian opposition.

Former U.S. officials Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn (aka 'The Gang of Four' on Nuclear Deterrence).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://disarmingconflict.ca/2011/03/12/the-gang-of-four-on-nuclear-deterrence/, The Gang of Four on Nuclear Deterrence]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed in January 2007 that the United States rededicate itself to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, concluding: &quot;We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal.&quot;  Arguing a year later that &quot;with nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous,&quot; the authors concluded that although &quot;it is tempting and easy to say we can't get there from here, . . . we must chart a course” toward that goal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/pages/336 Renewed call from Kissinger, Nunn, Perry and Shultz for Nuclear-Free World]&lt;/ref&gt;  During his Presidential campaign, U.S. President Elect Barack Obama pledged to &quot;set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and pursue it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/#nuclear Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Plan to Secure America and Restore our Standing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. policy options for nuclear terrorism===
The United States has taken the lead in ensuring that nuclear materials globally are properly safeguarded. A popular program that has received bipartisan domestic support for over a decade is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR). While this program has been deemed a success, many believe that its funding levels need to be increased so as to ensure that all dangerous nuclear materials are secured in the most expeditious manner possible. The CTR program has led to several other innovative and important nonproliferation programs that need to continue to be a budget priority in order to ensure that nuclear weapons do not spread to actors hostile to the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Key programs:
*'''Cooperative Threat Reduction''' (CTR): The CTR program provides funding to help Russia secure materials that might be used in nuclear or [[chemical weapons]] as well as to dismantle [[weapons of mass destruction]] and their associated infrastructure in Russia.
*'''Global Threat Reduction Initiative''' (GTRI): Expanding on the success of the CTR, the GTRI will expand nuclear weapons and material securing and dismantlement activities to states outside of the former Soviet Union.

==Other states==
{{main|List of states with nuclear weapons}}

While the vast majority of states have adhered to the stipulations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a few states have either refused to sign the treaty or have pursued nuclear weapons programs while not being members of the treaty. Many view the pursuit of nuclear weapons by these states as a threat to nonproliferation and [[world peace]], and therefore seek policies to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons to these states, a few of which are often described by the US as &quot;rogue states&quot;.

==Recent developments==
Eliminating nuclear weapons has long been an aim of the pacifist left. But now many mainstream politicians, academic analysts, and retired military leaders also advocate nuclear disarmament. [[Sam Nunn]], [[William Perry]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and [[George Shultz]] have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opeds proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda.  Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, &quot;I’m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers. You can’t deter a group who is willing to commit suicide. We are in a different era. You have to understand the world has changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maclin, Beth (2008-10-20) [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18606/ &quot;A Nuclear weapon-free world is possible, Nunn says&quot;], Belfer Center, Harvard University. Retrieved on 2008-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled ''[[Nuclear Tipping Point]]''.  The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the Wall Street Journal op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=The Growing Appeal of Zero |author= |date=June 18, 2011 |work=The Economist |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]] is an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalzero.org?name=2.htm&amp;id=2&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative, launched in December 2008, promotes a phased withdrawal and verification for the destruction of all devices held by official and unofficial members of the [[nuclear club]]. The Global Zero campaign works toward building an international consensus and a sustained global movement of leaders and citizens for the elimination of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Goals include the initiation of [[United States]]-[[Russia]] bilateral negotiations for reductions to 1,000 total warheads each and commitments from the other key nuclear weapons countries to participate in multilateral negotiations for phased reductions of nuclear arsenals. Global Zero works to expand the diplomatic dialogue with key governments and continue to develop policy proposals on the critical issues related to the elimination of nuclear weapons.

The [[International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament, Oslo, 2008|International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament]] took place in [[Oslo]] in February, 2008, and was organized by The Government of [[Norway]], the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] and the [[Hoover Institute]]. The Conference was entitled ''Achieving the Vision of a World Free of Nuclear Weapons'' and had the purpose of building consensus between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states in relation to the [[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://disarmament.nrpa.no/ |title=International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament |date=February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, 2010|Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation]] took place in [[Tehran]] in April 2010. The conference was held shortly after the signing of the [[New START]], and resulted in a call of action toward eliminating all nuclear weapons. Representatives from 60 countries were invited to the conference. [[Non-governmental organization]]s were also present.

Among the prominent figures who have called for the abolition of nuclear weapons are &quot;the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], the entertainer [[Steve Allen]], [[CNN]]’s [[Ted Turner]], former [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Claiborne Pell]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] president [[Theodore Hesburgh]], South African Bishop [[Desmond Tutu]] and the [[Dalai Lama]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=40 |title=Nuclear Weapons: Instruments of Peace  |author=Ernest Lefever |date=Autumn 1999 |volume=1 |issue=2 |work=Global Dialogue }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that nuclear weapons have made the world relatively safer, with peace through [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] and through the [[stability–instability paradox]], including in south Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/ESCCONTROLCHAPTER1.pdf|title=The Stability-Instability Paradox, Misperception, and Escalation Control in South Asia|last=Krepon|first=Michael|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230611/http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/ESCCONTROLCHAPTER1.pdf|archive-date=2 May 2013|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2911/the-stability-instability-paradox|title=The Stability-Instability Paradox|last=Krepon|first=Michael|date=November 2, 2010|website=Arms Control Wonk|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Waltz]] has argued that nuclear weapons have created a [[nuclear peace]], and further nuclear weapon proliferation might even help avoid the large scale conventional wars that were so common prior to their invention at the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm Kenneth Waltz, “The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: More May be Better,”&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 2012 issue of [[Foreign Affairs]] Waltz took issue with the view of most U.S., European, and Israeli, commentators and policymakers that a nuclear-armed Iran would be unacceptable. Instead Waltz argues that it would probably be the best possible outcome, as it would restore stability to the Middle East by balancing [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's regional monopoly on nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waltz|first=Kenneth|title=Why Iran Should Get the Bomb: Nuclear Balancing Would Mean Stability|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=July–August 2012|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137731/kenneth-n-waltz/why-iran-should-get-the-bomb|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor John Mueller of [[Ohio State University]], the author of ''Atomic Obsession'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/InternationalStudies/InternationalSecurityStrategicSt/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195381368|title=Atomic Obsession}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also dismissed the need to interfere with Iran's nuclear program and expressed that arms control measures are counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;http://bloggingheads.tv/videos/2333 From 19:00 to 26:00 minutes&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2010 lecture at the [[University of Missouri]], which was broadcast by [[C-SPAN]], Dr. Mueller has also argued that the threat from nuclear weapons, especially [[nuclear terrorism]], has been exaggerated, both in the popular media and by officials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/AtomicO: John Mueller, &quot;Atomic Obsession&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Secretary Kissinger says there is a new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence: &quot;The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil. In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn’t operate in any comparable way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/ben-goddard/78391-cold-warriors-say-no-nukes |title=Cold Warriors say no nukes |author=Ben Goddard |date=2010-01-27  |work=The Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt; George Shultz has said, &quot;If you think of the people who are doing suicide attacks, and people like that get a nuclear weapon, they are almost by definition not deterrable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebulletin.org/new-abolitionists |title=The new abolitionists |author=[[Hugh Gusterson]] |date=30 March 2012 |work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
