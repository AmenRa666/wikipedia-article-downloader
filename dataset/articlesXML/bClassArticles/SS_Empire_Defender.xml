'''''Empire Defender''''' was a {{GRT|5649|link=off}} [[cargo ship]] that was built in 1910 as '''''Freienfels''''' by Joh. C. Tecklenborg in [[Geestemünde]], Germany. She was seized by the United Kingdom in 1914, passing to the [[Admiralty]]. In 1920, she was passed to the [[Secretary of State for India]].

She was sold to [[Greece]] in 1925 and renamed '''''Hadiotis'''''. In 1928, she was sold to Italy and renamed '''''Felce'''''. In 1940, she was seized by the United Kingdom and passed to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] (MoWT). Renamed ''Empire Defender'', she served until 14 November 1941, when she was torpedoed and sunk. Her sinking killed four crew members on board.

==Description==
The ship was built in 1910 by Joh. C. Tecklenborg in [[Geestemünde]].&lt;ref name=Ships&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mitchell |first1=W.H. |last2=Sawyer |first2=L.A. |year=1995 |title=The Empire Ships |page=not cited |publisher= Lloyd's of London Press Ltd |location= London, New York, Hamburg, Hong Kong |isbn=1-85044-275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was yard number 237.&lt;ref name=DDG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ddghansa-shipsphotos.de/freienfels100.htm |title=D/S FREIENFELS |publisher=DDG Hansa Shipsphotos |language=German |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As built, the ship was {{convert|128.36|m|ftin}} long, with a beam of {{convert|16.80|m|ftin}}. She had a depth of {{convert|9.52|m|ftin}} and a draught of {{convert|7.63|m|ftin}}. She was assessed at {{GRT|5,633}}, {{NRT|3,545}}. Her [[deadweight tonnage|DWT]] was 8,705.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt;

The ship had a {{convert|2300|ihp|kW}} [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|quadruple expansion steam engine]], with cylinders of 61&amp;nbsp;cm (21{{frac|1|64}} inches), 88&amp;nbsp;cm (34{{frac|21|32}} inches), 128&amp;nbsp;cm (50{{frac|25|32}} inches) and 189&amp;nbsp;cm (74{{frac|1|32}} inches) diameter by 137&amp;nbsp;cm (53{{frac|15|16}} inches) stroke.&lt;ref name=Felce30&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b0408.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VAPEUR ET A MOTEURS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was built by JC Tecklenborg, Wesermünde. It drove a screw propeller and could propel the ship at {{convert|11.5|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt;

==History==
''Freienfels'' was built for [[Deutsche Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft &quot;Hansa&quot;]] (DDG Hansa), [[Bremen]]. She was launched on 20 September 1910 and delivered on 22 November. Her port of registry was Bremen and the [[Code Letters]] QJVC were allocated. She had a crew of 63. On 5 August 1914, ''Freienfels'' was seized by the United Kingdom at [[Calcutta]], India.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt; She was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] and operated under the management of Grahams &amp; Co Ltd.&lt;ref name=Mariners&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/EmpireD.html |title=EMPIRE – D – E |publisher=Mariners |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her port of registry was changed to London and the Code Letters JLGB were allocated.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt; ''Freienfels'' was allocated the Official Number 139043.&lt;ref name=Number&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/ON130000.htm |title =ON130000 |publisher=Mariners |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, she was passed to the [[Secretary of State for India]], operating under the management of the Director, India Office Shipping.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt;

''Freienfels'' was one of five ships that were condemned to detention, but not declared to be [[prize of war|prizes of war]]. The other ships were {{SS|Braunfels||2}}, {{SS|Frankenfels||2}}, {{SS|Kurmark||2}} and  {{SS|Rotenfels||2}}. Under the terms of the [[Versailles Treaty]], they were to be sold. On 2 March 1925, questions were asked in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by [[Joseph Kenworthy, 10th Baron Strabolgi|Joseph Kenworthy, MP]] about the profitability and proposed sale of the ships to [[Greece]], and what arrangements had been made for the continued employment of her British crew. In reply, [[Edward Turnour, 6th Earl Winterton|Earl Winterton]], then [[Under-Secretary of State for India]] said that the five ships had made in excess of [[Pound Sterling|£1,700,000]] profit. The disposal of the ships was a matter for the Reparation Commission and the [[India Office]] had no say in the disposal of the ships.&lt;ref name=Hansard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1925/mar/02/ex-enemy-vessels |title=EX-ENEMY VESSELS. |publisher=Hansard |date=2 March 1925 |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frienfels'' was duly advertised for sale in June 1925. She would be available for inspection at [[Dunquerque]], France from 6–18 June, and would then depart for [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] where she was to be laid up pending sale. She was described as {{GRT|5633|link=off}}, 9,112 DWT.&lt;ref name=Times040625&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Ex-Enemy Steamers |day_of_week=Thursday |date=4 June 1925 |page_number=18 |issue=43979 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Freienfels'' was sold to Pnevmaticos, Rethymnis &amp; Yannaghas, [[Syra]], Greece. She was renamed ''Hadiotis''. In 1927, she was sold to Kassos Steam Navigation Co. Ltd, Syra and placed under the management of Pnevmaticos, Rethymnis &amp; Yannaghas. In September 1928, ''Hadiotis'' was sold to Achille Lauro fu Giochine &amp; Co, [[Naples]], Italy and was renamed ''Felce''. The Code Letters NPCL were allocated. On 1 January 1934, these were changed to IBVL.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt; On 18 January 1937, ''Felce'' ran aground at [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]], [[French Somaliland]]. After her cargo was discharged,&lt;ref name=Times190137&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Casualty Reports |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=19 January 1937 |page_number=23 |issue=47586 |column=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; she was refloated with assistance from a tug.&lt;ref name=Times200137&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Casualty Reports |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=20 January 1937 |page_number=6 |issue=47587 |column=G }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Timeline of World War II (1940)#June 1940|10 June 1940]], ''Felce'' was in port at [[Haifa]], [[British Mandate for Palestine|Palestine]]. She was seized and passed to the MoWT. She was renamed ''Empire Defender''. Her port of registry was changed to London and the Code Letters GPJG were allocated. She was placed under the management of the City Line Ltd.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt; She was assessed as {{GRT|5649|link=off}},&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; and would have regained her previous Official Number 139043.

''Empire Defender{{'}}s'' movements over the next six months are not recorded.&lt;ref name=Port&gt;{{cite web |url=http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=EMPIRE%20DEFENDER~armain |title=EMPIRE DEFENDER |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She departed from [[Suez]], [[Egypt]] on 4 November 1940 as a member of Convoy BS 8, which dispersed off [[Aden]] on 12 November.&lt;ref name=BS8&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/misc/index.html?yy.php?convoy=BS.8!~miscmain |title=Convoy BS.8  |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She detached from the convoy before it dispersed and sailed to [[Port Sudan]], [[Sudan]], arriving on 8 November.&lt;ref name=Port/&gt; She departed from Port Sudan on 22 November to join Convoy BS 9,&lt;ref name=Port/&gt; which had departed from Suez on 18 November and dispersed on 26 November at {{coord|12|30|N|48|23|E}}.&lt;ref name=BS9&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/misc/index.html?yy.php?convoy=BS.9!~miscmain |title=Convoy BS.9  |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sailed to [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], arriving on 8 December. Leaving Mombasa on 15 December, she sailed to [[Durban]], South Africa, where she arrived on 26 December.&lt;ref name=Port/&gt;

During 1941, management of ''Empire Defender'' passed to the Stanhope Steamship Co Ltd.&lt;ref name=DDG/&gt; ''Empire Defender'' departed from Durban on 6 April 1941 for [[Cape Town]], where she arrived on 11 April. Although she departed from Cape Town on 17 April, she returned two days later. She departed for a second time on 3 May for [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], arriving there on 22 May. ''Empire Defender'' departed from Freetown on 15 June for [[Saint Lucia]], where she arrived on 5 July, departing five days later for the [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]], United States, arriving on 21 July. She departed from the Hampton Roads on 10 August for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, Canada, arrving four days later.&lt;ref name=Port/&gt; She departed from Halifax on 16 August as a member of Convoy HX 156, which arrived at [[Liverpool]], Lancashire, United Kingdom on 31 August.

''Empire Defender'' departed from Southend on 27 September as a member of Convoy FN 524, which arrived at Methil on 29 September. The next day, she departed from Methil to join Convoy EC 79,&lt;ref name=Port/&gt; which had departed from Southend on 28 September and arrived at [[Oban]], Argyllshire on 3 October.&lt;ref name=EC79&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/ec/index.html?ec.php?convoy=79!~ecmain |title=Convoy EC.79 |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sailed on to the [[River Clyde|Clyde]], arriving on 3 October.&lt;ref name=Port/&gt; ''Empire Defender'' was ordered to sail from [[Glasgow]] to [[Malta]] laden with ammunition,&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; as part of [[Operation Astrologer]].&lt;ref name=Malta&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xAH-MaltaSupply02.htm |title=THE SUPPLY OF MALTA 1940–1942, Part 2 of 3 |first=Arnold |last=Hague |publisher=Naval History |year=1995 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1941, 60 [[lascar]] sailors refused to sail, claiming that the vessel was cursed and would be sunk before the next [[new moon]]. The authorities were unable to persuade them to sail by either threats or inducements. An equivalent number of white sailors were procured with a payment of £10 in cash each to accept the lascar accommodation. The ship had been repainted with a black hull, white topsides and a buff funnel, contrary to wartime regulations. All armament had been removed in an effort to make the ship appear as though it belonged to a neutral country.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; She departed from the Clyde on 29 October to join Convoy OG 76,&lt;ref name=Port/&gt; which departed from [[Milford Haven]], [[Pembrokeshire]] on 26 October and arrived at [[Gibraltar]] on 11 November.&lt;ref name=OG76&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/og/index.html?og.php?convoy=76!~ogmain |title=Convoy OG.76 |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Empire Defender'' passed Gibraltar on 11 November,&lt;ref name=Port/&gt; and headed for Malta. The flag of whichever nation's waters she was in at the time was painted on her hull, thus she was passed off as a French, Spanish and Italian ship.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; Operation Astrologer had probably been compromised following the loss of the merchantman {{SS|Parracombe||2}} on 2 May 1941 and the subsequent interrogation of her crew who were interned in [[Vichy France|France]].
