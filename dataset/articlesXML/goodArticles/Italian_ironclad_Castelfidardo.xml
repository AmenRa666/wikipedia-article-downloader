'''''Castelfidardo''''' was the third of four {{sclass-|Regina Maria Pia|ironclad|0}} [[ironclad warship]]s built in French shipyards for the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) in the 1860s. ''Castelfidardo'' was laid down in July 1862, was launched in August 1863, and was completed in May 1864. She and her three [[sister ship]]s were [[broadside ironclad]]s, mounting a battery of four {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} and twenty-two {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} guns on the [[broadside]].

''Castelfidardo'' participated in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866. She was stationed in the van of the Italian fleet, which became separated from the rest of the fleet and was not heavily engaged. Her career was limited after the war, owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a [[central battery ship]] some time after Lissa, and was modernized several more times in the 1870s and 1880s. From 1900 to 1910 she served as a [[training ship]] before being [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.

==Design==
{{main|Regina Maria Pia-class ironclad}}
[[File:Regina Maria Pia (1863) Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''Regina Maria Pia'' in her 1888 configuration]]

''Castelfidardo'' was {{convert|81.8|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]]; she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|15.16|m|abbr=on}} and an average [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.35|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|4192|MT|sp=us}} normally and up to {{convert|4527|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} at full load. She had a crew of 480&amp;ndash;485&amp;nbsp;officers and men. ''Castelfidardo'' was a [[broadside ironclad]], and she was initially armed with a [[main battery]] of four {{convert|8|in|abbr=on|0}} guns and twenty-two {{convert|164|mm|abbr=on}} guns, though her armament changed throughout her career. The ship was protected by iron [[belt armor]] that was {{convert|4.3|in|abbr=on|0}} thick and extended for the entire length of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] at the [[waterline]]. The side armor extended up to the battery deck with the same thickness of iron plate.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;

Her propulsion system consisted of one single-expansion [[steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]], with steam supplied by eight coal-fired, rectangular [[boiler]]s. Her engine produced a top speed of {{convert|12.1|kn|lk=in}} from {{convert|2125|ihp|lk=in}}. She could steam for {{convert|2600|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship was initially [[schooner]]-rigged to supplement the steam engine, though her masts were later reduced to a [[barque]] rig. Ultimately, she lost her sailing rig completely, having it replaced with a pair of [[military mast]]s with [[fighting top]]s.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;

==Service history==
''Castelfidardo'' was laid down on 27 July 1862 at the [[Gouin et Guibert]] shipyard in [[St. Nazaire]], France. She was launched on 1 August 1863 and completed in May 1864.&lt;ref name=G339&gt;Gardiner, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], which was fought concurrently with the [[Austro-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name=S1&gt;Sondhaus, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian fleet commander, Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austrian Navy]], despite the fact that the Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}, ''en route'' from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 217&amp;ndash;222&lt;/ref&gt;

Rear Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] brought the Austrian fleet to [[Ancona]] on June 27, in an attempt to draw out the Italians. At the time, many of the Italian ships were in disarray; several ships did not have their entire armament, and several others had problems with their engines. ''Castelfidardo'' was one of the few ironclads fit for action, so she, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|San Martino||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe di Carignano||2}} formed up to prepare to attack Tegetthoff's ships. Persano held a council of war aboard ''Principe di Carignano'' to determine whether he should sortie to engage Tegetthoff, but by that time, the Austrians had withdrawn, making the decision moot. The Minister of the Navy, [[Agostino Depretis]], urged Persano to act and suggested the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], to restore Italian confidence after their defeat at the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]] the previous month. On 7 July, Persano left Ancona and conducted a sweep into the Adriatic, but encountered no Austrian ships and returned on the 13th.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 216&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Lissa===
[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July]]
{{main|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet out of Ancona, bound for Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought troop transports carrying 3,000 soldiers; the Italian warships began bombarding the Austrian forts on the island, with the intention of landing the soldiers once the fortresses had been silenced. In response, the Austrian Navy sent the fleet under Tegetthoff to attack the Italian ships.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, pp. 1&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Castelfidardo'' was at that time assigned to the 1st Division, commanded by Admiral [[Giovanni Vacca (admiral)|Giovanni Vacca]], along with the ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ancona||2}} and ''Principe di Carignano'', the divisional flagship.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving off Lissa on the 18th,&lt;ref name=S1/&gt; Persano ordered the 1st Division to bombard the Austrian fortresses protecting the island, but Vacca informed him that his ships' guns could not elevate high enough to hit the high fortifications. Persano then sent Vacca's division to [[Vis (town)|Vis]] to force the harbor defenses, but by the time they arrived, night was approaching, and so he cancelled the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 221&amp;ndash;222&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, Persano ordered the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Formidabile||2}} to enter the harbor Vis and attack the Madonna [[artillery battery|battery]], supported by ''Castelfidardo'' and the rest of the 1st Division. Vacca found it impossible to employ his ships in the confined waters, and so he left ''Formidabile'' to handle the battery. With the day's attacks again having yielded no results, Persano decided to make another attempt on the 20th. Vacca would take his three ships to patrol to the north-east of the island while the rest of the fleet would again try to land the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 221&amp;ndash;224&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Italians could begin the attack, the [[dispatch boat]] {{ship|Italian dispatch boat|Esploratore||2}} arrived, bringing news of Tegetthoff's approach. Persano's fleet was in disarray; Vacca's ships were three miles to the northeast from Persano's main force, and three other ironclads were further away to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 223&amp;ndash;225&lt;/ref&gt; Persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with Vacca's, first in [[line abreast]] formation, and then in [[line ahead]] formation. ''Castelfidardo'' initially reported trouble with her engines, but her crew was able to repair them before the battle began.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the action began, Persano left his flagship, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, and transferred to the [[turret ship]] ''Affondatore'', though none of his subordinates on the other ships were aware of the change. They there thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping ''Re d'Italia'', he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships and the rest of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass, so he turned back toward Persano's ships, and took ''Re d'Italia'', ''San Martino'', and ''Palestro'' under heavy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235&lt;/ref&gt; Vacca turned ''Principe di Carignano'' and ''Castelfidardo'' to port, taking them away from the Austrian ships hammering Persano's division. He briefly attempted to engage the Austrian wooden ships in the rear, but was driven off by heavy fire from three steam [[frigate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

''Castelfidardo'', ''Principe di Carignano'', and the [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Varese||2}} engaged the wooden [[ship of the line]] {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}}, but failed to inflict fatal damage to her before she withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, ''Re d'Italia'' had been rammed and sunk, and ''Palestro'' had been set on fire, soon to be destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, Persano refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and [[Pula|Pola]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 238&amp;ndash;241, 250&lt;/ref&gt; ''Castelfidardo'' had emerged from the battle relatively unscathed, though the captain's cabin had been set on fire by an Austrian shell.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:Castelfidardo NH 66035.jpg|thumb|''Castelfidardo'' in the 1880s]]
For the rest of her long career, ''Castelfidardo'' served in a variety of roles, both in the main fleet and in [[Italian Empire|Italy's colonial empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordovini et al., pp. 343&amp;ndash;344&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of [[Civitavecchia]] in September 1870, as part of the [[Italian unification|wars of Italian unification]]. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors [[conscript]]ed to man them were sent home.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after 1866, the ship was rebuilt as a [[central battery ship]], with most of her guns located in a central, armored [[casemate]]. Two other guns were placed in the bow as [[chase gun]]s, with a third mounted as a stern chaser. Around 1871, her armament was also revised, to two {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} guns in the bow and eight 8&amp;nbsp;in guns, four on each [[broadside]]. By 1880, her armament had been changed another time, with two {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} guns replacing the 10&amp;nbsp;in guns, and a ninth 8&amp;nbsp;in gun being added in the stern. The ship was modernized in 1884, with her armament replaced with eight {{convert|6|in|abbr=on}} guns, six {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on}} guns, four {{convert|57|mm|abbr=on}} [[quick-firing gun|quick firing]] (QF) guns, and eight {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss revolver cannon]]s.&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;

For the annual fleet maneuvers held in 1885, ''Castelfidardo'' served in the &quot;Eastern Squadron&quot;, joined by the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe Amedeo||2}}, the [[corvette]] {{ship|Italian corvette|Amerigo Vespucci||2}}, a [[sloop]], and four [[torpedo boat]]s. The &quot;Eastern Squadron&quot; defended against an attacking &quot;Western Squadron&quot;, simulating a Franco-Italian conflict, with operations conducted off [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; By 1899, ''Castelfidardo'' had been assigned to the 2nd Division, which also included the ironclads ''Affondatore'' and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Sicilia||2}} and the [[torpedo cruiser]]s {{ship|Italian cruiser|Partenope||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Urania||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brassey, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she was converted into a torpedo [[training ship]]. Her armament now consisted of one {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} QF gun, one {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} gun, four 57&amp;nbsp;mm guns, one {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} gun, two of the 37&amp;nbsp;mm revolver cannons, and two [[torpedo tube]]s. She served in this capacity until she was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1910, thereafter being [[ship breaking|broken up for scrap]].&lt;ref name=G339/&gt;
