The '''16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 2 gun''' and the near-identical '''Mark 3''' were guns originally designed and built for the [[United States Navy]] as the main armament for the [[South Dakota-class battleship (1920)|''South Dakota''-class battleships]] and {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser}}s. At the time, they were among the heaviest guns built for use as [[naval artillery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk2.htm|title=United States of America 16&quot;/50 (40.6 cm) Mark 2 and Mark 3 |publisher=Navweaps |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, both of these ship classes were cancelled part way through construction, surplussing about 70 examples of the 16-inch/50 which had already been built. Twenty were released to the [[US Army]], between 1922–1924, for use by the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]], the rest were kept in storage for future naval use. Only ten of the twenty available guns were deployed (in five two-gun batteries) prior to 1940.&lt;ref name=Berhow61&gt;Berhow, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps&quot; /&gt;

When the design of the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}} began in 1938, it was initially assumed these ships would use the surplus guns. However, due to a miscommunication between the two Navy departments involved in the design, the ships required a lighter gun than the Mark 2/Mark 3. In January 1941 all but three of the remaining fifty Mark 2 and Mark 3 guns were released to the Army. They were the primary armament of 21 two-gun batteries built in the United States and its territories during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berhow, p. 225&quot;&gt;Berhow, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these were fired in anger.

== Development ==
[[File:Model of South Dakota class battleship.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the [[South Dakota-class battleship (1920)|''South Dakota''-class]] battleship, including 12 16&quot;/50 Mark 2 guns.]]
The first example of a US 16-inch gun was an [[United States Army|Army]] weapon, [[16-inch gun M1895|the M1895]], approved for construction in 1895, and completed in 1902; only one was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wva.army.mil/MUSEUM.HTM |title= Watervliet Arsenal Museum |accessdate= 4 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090404030342/http://www.wva.army.mil/MUSEUM.HTM| archivedate= 4 April 2009 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US Navy [[16&quot;/45 caliber gun|16-inch/45]] [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mark 1 gun, which armed the [[Colorado-class battleship|''Colorado''-class battleships]] launched 1920–21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DiGiulian |first=Tony |year=2008 |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-45_mk1.htm |title=United States of America 16&quot;/45 (40.6 cm) Mark 1 |accessdate= 25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman Battleships, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The second Navy design, the Mark 2, was intended as armament for the planned [[South Dakota-class battleship (1920)|''South Dakota''-class battleships]], and also selected for the modified design of the {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser}}s, replacing the [[14&quot;/50 caliber gun|14-inch/50 caliber gun]] that was originally used for the design.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman Battleships, pp. 154–165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman Cruisers, pp. 86–103&lt;/ref&gt; The Mark 3 was a slightly modified version of the Mark 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;Silverstone, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the United States entering into the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], the terms limited the United States to a maximum displacement of {{convert|35000|LT|MT}}. As both the ''South Dakota''-class battleships and ''Lexington''-class battlecruisers exceeded this limit, the Navy was required to cancel their construction, doing so in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC BB49&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/usnshtp/bb/bb49cl.htm |title= Navy Historical Center – Ship types: ''South Dakota'' Class |accessdate= 3 September 2010| archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100412213756/http%3A//www%2Ehistory%2Enavy%2Emil/photos/usnshtp/bb/bb49cl%2Ehtm| archivedate= 12 April 2010 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While two of the ''Lexington'' class were re-ordered as {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier}}s, none of them were completed with the [[barbette]]s necessary to mount these guns. Construction of the 16-inch Mark 2 and Mark 3 guns was also cancelled with 70 completed, plus the prototype, Gun No. 42. Twenty of the existing guns were transferred to the Army in 1922 to supplement the Army's more massive and much more expensive [[16-inch gun M1919]], of which only seven were ever deployed. The remaining Mk2/Mk3 guns were retained for use on future warships. With funding lacking until 1940, five batteries of two Mk2/Mk3 guns each were built 1924–40 in the [[Harbor Defense Command|harbor defenses]] of [[Pearl Harbor]], the [[Panama Canal Zone]] (Pacific side), and [[San Francisco]]. They were designated 16-inch Navy guns MkIIMI and MkIIIMI in Army service. A version of the M1919 [[barbette]] mount used for the M1919 guns was used for these batteries, except at [[Fort Funston]] in San Francisco, where Battery Davis was the prototype for the M2 mount and [[casemate|casemating]].&lt;ref&gt;Berhow, pp. 174–175, 224&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, with the signing of the [[Second London Naval Treaty]], the tonnage limit for battleships was relaxed to 45,000 tons. After this, the U.S. Navy began design of a ship that would fit this higher tonnage limit, eventually resulting in the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}. The larger size would allow for guns with a 16-inch caliber and a 50-caliber length, larger than the [[16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 gun|16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns]] used on the [[North Carolina-class battleship|''North Carolina'']]- and [[South Dakota-class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota''-class battleships]]. While the ''Iowa''-class battleships were under construction, the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] assumed that the guns to be used would be the existing Mark 2 and 3 weapons, and through miscommunication, the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] assumed the ships would use a lighter design. As a result, the Mark 2 and 3 guns were not used for these, and the [[16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|16-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]] was designed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman Battleships, pp. 311–313&lt;/ref&gt; The Mark 2 and 3 guns were never placed on any ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot; /&gt;

== Design ==
The 16-inch Mark 2 was 50 calibers long, with a liner, an A [[Built-up gun|tube]], jacket and seven [[Hoop gun|hoops]] with four hoop locking rings and a screw box liner. The Mod 0 used an increasing twist in the rifling while the Mod 1 used a uniform twist and a different groove pattern. The Mark 3 was the same as the Mark 2 but used a one-step conical liner. The Mark 3 Mod 0 had an increasing rifling twist (like the Mark 2 Mod 0) while the Mark 3 Mod 1 utilized had a uniform twist. At the time the program was cancelled, in 1922, 71 guns had been built, including the prototype, while another 44 were in progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;friedman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yh3OAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg | title=Naval Weapons of World War One | publisher=Seaforth Publishing | author=Friedman, Norman | year=2011 | pages=158–159 | isbn=978 1 84832 100 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Mark 3 Mod 1 was modified and used as the prototype for the 16-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 gun, which would go on to arm the ''Iowa''-class battleships; it was redesignated as Mark D Mod 0.&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps&quot; /&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:16-inch-Casemated.jpg|thumb|right|A [[casemate]]d 16-inch gun. Almost all batteries were casemated by 1940.]]
These [[built-up gun]]s were {{convert|66|ft|8|in|m}} long—50 times their {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} bore, or 50 calibers from [[breechface]] to [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. With a full powder charge of {{convert|700|lb|kg}}, the guns were capable of firing a {{convert|2110|lb|kg|adj=on}} Mark 3 armor-piercing shell with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s}} firing out to an effective range of {{convert|44680|yards|m}}. The Army used a reduced charge ({{convert|672|lb|kg}} with Mark 3 shell or {{convert|648|lb|kg}} with Mark 12 shell) and either a {{convert|2110|lb|kg|adj=on}} Mark 3 shell or a {{convert|2240|lb|kg|adj=on}} Mark 12 shell, for a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s}} with the Mark 3 or {{convert|2650|ft/s|m/s}} with the Mark 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps&quot; /&gt; The range for the Army version is listed as {{convert|45150|yd|m|abbr=on}} but it is not clear which shell and charge this is for.&lt;ref name=Berhow61&gt;Berhow, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service ==

With war on the horizon, the Navy released the approximately 50 remaining guns, and on 27 July 1940, in the wake of the [[Fall of France]], the Army's Harbor Defense Board recommended the construction of twenty-seven 16-inch two-gun batteries to protect strategic points along the US coastline, to be [[casemate]]d against air attack, as were almost all of the older batteries by this time. The M2 through M5 barbette mounts were used for the later batteries.&lt;ref&gt;Berhow, pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; As with the previous M1919 barbette carriage, these were designed with an elevation of 65 degrees to allow plunging fire as enemy ships approached.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance, pp. 147-149&lt;/ref&gt; About twenty-one 16-inch gun batteries were completed at eleven [[Harbor Defense Command|harbor defense commands]] in 1941–44, but not all of these were armed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berhow, p. 225&quot;/&gt;

Typical of this plan were the guns placed to protect [[Narragansett Bay]], [[Rhode Island]]; two 16-inch guns in Battery Gray, [[Fort Church (Rhode Island)|Fort Church]], [[Little Compton, Rhode Island]], with two more in Battery Hamilton, [[Fort Greene (Rhode Island)|Fort Greene]], [[Point Judith]], [[Narragansett, Rhode Island]].  A second battery of 16-inch guns at Fort Greene, Battery 109, had construction suspended in 1943 and never received guns.  These batteries were placed such that they not only protected Narraganset Bay, but interdicted the main channels into [[Buzzards Bay (bay)|Buzzards Bay]] and the east end of [[Long Island Sound]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schroder&quot;&gt;Schroder, pp. 37–50&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1943, the threat of a naval attack on the United States had diminished, and with two or four 16-inch guns in most harbor defenses, construction and arming of further batteries was suspended. As 16-inch guns and a companion [[6-inch gun M1|improved 6-inch gun]] were emplaced, older weapons were scrapped. With the war over in 1945, most of the remaining coast defense guns, including the recently-emplaced 16-inch weapons, were scrapped by 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Assistant Secretary of Defense, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surviving examples ==
All but four of these guns were scrapped by 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;ord-m&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ordmusfound.org/16ingun.html |title=16-Inch Coast Defense Gun |accessdate=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One remaining piece is a Mark 3 ([[Bethlehem Steel]] No. 138) at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Aberdeen, Maryland]],  {{Coord|39|29|22.9|N|76|08|21.6|W|type:landmark_region:US-MD|display=inline}}. Another is a Mark 2 (Naval Gun Factory No. 111) at the former [[Naval Gun Factory]] at the [[Washington Navy Yard]], part of the [[Naval Historical Center]] museum collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot; /&gt; Two Mark 2 guns (Nos. 96 and 100) remain at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division]], Dahlgren, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsg.org/old/reprint%20PDFs/survive14.pdf List of surviving US coast defense weapons at the Coast Defense Study Group]&lt;/ref&gt;
