[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''George John William Mackinolty''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (24&amp;nbsp;March 1895&amp;nbsp;– 24&amp;nbsp;February 1951) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Commencing his service in the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) as a mechanic during World War&amp;nbsp;I, he rose to become the RAAF's chief [[logistics]] officer for more than twenty years. Mackinolty was born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and joined the AFC in 1914.  He first saw active duty the following year in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] with [[No. 30 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Squadron]] [[Royal Flying Corps]] (formerly the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]]). In 1916 he was [[mentioned in despatches]] and posted to [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron AFC]]. By the end of the war he had been commissioned a [[second lieutenant]].

Joining the newly formed RAAF in August 1921, Mackinolty established himself as the service's senior logistician between the wars, first as Director of Transport and Equipment from 1929 to 1935, and thereafter as Director of Equipment. He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1937. Soon after the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, he became Director of Supply and was promoted to [[group captain]]. In June 1942 he was raised to acting [[air commodore]] and appointed the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE). Promoted to air vice marshal in 1948, Mackinolty continued to serve as AMSE until his sudden death from cancer in February 1951, aged fifty-five.

==Early life and World War I==
Born on 24 March 1895 at [[Leongatha, Victoria|Leongatha]], Victoria, Mackinolty was the son of labourer James Mickleburg Mackinolty and his wife Mary. He went to public schools, obtaining his merit certificate before undertaking formal engineering and business courses in [[Melbourne]]. Commencing his working life as a coach and motor-body builder, he enlisted in the [[Australian Military Forces]] on 17&amp;nbsp;August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150297b.htm?hilite=Mackinolty|last=Stephens|first=Alan|title= Mackinolty, George John William (1895–1951)|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography|Australian Dictionary of Biography Online]]|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 104–107&lt;/ref&gt; His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an air mechanic with the Aviation Instructional Staff at [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] (CFS), [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarkxvi&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon promoted from [[Private soldier|private]] to [[corporal]] and later, having gained a reputation for his skill with timber, raised to [[sergeant]] and given command of the school's woodworking team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarkxvi/&gt;

On 1&amp;nbsp;August 1915, Mackinolty transferred to the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]], to lead a team of thirteen other mechanics as reinforcements for an [[Australian Flying Corps]] contingent serving in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He departed Melbourne nine days later aboard RMS ''Persia'', and arrived at [[Basra]] on 1&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=183898|title= George John William Mackinolty|work= The AIF Project|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069786--1-.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 25]&lt;/ref&gt; Mackinolty's team immediately joined [[No. 30 Squadron RAF|No. 30 Squadron]] [[Royal Flying Corps]] (originally the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight|Mesopotamian Half Flight AFC]]), which moved into the city of [[Kut]] after its capture by British Empire troops in the [[Battle of Es Sinn]].  The unit took part in the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] in November, and organised supply drops to the British and Indian garrison in [[Siege of Kut|Kut during the siege]] that lasted from December 1915 until the following April.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 6–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackinolty was promoted in the field to [[flight sergeant]] in June 1916, and [[mentioned in despatches]] on 19&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29789|supp=yes|startpage=10047|endpage=10049|date=19 October 1916|accessdate=on 26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Australian members of No.&amp;nbsp;30 Squadron were dispersed, he was posted to [[Al Qantarah El Sharqiyya|Kantara]], Egypt, where he joined the newly established [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron AFC]] (also numbered No.&amp;nbsp;68 Squadron RFC by the British). Commanded by Major [[Oswald Watt]], the unit relocated to England in January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 6–8,16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10836.asp |title= 2 Squadron AFC|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his service with No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron, Mackinolty was assigned to [[No. 5 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 (Training) Squadron AFC]], which formed at [[Shawbury]], Shropshire, in June 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/137/Air-Vice-Marshals-L-Z.aspx |title=Air Vice-Marshals (L-Z)|publisher= [[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10845.asp |title=5 (Training) Squadron AFC|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praised for his organisational and leadership abilities, he was commissioned as an equipment officer in March 1918, with the rank of [[second lieutenant]]. The following month he was given command of an aircraft repair unit in [[Minchinhampton]], Gloucestershire,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; home of two squadrons of the AFC's [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|1st Training Wing]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Command and Leadership in War and Peace'', pp. 36–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
Mackinolty remained in England following the end of hostilities, serving as &quot;officer in charge of Australian packing&quot; at [[Hendon Aerodrome|RAF Hendon]], near London, from December 1919 to September 1920. In this role he was responsible for crating and shipping to Point Cook the 128 aircraft and associated spares, weaponry, vehicles, hangars and other equipment that made up Britain's post-war [[Imperial Gift]] of [[Royal Air Force]] surplus to Australia, which eventually filled 19,000 cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Mackinolty also completed formal training in [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]] before returning to Melbourne in October 1920. Discharged from the AIF in January 1921, he worked in the automotive industry and took a correspondence course on internal combustion engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

On 8&amp;nbsp;August 1921, Mackinolty was commissioned as a [[flying officer]] in the newly formed [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). A member of the Stores and Accounting Branch, he commenced service with [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]] at Point Cook in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in 1924. On 20&amp;nbsp;November that year, he married Eileen Moore at Christ Church, [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]]; the couple had a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; In 1925, Mackinolty was posted as Equipment Officer to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] at the recently established [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Promoted [[flight lieutenant]], he was appointed Director of Transport and Equipment at RAAF Headquarters in 1929, effectively making him the Air Force's senior supply officer, a role he would occupy for the next twenty-two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt; His continuous tenure in essentially the one post was comparable to the RAAF's other chief logistician, Squadron Leader (later Air Vice Marshal) [[Ellis Wackett]], who served as its senior engineer for twenty-four years, from 1935 to 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 97–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackinolty's position was redesignated Director of Equipment in April 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth&quot;&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time, he collaborated with Squadron Leader [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], then Director of Training, on an investigation into the state of aircraft production in Australia to highlight shortfalls in local defence in the face of possible future conflict with Japan.  Though the report was reviewed enthusiastically by the [[Air Member for Personnel (Australia)|Air Member for Personnel]], Wing Commander [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]], it apparently went no further in the chain of command and thus was effectively ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Raised to [[squadron leader]], Mackinolty was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[Coronation of the British Monarch|Coronation Honours]] on 11&amp;nbsp;May 1937, in recognition of his achievements in stores and accounting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=11 May 1937|accessdate=on 6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February the following year he was promoted to  [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth&quot;/&gt; The punctilious [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], sometimes complained that Mackinolty did not pay enough attention to his personal appearance, but never failed to acknowledge his &quot;professional excellence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and after==
In April 1940 Mackinolty became Director of Supply, reporting to the Director-General of Supply and Production on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body. Responsible for all stores and equipment, Mackinolty also represented his service at the Federal Contract Board, Department of Supply, and Oil Board.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp. 3, 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[group captain]] in June that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth&quot;/&gt; With the formation in 1942 of [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Allied Air Forces Headquarters]], which assumed the operational functions of the Chief of the Air Staff, the Air Board was reorganised. The offices of Air Member for Organisation and Equipment, once held by [[Air Marshal]] Richard Williams, and Director-General of Supply and Production, a civilian position, were dissolved and replaced by those of the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) and Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance (AMEM) to focus on the two key logistical functions of supply and engineering, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070516--1-.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 479]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', pp. 130–132&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to acting [[air commodore]], Mackinolty became the inaugural AMSE in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;  Air Commodore Ellis Wackett became AMEM at the same time. Norman Ashworth, in ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', observed that splitting the logistical functions of the Air Board in this manner appeared to be a &quot;uniquely Australian&quot; experiment, and it was not inconceivable that the organisation had been &quot;tailored&quot; to suit these &quot;two very capable officers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force!'', pp. 132, 137&lt;/ref&gt; Serving as AMSE for the remainder of the war, Mackinolty was credited with successfully managing the supply requirements of personnel and aircraft for an organisation that by 1945 had grown by a factor of fifty from its pre-war size, to become the world's fourth largest air force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of hostilities, Mackinolty was personally responsible for [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II#Disposal of military equipment|disposing of surplus equipment]] up to an original value of £500, and jointly responsible (with the Business and Finance Members of the Air Board) for disposing of equipment valued between £500 and £10,000.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; His duties as AMSE extended to setting the peacetime meal rations for RAAF personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1946, he joined the Australian Battlefields Memorial Committee, convened to advise the Federal government regarding commemoration of the armed forces for their wartime achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50344076 |title=War memorials |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=31 May 1946 |accessdate=22 November 2011 |page=6 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Mackinolty visited [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF) headquarters in Japan, and subsequently arranged for the RAAF to assume responsibility for the supply of spare parts to its air component, British Commonwealth Air Group (BCAIR).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 210, 216&lt;/ref&gt;  He was raised to acting [[air vice-marshal]] in January 1947 (substantive in October 1948).&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; By this time, Mackinolty and the Chief of the Air Staff, [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]] veteran Air Vice-Marshal George Jones, were the only remaining RAAF officers who had served in both world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''10 Years at the Top'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Other senior commanders and veterans of the Australian Flying Corps had been summarily retired in 1946, a &quot;purge&quot; that was ostensibly designed to make way for the advancement of younger and equally proficient officers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1947, the RAAF prepared for the introduction of an apprentice engineering scheme. Against a harsh post-war economic climate, Mackinolty personally intervened to improve the planned accommodation for trainees, arguing that the youths could not be expected to live in the austere conditions to which other members of the Air Force were used. He further noted in his submission to the Minister for Air, [[Arthur Drakeford]], that &quot;the parents of apprentices will, from time to time, be permitted to visit their sons and it would be in the interest of both the Apprentice Scheme and the Service generally if all reasonable efforts were made to create a favourable impression in the minds of the parents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''From the Ground Up'', pp. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the first intake of engineer apprentices in January 1948, Mackinolty formally proposed that a similar scheme be set up for apprenticeships in the supply and clerical trades. Although initially rejected by the Minister, after some refinements the plan came to fruition three years later as the Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''From the Ground Up'', pp. 90–95&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1951, Mackinolty was struck down suddenly with cancer and admitted to hospital at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria. He died there on 24&amp;nbsp;February, survived by his wife and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens &amp; Isaacs&quot;/&gt;  At the time of his death, he had served for a decade as honorary treasurer of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmens' Imperial League of Australia]], and was the last member of the original staff of the AFC in 1914 still serving.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27023127 |title=Air Force chief dies in Victoria |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart |date=26 February 1951 |accessdate=2 June 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as AMSE by Air Vice-Marshal [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; Described by Air Force historian Alan Stephens as &quot;the most significant logistics officer in the history of the RAAF&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Mackinolty was accorded an Air Force funeral with full honours at Bathurst Memorial Chapel, [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], and cremated at [[Springvale Botanical Cemetery|Springvale Crematorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23054207 |title=Pioneer of the air dies |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=26 February 1951 |accessdate=22 November 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
