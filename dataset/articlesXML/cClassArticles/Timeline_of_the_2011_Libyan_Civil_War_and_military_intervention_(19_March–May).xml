The [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] began on 15 February 2011 as a civil protest and later evolved into a widespread uprising. However, by 19 March, Libyan forces under Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] were on the brink of a decisive victory over rebels in [[Cyrenaica|Libya's east]]. That day, leading [[NATO]] members acted on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] which authorized member states &quot;to take all necessary measures... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]], including [[Benghazi]], while excluding an occupation force&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN News Centre&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37808 |title=Security Council Authorizes 'All Necessary Measures' To Protect Civilians in Libya|date=17 March 2011|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the implementation of a [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libyan no-fly zone]], the [[Battle of Ajdabiya]] and the [[Second Battle of Benghazi]], the rebels recovered all territory lost in the Gaddafi loyalist offensive. However, due to the bulk of their forces being armed civilians lacking both leadership and communication, they quickly fell into disarray and were forced into retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author = Calder, Ryan | date=4 April 2011|work=The Berkeley Blog (blog of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]) | url= http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2011/04/04/accordion-war-why-does-the-front-in-libya-keep-moving-back-and-forth/| title = Accordion War: Why Does the Front in Libya Keep Moving Back and Forth?|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With NATO attacks increasing in both severity and frequency, numerous defections amongst Gaddafi's military and political elite, and steadily increasing support from the international community, the opposition was able to make limited gains towards the end of May. After being [[Battle of Misrata|besieged since February]], opposition forces pushed loyalist forces out of Misrata and into its outskirts, beginning a [[Battle of the Misrata frontline|battle]] for control of [[Misrata District|the area]].
