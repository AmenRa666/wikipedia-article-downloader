The '''''Pennsylvania'' class''' consisted of two [[super-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built for the [[United States Navy]] just before the [[World War I|First World War]]. The ships were named {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} and {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}}, after the American states of the same names. They constituted the United States' second battleship design to adhere to the &quot;[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]&quot; armor scheme, and were the newest American [[capital ship]]s when the United States entered the [[World War I|First World War]].

The {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|1}}s represented a marked increase in the United States' dreadnought technology, and the ''Pennsylvania'' class was intended to continue this with slight increases in the ships' capabilities, including two extra [[14&quot;/45 caliber gun|{{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}}/45 caliber guns]] and improved underwater protection. The class was the second [[standard type battleship|standard type]] battleship class to join the United States Navy, along with the preceding ''Nevada''  and the succeeding {{sclass-|New Mexico|battleship|5}}, {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|5}} classes.

In service, the ''Pennsylvania'' class saw limited use in the First World War, as a shortage of [[fuel oil|oil fuel]] in the United Kingdom meant that only the coal-burning ships of [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division Nine]] were sent. Both were sent across the Atlantic to France after the war for the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], and were then transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] before being significantly modernized from 1929 to 1931. For the remainder of the inter-war period, the ships were used in exercises and [[fleet problem]]s. Both ''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' were present during the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. ''Arizona'' was sunk in a [[USS Arizona (BB-39)#Attack on Pearl Harbor|massive magazine explosion]] and was turned into [[USS Arizona Memorial|a memorial]] after the war, while ''Pennsylvania'', in [[dry dock]] at the time, received only minor damage. After a refit from October 1942 to February 1943, ''Pennsylvania'' went on to serve as a [[shore bombardment]] ship for most of the remainder of the war, an exception being the October 1944 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]], the last battle ever between battleships. ''Pennsylvania'' was severely damaged by a torpedo on 12 August 1945, the day before the cessation of hostilities. With minimal repairs, she was used in [[Operation Crossroads|Operation ''Crossroads'']], part of the [[Bikini atomic experiments]], before being expended as a [[target ship]] in 1948.

== Background ==
{{main article|Nevada-class battleship|l1=''Nevada''-class battleship|Standard-type battleship}}
[[File:Oklahoma (BB37). Starboard bow, underway, 01-15-1916.jpg|left|thumb|The ''Nevada'' class, represented here by {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}} in 1916, were the first American battleship class with triple gun turrets, the &quot;[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]&quot; armor concept, oil fuel, and [[steam turbine]]s with geared cruising turbines (albeit the latter only in {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}); all of these innovations were continued in the ''Pennsylvania'' class.&lt;ref group=&quot;upper-roman&quot;&gt;Photograph [http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=512922 courtesy] of the National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The preceding ''Nevada''-class battleships represented a leap forward from previous American battleship technology and from most contemporary foreign designs. These ships were the first in the world to employ the &quot;[[all or nothing (armor)|all or nothing]]&quot; armor scheme that characterized every succeeding American battleship. Devised with the knowledge that engagement ranges between battle fleets was growing greater as [[main battery]] sizes increased, the system moved away from previous designs that used heavy, medium, and light armor, in favor of using only heavy armor to protect vital areas on the ship. The new system envisioned that, at long ranges, ships would be attacked with only [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] (AP) projectiles, stoppable only by heavy armor. Medium or light armor would only serve to detonate the shells. By removing gun turrets and reducing the overall protected length of the ship, the navy's designers were able to devote the weight savings to the [[belt armor|belt]], as well as extra [[deck (ship)|deck armor]] to protect against plunging shells.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Design and Development'', 65–66; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

In issuing desired specifications for the design that would become the ''Nevada'' class, the navy's [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]] asked for triple gun turrets, i.e. three guns mounted per turret. They were very unsatisfied with the awkward placement required on classes preceding the ''Nevada''s, which had five and six two-gun turrets—yet moving back to the four two-gun turrets of the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|4}} would be a significant loss in firepower. Although a triple turret was first proposed in American professional magazines in 1901 and briefly considered for the ''South Carolina''s, it was not even in the experimental stage—the first turret was authorized in 1911 and would not be ready until months after contracts for the new ships would be signed with the shipbuilders. The decision to go ahead with the turret was a calculated gamble, but proved to be a qualified success: the only issue came with shell interference when the center and outside guns were fired simultaneously, which was easily solved by delaying the firing of the center barrel by a small fraction of a second. The major benefit, though, came from the weight savings from the reduction of an armored [[barbette]] and turret. These gains were used in heavier armor, making the &quot;all or nothing&quot; concept a reality.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Design and Development'', 134–35; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 102, 107, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nevada''s were also the first American battleships to use exclusively [[fuel oil|oil fuel]], which had greater thermal efficiency than firing with coal or coal sprayed with oil. The cumulative effect of the change was measured by the navy as a fifty-five&amp;nbsp;percent increase in steam production per pound of fuel (in a design for an oil-fired version of the {{sclass-|New York|battleship|4}}). This would give oil-fired vessels additional range, an important consideration for ships based in the Pacific Ocean, but the United States Navy's [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] (C&amp;R) pointed out what it saw as the unfortunate side effects, including a lower center of gravity, higher [[metacentric height]], and the loss of coal bunkers, which were employed as part of the armor protection. However, just a few years later oil tanks below the waterline were considered indispensable parts of the underwater armor scheme employed in American dreadnoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Design and Development'', 93–95; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 102, 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:USS Arizona aft cradle before launch NARA 19-LC-19A-12.jpg|thumb|right|''Arizona''{{'}}s starboard propeller shaft.&lt;ref group=&quot;upper-roman&quot;&gt;Photograph [http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=512913 courtesy] of the National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The General Board's call for a new 1913 [[fiscal year]] battleship design was sent in June 1911 with the recent ''Nevada'' innovations in mind. They desired a ship with a main battery of twelve 14-inch guns in triple turrets, a secondary battery of twenty-two {{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}} guns, a speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}, and armor equivalent to that of the ''Nevada''s. C&amp;R's first sketch was unsatisfactory; their lengthy design of {{convert|625|ft|m}} and {{convert|30000|LT|t|0}} actually had less armor than the ''Nevada''s, with a {{convert|12.5|in|mm|adj=on}} belt.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design process was marked by various efforts to meet the General Board's specifications with only a moderate increase in tonnage over the ''Nevada'' class. Between January and March 1912, thirteen sketches were prepared for consideration by C&amp;R with reciprocating or turbine engines that traded either speed or [[metacentric height]] for armor. Some later designs gave up a half knot of speed to free up about {{convert|500|LT|t|0}}, enough to thicken the belt from {{convert|13.5|to|15|in|mm|0}} and the [[barbette]]s to 14 inches. The choice between double or triple turrets was also still an issue, as the ''Nevada'' class had not been completed yet. The [[Bureau of Ordnance]] was in favor of waiting for test results, rather than risking reverting to two-gun 14-inch turrets or moving up to two-gun 16-inch turrets.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 113–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1912, C&amp;R proposed their seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth designs to the General Board for approval. The eighth and ninth designs were the ones to give up a half knot of speed, while the tenth was a design with four triple turrets and {{convert|1200|LT|t}} lighter than the ''Nevada'' class ships. In April, the General Board chose the seventh design, which satisfied all of their requirements, albeit on the largest displacement, {{convert|31300|LT|t}}. The length was fixed at {{convert|630|ft|m}}, the beam at {{convert|93|ft|m}}, and the draft at {{convert|28.5|ft|m}}. [[Steam turbine]]s gave the design {{convert|30500|shp}} and 21 knots, while the main armor belt was 13.5&amp;nbsp;inches tapering to {{convert|8|in|mm|0}} at the ends. This design was further refined and emerged in a completed state in September. The delay was partially due to tests on the proposed armor, which were completed in June 1912 and resulted in significant alterations to the ''Pennsylvania'' class' underwater protection.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pennsylvania''-class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors, the ''Nevada'' class. They had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|600|ft|1}}, an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|608|ft|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|97|ft|1}} (at the [[waterline]]), and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|29|ft|3|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. This was {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} longer than the older ships. Its designed [[standard displacement|standard]] and full load displacements were {{convert|31400|LT|t}} and {{convert|32440|LT|t}}, respectively, but they actually displaced {{convert|29158|LT|t}} standard and {{convert|31917|LT|t}} at full load, over {{convert|4000|LT|MT|-1}} more than the older ships. The class had a metacentric height of {{convert|7.82|ft|1}} at full load.&lt;ref name=&quot;f0&quot;&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships had four [[direct drive]] [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] steam turbine sets with geared cruising turbines, each of which drove a propeller {{convert|12|ft|1.5|in|1}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 360.&lt;/ref&gt; They were powered by twelve [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|31500|shp|lk=in}}, but only achieved {{convert|29366|shp|abbr=on}} during ''Pennsylvania''{{'}}s sea trials, when it slightly exceeded its designed speed of {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;f0&quot; /&gt; However, ''Pennsylvania'' reached {{convert|21.75|kn}} during full-power trials in 1916, and ''Arizona'' reached {{convert|21.5|kn}} in September 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 305; &quot;Trials of Our Latest Dreadnought,&quot; ''Scientific American'', 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The class was designed to normally carry {{convert|1548|LT|t|0}} of fuel oil, but had a maximum capacity of {{convert|2305|LT|t|0}}. At full capacity, they could steam at a speed of {{convert|12|knots}} for an estimated {{convert|6070|nmi|-1|lk=in}}, though this could be extended to {{convert|7585|nmi|-1}} with a [[:wikt:foul#Adjective|clean bottom]]. They had four {{convert|300|kW|0|adj=on}} [[turbo generator]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;f0&quot; /&gt;

The ''Pennsylvania'' class carried twelve 14-inch/45 [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns in triple [[gun turret]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;f0&quot; /&gt; The guns could not elevate independently and were limited to a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a maximum range of {{convert|21000|yd}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, &quot;The U.S. Navy's Study of the Loss of the Battleship Arizona,&quot; 66, 123, 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The ships carried 100 shells for each gun. Defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was provided by twenty-two [[5&quot;/51 caliber gun|5-inch/51 caliber guns]] mounted in individual [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull; these proved vulnerable to sea spray and could not be worked in heavy seas.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 116, 440.&lt;/ref&gt; At an elevation of 15°, they had a maximum range of {{convert|14050|yd}}.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''Naval Weapons of World War II'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Each gun was provided with 230 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name=&quot;f0&quot; /&gt; The ships mounted four [[3&quot;/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}/50 caliber]] [[anti-aircraft guns|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]], although only two were fitted when completed. The other pair were added shortly afterward on top of Turret III.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The class also mounted two submerged {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s and carried 24 [[Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo]]es for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;f0&quot; /&gt;

The ''Pennsylvania''-class design continued the all-or-nothing principle of armoring only the most important areas of the battleships, which began in the preceding ''Nevada'' class. The waterline armor belt of [[Krupp armor]] measured 13.5 inches thick and only covered the class' machinery spaces and [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. It had a total height of {{convert|17|ft|6|in|1}}, of which {{convert|8|ft|9.75|in|1}} was below the waterline; beginning {{convert|2|ft|4|in|1}} below the waterline, the belt tapered to its minimum thickness of 8 inches.&lt;ref name=&quot;f0&quot; /&gt; The transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] at each end of the ships ranged from 13 to 8&amp;nbsp;inches in thickness. The faces of the gun turrets were {{convert|18|in|0}} thick while the sides were {{convert|9|-|10|in}} thick and the turret roofs were protected by 5 inches of armor. The armor of the barbettes was {{convert|18|to|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick. The [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|16|in|0}} of armor and had a roof eight inches thick.&lt;ref name=&quot;s9&quot; /&gt;

The main armor deck was three plates thick with a total thickness of 3 inches; over the steering gear the armor increased to {{convert|6.25|in|0}} in two plates. Beneath it was the splinter deck that ranged from {{convert|1.5|to|2|in|mm|0}} in thickness.&lt;ref name=&quot;f5&quot;&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 115, 118, 440.&lt;/ref&gt; The boiler uptakes were protected by a conical [[mantlet]] that ranged from {{convert|9|to|15|in}} in thickness.&lt;ref name=&quot;s9&quot;&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 359.&lt;/ref&gt; A 3-inch torpedo bulkhead was placed {{convert|9|ft|6|in|1}} inboard from the side, and the class was provided with a complete [[double bottom]]. Testing in mid-1914 revealed that this system could withstand {{convert|300|lb}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]].&lt;ref name=&quot;f5&quot; /&gt;

The most visible change from the ships' original configuration came in the secondary armament, which was moved from casemates into their own twin mounts.&lt;ref group=&quot;upper-roman&quot;&gt;Photograph [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-p/bb38.htm courtesy] of the [[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Authorization and construction ==

[[File:Arizona (BB39). Starboard bow, underway with aircraft overhead retouched.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|''Arizona'' underway on 4 June 1927, shortly before its modernization.&lt;ref group=&quot;upper-roman&quot;&gt;Photograph [http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=512973 courtesy] of the National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The authorization for the two ''Pennsylvania'' class ships faced political opposition for being too weak and expensive. Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] believed that a much more capable warship was needed because of the shocking increase in battleship size over the previous few years—between 1907 (the {{sclass-|Delaware|battleship|4}}) and 1912, the displacement of American battleships increased by about  fifty percent, from around {{convert|20000|LT|t}} to 30,000 long tons.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Tillman proposed a &quot;maximum battleship&quot; in a Senate [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] in July 1912, which was adopted unanimously:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Resolved'': That the Committee on Naval Affairs [is] instructed to investigate and report to the Senate&amp;nbsp;... the object being to find out from official sources the maximum size and maximum draft, the maximum armament, and the maximum armor to make the best battleship or cruiser the world has ever seen or ever will see; to have this country own the greatest marine engine of war ever constructed or ever to be constructed under known conditions; and to report whether one such overpowering vessel would not in its judgement be better for this country to build than to continue by increasing taxation to spend the millions and millions of dollars now in prospect in the race for naval supremacy.&amp;nbsp;... Let us leave some money in the Treasury for other more necessary and useful expenditures, such as good roads, controlling the floods in the Mississippi, draining swamp land in the South, and irrigating the arid land in the West.

Tillman's proposal, however, was treated in his own words as a &quot;joke&quot;; the ''[[World Affairs|Advocate of Peace]]'' stated that &quot;it is nearly impossible to read this&amp;nbsp;... without having an inextinguishable bout of laughter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tillman and Moffet, ''Construction of Battleships'', 3; &quot;The Tillman Maximum Battleship,&quot; ''Advocate of Peace'', 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, C&amp;R completed multiple studies of a maximum battleship constrained only by technological limitations. The first design submitted by C&amp;R was a severely enlarged ''Nevada'', or a {{convert|38000|LT|t}} ship with twelve 14-inch guns, {{convert|17|to|9|in|mm}} belt armor, and a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn}} for a price of $19.5&amp;nbsp;million. A later sketch dropped the speed to {{convert|20|kn}} to see the effect on displacement and cost, which it dropped to {{convert|35000|LT|t}} and $17&amp;nbsp;million, respectively, and the consequent shortening of the ship would allow it to enter the [[dry dock]]s in New York and [[Norfolk Naval Yard|Norfolk]]. Tillman was concerned with this speed, however, and another study increased the speed to {{convert|25|kn}}, trading it for four {{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}} guns, or one-third of the main battery, and much of the armor.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|For further information on these studies, see A.D. Zimm, &quot;Build the Limit: The American 'Maximum Battleship' Studies of 1916–17,&quot; ''Warship International'' 12, no. 1 (1975), 31–59.}}

Political opposition in Congress also made it difficult to build the ''Pennsylvania'' class. The United States' [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the [[United States Senate|Senate]] would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become ''Pennsylvania'' was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; [[open tender|bids were opened]] on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, [[Newport News Shipbuilding|Newport News]], on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 116; &quot;Battleship ''Pennsylvania'',&quot; ''Naval Engineers'', 519.&lt;/ref&gt; The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Battleship 'Pennsylvania' and Class,&quot; ''Scientific American'', 254; &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06E5DD173DE633A25756C0A9649D946296D6CF Saves $750,000 on New Battleship],&quot; ''New York Times'', 5 December 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arizona'' was the one approved battleship for the fiscal year 1914. [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[George von Lengerke Meyer]] had requested three battleships for that fiscal year, citing the former policy of building two per year, plus an additional ship to make up for authorizing only ''Pennsylvania'' in the previous year, but congressional compromises once again approved only one new battleship. ''Arizona'' was authorized on 4 March 1913, but to avoid a lengthy delay between the two, the ship was ordered much more quickly, on 24 June, by giving the contract to a navy-owned shipyard.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pennsylvania'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 27 October 1913, with goals of fourteen months until [[ship naming and launching|launch]], and thiry-two until completion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-bUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JkkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3578,7066404 Keel of Pennsylvania Laid at Newport News],&quot; ''[[Pittsburgh Press|Pittsburg Press]]'', 28 October 1913, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The as-yet unnamed ''Arizona'' was laid down on the morning of 16 March 1914 with [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in attendance,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07EEDB133EE733A25754C1A9659C946596D6CF Lay Keel of Navy's New Dreadnought],&quot; ''New York Times'', 17 March 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; and the builders intended to set a world-record ten months between keel-laying and launch,&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; These ambitious goals—''Pennsylvania''{{'}}s anticipated completion date was a full two months earlier than the American record—were set by Navy Secretary [[Josephus Daniels]], who wanted the United States to compete with British and German building achievements.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=otk_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4966,2268699 Navy to Build New Ship],&quot; ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'', 13 June 1913, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constructors were not able not meet these goals, though. ''Pennsylvania'' was launched on 16 March 1915—seventeen months from keel-laying to launch, and just over two-thirds complete—while ''Arizona'' was launched on 19 June 1915, about fifteen months after keel laying.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Battleship ''Pennsylvania'',&quot; ''Naval Engineers'', 519; &quot;Recent Launches,&quot; ''International Marine Engineering'', 180; &quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0813FE3E5A15738DDDAE0994DB405B858DF1D3 Prayer Launches Greatest Warship],&quot; ''New York Times'', 17 March 1915, 7; &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E0DE1631E733A05750C1A9609C946496D6CF 50,000 to witness Arizona launching],&quot; ''New York Times'', 13 June 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arizona'' weighed {{convert|12800|LT|t}} at launch.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, &quot;Launching of the Battleship Arizona,&quot; 334.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Movie camera]]s were used to film the launch, in order to provide data for future launches.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA673 Launching a Giant Battleship a Long-planned and Risky Job],&quot; 673–74.&lt;/ref&gt; After their launch, both ships went through the necessary [[fitting-out]] period and [[sea trial]]s.

''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' were commissioned during the [[World War I|First World War]], but prior to the [[American entry into World War I|United States' entry]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. During their first year, the ships were cleaned and readied for full active duty.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pennsylvania'' became the [[flagship]] of the US Atlantic Fleet on 12 October 1916.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Pennsylvania''&quot;, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arizona'' first fired its main guns on 23 December, but issues with the propulsion system, specifically a stripped turbine, kept the ship almost exclusively in the [[New York Navy Yard]] from December 1916 to March 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ships were based in the United States for the duration of the war, owing to a shortage of fuel oil in the United Kingdom, and only the coal-burning battleships of [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division Nine]] were sent.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Battleship Operations'', 28, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Armistice with Germany|armistice]], both ''Pennsylvania''-class battleships were sent to the other side of the Atlantic. ''Arizona'' was sent first, leaving on 18 November and arriving in Portsmouth on the 30th. ''Pennsylvania'' escorted the American President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s transport, {{ship|SS|George Washington||2}}, across the Atlantic for the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 37–38; Jones, ''Battleship Operations'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 and 1922, during the [[inter-war period]], both ships took part in a mission to Peru and were transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Pennsylvania''&quot; and &quot;''Arizona''&quot;, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' were given extensive modernizations from 1929 through 1931; the expenditure came in the fiscal year 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 191, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the rebuilding, ''Pennsylvania'', which had been designed as a fleet flagship, had its conning tower expanded. Aside from that, ''Pennsylvania'' and ''Arizona'' received similar treatment: the elevation of the main batteries was increased to {{formatnum:30}}°, new fire control systems on [[tripod mast]]s were added, the secondary armament and directors were replaced and overhauled, eight [[5&quot;/25 caliber gun|5-inch/25 caliber]] anti-aircraft guns (four per side) were mounted on the weather deck which was above the secondary anti-ship 5-inch gun battery, and their bridges were enlarged to hold elevated antiaircraft directors. Armor additions were comparatively minimal beyond [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s, which were standard additions on all major warships in this period: {{convert|1.75|to|2|in|mm}} of armor were added to the second [[deck (ship)|armored deck]], and a [[torpedo bulkhead]] was added to the engine room. The propulsion system of the two ''Pennsylvania''s received perhaps the most attention. The boiler system was entirely replaced with six small-tube boilers and new turbines, the latter partially from the canceled {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|0}} battleship {{USS|Washington|BB-47|2}}. The new machinery allowed the ships to come close to their old design speed of {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}, even with the added bulk of bulges: ''Pennsylvania'' made 20.89&amp;nbsp;knots and ''Arizona'' 20.7&amp;nbsp;knots on full-power trials.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 197–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|left|''Arizona'' burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.]]

After their modernization, both ships participated in the normal activities of the fleet, including [[fleet problem]] exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet in their new base in [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]], after the beginning of the Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] sank ''Arizona'' in a tremendous explosion and slightly damaged ''Pennsylvania'', which was in dry dock at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, ''Battleship Arizona'', 274–76; Whitley, ''Battleships'', 262; &quot;''Pennsylvania''&quot; and &quot;''Arizona''&quot;, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pennsylvania'' came back into service more quickly than many of the other battleships present during the attack; it left on 20 December and was under repair in San Francisco until 30 March 1942. For the next several months, ''Pennsylvania'' was stationed on the United States' [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], before being reassigned to Pearl Harbor as the fleet flagship for a short time (August to October). After another refit in San Francisco, which lasted until February 1943, the ship was sent to assist American forces engaged in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]]. During this time, ''Pennsylvania'' was nearly hit by a torpedo from {{Jsub|I-31}}, which was later sunk.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next year, ''Pennsylvania'' was utilized in shore bombardment in the Battles of [[Battle of Makin|Makin]], [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]], [[Battle of Eniwetok|Eniwetok]], and [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], along with the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Palau Islands Campaign]]. The ship also participated in the [[Battle of Leyte|landings on Leyte]] and the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. During this time, ''Pennsylvania'' was present at the last battle ever between battleships, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]]. The ship did not fire any salvos because the Japanese vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond ''Pennsylvania''{{'}}s outdated fire control but within range of other, radar-directed battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 262–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US warships entering Lingayen Gulf 1945.jpg|thumb|right|The now-famous photograph of ''Pennsylvania'' leading {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|2}} and three cruisers into [[Lingayen Gulf]] before the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]] (Philippines), in January 1945.&lt;ref group=&quot;upper-roman&quot;&gt;Photograph [http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=52062 courtesy] of the National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1945, ''Pennsylvania'' was sent for another refit in San Francisco, and the guns in its main battery, worn out from the frequent shore bombardments, were replaced by those from ''Nevada'' and {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}}. After its completion in July, the ship bombarded [[Wake Island]] on 1 August en route to Okinawa, where it was struck by an air-dropped torpedo. It hit near the starboard propeller shaft, killing twenty men and knocking out three of the ship's four shafts. The area near the shafts, though, was also a vital area, and the opened seals around the shafts led to large amounts of flooding that nearly sank the battleship. ''Pennsylvania'' was towed to shallower waters, where local repairs were made. The ship's last action was to fire at a ''[[kamikaze]]'' on 13 August; it was then towed to Guam beginning on the 18th, where temporary repairs were effected, before being sent to [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility|Navy Yard Puget Sound]] for more permanent repairs. ''Pennsylvania'' arrived on 24 October only after a torturous journey, which saw the ship lose all but one of its remaining propeller shafts while taking on water through the temporary patch put over the torpedo hole in Guam.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 263; Cates, ''War History'', 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on 2 September, the Puget Sound repairs were limited to those necessary to ensure ''Pennsylvania''{{'}}s delivery to Bikini Atoll for [[Bikini atomic experiments|atomic experiments]] in July 1946. The old battleship survived the tests, but was decommissioned on 29 August and used for [[radiation|radiological]] studies before being sunk as a [[target ship]] on 10 February 1948. ''Pennsylvania'' was struck from the [[Navy Vessel Register]] nine days later.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 263; Cates, ''War History'', 38; &quot;{{NVR url|id=BB38|title=Pennsylvania (BB 38)}},&quot; ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
