Son [[Gino Segrè]] also?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/129.2.40.144|129.2.40.144]] ([[User talk:129.2.40.144|talk]]) 20:17, 19 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
== Segrè Chart ==
I think this article should mention the fact that, at least in the United Kingdom, the method of displaying the known isotopes on the N-Z plane is named after Segrè. Also, if anyone has any information regarding why this was named after him that would also be useful.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/148.79.162.144|148.79.162.144]] ([[User talk:148.79.162.144|talk]]) 14:25, 8 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== possible error ==

This phrase in the article has to be wrong:

&quot;In June 1944, Segrè was summoned into Oppenheimer's office and informed that while his father was safe, his mother had been rounded up by the Nazis in October 1943. Segrè never saw either of his parents again. His father died in Rome in October 1943&quot;

Note he was told in 1944 his father was safe. Later is says he died in 1943.

:Yes, but maybe the information given by Oppenheimer was wrong. Anyway, we should check the source about that. [[User:Alessandro57|Alex2006]] ([[User talk:Alessandro57|talk]]) 05:47, 5 March 2015 (UTC)
::{{done}} Verified against the source. His father died in Rome in October 1944, not 1943. A typo. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 08:53, 5 March 2015 (UTC)
:::Many thanks, [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]]! [[User:Alessandro57|Alex2006]] ([[User talk:Alessandro57|talk]]) 09:23, 5 March 2015 (UTC)

==article name==
He was always known as Emilio Segrè, that should be the article name. the name in the lede should of course be his full name. Emilio Gino Segrè should be a redirect.[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 19:41, 22 November 2015 (UTC)
:I agree. The moving happened maybe because the Nobel prize was assigned to Emilio Gino, although in Italy he is universally known as Emilio, as all his book were published under this name...[[User:Alessandro57|Alex2006]] ([[User talk:Alessandro57|talk]]) 19:44, 22 November 2015 (UTC)
::Thanks. if anyone has doubt, his autobiography was written by ES, not EGS, [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft700007rb&amp;brand=ucpress] [[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 20:15, 22 November 2015 (UTC)
:::I agree too. I see you already raised a request at [[WP:RM]].  [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 20:24, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

The result of the proposal was '''move per request''' as the [[WP:UCN|common name]].--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 21:32, 29 November 2015 (UTC)
----
[[:Emilio Gino Segrè]] → {{no redirect|Emilio Segrè}} – this is the name he is best known by, not his full name [[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 19:46, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

*'''Support'''. In Italy he is known as Emilio. Moreover, although many Italians get more than a noun at the birth, generally only the first name is used. All his books (he was also a formidable historian of science) bear &quot;Emilio&quot; as author's name. [[User:Alessandro57|Alex2006]] ([[User talk:Alessandro57|talk]]) 14:26, 23 November 2015 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. The issue was that the previous included &quot;G.&quot;.

== Father of the Bomb? ==

I just removed the claim, added by an anonymous ip, that Segrè has been nicknamed &quot;father of the bomb&quot;. This claim is unsupported and, given the work accomplished by Segrè in Los Alamos, totally exaggerated.
