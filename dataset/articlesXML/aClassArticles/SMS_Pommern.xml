'''SMS ''Pommern'''''{{efn|name=SMS}} was one of five {{sclass-|Deutschland|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] between 1904 and 1906. Named after the [[Prussia]]n province of [[Pomerania]], she was built at the [[AG Vulcan]] yard at [[Stettin]], where she was laid down on 22 March 1904 and launched on 2 December 1905. She was commissioned into the navy on 6 August 1907. The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered the service, being inferior in size, armor, firepower, and speed to the revolutionary new battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}.

After commissioning, ''Pommern'' was assigned to the II Battle Squadron of the [[High Seas Fleet]], where she served throughout her peacetime career and the first two years of [[World War I]]. During this period, ''Pommern'' participated in several fruitless sorties into the North Sea in attempts to lure out and destroy a portion of the British [[Grand Fleet]]. The ship was present at the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1916. She and her sisters briefly engaged the British battlecruisers commanded by [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]]; ''Pommern'' was hit once by a {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|1}} shell from the battlecruiser {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|6}}. During the confused night actions in the early hours of 1 June, she was hit by one, or possibly two, torpedoes from the British destroyer {{HMS|Onslaught|1915|6}}, which detonated one of ''Pommern''{{'}}s {{convert|17|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} gun [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. The resulting explosion broke the ship in half and killed the entire crew. ''Pommern'' was the only battleship of either side sunk during the battle.

[[File:Deutschland class line-drawing.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing of the ''Deutschland'' class]]

''Pommern'' was ordered under the contract name &quot;O&quot;.{{sfn|Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=237}} She was laid down on 22 March 1904 at the [[AG Vulcan]] dockyard in [[Stettin]].{{sfn|Staff|p=5}} She was originally scheduled to be launched on 19 November 1905, but the water level in the harbor was too low. As a result, the ship could not be launched until 2 December.{{sfn|Staff|p=12}} The ''Oberpräsident'' of [[Pommern]], [[Helmuth von Maltzahn]], gave the launching speech.{{sfn|Hildebrand Röhr &amp; Steinmetz|p=237}} In July 1907 ''Pommern'' was transferred to [[Kiel]] where she had her main battery of four 28&amp;nbsp;cm (11&amp;nbsp;in) guns installed. She was commissioned for trials on 6 August; during her speed run, she made {{convert|18.7|kn}}, which made her the fastest pre-dreadnought battleship in the world.{{sfn|Staff|p=12}}

The ship was {{convert|127.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and had a beam of {{convert|22.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a draft of {{convert|8.21|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Her full-load displacement was {{convert|14,218|t|LT|0|sp=us}}. She was equipped with [[triple expansion engine]]s that were rated at {{convert|13,015|kW|ihp|lk=in|order=flip}} and a top speed of {{convert|18|kn}}. Steam was provided by twelve Schulz-Thornycroft boilers. In addition to being the fastest ship of her class, ''Pommern'' was the most fuel efficient. At a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn}}, she could steam for {{convert|5,830|nmi|sp=us}}. The ship had a peacetime crew of 35&amp;nbsp;officers and 708&amp;nbsp;enlisted men, though during military operations, the size of the crew expanded.{{sfn|Gröner|p=21}}

''Pommern''{{'}}s primary armament consisted of four [[28 cm SK L/40 gun|{{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/40]] guns in two twin turrets.{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} She was equipped with fourteen {{convert|17|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} guns mounted in casemates and twenty {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} guns in pivot mounts. The ship was also armed with six {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s, all submerged in the hull. One was in the bow, one in the stern, and four on the [[broadside]]. Her [[belt armor|armored belt]] was {{convert|240|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[amidships]] and she had a {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick armored deck. The main battery turrets had {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gröner|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Staff|p=6}}

== Service history ==
[[File:SMS Pommern.png|thumb|left|''Pommern'' before the outbreak of war]]
''Pommern'' was assigned to the [[II Battle Squadron]] of the [[High Seas Fleet]] alongside her sisters. She took part in the annual training cruises and maneuvers with the rest of the High Seas Fleet between 1908 and 1914.{{sfn|Staff|p=12}} This included fleet training in the Baltic in 1908 and a cruise into the Atlantic the following year. In May 1910 ''Pommern'' took part in fleet training in the [[Kattegat]] between Denmark and Norway, followed by a cruise to Norway in the summer. At the end of 1910, the fleet conducted another cruise into the Baltic. The next two years followed a similar pattern, though the summer cruise in 1912 was interrupted by the [[Agadir Crisis]]. As a result, the cruise was only into the Baltic. Later in the year ''Pommern'' took part in maneuvers off the island of [[Helgoland]] in the North Sea.{{sfn|Staff|p=8}}

In July 1914, about two weeks after the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], ''Pommern'' was with the High Seas Fleet during its annual summer cruise to Norway. As a result of rising international tensions, the cruise was cut short and the German fleet was back in Wilhelmshaven by 29 July.{{sfn|Staff|p=11}} At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany.{{sfn|Herwig|p=144}} ''Pommern'' remained with the High Seas Fleet throughout the first two years of the naval war.{{sfn|Staff|p=12}} At the outbreak of war, the ship and her sisters in the II Battle Squadron were deployed to the mouth of the [[Elbe River]] to guard the area from possible British incursions.{{sfn|Staff|p=10}}

[[File:SMS Pommern 1916.jpg|thumb|''Pommern'' before the war]]
''Pommern'' and the rest of the II Battle Squadron then rejoined the High Seas Fleet as part of the battleship support for the battlecruisers in the [[I Scouting Group]] that [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby]] on 15–16 December 1914.{{sfn|Staff|p=14}} During the operation, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within {{convert|10|nmi|abbr=on}} of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival [[destroyer]] screens convinced Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]] that he was confronted with the entire [[Grand Fleet]], and so he broke off the engagement and turned for home.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=31–33}} Two fruitless fleet advances followed on 17–18 and 21–23 April 1915. A third took place on 17–18 May, and a fourth occurred on 23–24 October.{{sfn|Staff|p=14}}

On 24–25 April 1916, ''Pommern'' and her sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers, which were again tasked with conducting a raid of the English coast.{{sfn|Staff|p=10}} While en route to the target, the battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} was damaged by a [[naval mine|mine]]. ''Seydlitz'' was detached to return home, and the rest of the ships continued with the mission. Due to poor visibility, the battlecruisers conducted a brief [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft]]. The operation was quickly called off, which prevented the British fleet from being able to intervene.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=52–54}}

=== Battle of Jutland ===
[[File:Map of the Battle of Jutland, 1916.svg|thumb|350px|Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1916|alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast]]
{{main|Battle of Jutland}}

Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], the new commander of the High Seas Fleet, immediately planned another foray into the North Sea, but the damage to ''Seydlitz'' delayed the operation until the end of May.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=58}} ''Pommern'' remained assigned to the II Battle Squadron, now under the command of Rear Admiral [[Franz Mauve]]. The squadron was positioned at the rear of the German line.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=286}} During the &quot;Run to the North,&quot; Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the British V Battle Squadron at top speed. The slower ''Deutschland''-class ships could not keep up with the faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind.{{sfn|London|p=73}}

Later in the evening of the first day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. ''Pommern'' and the other so-called &quot;five-minute ships&quot; came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=195}}{{efn|name=five-minute ships}} ''Pommern'' could not make out a target in the darkness, though several of her sisters could. Despite this, their shooting was ineffective.{{sfn|London|pp=70–71}} The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships, including one on ''Pommern'' by a {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|1}} shell fired by {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|2}},{{sfn|Campbell|p=254}} forcing her to haul out of line. Admiral Mauve ordered an [[Boxing the compass|8-point]] turn to the south to disengage from the British, and they did not follow.{{sfn|London|pp=70–71}}

At 3:10 on the morning of 1 June, ''Pommern'' was torpedoed by the British destroyer {{HMS|Onslaught|1915|2}}. At least one torpedo, and possibly a second, struck the ship, detonating one of the 17&amp;nbsp;cm ammunition magazines.{{sfn|Staff|pp=12–13}} A tremendous explosion broke the ship in half. The stern capsized and remained afloat for at least 20&amp;nbsp;minutes with her propellers jutting into the air.{{sfn|Campbell|p=305}} {{SMS|Hannover||2}}, the ship directly astern of ''Pommern'', was forced to haul out of line to avoid the wreck. ''Pommern''{{'}}s entire crew of 839 officers and enlisted men were killed when the ship sank.{{sfn|Staff|p=13}} She was the only battleship, pre-dreadnought or dreadnought, in either fleet to be sunk at Jutland;{{sfn|Campbell|p=338}} her loss, coupled with the vulnerabilities of the surviving pre-dreadnoughts, prompted Scheer to leave them behind during the [[Action of 19 August 1916|sortie of 18&amp;ndash;19 August 1916]].{{sfn|Halpern|p=330}}
