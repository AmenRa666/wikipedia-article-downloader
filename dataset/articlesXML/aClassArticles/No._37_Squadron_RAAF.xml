'''No. 37 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Tactical airlift|medium tactical airlift]] squadron. It operates [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules]] aircraft from [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales. The squadron has seen active service flying transport aircraft during World War&amp;nbsp;II, the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]], the [[Operation Slipper|wars in Afghanistan]] and [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]], and the [[military intervention against ISIL]]. It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world, including [[Operation Solace|Somalia]], [[Operation Warden|East Timor]], [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali]], [[Operation Papua New Guinea Assist|Papua New Guinea]], and [[List of military operations involving Australia|the Philippines]].

The squadron was formed at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria, in July 1943, and equipped with [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|Lockheed C-60 Lodestars]] that it operated in Australia, New Guinea and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Towards the end of the war it began flying [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]]. It became part of [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;86 (Transport) Wing]], headquartered at [[RAAF Station Schofields]], New South Wales, in 1946 but was disbanded two years later. In response to Australia's increasing air transport needs during the Vietnam War, the squadron was re-formed at Richmond in February 1966, and equipped with {{nowrap|C-130E}} Hercules. It converted to the C-130J model in 1999, and between 2006 and 2012 also operated C-130Hs formerly of [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron]]. No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron came under the control of a re-formed No.&amp;nbsp;86 Wing from 1987 until 2010, when it was transferred to [[No. 84 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;84 Wing]].

By mid-1944, the squadron had expanded its operations to New Guinea, making courier flights to [[Merauke]] initially, and later [[Wewak]], [[Noemfoor]] and [[Jayapura|Hollandia]].&lt;ref name=Units62/&gt; It transferred to [[Essendon Airport|Essendon]], Victoria, on 1&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref&gt;No. 37 Squadron (1943–48), &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was now one of eight Australian transport squadrons, all of which operated under the control of RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]].

===Re-establishment===
On 27 September 1965, Minister for Air [[Peter Howson (politician)|Peter Howson]] announced that No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron was to be re-raised to operate twelve [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130E Hercules]] transport aircraft that had been purchased by the Federal government; the new aircraft would allow the RAAF to support Australian deployments in South East Asia while continuing to meet its domestic commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105863881 |title=New RAAF squadron for transports|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=28 September 1965 |accessdate=26 June 2016 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Dakota, Hercules, and Caribou in Australian Service'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron was formed at RAAF Base Richmond on 21&amp;nbsp;February 1966, under the command of [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Ron McKimm.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It joined No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron, which had been operating C-130A Hercules since 1958. No.&amp;nbsp;486 Squadron, inactive since 1964, was re-formed at Richmond to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons; major repairs and upgrades to the C-130s were the responsibility of [[No. 2 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Aircraft Depot]] (later No.&amp;nbsp;503 Wing).&lt;ref name=Solo420&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 178, 420–425&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As the C-130E had a longer range and could carry a greater payload than the C-130A, No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron was generally assigned strategic tasks, while No.&amp;nbsp;36 Squadron's responsibilities were primarily tactical in nature.&lt;ref name=Solo420/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron began taking delivery of its C-130Es in August, and by the end of September its staff numbered eighty-six, including twenty-one officers.&lt;ref name=Roylance100–103&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 100–103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No. 37 Squadron (1966–78), &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1967, the squadron commenced long-range missions in support of Australian forces in the [[Vietnam War]], including aero-medical evacuations conveying wounded soldiers back to Australia, generally via [[RMAF Base Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]], Malaysia.&lt;ref name=Roylance100–103/&gt;&lt;ref name=Units64&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Initially both C-130A and E&amp;nbsp;models were employed for such evacuations, but only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967, as they offered more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia if required.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 256–258&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of February 1968, No.&amp;nbsp;37 Squadron had a strength of 207 personnel: eighty-five aircrew, including fifty-one officers; and 122 ground staff, including three officers.&lt;ref&gt;No. 37 Squadron (1966–78), &quot;Operations Record Book&quot;, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron transported the last Australian forces out of Vietnam in December 1972, following the Federal government's decision to withdraw from the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 248&lt;/ref&gt;
