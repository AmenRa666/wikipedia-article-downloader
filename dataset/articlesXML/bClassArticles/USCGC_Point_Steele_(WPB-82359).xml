'''USCGC ''Point Steele'' (WPB-82359)''' was an {{convert|82|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Point class cutter]] constructed at the [[J.M. Martinac Shipbuilding Corp.]] yards at [[Tacoma, Washington]] in 1967 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. The construction was the same as the earlier cutters in the class that were constructed at the [[United States Coast Guard Yard|Coast Guard Yard]]. ''Point Steele'' was originally named ''Point Buchon'' but it is unknown why the name was changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina77&gt;Scheina, p 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and design details==
''Point Steele'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt; She was powered by two {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt; After 1990 she was refit with {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] diesel main drive engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt; Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; 

The design specifications for ''Point Steele'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After commissioning, ''Point Steele'' was stationed at [[Rockaway, New York]] where she was used for law enforcement duties and search and rescue work. After late 1969 she was transferred to [[Oswego, New York]] where she was detailed to escort [[Eastern Bloc|Communist bloc]] vessels through the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] from [[Massena, New York]] to the [[Welland Canal]]. Her first priority, as with all Coast Guard vessels, was search and rescue work. The disabled [[yacht]] ''Cirrus'' was towed to [[Sodus Bay|Sodus Bay, New York]] by ''Point Steele'' on 25 August 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina77&gt;Scheina, p 77&lt;/ref&gt; The regular escort of communist vessels continued through 1973; after this date the main thrust of her work on [[Lake Ontario]] was law enforcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;

In 1981, ''Point Steele'' was stationed briefly at [[Key West, Florida]] before moving her homeport to [[Fort Myers Beach, Florida]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt; 1984 proved to be a busy year for ''Point Steele'' with her first major action of the year occurring on 5 January. The FV ''Skyware'' was {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} off [[Cape Romano, Florida]] when she caught fire and ''Point Steele'' answered the distress call.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina77&gt;Scheina, p 77&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March, the FV ''El Principe del Golfo'' was seized by the cutter with {{convert|20000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[marijuana]] on board off the coast of Florida. Another boat seizure occurred on 10 November when ''Point Steele'' boarded FV ''Adriana Belle'' and found {{convert|10000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of marijuana on board. On 3 December she seized and sank the workboat ''New Jerusalem'' {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Miami, Florida]] after finding hazardous health conditions on the vessel in addition to 49 illegal migrants and {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of marijuana.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina77&gt;Scheina, p 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, ''Point Steele'' seized FV ''Crusader'' with {{convert|20000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of marijuana on 28 August. After intercepting a sailboat {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Nassau, Bahamas]] she turned 100 [[Haitian people|Haitian]] migrants over to immigration authorities in September 1985. On 14 October she seized the shrimp boat ''Black and White'' with {{convert|55000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of marijuana {{convert|34|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Sanibel Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina77&gt;Scheina, p 77&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 1987, ''Point Steele'' was caught in heavy seas and sustained hull damage requiring a tow of {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] by sister cutter {{USCGC|Point Swift|WPB-82312|2}}. On 5 May she seized FV ''My Girls'' carrying {{convert|50000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of marijuana {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Cape Romano|Cape Romano, Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina77&gt;Scheina, p 77&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Point Steele'' was decommissioned 9 July 1998 and transferred to [[Antigua and Barbuda]] for use by the [[Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force]] on 17 July 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot; /&gt;
