The '''7th Signal Regiment''' is an [[Australian Army]] [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) unit. Drawing lineage from the Australian Special Wireless Group (ASWG), which was raised during [[World War II]], the regiment's history includes service in the Allied campaigns in [[Battle of Greece|Greece]], on [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] and in [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria]] before taking part in the fighting against the Japanese in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]]. After the war, the ASWG was redesignated the 101 Wireless Regiment, deploying detachments overseas during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Confrontation]]. In the mid-1960s, the unit became the 7th Signals Regiment, taking part in the [[Vietnam War]]. The unit is currently part of the [[6th Brigade (Australia)|6th Brigade]].

==World War II==
The regiment traces its lineage back to a unit that was raised as part of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF) during [[World War II]]. The Australian Special Wireless Group (ASWG) was formed as signals intelligence group on 18 May 1942 at [[Bonegilla, Victoria]]. With a war establishment of 1,000 personnel, the ASWG was raised out of a smaller unit, No. 4 Australian Special Wireless Section, which had been raised at [[Seymour, Victoria]], in 1940 and had served in [[Egypt]], [[Battle of Greece|Greece]], [[Battle of Crete|Crete]], and [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria]], before being withdrawn back to Australia after Japan's entry into the war.&lt;ref name=signalman&gt;{{cite journal |author =Dewar, A. |author2 =Watt, E. |author3 =Murray, D. |last-author-amp =yes |title=The History of the Australian Special Wireless Group |journal=Signalman |volume=Spring / Summer |year=2002 |pages=42–45 |issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 1942, females were also recruited into the ASWG. Personnel undertook four months of training, before being formed into [[Section (military)|sections]] and deployed to various locations in remote parts of Australia or in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]]. The ASWG was headquartered at [[Kalinga, Queensland|Kalinga]], in Brisbane during the war and eventually 11 field sections were raised in total.&lt;ref name=ozatwar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozatwar.com/sigint/aswg.htm |title= Australian SpecialWireless Group, AIF, in Australia During World War 2 |publisher=Oz At War |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, the ASWG had around 4,300 personnel.&lt;ref name=signalman/&gt; Parts of the group were later absorbed into the [[Central Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Hillier, Jean | title=No Medals in this Unit |year=1996 | publisher=J.

==Post 1945==
After the conclusion of hostilities, the ASWG was relocated to [[Cabarlah, Queensland]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} north of [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]]. In February 1947, it was redesignated the &quot;101 Wireless Regiment&quot;, with an authorised strength of two officers and 22 other ranks. Over the next two years, the regiment was expanded and between 1951 and 1959, the regiment deployed a detachment to Malaya in support of Commonwealth forces deployed during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. During the early 1960s, the regiment deployed to Borneo during [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Confrontation]], intercepting and decoding Indonesian communications.&lt;ref name=signalman/&gt;

A further name change came in December 1964, when it became the 7th Signal Regiment,&lt;ref name=ozatwar/&gt; subsequently deploying a [[troop]]&amp;nbsp;– 547 Troop&amp;nbsp;– as part of [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's contribution to the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=signalman/&gt; The unit continues to exist within the Australian Army today as part of the [[6th Brigade (Australia)|6th Brigade]], providing an electronic warfare capability. From the 1990s, the regiment provided support for  Australian Army deployments to [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[Multinational Force and Observers|Sinai]], [[INTERFET|East Timor]], [[Peace Monitoring Group|Bougainville]], [[RAMSI|Solomon Islands]], [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Operation Slipper|Afghanistan]]. It is currently based at Borneo Barracks, at Cabarlah and has an establishment of around 250 personnel. The majority of its personnel are members of the [[Royal Australian Corps of Signals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Who-we-are/Divisions-and-Brigades/Forces-Command/6th-Brigade/7th-Signal-Regiment |title=7th Signal Regiment |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1995, then Governor-General Bill Hayden was the Reviewing Officer for the regiment's 48th birthday parade held at Borneo Barracks, Cabarlah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P06965.001 |title=Image: Governor General Bill Hayden presenting an award during the 7th Signal Regiment 48th birthday parade – June 1995 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P06965.002 |title=Image: Governor General Bill Hayden walking with Rwanda and Sinai award recipients after the 7 Sig 48th Birthday parade |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
