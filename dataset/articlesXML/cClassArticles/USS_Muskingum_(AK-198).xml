'''USS ''Muskingum'' (AK-198/T-AK-198)''' was an {{sclass-|Alamosa|cargo ship}} that was constructed for the [[US Navy]] under a [[US Maritime Commission]] (MARCOM) contract during the closing period of [[World War II]]. She supported the end-of-war Navy effort and was subsequently placed in service with the [[US Army]] under the [[Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine]] with a Japanese crew. In 1950 she was reactivated and placed into service with the [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] as '''USNS ''Muskingum'' (T-AK-198)''' until being struck from the [[Navy list]] in 1973. She was ultimately transferred to the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (TTPI) and the [[Republic of Palau]].

==Construction==
''Muskingum'', a type [[Type_C1_ship#C1-M|C1-M-AV1]] cargo ship was laid down under a MARCOM contract, MC hull 2152, by Globe Shipbuilding Co., [[Superior, Wisconsin]], 26 January 1944 and launched on 30 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Henry Larson. ''Muskingum'' was then completed at Samuelson Ship Yard, Beaumont, Texas. She was commissioned on 24 April 1945 at [[Houston, Texas]], [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] M. H. Bryant in command.{{sfn|DANFS}}

==Service history==
===World War II-related service===
After [[sea trial|shakedown]], she departed [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], 26 May 1945 with cargo for the Pacific Ocean. She arrived at [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippine Islands]], 4 August 1945 via the [[Panama Canal]] and [[Manus Island|Manus]], the [[Admiralty Islands]]. The next few months were spent in carrying passengers and freight between Philippine ports.{{sfn|DANFS}}

She departed [[Tacloban]], [[Leyte]], 24 January 1946, arriving [[Yokohama]] 31 January. The ship was decommissioned 7 March 1946 and turned over to the [[War Shipping Administration]] (WSA) for transfer to the [[U.S. Army Transportation Corps]] on a bareboat charter basis. She was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] 5 June 1946.{{sfn|DANFS}}
 
===Army service===
''Muskingum'' was given the Army designation '''V-208''' and operated between ports in Japan, [[Korea]], and the [[Mariana Islands]] under control of the Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine (SCAJAP) with overall control exercised by [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|Supreme Commander of Allied Forces, Japan]]. ''Muskingum'' was operated by Japanese until 1 July 1950 when title was transferred to Navy.{{sfn|DANFS}}

''Muskingum'' was reinstated on the Navy List for operations under [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] (MSTS) WesPac (Western Pacific). During the [[Korean War]], she carried supplies between Japan and Korea.{{sfn|DANFS}}
 
In 1951, ''Muskingum'', designated '''T-AK-198''', was under control of MSTS Far East, operating out of Japan. Besides providing logistical support for U.S. forces in Korea, ''Muskingum'' carried supplies to American and Allied forces in [[South Vietnam]].{{sfn|DANFS}}
