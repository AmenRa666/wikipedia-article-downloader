== The Harrier project was not the first VTOL jet ==
In 1963 I joined Lockheed Aircraft Company in Marietta, GA in their Research and Development division. At this time The US Army had a contract to develop a VTOL Jet. This prototype was named the Hummingbird. Since I don't know how much was secret about this aircraft, I won't go into details. Like all such experimental aircraft, all the bugs were not worked out of it. It was an ongoing project for about another year but the Army shut it down after a fatal crash involving, not the test test pilot, but a young Army Lieutenant who somehow got permission to take it for a test flight.
[[User:P3aul|P3aul]] ([[User talk:P3aul|talk]]) 03:51, 28 May 2014 (UTC)p3aul

:Actually, the Harrier's direct predecessor, the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], first flew in November 1960. The [[Lockheed XV-4 Hummingbird]] first flew in July 1962. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 04:15, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

==Why is it slower?==
Does anybody know where it lost those 80 to 100 knots of top speed compared to the AV-8A? --[[User:Cancun771|Cancun771]] ([[User talk:Cancun771|talk]]) 17:07, 9 June 2014 (UTC)?

:If I recall correctly, it's primarily a result of the supercritical wing used on the AV-8B, which is thicker and has less sweep than the wing of the original Harrier, but I don't understand aerodynamics enough to know why, let alone explain it. The AV-8B was developed primarily for the USMC as a bomb truck, so top speed is not as much of an issue for them in that role. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 17:21, 9 June 2014 (UTC)

:* Yes, the wing was not optimized for max speed.  Payload and range characteristics were greatly improved with the same basic Pegasus engine, though slightly improved.  -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 17:57, 9 June 2014 (UTC)

== TFA ==
Has any thought been given to nominating this article for [[WP:TFA]]?

What sort of anniversary would be most appropriate? Looking quickly, we have;

*9 November 2014 - 36th anniversary first flight of YAV-8B prototype
*5 November 2014 - 33rd anniversary first flight of &quot;full scale development aircraft&quot;
*12 December 2014 - 33rd anniversary delivery of first production aircraft
*5 December 2014 - 11th anniversary last delivery of a remanufactured aircraft(?)
*17 January 2015 - 24th anniversary first combat flight, in a conflict which also became the aircraft's main claim to fame

Or, if we really want a round number/precious stone, push it out right until 17 January 2016 for the 25th anniversary of the first combat flight. --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 17:52, 11 June 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|Demiurge1000}} Yep, the 25th anniversary on 17 January 2016 sounds good. Cheers, [[User:Sp33dyphil|Sp33dyphil]] ([[User talk:Sp33dyphil|talk]]) 02:00, 26 September 2014 (UTC)

::Cool, I will try to remember to add it to [[Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/pending]] in about three months' time. --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 18:38, 26 September 2014 (UTC)

== Origins - engine diameter ==

This section says &quot;Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was 2.75 in (70 mm) too large to fit into the Harrier easily&quot; - clearly it is a mistake, 70mm can't possibly be too big to fit in the aircraft.  Is it 700mm diameter? (although even that doesn't seem very large)  [[User:Baska436|Baska436]] ([[User talk:Baska436|talk]]) 09:46, 9 November 2015 (UTC)

:Not 2.75 inches &quot;in diameter&quot;, but 2.75 inches larger than whatever the original engine's diameter was. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 10:40, 9 November 2015 (UTC)

* Yep, seems pretty clear.  The text says the diameter is 2.75 in (70 mm) larger for the enlarged Pegasus engine. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 16:17, 9 November 2015 (UTC)

Well it seems that I read a comma (or colon) that wasn't there - my apologies.  It wasn't helped by coinciding with a line break.  But I have made a minor edit which I hope will make it clearer still.   [[User:Baska436|Baska436]] ([[User talk:Baska436|talk]]) 03:11, 12 November 2015 (UTC)

== Good article, questions ==
Great! But from the articles intro: Further down It says it didn t use an improved version of the Pegasus ... ?
Accident rate- is there a citation for the reason anywhere? Cheers [[User:Jabberwoch|Jabberwoch]]

: The intro refers to a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine; a slightly improved version of basic engine was used instead.  Look through the whole article; &quot;Accidents&quot; is a main section later in article. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 16:12, 9 November 2015 (UTC)

::I did mate, but it is a long one, which is why I tried to reduce it.  The intro appears to be possibly contradictory with the body, as if left unsynchronized.  I suggest &quot;...other structural and [[aerodynamic]] refinements and a slightly upgraded version of the Pegasus... [ as just &quot;upgraded&quot; sounds like RR's constant engine development programme.] 
:* does everyone think that s more precise?

::Ta, Fnlayson. I see it s also in the (long) Op. History section, I ll amalgamate the two to avoid confusion [[User:Jabberwoch|Jabberwoch]] ([[User talk:Jabberwoch|talk]])

::* I adjusted the wording on the proposed larger engine in the 2nd paragraph of the Lead to clarify. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 18:50, 9 November 2015 (UTC)

==Confusion about replacement by F-35 and phase-out date ? ==
&quot;Expected to become operational in 2015, the F-35B will start to replace the AV-8B in 2016, and continue in service until 2025.&quot;. This is saying, literally, that the F-35 will continue in service until 2025. Surely either a misprint or grammatical error ? I suspect the USMC will need at least some AV-8Bs until 2025. [[User:Rcbutcher|Rcbutcher]] ([[User talk:Rcbutcher|talk]]) 08:40, 29 December 2015 (UTC)
:{{Ping|Rcbutcher}} I've clarified it. Thanks for spotting it. Regards, --[[User:Sp33dyphil|Sp33dyphil]] ©&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Sp33dyphil|hat]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style='position: relative; left: -1.5em;'&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Sp33dyphil|ontributions]]&lt;/sub&gt; 09:47, 29 December 2015 (UTC)
