{{Dyktalk|16 October|2010|views=1700|entry=... that the '''[[Military Engineering-Technical University]]''' ''(pictured)'' in [[Saint Petersburg]] was the [[alma mater]] of author [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]?}}

==English==
I rewrote the article in native-born English. So please correct anything I didn't understand. There were some phrases I didn't understand at all, so I left them alone. Several times it says something like &quot;the places of the own historical basing&quot;. Does that mean where the university was first built in 1810? &quot;the base of the military school of engineering conductors (engineering of unter-officers)&quot; – I think that means &quot;engineering conductors&quot; means the same as &quot;engineering of unter-officers&quot;, but I don't understand either one. &quot;Conductors&quot; probably means something like [[Conductor (Army)]], but Americans aren't familiar with that British rank, and at first I wondered if it was more like [[Conductor (transportation)]]. It should at least be wiki-linked. &quot;Unter&quot; isn't an English word; it's the German word for &quot;under&quot;, so maybe you meant &quot;lower ranking officers&quot;.

- Many thanks from St-Petersburg. I must to explain as &quot;engineering conductors&quot; can to be the historical term, but it is necessary to so tell. Now russian people also can not understand about &quot;engineering conductors&quot;, but so could to named in 1803-1806 in Russua. Yes, &quot;engineering conductors&quot; can to be engineering of unter-officers. Also, graduating students could heroically battle, it is fact. Also, I want to tell about, as Harmonic association of spiritual force and engineering competence is tradition.

- Also, about: Does that mean where the university was first built in 1810?
so that mean where the university was first founded in 1810.
An university was founded and had different buildings, and the university even could was first founded in 1804-1806.

- So the university becomes normal engineering school for training engineers-officers with 1810 (and breaks off to be school of &quot;engineering conductors&quot;). Also, I think, term &quot;engineering conductors&quot; could to be from French, so as after 1700 there were a lot of the Russian graduating students of engineering schools of French. Do you know [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]]? he was military engineer and the great-grandfather of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also he can to have name as the great-grandfather of Russian engineers. so he was first rector of first engineering school.

:I meant that &quot;the places of the own historical basing&quot;, &quot;engineering conductors&quot;, and &quot;unter-officers&quot; don't make sense in English, so I need to understand them before I can rewrite them. Should I change &quot;the places of the own historical basing&quot; to &quot;where the university was first built&quot;, &quot;engineering conductors&quot; to &quot;engineering [[Conductor (Army)|conductors]]&quot;, and &quot;unter-officers&quot; to &quot;lower-ranking officers&quot;?

:Concerning words like &quot;heroically&quot;, it is difficult for English Wikipedia to enforce the [[Wikipedia:PEACOCK]] guideline in articles about unfamiliar cultures like India and Mexico. But you won't find words like &quot;heroically&quot; in articles like the heroic [[Battle of Midway]] or [[Battle of Britain]], except maybe when quoting a published opinion on those battles.

- Also, I could to think about &quot;unter-officers&quot; and &quot;non-commission officers&quot;. I see as &quot;unter-officers&quot; can not to be english term. 

- Also, I think, can to be to &quot;where the university was first founded or organized&quot;.

- Also, I think, &quot;school engineering conductors&quot; can to be historical term of 1700th, historical terms become antiquated and lose sense but continue to be used.

- Also, I think, about &quot;heroically&quot;, it is can to be one time to difficult for English Wikipedia, if it is about real veterans, but I can understand, so can not to be a lot of. I think, it is necessary to write, how 12-inch artillery of [[Krasnaya Gorka fort]] could to finally stopped the offensive of fascists in 1941 , built by a graduating student of the university. 

- Also, I think, as I can to write about the reason of the Stalin repressions against an university, because Stalin did not love Dostoevsky (Stalin did not understand Dostoevsky).

:Thank you. I made some changes accordingly. As for [[WP:PEACOCK]], I usually do copyediting only, without changing the content, but I can explain what WP:PEACOCK says. There is no objection to saying that a university graduate helped to stop the Nazis. That is presumably a fact. WP:PEACOCK objects to saying that a graduate heroically, gloriously, and magnificently helped stop the Nazis. That is an opinion.

==Linking==
Please do not link the same things repeatedly, and please do not link plain English words. Also, please do not link years. See [[WP:OVERLINK]] for an explanation. Thanks. [[User:Ground Zero|Ground Zero]] | [[User talk:Ground Zero|t]] 20:22, 29 November 2010 (UTC)

- Who could have ignorance to take away the historical names?
- I hope exact historical information from the book of S. Тymoshenko will be useful to understanding of development of Engineering education in Russia.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sergeispb-10|Sergeispb-10]] ([[User talk:Sergeispb-10|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sergeispb-10|contribs]]) 20:05, 29 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
