'''''Latnik''''' ({{lang-ru|Латник}}) was an {{sclass-|Uragan|monitor|0}} [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the mid-1860s. The design was based on the American {{sclass-|Passaic|monitor|2}}, but was modified to suit Russian engines, guns and construction techniques. She was one of two ships of the [[ship class|class]] to be built in Belgium and assembled in Russia. Spending her entire career with the [[Baltic Fleet]], the ship was only active when the [[Gulf of Finland]] was not frozen, but very little is known about her service. She was stricken in 1900 from the [[Navy List]], converted into a coal [[barge]] in 1903 and renamed ''Barzha No. 38'' and then ''Barzha No. 326''. Abandoned by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in Finland in 1918, the ship was later [[ship breaking|scrapped]] by the Finns.

==Description==
''Latnik'' was {{convert|201|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|46|ft|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.16|-|10.84|ft|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|1500|-|1600|LT|t|0}}, and her crew numbered eight officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865. They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877.&lt;ref name=m3&gt;McLaughlin, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was fitted with a two-cylinder, horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting steam engine]]&lt;ref name=m3/&gt; built by [[Carr and MacPherson]] of [[Saint Petersburg]]. It drove a single propeller&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 106–07&lt;/ref&gt; using steam that was provided by two rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Specific information on the output of the ship's engine has not survived, but it ranged between {{convert|340|-|500|ihp|0|lk=in}} for all the ships of this [[ship class|class]]. During ''Latnik''{{'}}s [[sea trial]]s on 31 May 1865, she reached a maximum speed of {{convert|5|kn|lk=in}}, the slowest ship in the class. She carried a maximum of {{convert|190|LT|t|0}} of coal, which gave her a theoretical endurance of {{convert|1440|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|6|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

''Latnik'' was designed to be armed with a pair of {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0}} [[smoothbore]] [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading guns]] purchased from [[Krupp]] of Germany and [[Rifling|rifled]] in Russia, but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with nine-inch smoothbores. These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license-built {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} smoothbore muzzle-loading [[Rodman gun]]s in 1867–68. The Rodman guns were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine-inch rifled guns.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 104–05&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the wrought-iron armor that was used in the ''Uragan''-class monitors was in {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} plates, just as in the ''Passaic''-class ships. The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates, of which the three innermost plates extended {{convert|42|in|m|1}} below the [[waterline]]. This armor was backed by a wooden beam that had a maximum thickness of {{convert|36|in|0}}. The [[gun turret]] was protected by eleven layers of armor and the [[pilothouse]] above it had eight layers of armor. Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] up to a height of {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} above the deck.  Unlike their predecessors, the ''Uragan''s were built without deck armor to save weight, but ''Latnik''{{'}}s deck was reinforced by the addition of {{convert|0.5|in|1|adj=on}} armor plates after completion.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 105–06&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Construction of the ship began on 17 June 1863 at the [[Carr and MacPherson]] Shipyard in [[Saint Petersburg]]. ''Latnik'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 24 December 1863 and she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 March 1864. She entered service on 14 July 1865 and cost a total of 1,148,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion. For some reason, she was the only ship of the class not to make a port visit to [[Stockholm]], Sweden in July–August 1865. She suffered some sort of hull damage in September, but the details are not known.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 100, 104, 109–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after ''Latnik'' was completed, an armored ring, {{convert|5|in|0}} thick and {{convert|15|in|0}} tall, was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it. Later, an armored, outward-curving [[wikt:bulwark|bulwark]] was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there. Three [[sponson]]s were later added, probably during the 1870s, to the upper portion of the turret. Each sponson, one above the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] and one on each side of the turret, mounted a light gun, probably a {{convert|1.75|in|adj=on}} Engstrem gun, for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a [[Deck (ship)#Hurricane deck|hurricane deck]] was built between the funnel and the turret, also probably during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the ship's career other than that she was [[Ship decommissioning|laid up]] each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. ''Latnik'' was reclassified as a [[coastal defense ship|coast defense]] [[ironclad]] on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of [[Kronstadt]] for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three [[Hold (ship)|holds]].&lt;ref name=m9&gt;McLaughlin, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; She was redesignated as ''Barzha No. 38'' and, in 1914, ''Barzha No. 326''. She was abandoned by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in Helsingfors ([[Helsinki]]) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] and was later broken up there.&lt;ref name=m9/&gt;
