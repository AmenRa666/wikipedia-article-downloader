== NPOV issues ==

Hey everyone-- happy primary day! This article is seriously slanted in a pro-Sestak way. It uses a number of weasel words and has a very specific 'against the establishment' feel to it that reads more like a campaign piece than an encyclopedia article. I'm going to wait until the polls have closed before I add the tag for this so it doesn't seem like I'm trying to electioneer or something like that, but some examples:

::*&quot;Sestak began laying the groundwork for a Congressional run in his home district in Pennsylvania as a Democrat. However, he was approached and told that he had to first receive the endorsement of the &quot;DCCC.&quot; Confused, Sestak first thought DCCC meant his hometown's Delaware County Community College.&quot; (Not sure what this adds to the article)

::*Eventually, he was steered toward the correct DCCC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and informed its head, Rahm Emanuel, of his run for Congress. Emanuel told Sestak he was not ready for such an election. Pennsylvania's 7th district is heavily conservative, as Republicans outnumbered Democrats 2:1. Sestak decided to run anyway and turned to his brother Richard and sisters Elizabeth and Margaret, who served as his campaign manager, top fundraiser and treasurer, respectively. (According to this source [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/7/12/226777/-], he was added to the DCCC's list immediately)

::*&quot;However, once Senator Specter switched, nationwide support mounted on a possible senatorial campaign. Most prominent was a straw poll conducted by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, entitled &quot;Should a Draft Sestak movement be created to take on Sen. Arlen Specter in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary?&quot; Nationwide, almost 8000 votes were cast with 86% responding yes and 85% of Pennsylvanians responding yes.&quot; (The citation is the PCCC itself, not an independent news source)

::*&quot;As the percentages stabilized, and it was clear Toomey was the eventual winner, Sestak conceded the race to a ballroom-full of his supporters at the Radnor Hotel. He lost by 80,000 votes out of the 4 million cast, a margin large enough to avoid a recount. It was the smallest margin of loss of any Pennsylvania Democratic candidate in 2010.&quot; (One of the sources for this is a picture of Toomey on election day from the campaign, which doesn't seem very relevant)

::*&quot;Some critics were quick to cite Sestak's handling of his Congressional staff as evidence to solidify &quot;the perception that he is a taskmaster with a prickly streak.&quot; During his first term in office, Sestak employed 61 people as staff in his official congressional office, while other comparable Congressmen employed a total of 28, 26, and 25 staff members, indicating that Sestak had a high turnover rate.&quot; (This is a mildly critical line, but the following line is a quote that puts a positive spin on it, much like a comms director on a race would do)

I think that this whole article needs a significant re-write and a solid culling of the spin inside of really all of it and some more neutral pieces should be added to flesh things out. [[User:Nomader|Nomader]] ([[User talk:Nomader|talk]]) 17:02, 26 April 2016 (UTC)
