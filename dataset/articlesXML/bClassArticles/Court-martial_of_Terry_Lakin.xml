      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25316">The '''court-martial of Terry Lakin''' &lt;!-- (''United States v. Lakin'') --&gt; took place over December 14–16, 2010. Doctor Terry Lakin, a [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], announced that he would refuse deployment, and subsequently refused to deploy to [[Afghanistan]] because of his [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|concerns over President Obama's constitutional eligibility to be president]]. It was Lakin's hope that he could request a copy of Obama's [[birth certificate]] as part of a court-martial, a goal that had eluded previous military defendants. Lakin had the support of three retired American generals, two of whom were working for [[Fox News Channel]] at the time.

Before Lakin went to [[court-martial]], it was found by the judge that President Obama's eligibility (and hence his birth certificate) had no bearing on the case. Lakin pleaded guilty to two charges while pleading not-guilty to one other. Despite recanting his original concerns and asking the jury for leniency, Lakin was found guilty of all charges and sentenced to dismissal from the Army and a prison term of six months. Lakin was released from the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]] after serving five of his six months. He was later denied a [[medical license]] in [[Kansas]] as a result of his dereliction of duty.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakin invited his court-martial to cause the president's legitimacy to be scrutinized, but also because he wanted the president to produce his original 1961 [[birth certificate]] to prove his &quot;birth on American soil&quot; and [[natural born citizen of the United States|natural born]]-status.&lt;ref name=&quot;apfincyt20100330&quot; /&gt;  Margaret Hemenway, speaking for the APF to [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']], repeatedly claimed that President Obama hadn't even released the same birth certificate Lakin had to give the military.  The APF also raised funds to assist in Lakin's defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon20100405&quot; /&gt;

Prior to April 12, Army officials stated they were aware of Lakin's intent to &quot;violate articles 87 and 92 of [the] [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]&quot;, but until he did so they had nothing further upon which to comment.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon20100405&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of complying with his deployment orders, Lakin reported to [[the Pentagon]].  After being [[Miranda warning|Mirandized]]&lt;ref name=&quot;politico20100414&quot; /&gt; and informed by his [[commanding officer]]—[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Gordon Ray Roberts]]—that he would face court-martial, Lakin's Pentagon [[access badge]] and governmental [[laptop]] were confiscated.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbcnews20100413&quot; /&gt;  Pending his court-martial, Lakin was assigned to duty at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;politico20100414&quot; /&gt;

===Analysis===
[[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] contributor Alex Koppelman noted that LTC Lakin was not the first [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] member to &quot;become a [[birther]] cause celebre&quot;, indicating the cases of Major Stefan F. Cook ([[Orly Taitz#Cook v. Good|''Cook v. Good'']]) and Captain Connie Rhodes ([[Orly Taitz#Rhodes v. MacDonald|''Rhodes v. MacDonald'']]).  Koppelman explained that neither of these lawsuits succeeded in a ruling on Obama's eligibility to be president.  In contrast, since a court case (in this case, a court-martial) was the likely conclusion to Lakin's actions, his attorneys hoped that he could seek President Obama's original birth certificate for use in his defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon20100405&quot; /&gt;

===Commentary by others===
Prior to Lakin officially violating his order to deploy, former Republican [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Bob Smith (American politician)|Bob Smith]], who founded the American Patriot Foundation, said: &quot;...my personal belief is that when an officer has a constitutional question I don't have a problem with that being answered, that's his legal right to have that answered, but I'm not involved in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;salon20100405&quot; /&gt; Three retired United States generals expressed support for Lakin.  The first was retired Army [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Paul E. Vallely]], a senior [[military analyst]] for [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]].  In an interview, Vallely stated &quot;I think many in the military – and many out of the military – question the natural-birth status of Barack Obama.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gg20100429&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Trial==
In September 2010, Lakin's military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, ruled that whether President Obama is constitutionally qualified for office had no legal bearing on Lakin's case.  As such, Lakin could not make any demands for the president's birth certificate as part of his trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUFFPO20101214&quot;&gt;{{cite news

On December 14, 2010, the first day of Lakin's court-martial at [[Fort George G. Meade]], jurors were asked about their awareness of the &quot;birther movement&quot;.  Lakin pleaded guilty to violating article 92 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) (failing to meet with a superior officer and failing to report to duty at [[Fort Campbell]]), and pleaded not guilty to violating article 87 of the UCMJ (missing a flight on which he was required); the court-martial continued on the second charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc20101214&quot;&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Lakin court-martial sketch (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Courtroom sketch]] of Lakin (left) and jurors (right) made 15 December]]
Facing up to 3.5 years in military prison and dismissal from the Army, on December 15 Lakin changed tack and stated that he was wrong to question the president's qualifications through his military service.  He requested that the jury allow him to continue his career in the military (&quot;I don't want it to end this way, I want to continue to serve&quot;), and that he would now undertake his deployment if he could, even with his concerns about the president unaddressed.  The defense brought witnesses before the court to testify on Lakin's behalf, describing the accused as a &quot;compassionate physician&quot; who always volunteered to help when needed.  The prosecution introduced the officer that was deployed in Lakin's stead, who testified alongside his wife about how the last-minute deployment affected their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUFFPO20101215&quot;&gt;{{cite news
