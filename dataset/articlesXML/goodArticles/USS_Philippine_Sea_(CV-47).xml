'''USS ''Philippine Sea'' (CV/CVA/CVS-47, AVT-11)''' was one of 24 {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s of the [[United States Navy]], and the first ship to be named for the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. She was launched on 5 September 1945, after the end of [[World War II]] and sponsored by the wife of the [[Governor of Kentucky]].

During her career, ''Philippine Sea'' served first in the Atlantic Ocean and saw several deployments to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as well as a trip to [[Antarctica]] as a part of [[Operation Highjump]]. Sent to the [[Korean Peninsula]] at the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], she sent aircraft in support of United Nations ground troops, first during the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] and then during the [[Inchon Landing]]s and the [[Second Battle of Seoul]]. She subsequently supported UN troops during the surprise [[Republic of China|Chinese]] attack and the [[Chosin Reservoir Campaign]]. ''Philippine Sea'' saw three tours to Korea during the war, receiving nine [[battle star]]s for her service.

For the remainder of her service, she operated primarily out of [[San Diego]] and San Francisco, seeing several deployments to the Far East and being redesignated an [[anti-submarine warfare carrier]]. She was decommissioned on 28 December 1958 and sold for scrap in 1970.

==Construction==
{{main|Essex-class aircraft carrier}}

''Philippine Sea'' was the last of the 24 {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|0}} ships to be completed, among the largest and most numerous [[capital ship]]s produced for [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=''Essex''-class Aircraft Carrier |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/usnshtp/cv/cv9cl.htm |publisher=[[United States Navy]] |date=6 June 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CV-47 was ordered simultaneously to {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|2}} and {{USS|Iwo Jima|CV-46|2}} in June 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ticonderoga&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/usnshtp/cv/cv14cl.htm |title=''Ticonderoga''-class Aircraft Carrier |publisher=[[United States Navy]] |date=8 October 2001 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SB2C-5 VA-9A on USS Philippine Sea 1948.jpg|thumb|left|[[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver|Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver]]s aboard ''Philippine Sea'' during her cruise in the Mediterranean in 1948.]]
The ship was one of the [[Essex-class aircraft carrier#The &quot;long-hull&quot; Essexes|&quot;long-hull&quot;]] designs of the class, which had begun production after March 1943. This &quot;long hull&quot; variant involved lengthening the bow above the waterline into a &quot;clipper&quot; form. The increased [[Rake angle|rake]] and [[Flare (ship)|flare]] provided deck space for two quadruple {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} mounts; these units also had the flight deck slightly shortened forward to provide better arcs of fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sowinski 1980 30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sowinski|1980|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the ''Essex''-class ships laid down after 1942, only {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31|2}} followed the original &quot;short hull&quot; design. The later ships have been variously referred to as the &quot;long-bow units&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sowinski 1980 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raven|1988|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;long-hull group&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fahey|1950|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fried151&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|1983|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the &quot;''Ticonderoga'' class&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ticonderoga&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=StJohn11&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.S. Navy never maintained any institutional distinction between the long-hull and short-hull members of the ''Essex'' class, and applied postwar refits and upgrades to both groups equally.&lt;ref name=StJohn11/&gt; The ship was powered by eight 600 psi [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] boilers, and Westinghouse geared [[steam turbines]] that developed 150,000 [[shaft horsepower]] that turned four propellers. Like other ''Essex''-class carriers, she had a maximum speed of {{convert|33|kn}}. The ship's cost is estimated at $68,000,000 to $78,000,000.&lt;ref name=StJohn215&gt;{{harvnb|''Boxer''|2000|p=15|ref=&quot;Boxer&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other &quot;long-hull&quot; ''Essex''-class carriers, ''Philippine Sea'' had a displacement of {{convert|27100|t}}. She had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|888|ft}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|93|ft}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|39|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;/&gt; The ship was powered by {{convert|150000|shp|adj=on}} [[steam turbines]] with a designed range of {{convert|20000|nmi}}. While ''Essex''-class carriers typically had a designed maximum speed of {{convert|33|kn}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex&quot;/&gt; ''Philippine Sea'' only made {{convert|30|kn}} on [[sea trial]]s. The ship had a total crew complement of 3,310.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;&gt;{{citation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529223045/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=61 |archivedate=29 May 2012 | url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=61 | title=USS ''Philippine Sea'' (CV-47) from Dictionary of American Fighting Ships and United States Naval Aviation, 1910–1995 | publisher=[[US Navy]] | accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other ''Essex''-class ships, she was armed with twelve 38-[[caliber]] [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|5-inch (127 mm)]] [[dual purpose gun]]s arrayed in four twin and four single mountings, as well as 8 quadruple [[Bofors 40 mm guns]] and a variable number of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex&quot;/&gt; Unlike her [[sister ship|sisters]], however, ''Philippine Sea'' substituted additional Bofors guns for the Oerlikons with forty-four {{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}} guns arrayed in 10 quadruple and two double mounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;/&gt;

The [[keel]] of CV-47 was laid down 19 August 1944 at the [[Bethlehem Steel Company]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]. Originally, the ship was to be named {{USS|Wright}} in honor of the [[Wright brothers]], but following the 19 June 1944 [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], the Navy decided that the ship be named after the battle, and on 13 February 1945, she was renamed.&lt;ref name=StJohn10&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the ship continued throughout the summer of 1945, but ''Philippine Sea'' was not completed at the time of [[V-E Day]]. The ship was launched on 5 September 1945, only days after [[V-J Day]] and the end of World War II. She was [[Ship naming and launching|christened]] by the wife of [[Governor of Kentucky]] [[Happy Chandler|Albert &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler]].&lt;ref name=StJohn11/&gt;

== Service history ==
''Philippine Sea'' commissioned on 11 May 1946, when [[Rear Admiral]] [[Morton Deyo]] placed the ship under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Delbert Strother Cornwell at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] in [[South Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The ship remained [[drydock]]ed at the yard for two weeks before sailing for [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point]] on 13 June. However, a shortage of men following the post-World War II [[demobilization]] forced her to remain at reduced operational status until 23 September when she embarked for sea trials.&lt;ref name=StJohn11/&gt;

Returning from trials on 27 September, the carrier embarked [[Carrier Air Group 20]],&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn11&quot;/&gt; which flew two squadrons of [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]] [[fighter aircraft]] as well as a squadron each of [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] [[dive bomber]]s and [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman TBM-3E Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, about 90 aircraft total.&lt;ref name=StJohn33&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left port 30 September and commenced training en route to [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. CVG-20 [[Commander]] Robert M. Milner made the first takeoff from the carrier on 1 October aboard a Bearcat. ''Philippine Sea'' departed [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] 12 October for [[Cuba]]n waters where she conducted an abbreviated [[shakedown cruise]] and training exercises for CVG-20's Grumman F8F Bearcats and Curtiss SB2C Helldivers until 20 November.&lt;ref name=StJohn11/&gt;

Following these trials, ''Philippine Sea'' was assigned to [[Operation Highjump]]. She returned to Quonset and disembarked CVG-20 before sailing for Boston for repairs and alterations. She then headed to Norfolk where Rear Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] boarded her and she took on six [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas R4D-5 Skytrain]] transports, two [[Stinson L-5 Sentinel|Stinson OY-1 Sentinel]] liaison aircraft, and a [[Sikorsky H-5|Sikorsky HO3S-1]] [[helicopter]] along with cargo, spare parts, skis and [[Task Force 68]] personnel. She left Norfolk 29 December and stood out of [[Hampton Roads]] 2 January 1947 en route to [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=StJohn13&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Philippine Sea'' passed through the [[Panama Canal]] 8 January and cleared [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] by 10 January. By 12 January the ship had crossed the [[equator]] in an elaborate ceremony, but on 22 January its HO3S-1 was lost due to pilot error, though the crew was recovered. Two days later, it met the remaining ships of Task Force 68. The ship arrived on station on 29 January, {{convert|660|mi}} from [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]], and launched its R4Ds in the next few days to explore the Arctic. Commander [[William M. Hawkes]] and Byrd both disembarked from ''Philippine Sea'' aboard the aircraft to begin their expedition. After her aircraft departed, ''Philippine Sea'' returned to Quonset, passing through Balboa again on 22 February and arriving back in port on 27 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn13&quot;/&gt;

[[File:CV-47 Gibraltar 1948.jpg|thumb|left|''Philippine Sea'' at [[Gibraltar]] in early 1948.|alt=A color photo of an aircraft carrier at sea from a distance]]
In late March, the carrier embarked [[Carrier Air Group 9]], which flew two squadrons of [[Gruman F8F Bearcat]]s and [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] fighters as well as a squadron each of SB2C Helldivers and TBM Avengers, and a detachment of HO3S helicopters for a total of about 100 aircraft.&lt;ref name=StJohn33/&gt; She completed her shakedown cruise at [[Guantanamo Bay]] until late May.&lt;ref name=StJohn17&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued sea trials in the area until 1 July when she arrived at [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend Bay, New Jersey]] for refit. She was refitted for most of the year at [[New York Naval Shipyard]] and [[Bayonne, New Jersey]] through 15 November 1947 before conducting trials and training around Quonset and Guantanamo Bay through February 1948. That month, she became [[flagship]] of [[Carrier Division Four]] led by Rear Admiral [[Ralph E. Jennings]], who established his command aboard her on 4 February. On 20 February she departed for her first deployment in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as part of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Forrest Sherman]]'s [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]]. Here she logged 8,534 flight hours, including 85 hours of night operations. She returned to Quonset 26 June and for repairs to her catapult machinery.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn13&quot;/&gt; She spent the remainder of the year as a part of the [[Operational Development Force]] testing new carrier aircraft doctrine, and her pilots logged 750 hours in 670 [[carrier controlled approach]] tests and 314 successful landings. On 22 October she was sent to the North Atlantic to conduct cold-weather landing tests and tested problem landing scenarios along the [[Arctic Circle]] until 23 November 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Philippine Sea (CV-47) and USS Wisconsin (BB-64) during arctic operations 1948.jpeg|thumb|''Philippine Sea'' with {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}} during cold weather fleet exercises in the North Atlantic, November 1948.|alt=A black and white photo of an aircraft carrier and a battleship in the background.]]
In January 1949, ''Philippine Sea'' returned to Carrier Division Four under Rear Admiral [[Joseph J. Clark]] and embarked [[Carrier Air Group 7]] for another tour in the Mediterranean, which had a similar fighter complement. She sailed 4 January with the aircraft carrier {{USS|Midway|CVB-41|2}} and supporting ships. There, she conducted joint exercises with carriers of the British fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn16&quot;/&gt; She returned in late May and began an overhaul at the [[Boston Naval Shipyard]]. That fall, the ship returned to the Caribbean to shake down with its new upgrades, this time with [[Carrier Air Group 1]]. For the rest of the year, she continued fleet exercises in the North Atlantic and testing for new [[jet engine]] powered fighter aircraft to test their abilities to operate on aircraft carriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn16&quot;/&gt;

Operating again from her base at Quonset Point, ''Philippine Sea'' spent early 1950 qualifying new carrier pilots. During February and most of March, she took part in more fleet exercises throughout the Atlantic. During April and May 1950 she conducted demonstration cruises for guests of the [[Secretary of the Navy]], the [[Armed Forces Industrial College]], [[Air War College]], and the [[Armed Forces Staff College]]. On 24 May 1950, ''Philippine Sea'' sailed from Norfolk  through the Panama Canal, arriving at her new home port of San Diego to join the Pacific Fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;/&gt; She was replaced in the Atlantic Fleet by {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn16&quot;/&gt; She was scheduled to begin a tour in the Far East in October 1950 before she was called to combat duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar296&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korean War ===

With the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] on 25 June 1950, ''Philippine Sea'' was ordered to [[Naval Base Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sailed for Hawaiian waters on 5 July with [[Carrier Air Group 11]] embarked, flying four squadrons of [[Vought F4U Corsair]] fighter-bombers. The ship departed for Japan on 24 July. Leaving Pearl Harbor, ''Philippine Sea'' sailed at full speed for the Western Pacific, reaching [[Okinawa]] on 4 August. During this time, she took command of [[Carrier Division One]].&lt;ref name=StJohn18&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the third [[aircraft carrier]] to arrive in Korea, as her [[sister ship]] {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|2}} as well as {{HMS|Triumph|R16|6}} had arrived in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time ''Philippine Sea'' arrived in Korea, the UN forces had established superiority in the air and sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex126&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AD-4 USS Philippine Sea Korea.jpg|thumb|250px|left|An [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD-4 Skyraider]] takes off from ''Philippine Sea'' for a sortie to Korea in the fall of 1950.|alt=A propeller-driven aircraft prepared to take off aboard an aircraft carrier deck.]]
''Philippine Sea'' arrived in Korean waters on 1 August,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar35&quot;/&gt; and became flagship of [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]] on 5 August. She immediately began launching [[air strike]]s against strategic targets, as the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] began and United Nations and [[United States Army]] forces fought a defensive battle against the North Korean [[Korean People's Army]]. Her first strikes were against [[Iri, Korea|Iri]], [[Mokpo, Korea|Mokpo]], and [[Kunsan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar65&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strikes were at first planned to target North Korean lines of communication but the intensity of the battle at Pusan Perimeter forced the carrier to fly primarily [[close air support]] missions for troops on the front lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar299&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also hit targets of opportunity, such as North Korean boats, bridges and dams spotted during missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;StJohn18&quot;/&gt; As many as 140 [[sorties]] a day were launched from the carrier. Except for brief rests to re-arm, refuel, or repair, ''Philippine Sea'' was in action continuously.&lt;ref name=StJohn19&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was put in a rotation of continuous action with ''Valley Forge'' to assure at least one was launching aircraft at all times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar44&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the beginning of [[The Great Naktong Offensive]] on 31 August, the two carriers launched 263 sorties to prevent the North Koreans from overrunning Pusan Perimeter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship sent sorties to defend [[Masan]] during the [[Battle of Masan]], in spite of being {{convert|200|mi}} from the area. The ship steamed to the southern tip of the Peninsula at {{convert|27|kn}} on 1 September to support the Masan area more easily during the North Korean attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex190&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the other carriers of Task Force 77, ''Philippine Sea'' targeted rail and communication centers around North Korean-controlled [[Seoul]] to [[Wonsan]] in September. The strikes were part of a deception plan to draw North Korean attention away from the UN force massing for an attack on [[Inchon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar303&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stationed in the [[Yellow Sea]], she sent numerous air attacks on Inchon and [[Wolmi-do]] in preparation for [[Operation Chromite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar65&quot;/&gt; The day of the operation, 15 September, ''Philippine Sea'' dispatched planes far inland to destroy North Korean positions and prevent reinforcements from countering the [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landings]]. Following the initial assault, she continued to provide close air support for the thrust inland to [[Second Battle of Seoul|recapture Seoul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar304&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, she was joined by {{USS|Boxer|CV-21|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar201&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were part of a massive invasion force of some 230 ships and hundreds of aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex195&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====F9F-2 Miracle Landing====

On 17 September 1950 a pair of [[Grumman F9F Panther|Grumman F9F-2 Panthers]] launched from the deck of  ''Philippine Sea''. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section  dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historynet.com&quot;&gt;http://www.historynet.com/miracle-landing-off-korea.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield turned out to be little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Aviation History magazine March 2014 page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from &quot;passengers&quot; on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from {{convert|50|ft|m}} [[Altitude above ground level|AGL]]. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to &quot;clothesline&quot; low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;historynet.com&quot;/&gt; Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds&lt;ref name=&quot;history.navy.mil&quot;&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/g430000/g439862l.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Plexiglas]] and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the [[Yellow Sea]], but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship and with the help of [[Landing Signal Officer|LSO]] Lt.j.g.&quot;Les&quot; Bruestle&lt;ref name=&quot;history.navy.mil&quot;/&gt; and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 [[Arresting gear|wire]] on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In November 1950 when [[China]] surprised the United Nations ground troops with an unexpected counterattack from the [[Yalu River]] by the [[People's Liberation Army]], ''Philippine Sea'' planes saw heavy action. The US Navy had sent ''Valley Forge'' and several other ships away from Korea, expecting the conflict to end, and so the unprepared forces remaining in the area were heavily engaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar310&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the long retreat from the Yalu River, the four carriers' Panthers, Skyraiders and Corsairs provided [[close air support]] for the trapped [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]] at [[Chosin Reservoir]].&lt;ref name=StJohn20&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the increasingly cold weather proved a problem for ''Philippine Sea'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar221&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ship continued to support the troops as they tried to [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir|evacuate from the reservoir]] and then cleared the path for their retreat to [[Hungnam]]. The carriers provided support with hundreds of aircraft sorties as 150,000 UN troops and civilians were evacuated, and then destroyed the port.&lt;ref name=StJohn20/&gt; During this support, ''Valley Forge'' and ''Philippine Sea'' were tightly clustered with {{USS|Leyte|CV-32|2}} and {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|2}} and commanders worried that they would be a target for air attack by North Korean [[MiG-15]] fighters, prompting a large screen of 32 destroyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar226&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex357&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of 1950 and early 1951, she launched numerous attacks against Chinese forces around the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]] hoping to slow their advance as UN troops retreated. With only brief stops for repair and rest, the carrier continued numerous sorties against Chinese targets. On 25 February, command of Task Force 77 was transferred to ''Valley Forge''. During this time, the cold weather hampered operations and blizzards occasionally shut them down completely.&lt;ref name=StJohn20/&gt; Putting into [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]], Japan, in late March 1951 for repair and refit, ''Philippine Sea'' exchanged Air Group 11 for [[Carrier Air Group 2]] from ''Valley Forge'', a group which consisted mostly of Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers. The same date as the transfer on 28 March, ''Philippine Sea'' became flagship of Vice Admiral [[H. M. Martin]], the commander of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]].&lt;ref name=StJohn20/&gt;

Returning to the [[Sea of Japan]] in April, ''Philippine Sea'' led Task Force 77 as well as other ships of the 7th Fleet through the [[Strait of Formosa]] to the [[South China Sea]]. From the Formosa Strait, planes flew in [[parades]] over [[Formosa]] as part of a show of support for the newly formed nation of [[Taiwan]], in an effort to boost morale of the nation. She steamed back to Korea three days later, in time to lend close air support to UN forces throughout early 1951 as they faced repeated offensives by the Chinese.&lt;ref name=StJohn20/&gt;

[[File:CVA-47 3May1953 HN-SN-98-07229.JPEG|thumb|250px|''Philippine Sea'' on 3 May 1953 with planes of ''Carrier Air Group 9''|alt=A black and white photo of a large aircraft carrier with aircraft filling its deck.]]
''Philippine Sea'' completed her first deployment to Korea and arrived at San Francisco on 9 June 1951. It conducted refits, repairs and patrol operations along the West Coast continued for the remainder of the year. On 19 December, she was the site of a test for an emergency [[nuclear weapon]] assembly, the first such test involving a nuclear weapon aboard a US Navy ship. The ship departed from San Diego on 31 December 1951. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1952, ''Philippine Sea'' continued on to Yokosuka for a second deployment to Korea, arriving 20 January 1952 with Carrier Air Group 11, which flew five squadrons of the F4U Corsair, about 100 aircraft.&lt;ref name=StJohn21&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this tour, the front lines in Korea had largely stabilized, and instead the ship directed its aircraft against strategic targets, including the 23 June [[attack on the Sui-ho Dam]] in conjunction with ''Boxer'', ''Princeton'', and {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31|2}}, and sending aircraft against targets in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar332&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Philippine Sea'' returned to San Diego in August 1952. Her designation was changed to CVA, denoting an &quot;attack aircraft carrier&quot; in October. With five more Corsair squadrons of Carrier Air Group 9 embarked, she began a third cruise to the Far East early in December 1952 with about 100 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;/&gt; In this third tour in Korea, ''Philippine Sea'' focused primarily on [[interdiction]] attacks against rail and communication lines in North Korea, hoping to limit supplies to the front lines. The North Korean offensive, begun at the same time truce talks began at [[Panmunjom]], marked the beginning of a series of &quot;round the clock&quot; air sorties designed to weaken North Korean and Chinese front line troops and support UN troops when under attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar342&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mission continued until an armistice was signed in the summer of 1953, resulting in the ''[[de jure]]'' cessation of open warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;/&gt;

===Post-Korea===
Following the end of her tour in Korea, the ship arrived in [[Alameda Naval Air Station]] in [[Alameda, California]] on 14 August 1953 to offload Air Group 9, then entered drydock at [[Hunters Point Drydocks|Hunters Point]] in San Francisco for overhaul. On 9 January 1954, ''Philippine Sea'' once more began training off the coast of San Diego. She then steamed west on 12 March, for her fourth tour in the Far East. She operated out of [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] near [[Olongapo]], [[The Philippines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;/&gt; She was part of Carrier Division 3 and operated alongside {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|2}} around [[French Indochina]].

''Philippine Sea'' moored alongside {{USS|Bennington|CVA-20|2}} and {{USS|Shangri La|CV-38|2}}. As an anti-submarine carrier, her complement consists of numerous [[helicopter]]s.]]
The most significant event of the tour occurred in late July 1954. Chinese airplanes had [[1954 Cathay Pacific Douglas DC-4 shootdown|shot down]] a [[Douglas DC-4]] passenger aircraft operated by [[Cathay Pacific|Cathay Pacific Airways]] near [[Hainan]] Island off the Chinese coast. The Chinese military had believed it to be a Taiwanese military airplane. ''Philippine Sea'' was ordered into the area as part of a search mission to recover some of the 19 on board.&lt;ref name=StJohn27&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While engaged in the search mission, a flight of the ship's [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD Skyraiders]] was attacked by two Chinese fighter aircraft. The Skyraiders returned fire and shot down the airplanes. Later this came to be known unofficially as the &quot;Hainan Incident&quot;.&lt;ref name=StJohn28&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this duty, the ship sailed for Hawaii, where she was used as a prop in the movie ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]''. The ship returned to San Diego in November. Remaining in the area for four months, ''Philippine Sea'' conducted several training operations off the California coast. She then began her fifth cruise of the Far East on 1 April 1955 ''en route'' to Yokosuka. She operated in waters of Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan for most of 1955, with Air Task Group 2 consisting of [[VF-123]], [[VF-143]] and [[VA-55]], VF-123 flying the F9F-2 Panther jet fighter-bomber, VF-143 flying the [[Grumman F-9 Cougar|Grumman F9F-6 Cougar]] jet fighter, and VA-55 flying the AD-6 Skyraider propellor attack bomber. During this time, she made trips to Hong Kong, [[Keelung]] and [[Formosa]]. On 23 November, she was redesignated as a '''CVS''', or an [[anti-submarine warfare carrier]]. Her aircraft complement was replaced with several dozen [[S2F Tracker]] anti-submarine aircraft and [[HSS-1 Seabat]] helicopters. She returned to San Diego on 23 November 1955. Throughout 1956 she saw little activity as crew went on leave and she was docked for upkeep, and only conducted several routine training operations off the coast of [[southern California]]. In late 1956 she moved to Hawaii for more training operations.&lt;ref name=StJohn28/&gt;

In March 1957, she sailed for the western Pacific on a sixth tour to the area with the HSS-1s and S2Fs of [[VS-21]], [[VS-23]], and [[VS-37]].&lt;ref name=StJohn28/&gt; She was there for two months before returning to San Diego and resuming training missions off the west coast in summer 1957. In November 1957, she found some debris of [[Pan Am Flight 7]], an airline flight that disappeared en route to Hawaii. In January 1958, she steamed west on her last 7th Fleet deployment. Remaining six months, she returned to San Diego on 15 July and commenced inactivation.&lt;ref name=StJohn29&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] 28 December 1958&lt;ref name=StJohn2&gt;{{harvnb|St. John|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and berthed with the [[United States Reserve Fleet]] at [[Long Beach, California]]. She was redesignated '''AVT-11''', an [[List of auxiliaries of the United States Navy#Aircraft Transports (AVT)|auxiliary aircraft transport and landing training ship]], on 15 May 1959. After 10 years docked at the reserve fleet, she was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Registry]] on 1 December 1969&lt;ref name=&quot;CV47&quot;/&gt; and sold for scrapping on 23 March 1971&lt;ref name=StJohn2/&gt; to [[Zidell Explorations Corporation]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=StJohn29/&gt;

''Philippine Sea'' received nine [[battle star]]s for Korean War service. During her career, she logged 82,000 launches, including 33,575 catapult shots, and 82,813 landings. In April 1987, a new {{USS|Philippine Sea|CG-58}} was launched, a [[Ticonderoga-class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class guided missile cruiser]]. An organization was also formed of veterans who had served aboard the ship, the ''Philippine Sea'' Association.&lt;ref name=StJohn2/&gt;
