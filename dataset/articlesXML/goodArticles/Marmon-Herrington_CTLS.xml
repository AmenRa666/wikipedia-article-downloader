The '''[[Marmon-Herrington]] Combat Tank Light Series''' were a series of [[United States|U.S.]] [[light tank]]s/[[tankette]]s that were produced for the export market at the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The CTL-3 had a crew of two and was armed with two .30&amp;nbsp;cal (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm) [[M1919 machine gun]]s and one .50 cal (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]. They were originally designed to be amphibious light tanks. They were rejected by the [[U.S. Marines|Marines]] in 1939, but after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] they were exported and used as an emergency light tank.

It primarily served in [[Aleutian Islands campaign|Alaska]] and the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Dutch East Indies]], while small numbers were used in the U.S. as guard tanks stationed along the U.S. coast. A total of about 700 examples were produced, and although it was declared obsolete by the Allies in 1943, it was used by the newly created Indonesian Army after the end of the Second World War, remaining in Indonesian service until 1949.

==Design and development==
In the mid-1930s, the [[U.S. Marine]]s required a light tank that could be used in [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]]. After trials with [[J. Walter Christie|Christie]] amphibious tanks, [[Marmon Herrington]] produced a light, turretless tank with a {{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[M2 machine gun]] and two .30&amp;nbsp;cal (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm) [[M1919 machine gun]]s. This was the first light tank to meet USMC standards when it was designed.&lt;ref name=Zaloga/&gt; With a crew of two, consisting of the driver and gunner,&lt;ref name=Marines/&gt; and protected by up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) of [[vehicle armour|armor]], it was named the Combat Tank Light 3 (CTL-3). All three machine guns were mounted on ball mounts on the front [[chassis|hull]].&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt/&gt;

Fitted with [[Bogie|bogie leaf suspension]], the tank was {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} long, with a height of {{convert|6|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}. It weighed {{convert|4300|kg|ST|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and was powered by a Lincoln V-12, Hercules 6-cylinder [[petrol|gasoline]] engine, providing {{convert|120|hp|abbr=on}}. It was capable of speeds of up to {{convert|33|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and had a range of {{convert|125|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Marines/&gt; Five prototypes were produced in 1936 to be tested. Five more were produced in 1939. Tests continued until 1940,&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt/&gt; after which the Marine Corps deemed it obsolete because of the goals to make it amphibious which left it with fragile tracks and weak armor.&lt;ref name=Zaloga/&gt; The Marine Corps thus relegated it to training use only.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt/&gt;

==Service history==

===American use===
A small number were used by the US Marine Corps' 1st Tank and 1st Scout Companies prior to the war. Some were employed on Western [[Samoa]]. None of those tanks saw action. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the Ordnance Committee determined that a few CTLS-4TAC and 4TAYs would be dispersed to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and employed in the [[Aleutian Islands campaign]]. Under Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM) 18526,&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt2/&gt; these examples were subsequently designated as the '''Light Tank T16''' and '''Light Tank T14''' respectively.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt&gt;Hunnicutt (1992), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign use ===
[[File:IWM-SE-5742-tank-Surabaya-194511.jpg|left|thumb||alt=A damaged Marmon-Herrington CTLS with an Indonesian soldier inspecting it|A damaged Marmon-Herrington CTLS in [[Surabaya]], 1945.]]
A total of 628 CTMS tanks were ordered by the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]]. Of these, a small number were delivered to Java, just in time to see combat in the [[Dutch East Indies campaign]] following the Japanese invasion in early 1942.&lt;ref name=Bradford/&gt; 600 CTLS-4TACs and 4TAYs were delivered to China under Lend-Lease after Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=Green161/&gt; After the war, the Indonesian Army is reported to have used several captured Dutch vehicles, with the type remaining in Indonesian service until 1949 amidst the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Bradford/&gt;

==Variants==
[[File:Marmon-Herrington CTLS-3 testing.jpg|thumb|right|A CTL-3 being tested by the U.S. Marines.]]
*'''CTL-1''' – Designed by Marmon-Herrington to be shipped to the [[Polish Army]], but it was rejected by them. Only one was ever produced.&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;Zaloga (2012), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''CTL-2''' – A CTL-1 with slightly thicker armor.&lt;ref name=Zaloga/&gt;
*'''CTL-3''' – A [[tankette]], fitted with one 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm (.50 cal) M2 Browning machine gun and two .30&amp;nbsp;cal (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) M1919 machine guns. It was only a prototype. Five were produced in 1936, while another five were produced in 1939. All of them were upgraded to CTL-3M standard in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga&quot; /&gt;  Two tank platoons were assigned the CTL-3. All of the vehicles were scrapped in 1943.&lt;ref name=Marines&gt;Estes (2012), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green (2014), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''CTL-3A''' – An improved version of the CTL-3. The only difference was improved suspension.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;
*'''CTL-3M''' – An improved version of the CTL-3. All of the CTL-3s were upgraded to this standard in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga&quot; /&gt;
*'''CTL-3TBD''' – An upgraded version of the CTL-3, although the only differences were improved tracks, suspension and the addition of an M2 machine gun. The two M2 machine guns were mounted in a turret. Only five were produced and all of them were scrapped in Samoa in 1943.&lt;ref name=Marines/&gt;
*'''CTLS-4TAC''' – Designed for export under [[Lend-Lease]], a total of 420 were produced, originally intended for [[Chinese Army|China]]. Six hundred 4TACs and 4TAYs were sent to China after Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=Green161/&gt; The remaining 240 were dispersed for emergency situations, like in [[Aleutian islands campaign|Alaska]]. The armor was doubled and the armament consisted of three 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm (.30 cal) machine guns, one of which was mounted in a 240° traverse, hand-cranked turret. Under OCM 18526, the CTLS-4TAC was labeled Light Tank T16. All vehicles were scrapped in 1943.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt2&gt;Hunnicutt (1992), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''CTLS-4TAY''' – A CTLS-4TAC with the driver and the turret sitting on the left side of the hull. 420 were produced.&lt;ref name=Green161&gt;Green (2014), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''CTL-6''' – The CTL-6 was an improved version of the CTL-3. The only differences were better tracks and suspension. Only 20 were produced. They served in two tank platoons, which were sent to Samoa. All of them were scrapped there in 1943.&lt;ref name=Marines/&gt;

== Branching projects ==
Two other tank designs were produced by Marmon-Herrington that branched directly from the CTLS. They were both intended to be shipped to the Dutch, but were overtaken by the [[Ordnance Department]].&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt217/&gt;

===CTMS-1TB1===
The CTMS-1TB1 project was started in 1941 to produce a three-man light tank for the [[Dutch Army]]. It was armed with a {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} automatic cannon and coaxial M1919 machine gun. They originally meant to send 600 of them to the Dutch East Indies campaign to aid the Dutch.&lt;ref name=Bradford&gt;Bradford (2009), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaign ended too early for prototypes to be sent. The project was then taken over by the Ordnance Department and was tested at [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]] in early 1943. Other, more robust light tanks were being produced at the time, and there was no need for stop-gap solutions so the prototypes were rejected for U.S. use in May 1943.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt217&gt;Hunnicutt (1992), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MTLS-1G14===
The MTLS-1G14 project was started at the same time as the CTMS-1TB1 to produce a four-man [[medium tank]] for the Dutch Army. It was armed with two 1.5&amp;nbsp;in (37&amp;nbsp;mm) automatic cannons. It also was equipped with five M1919 machine guns, three of which were mounted on the hull, one mounted coaxially, and one mounted on the top of the turret. The armor was [[bolted]] and measured between {{convert|0.5|-|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The design was soon taken over by the Ordnance Department and was tested at Aberdeen in April 1943. It was rejected by the U.S Army because there were [[M4 Sherman|better medium tanks]] already in production.&lt;ref name=Hunnicutt218&gt;Hunnicutt (1992) pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt;
