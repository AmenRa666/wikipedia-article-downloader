'''HMS ''Cydnus''''' was one of eight [[Royal Navy]] 38-gun ''Cydnus''-class [[fifth-rate]]s. This [[Sailing frigate|frigate]] was built in 1813 at [[Blackwall Yard]], [[London]], and broken up in 1816.

==Design, construction and armament==
The entire class was a version of the [[Leda class frigate|''Leda''-class]] frigates, but built of red fir (pine), which was cheaper and more abundant than oak. Most importantly, it permitted noticeably faster construction, but at a cost of reduced durability.

To enable the new frigate to meet the American frigates on less unequal terms, ''Cydnus'', and her sister ''[[HMS Eurotas (1813)|Eurotas]]'' received medium 24-pounders and an increased complement of men. ''Cydnus''{{'}}s 24-pounders were of a design by General [[Sir Thomas Blomefield, 1st Baronet]] and measured 7&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. in length while  weighing about 40 cwt. The 24-pounders on ''Eurotas'' were to a design by Colonel [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet|Congreve]].

During December 1813 and January 1814, ''Cyndus'' and ''Eurotas'' actually temporarily exchanged six 24-pounders, presumably to enable both vessels to test the designs against each other. Ultimately, the [[Royal Navy]] adopted General Blomefield's design.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon &amp;  Winfield (2004), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==

''Cydnus'' was commissioned in May 1813 under Captain [[Frederick Whitworth Aylmer, 6th Baron Aylmer|Frederick W. Aylmer]], but command passed later that month to Captain Frederick Langford.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.186.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, ''[[HMS Briton (1812)|Briton]]'' captured the ''Wolf{{'}}s Cove'', while ''Cydnus'' and a squadron were in company.&lt;ref name=LG16956&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16956|startpage=2243|date=12 November 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The prize money for an ordinary seaman was 6[[shilling|s]] 11¼[[pence|d]].&lt;ref name=LG16956/&gt;|group=Note}}

On 8 January 1814, ''Cydnus'' recaptured the English ship ''Rachael and Ann'', of 14 guns, 226
tons. and 20 men. She had been sailing from Buenos Aires for London.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16884|startpage=794|date=12 April 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The prize money for an ordinary seaman was 9s 9¾d.&lt;ref name=LG16956/&gt;|group=Note}}

On 14 March 1814 ''Cydnus'' and ''[[French frigate Astrée (1809)|Pomone]]'' captured the American privateer ''Bunker's Hill'', of 14 guns and 86 men. Though ''Bunker{{'}}s Hill'' had been known for her past successes, on this cruise she was eight days out of [[Morlaix]] without having captured anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16874|startpage=651|date=26 March 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The prize money for an ordinary seaman was 16s 6¾d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17015|startpage=976|date=23 May 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Bunker{{'}}s Hill'' was the former Royal Navy cutter {{HMS|Linnet|1806|2}}, which the [[French frigate Gloire (1803)|French frigate ''Gloire'']] had taken on 25 February 1813 near [[Madeira]].&lt;ref&gt;Winfield (2008), p.370.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cydnus'' carried out convoy duties to the [[East Indies]] in 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-383106&quot;/&gt;

''Cydnus'' served in the operations against [[New Orleans]] in 1814. Her boats participated in the British victory at the [[Battle of Lake Borgne]]. On 8 December 1814, two US gunboats fired on {{HMS|Sophie|1809|2}}, {{HMS|Armide|1806|2}} and the [[sixth-rate]] frigate {{HMS|Seahorse|1794|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Index of 19th Century Naval Vessels and a few of their movements - HMS Seahorse |url=http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/L/04185.html |work=P. Benyon |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while they were passing the chain of small islands that runs parallel to the shore between Mobile and [[Lake Borgne]].&lt;ref name=LG16991&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16991|date=9 March 1815|startpage=446|endpage=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Battle of Lake Borgne}}

Between 12 and 15 December 1814, Captain Lockyer of ''Sophie'' led a flotilla of some 50 boats, barges, gigs and launches to attack the US gunboats.  Lockyer drew his flotilla from the fleet that was massing against New Orleans, including the 74-gun [[Third-rate|Third Rate]] {{HMS|Tonnant|1798|2}}, '' Armide'', ''Cydnus'', ''Seahorse'', {{HMS|Manly|1812|2}} and ''[[HMS Starr (1805)|Meteor]]''.

Lockyer deployed the boats in three divisions, of which he led one.  Captain Montresor  of the gun-brig ''Manly'' commanded the second, and Captain Roberts of ''Meteor'' commanded the third.&lt;ref name=LG16991/&gt; After rowing for 36 hours, the British met the Americans at St. Joseph's Island.&lt;ref name=LG16991/&gt; On 13 December 1814, the British [[Action of 13 December 1814 (Louisiana Campaign)|attacked]] the one-gun schooner [[USS Sea Horse (1812)|USS ''Sea Horse'']]. On the morning of the 14th, the British engaged the Americans in a short, violent battle.

The British captured or destroyed almost the entire American force, including the tender, [[USS Alligator (1813)|USS ''Alligator'']], and five gunboats. The British lost 17 men killed and 77 wounded; ''Cydnus'' had four men wounded. {{HMS|Anaconda|1813|2}} then evacuated the wounded. In 1821 the survivors of the flotilla shared in the distribution of head-money arising from the capture of the American gun-boats and sundry bales of cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17719|date=26 June 1821|startpage=1353|endpage=1354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| A first-class share of the prize money was worth [[£sd|£]]34 12s 9¼d; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 7s 10¾d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|startpage=1561|issue=17730|date=28 July 1821}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]] with clasp &quot;14 Dec Boat Service 1814&quot; to all surviving claimants from the action.

On 18 January 1815, Captain the Honourable [[William Henry Percy]] faced a court martial on board ''Cydnus'', off [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island, Mississippi]] for the loss of his vessel, ''[[HMS Hermes (1811)|Hermes]]'', during his unsuccessful attack at the [[Battle of Fort Bowyer]] in September 1814. The court acquitted him of all blame, finding that the attack was justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall |first=John |title=Royal Naval Biography |year=1823 |volume=3 |page=69 |publisher= Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green  |location=London  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI8AAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langford died early in 1815 at Jamaica.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-383106&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_v.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 383106|work=Warship Histories, vol v|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Alexander Cochrane]] appointed Captain [[Robert Cavendish Spencer]], of the sloop ''[[HMS Carron (1813)|Carron]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0463 - HMS Carron |url=http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/L/04185.html |work=Patrick Marioné and Michael Phillips |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to command ''Cydnus'' in 1815,&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; for his efforts in Louisiana and Florida.  Spencer then spent a month camped at [[Negro Fort|Prospect Bluff]] on the [[Apalachicola River]] with Britain's Indian allies, charged with settling their claims and dismissing them from British service.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annual Biography and Obituary of 1831''. (London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landers, p125&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently he left them with some cannons as well.&lt;ref&gt;Monette (1846), p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Nicolls]] received orders to withdraw his troops from the fort at Prospect Bluff.&lt;ref&gt;Covington, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Spencer to Cochrane dated 17 February 1816 does mention that the Indian Chiefs were 'obeying Brevet Major Nicolls' orders until 22 April [1815]' UK National Archives reference WO 1/144 folio 133&lt;/ref&gt;
In accordance with Cochrane's orders, the ''Cydnus'' was moored off [[Negro Fort|Prospect Bluff]],&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Vice Admiral Cochrane to Rear Admiral Malcolm dated 17 February 1815. This is within WO 1/143 folio 37, which can be downloaded for a fee from the [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C2488982 UK National Archives website].&lt;/ref&gt; and embarked the Royal Marine detachment on 22 April, arriving at Bermuda on 13 June 1815, to allow the detachment to rejoin the [[Royal Marines Battalions (Napoleonic Wars)|3rd Battalion]] as a supernumerary company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonandhisworld.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=1569&amp;sid=5a4ef12603261b952d183b69e7c2289e|title=Royal Marines on the Gulf Coast|accessdate=19 January 2014|quote=Extracted information from the log of HMS Cydnus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;3rd Battalion Royal Marines muster/pay Lists Jan to Oct 1815  ADM 96/471&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter ''Cydnus'' salied to Halifax, arriving on 24 June 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Index of 19th Century Naval Vessels and a few of their movements |url=http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/C/01240a.html |work=P.

==Fate==

The ''Cydnus'' was then paid off. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] had ended and as she was not durable, she was broken up at [[Portsmouth]] in February 1816.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

''Cydnus'' was among the ships and vessels under the command of-Admiral Lord Viscount [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Keith]] entitled to share in the Parliamentary grant for service in 1813 and 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17441|startpage=112|date=16 January 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt;
