'''No. 100 Squadron''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) bomber and maritime patrol squadron that operated during World War II. Raised in early 1942 from the remnants of a British unit that had been destroyed in Malaya, the squadron flew [[Bristol Beaufort]]s from bases in Queensland and New Guinea, undertaking torpedo- and level-bombing [[sortie]]s against Japanese targets in the [[Pacific theatre of World War II|Pacific theatre]]. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the squadron was disbanded in August 1946.

==History==

No. 100 Squadron was formed at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, on 15 February 1942;&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; the following month Wing Commander [[John Balmer]] took command of the squadron.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|pp=552–553}} The squadron was formed from a nucleus of [[No. 100 Squadron RAF]], which had been destroyed during the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan Campaign]], and was named in that unit's honour.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/100sqn.htm |title=No. 100 Squadron RAAF |work=RAAF Museum |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this link, No. 100 Squadron RAAF was an Australian squadron throughout its existence and considered to be separate from its British namesake, which was re-formed as a heavy bomber squadron in Britain on 15 December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/100squadron.cfm |title=100 Squadron RAF |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%201558.html |title=No. 100 Squadron |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |date=28 October 1955 |pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;673–676, 678}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit subsequently moved to [[Mareeba, Queensland]], in May 1942, before conducting further training and anti-submarine patrols.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=101}} 

Staging through [[Port Moresby]], No. 100 Squadron flew its first combat missions in June 1942, making it the first of the RAAF's Beaufort bomber-equipped squadrons to see combat.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; During the mission seven aircraft bombed targets around Lae, losing one aircraft whilst sinking a Japanese merchant ship. Later a number of successful attacks were completed against Japanese positions.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=101}} Following these attacks the squadron was withdrawn to [[Laverton, Victoria|Laverton]] in July, subsequently conducting patrols off [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and undertaking further training.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=100}} A further move was later undertaken to [[Bohle River]] in Queensland.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=101}} Meanwhile, after completing its training the squadron commenced deploying to [[Milne Bay]] in [[New Guinea]] in September 1942.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;{{sfn|Odgers|1968|p=23}}

In October 1942, while participating in a training exercise off the coast of [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Beaufort A9-26 of the No. 100 Squadron struck the mast of the wrecked [[SS City of Adelaide (1863)|SS ''City of Adelaide'']] in [[Cockle Bay, Queensland|Cockle Bay]], [[Magnetic Island]]. The aircraft plunged into the shallow water below and the fuselage disintegrated on impact killing three RAAF officers and one US Navy officer aboard.{{sfn|King|2008|p=63}} On 6 October 1942 the Squadron conducted its first torpedo strike, with six Beauforts unsuccessfully targeting Japanese naval vessels.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=101}} Over the following months the squadron conducted a number of dangerous low-level attacks with limited success, although a number of Japanese vessels were damaged or sunk.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=101}} On 9 January 1943 a convoy returning from Lae was intercepted by six Beauforts off [[Gasmata]]. A Japanese cruiser was believed sunk in the action, for the loss of two aircraft.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=235}}{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=101}}

Flying from bases in eastern New Guinea No. 100 Squadron flew reconnaissance patrols and anti-shipping and bombing missions against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea mainland.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Eight aircraft from the squadron participated in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], during which the squadron conducted a torpedo-bombing mission. It was not successful in sinking any ships in this battle, though, and from March 1943 it operated solely in the level bombing role.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Later, in September 1943, the squadron flew anti-submarine patrols in support of [[Landing at Lae|amphibious landings around Lae]].{{sfn|Odgers|1968|p=73}} On 4 October, ten Beauforts made a low-level attack on the Japanese airfield at Gasmata, with three aircraft being shot down.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=101}} A surfaced submarine was attacked and heavily damaged in [[St George's Channel]] on 18 October.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=236}} The squadron bombed a bridge over the Anwek River in November as part of an air offensive over New Britain and the same month moved to [[Goodenough Island]].{{sfn|Odgers|1968|p=123}} 

The squadron remained at Goodenough Island until April 1944, when it relocated to [[Nadzab]]. This was followed by a further move to [[Tadji, Papua New Guinea|Tadji]] in July 1944.{{sfn|King|2008|pp=149, 170}} As a level bomber squadron, No. 100 Squadron conducted missions against Japanese facilities throughout New Guinea and surrounding islands during 1944, including the key base at [[Rabaul]].{{sfn|Odgers|1968|p=329}} In late 1944 and into 1945, it conducted operations in support of Allied ground operations. In October 1944, a detachment of five aircraft and crews from No. 100 Squadron being sent to reinforce [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No. 6 Squadron]], which had been tasked to support Australian landings on [[New Britain Campaign|New Britain]]. Prior to the landings, the Beauforts attacked targets across the Gazelle Peninsula, and then remained on standby to support the troops coming ashore around Jacquinot Bay. Later, further operations were flown around Wide Bay.{{sfn|King|2008|pp=198–200}} The squadron's attention then turned to support of the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]]'s campaign in [[Aitape-Wewak campaign|Aitape–Wewak]].{{sfn|Odgers|1968|pp=330, 337}} The squadron continued in this role until the last day of the war, flying its final bombing mission the morning Japan surrendered, on 15 August 1945.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=102}}

Following the end of hostilities, No. 100 Squadron flew reconnaissance missions and leaflet drops before transferring to [[Finschafen]] in March 1946.{{sfn|King|2008|p=265}} There it undertook ferrying and courier flights until disbanding on 19 August 1946;{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=102}} prior to this, the squadron's strength had dwindled as personnel were repatriated back to Australia for demobilisation or transferred to other units for subsequent service with the occupation forces in Japan.{{sfn|King|2008|p=264}} Throughout the war a total of 115 aircrew fatailities were recorded among the squadron's personnel as a result of combat operations.{{sfn|King|2008|p=257}}
