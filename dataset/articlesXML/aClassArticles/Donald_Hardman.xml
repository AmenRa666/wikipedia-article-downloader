[[Air Chief Marshal]] '''Sir James Donald Innes Hardman''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|sep=,|GBE|KCB|DFC}} (21 December 1899&amp;nbsp;– 2 March 1982), known as '''Donald Hardman''', was a senior [[Royal Air Force]] commander. He began his flying career as a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot in World War&amp;nbsp;I, achieving nine victories to become an [[Flying ace|ace]]. During World War&amp;nbsp;II, Hardman held senior staff and operational posts. He was [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) from 1952 to 1954, after which he served as a member of the British [[Air Council]] until retiring in 1958.

Born in [[Lancashire]], Hardman joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in 1917 and was posted to France the following year.  He flew [[Sopwith Dolphin]]s with [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;19 Squadron]], earning the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his fighting skills. Between the wars he served with [[No. 31 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;31 Squadron]] in India and [[No. 216 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;216 Squadron]] in Egypt. A [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] at the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, Hardman was attached to the [[Air Ministry]] for several years before being posted in 1944 to [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South East Asia]], where he commanded No.&amp;nbsp;232 (Transport) Group during the [[Burma campaign]]. He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1940 and a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1945, and was also [[mentioned in despatches]].

Finishing the war an [[air commodore]], Hardman was Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, Commandant of [[RAF Staff College, Bracknell]], and Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of [[RAF Home Command|Home Command]], prior to becoming RAAF CAS in January 1952. He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] the same year.  As CAS he was responsible for reorganising the RAAF's [[RAAF area commands|geographically based command-and-control system]] into a functional structure.  Returning to Britain, he became [[Air Member for Supply and Organisation]] in May 1954, and was promoted to [[air chief marshal]] the following year. He was raised to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] in January 1958, shortly before his retirement.

Born on 21 December 1899 in [[Oldham, Lancashire]], James Donald Innes Hardman was the son of a master cotton-spinner, also named James, and his wife Wilhelmina. The younger James, known as Donald, was educated at [[Malvern College]].&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=John|title=Hardman, Sir James Donald Innes (1899–1982)|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|url= http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hardman-sir-james-donald-innes-12591/text22677|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fliers&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 113–115&lt;/ref&gt; He began his military career in 1916 as a seventeen-year-old [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[Artists Rifles]]—part of the [[London Regiment]]—and joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) early the following year.&lt;ref name=Chiefs&gt;Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'', pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franks&gt;Franks, ''Dolphin and Snipe Aces'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Hardman was commissioned a temporary [[second lieutenant]] on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1917 and confirmed in his rank on 21&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30100|supp=yes|startpage=5309|date=29 May 1917|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1917/1917%20-%200899.html|title=Royal Flying Corps (Military Wing)|magazine=[[Flight International|Flight]] |date=30 August 1917|page=899|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevented initially from seeing combat because of his youth, Hardman was eventually posted to [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;19 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in February 1918, just as the unit was completing its conversion from [[SPAD S.VII]]s to [[Sopwith Dolphin]]s.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Franks/&gt; He achieved his first aerial victory in May 1918.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; On 28&amp;nbsp;September, Hardman was promoted from [[lieutenant]] to temporary [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]], and appointed one of No.&amp;nbsp;19 Squadron's [[flight commander]]s.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30953|startpage=12126|date=15 October 1918|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored two &quot;kills&quot; in one [[sortie]] on 30&amp;nbsp;October 1918, when he led twelve Dolphins escorting [[Airco DH.9|DH.9]] bombers of [[No. 98 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;98 Squadron]] to [[Mons]]; in a dogfight that resulted in the loss of ten British aircraft, Hardman shot down two German [[Fokker D.VII]]s in flames.&lt;ref name=Franks/&gt; His &quot;cool judgment and skill in leading&quot; during this action earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]; the award was promulgated on 11 February 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|city=e|issue=13400|startpage=798|date=11 February 1919|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardman's final wartime tally was nine aerial victories.&lt;ref name=Fliers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Franks/&gt; The life expectancy for even an experienced RFC pilot on the Western Front was as little as three weeks;&lt;ref name=Brent&gt;Brent, ''A Century of Military Aviation'', pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''The Dream of Civilized Warfare'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; years later Hardman admitted that he was still surprised he had survived.&lt;ref name=Brent/&gt;

|quote=On first meeting the then Air Commodore in his headquarters in Comilla one was immediately aware of an exceptionally dignified bearing, a considerable presence, great humour; there was much leg-pulling and light-hearted banter, the whole atmosphere was very much at ease. Yet one also obtained a remarkably strong impression of &quot;No nonsense&quot;; it was made quite clear that there was a tough job ahead.

Hardman was promoted to acting [[air vice marshal]] on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37336|supp=yes|startpage=5385|date=2 November 1945|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He remained in South-East Asia following the cessation of hostilities, taking over as Air Officer in Charge of Administration for ACSEA (later Air Command Far East) in January 1946.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times1947/&gt; After his return to Britain he was appointed to several senior posts in the RAF including, successively, Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Operations) in May 1947, Commandant of [[RAF Staff College, Bracknell]], in January 1949, and Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of [[RAF Home Command|Home Command]] in September 1951.&lt;ref name=Times1947/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News in brief|work=The Times |date= 2 April 1955|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardman's wartime rank of air commodore became substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37758|supp=yes|startpage=5080|date=11 October 1946|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was followed by substantive promotion to air vice marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38344|supp=yes|startpage=3895|date=2 July 1948|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised to acting [[air marshal]] on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39520|supp=yes|startpage=2169|date=18 April 1952|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 1952, Hardman was appointed [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), succeeding Air Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], who had served ten years in the position.&lt;ref name=Solo499&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The decision by Australia's [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Robert Menzies]], to appoint an RAF officer caused resentment in the RAAF. This was compounded when Menzies stated his reason as being that there was &quot;no RAAF officer of sufficient age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff&quot;, which appeared to ignore the wartime records of such figures as [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]] and [[Frederick Scherger]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Mirror (Australia)|The Daily Mirror]]'' in [[Sydney]] was one of several media outlets to voice a &quot;stern protest&quot; over the matter. Menzies also felt that he could justify the appointment of an outsider on the grounds that the RAAF's [[RAAF area commands|geographically based command-and-control system]] needed reorganisation along functional lines, a system with which a senior RAF member would be familiar. Britain's CAS, Marshal of the Royal Air Force [[John Slessor|Sir John Slessor]], was, somewhat reluctantly, responsible for fulfilling the Australian Government's request for a suitable officer. In putting forward Hardman as the &quot;outstanding candidate&quot; for the Australian post, Slessor tried to avoid what he called &quot;the follies of some years ago&quot;, referring to Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]]'s controversial tenure as CAS on secondment from the RAF early in World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=Solo73-74&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardman made two major changes to the structure of the Air Force to streamline command and control: integrating RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]],  with the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]], and supplanting the geographical area commands with three functional organisations, namely [[RAAF Home Command|Home]] (operational), [[RAAF Training Command|Training]], and [[RAAF Maintenance Command|Maintenance Commands]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; The functional command system has been described by historian Alan Stephens as Hardman's &quot;major legacy to the RAAF&quot;.&lt;ref name=Solo73-74/&gt; While doing away with the area command structure that had been favoured by Jones, Hardman carried on his predecessor's support for the local aircraft industry.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; He also formed a policy agreement with the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of the Naval Staff]], Vice Admiral [[John Augustine Collins|Sir John Collins]], covering joint responsibility and cooperation for maritime warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; During Hardman's term as CAS, [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 (Fighter) Wing]] was re-equipped with RAF [[de&amp;nbsp;Havilland Vampire]] jet fighters to garrison Malta and support British operations in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] promulgated on 5&amp;nbsp;June 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39555|supp=yes|startpage=3009|date=30 May 1952|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised to substantive air marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39586|supp=yes|startpage=3581|date=27 June 1952|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a protege of Slessor, Hardman proclaimed: &quot;An air force without bombers isn't an air force&quot;. He maintained that the only way to attain &quot;true and enduring air superiority&quot; was by attacking the enemy's vital centres, which included its means of producing fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 38, 362&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended that the RAAF purchase one of Britain's &quot;[[V bomber]]s&quot;—the [[Vickers Valiant]], [[Handley Page Victor]], or [[Avro Vulcan]]—though this never eventuated, and Australia's jet bomber remained the [[English Electric Canberra]] until the long-delayed introduction of the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his tenure as CAS, Hardman gave an interview in which he criticised [[Australian Army|Army]] and [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]] operations against a backdrop of continuing interservice rivalry for the defence budget.&lt;ref name=Dennis&gt;Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted as saying: &quot;The Air Force in this country, for either defence or offence, is the only force worth while. It can be sent anywhere in the world to the point where it can do most good and be rapidly switched to any other point.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article134472622 |title=Defence chief's blast |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |date=16 February 1954 |accessdate=16 June 2015 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the initial disquiet at his appointment, upon his departure from Australia Hardman was described by ''[[The Age]]'' as &quot;the outstanding CAS in the RAAF's history&quot;, a &quot;brilliant organiser&quot;, and a &quot;master of the theory of air power&quot;.&lt;ref name=Solo73-74/&gt; He was succeeded by Air Marshal McCauley on 18&amp;nbsp;January 1954.&lt;ref name=Solo499/&gt;

Hardman returned to Britain on the [[SS Himalaya|SS ''Himalaya'']], and joined the British [[Air Council]] as [[Air Member for Supply and Organisation]] on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1954, succeeding Air Chief Marshal [[John Whitworth-Jones|Sir John Whitworth-Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40163|supp=yes|startpage=2618|date=4 May 1954|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, he represented the Air Council at No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing's farewell parade in Malta, reminding the personnel gathered that he had been present at the wing's march through Sydney in July 1952, prior to its departure for the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1954/1954%20-%203270.html|title=No. 78 Wing returns home|magazine=Flight |date=10 December 1954|page=847|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[air chief marshal]] on 1&amp;nbsp;April 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40442|supp=yes|startpage=1929|date=1 April 1955|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1956, he presented a Squadron Standard to his old unit, No.&amp;nbsp;19 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%200990.html|title=No. 19 Sqn Standard|magazine=Flight |date=20 July 1956|page=136|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That October, he presided over the inquiry into the [[Avro Vulcan#Accidents and incidents|fatal crash]] of Vulcan ''[[1956 London Heathrow Avro Vulcan crash|XA897]]'' at [[Heathrow Airport]] after its maiden round-the-world flight, the only survivors of the six crew members being the pilot and Air Marshal [[Harry Broadhurst|Sir Harry Broadhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, ''Vulcan'', pp. 96–98&lt;/ref&gt; Hardman was succeeded as Air Member for Supply and Organisation by Air Chief Marshal [[Walter Dawson (RAF officer)|Sir Walter Dawson]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1958, and was raised to [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41266|supp=yes|startpage=7593|date=31 December 1957|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the RAF on 29&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41268|supp=yes|startpage=9|date=1 January 1958|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
