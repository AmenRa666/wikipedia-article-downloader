The '''320th Missile Squadron''' is a [[United States Air Force]] unit.  It is assigned to the [[90th Operations Group]], stationed at [[F.E. Warren AFB]], Wyoming.   The 320 MS is equipped with the [[LGM-30G Minuteman III]] [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM), with a mission of nuclear deterrence.

==History==
===World War II===
{{Commons category-inline|90th Bombardment Group (United States Army Air Forces)|90th Bombardment Group}}

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first organized as the '''320th Bombardment Squadron''' at [[Key Field]], Mississippi in April 1942 as a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] unit and one of the original squadrons of the [[90th Bombardment Group]].  The squadron trained with Liberators in the southeastern United States under [[III Bomber Command]] until August.&lt;ref name=90OGfacts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9836 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 90 Operations Group (AFSPC)|date=May 27, 2010|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=320MSfacts/&gt;

[[File:90th Bomb Group B-24s - 1943.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Jolly Rogers&quot; of the 90th Bombardment Group on a mission, 1943]]
[[File:90th Bomb Group B-24J 1944.jpg|thumb|left|B-24J with the distinct nose turret, probably in 1944.]]
The squadron moved to [[Willow Run Airport]], Michigan for conversion training on newly manufactured Ford Liberators. Assigned to [[VII Bomber Command]] with B-24Ds, the unit moved to [[Hickam Field]], Hawaii in September.  The squadron arrived in northern [[Queensland]], Australia in November 1942 and began bombardment missions under [[V Bomber Command]] almost immediately.&lt;ref name=90OGfacts/&gt;

The squadron attacked enemy [[airfield]]s, troop concentrations, ground installations and shipping in New Guinea, the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Palau]] and the southern Philippines. The 3209th was awarded a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] for its operations in Papua through January 1943. The unit participated in the [[Battle of Bismarck Sea]] in March 1943, and earned another citation for strikes on enemy airfields at [[Wewak]], New Guinea in September 1943 despite heavy [[flak]] and [[fighter Aircraft|fighter]] opposition.&lt;ref name=90OGfacts/&gt;

During 1944, the 320th supported the New Guinea Campaign through the end of June, then made long-range raids on oil refineries at [[Balikpapan]], Borneo, in September and October.  In January 1945, the squadron moved to the Philippines and supported ground forces on [[Luzon]], attacked industrial targets on [[Formosa]], and bombed railways, airfields, and harbor facilities on the Asiatic mainland.  Shortly before the end of the war in the Pacific, the 90th moved to [[Okinawa]], from which it would be able to strike the Japanese home islands.&lt;ref name=90OGfacts/&gt;

After [[VJ Day]], the squadron flew [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] missions over Japan and ferried Allied prisoners of war from [[Okinawa]] to [[Manila]].  It ceased operations by November 1945. The squadron was inactivated in the Philippines in early 1946.&lt;ref name=320MSfacts/&gt;

===Superfortress operations===
{{Main|90th Bombardment Wing}}
The squadron was reactivated in July 1947 as a very heavy unit at [[Andrews Field]], Maryland.  It was a component of one of seven bombardment groups activated at Andrews by [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) that day.  Most of these units, including the 320th, were inactivated by September 1948 and it does not appear they were manned during this period.&lt;ref name=320MSfacts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 102, 176, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:90th Bombardment Wing Boeing B-29-100-BW Superfortress 45-21846 1948.jpg|thumb|Wing Boeing B-29&lt;ref group=note&gt;Aircraft is Boeing B-29-100-BW Superfortress serial 45-21846&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The squadron was again organized at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington in January 1951 and equipped with the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]].  In February, as part of a reorganization of [[Strategic Air Command]] wings, the 90th Bombardment Group was reduced to paper status and the squadron was attached to the wing for operational control.  In June 1952, this organization, which was designed to permit the wing commander to focus on the wing's combat units and the maintenance necessary to support combat aircraft, was formalized as the Dual Deputy Organization and the squadron was assigned to the wing.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=90MWfacts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=14782 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 90 Missile Wing (AFGSC)|date=April 6, 2012|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deaile, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1951, the squadron moved to [[Forbes Air Force Base]], where it served primarily as a training unit.  In May, it began serving as an Operational Training Unit for B-29 [[aircrew]]s and mechanics of newly-activating units.  The squadron help organize and train the [[376th Bombardment Wing|376th]], [[308th Bombardment Wing|308th]], and [[310th Bombardment Wing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstein, pp. 200–202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9893 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 308 Armament Systems Wing (AFMC)|date=August 27, 2015|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=17678 |last1=Kane|first1=Robert B.|title=Factsheet 310 Space Wing (AFRC)|date=December 23, 2010|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, the squadron added duty as a Replacement Training Unit, primarily providing individual training for aircrew being assigned to existing [[Far East Air Forces]] B-29 units during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/452/106.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 90 Bombardment Wing|date=1 October 1951|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Replacement Training Units trained individuals to fill positions in existing units. ''See'' Goss, p. xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;  In November of 1952 it also began training replacement crews for the RB-29 [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] model of the Superfortress and [[SHORAN]] personnel for [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).  These training activities continued through November 1953.&lt;ref name=90MWfacts/&gt;

===Strategic reconnaissance===
[[File:B-47-kc-97.jpg|thumb|B-47 and KC-97 as flown by the wing]]
The squadron began to fly strategic reconnaissance missions in September 1953.&lt;ref name=90MWfacts/&gt;  The following year, it replaced its RB-29s with the jet [[Boeing RB-47 Stratojet]], with the first B-47E arriving on 25 June, although crews had begun training in March.&lt;ref&gt;90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, pp. 3, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  One year later, the squadron and the entire 90th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing deployed as a unit to [[Eielson Air Force Base]], Alaska from 5 May until 31 August 1955, where the wing performed the final mapping of Alaska.&lt;ref name=90MWfacts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1958, the 90th Wing returned to the training mission serving as a combat crew training wing for RB-47 aircrews until it was inactivated on 20 June 1960.&lt;ref name=90MWfacts/&gt;  The squadron's personnel and equipment were transferred to the [[44th Bombardment Squadron]], which moved to Forbes on paper from [[Schilling Air Force Base]], Kansas the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstein, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercontinental ballistic missiles===
[[File:320th Missile Squadron - ALL.png|thumb|200px|LGM-30 Minuteman Missile Alert and Launch Facilities]]
{{Commons category-inline|90th Missile Wing (United States Air Force)|90th Missile Wing}}

The squadron was reactivated on 8 January 1964 as an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] squadron assigned to the [[90th Strategic Missile Wing]] at [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]], Wyoming, and equipped with fifty [[LGM-30B Minuteman I]]s, armed with a single reentry vehicle.  The squadron was the second of the 90th Wing's four Minuteman squadrons to activate, as construction on launch facitlities continued until the middle of 1964.  Beginning in June 1973, its Minuteman I missiles began to be replaced by [[LGM-30G Minuteman III]]s, which could carry up to three reentry vehicles.&lt;ref name=90MWfacts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=14782 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 90 Missile Wing (AFGSC)|date=April 6, 2012|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren90MWfacts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.warren.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/3813/Article/331279/90-mw-fact-sheet.aspx |last1=|first1=|title=90 MW Fact Sheet|date=August 19, 2010|publisher=90th Missile Wing Public Affairs|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001 in compliance with the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]], these missiles were limited to a single reentry vehicle&lt;ref name=Warren90MWfacts/&gt;  

In 1997 the squadron won the [[William H. Blanchard|Blanchard Trophy]] as the best missile operations squadron at the [[Guardian Challenge]] missile competition.  It also received awards that year for the best missile maintenance team and the best missile crew.&lt;ref&gt;90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Blanchard Trophy was awarded at the squadron level for only a few years.  For most of its existence it was awarded at the wing level.  The 90th Wing has also won this award.  90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In more recent competitions, the squadron won the [[Samuel C. Phillips|Samuel C. Phillips Award]] as the best missile squadron in [[Air Force Space Command]] in 2005. It was awarded the [[Thomas H. Neary|Neary Trophy]] and the [[Robert E. Linhard|Linhard Trophy]] for best USAF missile crew in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, pp. 23, 26&lt;/ref&gt;
