'''''Wave Ruler''''' was a {{GRT|8,138}} {{sclass|Wave|oiler||ship}}  that was built in 1946 as '''''Empire Evesham''''' by [[Furness Shipbuilding Company|Furness Shipbuilding Co Ltd]], [[Haverton Hill-on-Tees]], [[Co Durham]], United Kingdom for the British [[Ministry of Transport (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Transport]]. In 1947, she was transferred to the [[Admiralty]] and commissioned into the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA) as ''Wave Ruler''.

==History==
''Empire Evesham'' was laid down on 27 October 1944.&lt;ref name=Ruler/&gt; She was launched on 17 January 1946. In February, she was transferred to the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref name=Ruler&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalrfa.org/rfa-wave-ruler-ships-details |title=RFA Wave Ruler |publisher=RFA Historical Association |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Empire Evesham'' was completed in April 1946.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; The United Kingdom Official Number 180849 was allocated.&lt;ref name=Tees/&gt; Her [[Code Letters]] were GKNR.&lt;ref name=HRFA/&gt; She was placed under the management of the [[Eagle Oil and Shipping Company]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[North Riding of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=Tees/&gt;

On 7 March 1947, ''Empire Evesham'' was commissioned into the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA) and renamed ''Wave Ruler''.&lt;ref name=Ruler/&gt; The [[Pennant number]] A212 was allocated.&lt;ref name=Tees/&gt; This would later be changed to X135. In May 1951, her captain refused to enter the harbour at [[Cairns]], [[Queensland]], Australia as there was insufficient depth of water for ''Wave Ruler''. As a result of this, the harbour authorities purchased a [[dredger]]. On 3 April 1952, ''Wave Ruler'' caught fire whilst anchored off [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire]]. At the time, she was fully laden and all non-essential personnel took to the [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. The fire, which was in a pumproom, was under control within two hours.  It damaged ''Wave Ruler{{'}}s'' steering gear and she had to be assisted by four [[tugboat|tugs]] to berth for the discharge of her cargo. On 3 October, ''Wave Ruler'' was in the [[Montebello Islands]], Australia in support of [[Operation Hurricane]].&lt;ref name=Ruler/&gt;

On 18 September 1953, ''Wave Ruler'' lost all power off [[Oporto]], Portugal. The tugs {{HMS|Careful}} and {{ship|RFA|Saucy}} were sent to her aid. On 28 September, she ran aground off [[Swansea]], [[Glamorgan]]. Her cargo was transferred to {{ship|RFA|Wave Monarch}} on 3 October and she was refloated two days later and taken to Swansea for examination. On 1 December 1957, ''Wave Ruler'' arrived at [[Christmas Island]] to participate in [[Operation Grapple]]. From 30 September 1958 to 15 December 1960, ''Wave Ruler'' was deployed off Iceland in support of [[Royal Navy]] ships participating in the [[First Cod War]]. She was then refitted at [[Hebburn]].&lt;ref name=Ruler/&gt;

In July 1961, ''Wave Ruler'' was one of thirteen RFA ships deployed in support of the [[July 1961|Kuwait Crisis]]. On 10 September 1962, she participated in Exercise Tucker Box 2 in the [[Coral Sea]] and in November she was at [[Perth, Western Australia]] where the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] were taking place. On 21 November, a [[mayday]] was received from the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|Scripps]] [[research vessel]] {{ship|RV|Horizon||2}}, which was off [[Île Saint-Paul|St Paul Island]] and had a crewmember who was critically ill. ''Wave Ruler'' responded and gave assistance. In July 1963, ''Wave Ruler'' was one of four RFA ships that escorted {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} from the United Kingdom to the Far East. In February 1965, ''Wave Ruler'' suffered a major engine breakdown off [[Port Said]], Egypt. She slowly sailed to [[Malta]] for repairs, arriving on 10 February. In 1967, she was one of the last British naval vessels to be refitted in Malta.&lt;ref name=Ruler/&gt;

On 26 August 1970, ''Wave Victor'' departed from [[HMNB Devonport]] for the [[Maldive Islands]], where she was to replace {{ship|RFA|Wave Victor|A220|6}} as a [[hulk (ship)|fuel hulk]]. She arrived on 3 October and her colours were struck for the last time on 14 October. She served until 1975, when RAF Gan closed. In October that year she was offered for sale. On 11 November, her remaining cargo was transferred to {{ship|RFA|Tidesurge|A98|6}}. In January 1976, ''Wave Ruler'' was sold to Straits Engineers Contracting Private Ltd, [[Singapore]] for scrapping. She was towed to Singapore in March and laid up in the Singapore Roads.&lt;ref name=Ruler/&gt; In 1977, she was sold to Taiwanese shipbreakers.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; ''Wave Ruler'' was scrapped that year at [[Kaohsiung]].&lt;ref name=Tees/&gt;
