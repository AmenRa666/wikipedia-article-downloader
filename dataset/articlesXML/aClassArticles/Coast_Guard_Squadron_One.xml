'''Coast Guard Squadron One''', also known in official message traffic as '''COGARDRON ONE''' or '''RONONE''', was a combat unit formed by the United States Coast Guard in 1965 for service during the Vietnam War. Placed under the operational control of the [[United States Navy]], it was assigned duties in [[Operation Market Time]]. Its formation marked the first time since [[World War II]] that Coast Guard personnel were used extensively in a combat environment.

The squadron operated divisions in three separate areas during the period of 1965 to 1970. Twenty-six {{sclass-|Point|cutter|3|boat}}s with their crews and a squadron support staff were assigned to the U.S. Navy with the mission of interdicting the movement of arms and supplies from the [[South China Sea]] into [[South Vietnam]] by [[Viet Cong]] and [[North Vietnam]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]] and [[Naval trawler|trawler]] operators. The squadron also provided [[naval gunfire support]] to nearby friendly units operating along the South Vietnamese coastline and assisted the U.S. Navy during [[Operation Sealords]]. As the United States' direct involvement in combat operations wound down during 1969, squadron crews began training [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]] (RVN) sailors in the operation and deployment of the cutters. The cutters were later turned over to the RVN as part of the [[Vietnamization]] of the war effort. Turnover of the cutters to South Vietnamese Navy crews began in May 1969 and was completed by August 1970. Squadron One was disestablished with the decommissioning of the last cutter.

The squadron was awarded several unit citations for its service to the U.S. Navy and the South Vietnamese government during the six years the unit was active with over 3,000 Coast Guardsmen serving aboard cutters and on the squadron support staff. Six squadron members were killed in action during the time the unit was commissioned.

Squadron One, along with American and South Vietnamese naval units assigned to the task force that assumed the Market Time mission, were successful interdicting seaborne North Vietnamese personnel and equipment from entering South Vietnamese waters. The success of the blockade served to change the dynamics of the Vietnam War, forcing the North Vietnamese to use a more costly and time-consuming route down the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] to supply their forces in the south.

==Background==
As the United States military involvement in South Vietnam shifted from an advisory role to combat operations, advisors from [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] (MACV) to the South Vietnamese military noticed an increase in the amount of military supplies and weapons being smuggled into the country by way of North Vietnamese junks and other small craft.&lt;ref name=Larzelere6&gt;Larzelere, p 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SummersJr.100&gt;Summers, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of infiltration was underscored in February 1965 when a [[U.S. Army]] helicopter crew spotted a North Vietnamese trawler camouflaged to look like an island.&lt;ref name=Tulich3&gt;Tulich, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; The event would later be known as the [[Vung Ro Bay Incident]], named for the small bay that was the trawler's destination.&lt;ref name=Kelley5-541&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 541&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutler76&gt;Cutler, p 76&lt;/ref&gt; After the U.S. Army helicopter crew called in [[air strike]]s on the trawler, it was sunk and captured after a five-day action conducted by elements of the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]] (RVN). Investigators found one million rounds of small arms ammunition, more than 1,000 stick grenades, 500 pounds of prepared [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] charges, 2,000 rounds of 82&amp;nbsp;mm mortar ammunition, 500 [[anti-tank grenade]]s, 1,500 rounds of [[recoilless rifle]] ammunition, 3,600 rifles and sub-machine guns, and 500 pounds of medical supplies.&lt;ref name=Cutler76 /&gt;  Labels on captured equipment and supplies and other papers found in the wreckage indicated that the shipment was from North Vietnam. Concern by top MACV advisors as to whether the RVN was up to the task of interdicting shipments originating in North Vietnam led to a request by General [[William C. Westmoreland]], commanding general of MACV, for U.S. Navy assistance.&lt;ref name=Karnow345-346&gt;Karnow, pp 345–346&lt;/ref&gt;

The request was initially filled by U.S. Navy [[radar picket]] [[destroyer escort]]s (DER) and [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s (MSO) in March when [[Operation Market Time]] was started, but these vessels had too great a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] to operate effectively in shallow coastal waters.&lt;ref name=Johnson331&gt;Johnson, p 331&lt;/ref&gt; In April the U.S. Navy ordered 54 [[Fast Patrol Craft|Swift boats]] (PCF), {{convert|50|foot|m|adj=on}} aluminum-hulled boats with a draft of only {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=off}} and capable of {{convert|25|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|}}. At the same time, the U.S. Navy queried the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], the lead agency for the U.S. Coast Guard at the time, about the availability of suitable vessels.&lt;ref name=Cutler81&gt;Cutler, p 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere7&gt;Larzelere, p 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Coast Guard had only a very minor role in combat operations during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]], Admiral [[Edwin J. Roland]], responded to the request by offering the use of {{convert|82|foot|m|adj=on}} Point-class cutters (WPB) and {{convert|40|foot|m|adj=on}} utility boats, fearing that, if the Coast Guard were left out of a role in Vietnam, its status as one of the nation's [[United States Armed Forces|armed services]] might be jeopardized.&lt;ref name=Johnson331 /&gt;
[[File:Mk 2 Mod 1 mount.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mk 2 Mod 1 gun mount]]
The decision to use the Point-class cutter was one of logistics. The {{convert|95|foot|m|adj=on}} [[Cape-class cutter]] was initially considered an option by Roland since it had a greater speed because of its four main drive engines. The Point-class cutter had only two main drive engines but they were more consistent throughout the class than the Cape-class cutters, so it was easier to supply spare parts and maintain the engines.&lt;ref name=Larzelere13&gt;Larzelere, p 13&lt;/ref&gt; Additional factors favoring the Point-class cutter were an unmanned engine room with all controls and alarms on the bridge, and air-conditioned living spaces, a big factor in a tropical climate where crews were expected to live on the boat whether on or off duty.&lt;ref name=Cutler82&gt;Cutler, p 82&lt;/ref&gt;  The 40-foot utility boats were rejected because they lacked radar, [[Berth (sleeping)#Beds in boats or ships|berthing]], and [[mess]] facilities for extended patrols offshore.&lt;ref name=Larzelere13 /&gt;

On 22 April representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] stating that the Coast Guard would supply 17 Point-class cutters and their crews and the Navy would provide transport to South Vietnam and logistical support with two [[Landing Ship, Tank|tank landing ships]] (LST) that had been converted to repair ships.&lt;ref name=Johnson331 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere8&gt;Larzelere, p 8&lt;/ref&gt; Ten of the cutters were sourced from stations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and seven were sourced from Pacific coast stations.  After removal of the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20–mm cannon]] on the bow, in place of which each cutter was fitted with a combination mount consisting of a 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar which could be either drop-fired or trigger-fired, above which was mounted a [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun]]. The mortar could be fired in both indirect and direct modes, and was equipped with a recoil cylinder.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;Wells II&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|A discussion of the history and characteristics of the Mk 2 Mod 0 and Mod 1 naval mortar and machine gun combination mount is at: {{cite web|last1=Stoner|first1=Bob|title=Mk 2 Mod 0 and Mod 1 .50 Caliber MG/81mm Mortar|url=http://www.pcf45.com/misfire/mortar.html|website=Patrol Craft Fast|publisher=pcf45.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}|group=Note}} The cutters were loaded on merchant ships for shipment to [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Johnson332&gt;Johnson, p 332&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] authorized Coast Guard units to operate under Navy command in Vietnam and to provide surveillance and interdiction assistance to U.S. Navy vessels and aircraft in an effort to stop the infiltration of troops, weapons and ammunition into South Vietnam by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and [[Viet Cong]] (VC) forces.&lt;ref name=Scotti9&gt;Scotti, p 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crew training and unit commissioning==
While the cutters were being shipped to Subic Bay, crew members started reporting to [[Coast Guard Island|Coast Guard Training Center Alameda]], California on 17 May 1965 for overseas processing and training.&lt;ref name=Larzelere18&gt;Larzelere, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; The cutter crews received one week of [[small arms]] training at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]] and [[Camp Pendleton]] while [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) training was received at [[Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center]], near [[Coleville, California]], in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and at [[Whidbey Island Naval Air Station]], Washington.&lt;ref name=Larzelere19&gt;Larzelere, p 19&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Alameda, they underwent refresher firefighting and [[damage control]] training from the Navy at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island Naval Base]]. Additional weapons qualifications and live fire exercises were held at Coast Guard Island and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], along with refresher training in radar navigation, radio procedures and visual signaling. Gun crews received mortar and machine gun training at Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name=Larzelere19 /&gt; Of the 245 personnel assigned to the unit only 131 were present at the squadron commissioning ceremony held at Alameda on 27 May with the remainder of the crews in the process of completing training elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Johnson332 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere18 /&gt; For service in Vietnam, two [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] were added to the normal crew complement of eight to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea. All officers assigned to command cutters were required to be [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]]s and to have previously commanded a Cape-class cutter and had to volunteer for the assignment. The executive officer was either a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenant junior grade]] or [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].&lt;ref name=Larzelere15&gt;Larzelere, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:VTN 82s Loaded 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|USCGC ''Point Mast'' (WPB-82316) being loaded on board a merchant ship for shipment to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, Philippines (May 1965)]]

==Naval Base Subic Bay==

===Divisions 11 and 12===

The first crews arrived at Subic Bay on 11 June and a squadron office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron came under the operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard.&lt;ref name=Larzelere21&gt;Larzelere, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the [[waterline]] down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and [[ready service ammunition|ammunition ready boxes]] for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits.&lt;ref name=Larzelere21 /&gt; Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol [[nautical stationkeeping|on-station]] time.&lt;ref name=Cutler83&gt;Cutler, p 83&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications were made to the bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close-range firing. Four additional [[M2 Browning|M-2 machine guns]] with ready boxes were added to the [[gunwale]]s of each cutter.&lt;ref name=Larzelere21 /&gt;

As the crews arrived from the United States, they began doing required modification work in the shipyard and [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] [[sorties]] in an effort to get all systems working. Night training exercises and gunnery drills were held each day and underway drills and training had been completed and [[commissary]] stores loaded by 9 July.&lt;ref name=Larzelere22&gt;Larzelere, p 22&lt;/ref&gt; A one-day survival training course was conducted by [[Negrito]] natives and completion was compulsory for all squadron personnel.&lt;ref name=Larzelere22 /&gt; When it became known that the cutters would be operating in two widely separated locations, Squadron One was divided into two divisions with Division 11 operating in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] at An Thoi, [[Phu Quoc|Phu Quoc Island]]&lt;ref name=Kelley5-400 /&gt; and Division 12 operating near the port of [[Da Nang]]&lt;ref name=Kelley5-129 /&gt; close to the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ).&lt;ref name=Larzelere21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelley5-142&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 142&lt;/ref&gt;  Division 11 consisted of nine cutters and Division 12 consisted of eight cutters. At 16:00 on 16 July, Division 12 got underway and once out of the harbor they formed up on {{ship|USS|Snohomish County|LST-1125|6}}, the LST permanently assigned to support the division at Da Nang. Division 11 and {{ship|USS|Floyd County|LST-762|6}}, the division's LST support ship, left Subic Bay bound for Phu Quoc Island at 08:00 on 24 July&lt;ref name=Larzelere22 /&gt;

After reviewing a study of the overall infiltration threat, MACV requested additional aircraft and patrol vessels for Operation Market Time. A request for an additional division of Point-class cutters to be added to Squadron One was made on 5 August 1965 and preparations for deploying the additional cutters started in late October with the new division of nine patrol boats to be named Division 13.&lt;ref name=Larzelere72&gt;Larzelere, p 72&lt;/ref&gt; The staff and repair personnel arrived at Subic Bay 14 December 1965 while the division's boat crews received weapons and undertook survival training in California. The crews started arriving at Subic Bay on 28 December where additional survival and weapons training was given.&lt;ref name=Larzelere74&gt;Larzelere, p 74&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one of the division's personnel were sent to Divisions 11 and 12 to be exchanged for crewmen who had Market Time experience.&lt;ref name=Larzelere74 /&gt; Division 13 cutters began arriving as deck cargo on transport ships at Subic Bay on 24 January 1966 and crews commenced outfitting and painting them deck gray. Some of the outfitting had been accomplished before shipment so that more time could be devoted to training crews in gunnery and procedure before the division's scheduled departure for Vietnam on 18 February.&lt;ref name=Larzelere74 /&gt; During a training exercise on 13 February, the main engine alarm sounded on the bridge of {{USCGC|Point League|WPB-82304|2}}.  After checking the cause of the alarm, it was determined that a complete overhaul of one of the engines would be required. Division 12  shipped a complete kit of repair parts from Da Nang overnight by way of a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[C-130]] flight to [[Cubi Point Naval Air Station]]. The flight was met by division personnel and repairs commenced. Divided into three shifts, the crews worked around-the-clock and the repairs were completed in 72 hours.&lt;ref name=Larzelere75&gt;Larzelere, p 75&lt;/ref&gt; A partial load [[Break-in (mechanical run-in)|break-in]] was made the morning of departure and the rest of the procedure was completed while the division was en route to Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Larzelere76&gt;Larzelere, p 76&lt;/ref&gt; At 16:00 on 18 February, Division 13 left Subic Bay in the company of {{USS|Forster|DER-334|6}}, arriving at the RVN Base at [[Cat Lo Naval Base|Cat Lo]] on 22 February.&lt;ref name=Kelley5-95 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti16&gt;Scotti, p 16&lt;/ref&gt; Patrol work for six of the division's cutters began at 08:00 the following morning, covering the area from {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} north of [[Vung Tau]] to {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} south.&lt;ref name=Larzelere77&gt;Larzelere, p 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

===Arrival in South Vietnam===
Division 12 arrived at the port city of Da Nang at 07:00 on 20 July 1965 and was the first U.S. Coast Guard unit to be stationed in South Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Larzelere28&gt;Larzelere, p 28&lt;/ref&gt; The morning after their arrival five of the division's eight cutters prepared to get underway for their first patrol accompanied by the Navy destroyer {{USS|Savage|DE-386|6}}, which coordinated the Market Time assets in the Da Nang area.&lt;ref name=Larzelere30&gt;Larzelere, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Division 11 arrived at [[Côn Sơn Island|Con Son Island]]&lt;ref name=Kelley5-116&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 116&lt;/ref&gt; on 29 July taking shelter from heavy seas and monsoon rains that had developed during the transit. ''Point Banks'' was the only cutter to have engine problems during the transit and repairs were made in the cramped engine room while underway so that no time was lost by the division during transit. During the lay over at Con Son minor repairs were made and repainting was completed on some of the cutters' hulls which had been partially stripped of paint by the storm. Three RVN liaison officers reported aboard the cutters just before the division departed for Phu Quoc Island and the same three cutters started patrol work as the rest of the division put into Phu Quoc harbor on 31 July.&lt;ref name=Larzelere48&gt;Larzelere, p 48&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July operational control of all Market Time elements, whether U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard or RVN, was transferred to the Commander, Task Force 115 (TF115).&lt;ref name=Cutler85&gt;Cutler, p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market Time operational theory===
[[File:US Navy Market Time patrol areas in Vietnam 1966.png|right|thumb|300px]]
{{Main|Operation Market Time}}
Market Time planners sectioned off nine patrol areas numbered in order from the DMZ in the north to the Cambodian border in the south. The areas varied in size, measuring {{convert|80|x|120|mi|km}} wide and running {{convert|30|to|40|mi|km}} out to sea. The outer two-thirds of each area was covered by the U.S. Navy DER and MSO fleet and was identified by the area number with the suffix &quot;B&quot;.

On 30 September 1968, Vice Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt]] assumed command of [[Naval Forces Vietnam]] and he redirected the focus of interdiction operations conducted by TF115 to areas nearer the DMZ as a part of [[Operation Sealords]] (Southeast Asia Lake, Ocean, River, and Delta Strategy). The result was that all but four Division 11 WPBs were transferred to Divisions 12 and 13 and the shallower draft U.S. Navy PCFs that had been used for patrol duties at the DMZ were used to patrol the canals and rivers.&lt;ref name=Larzelere66&gt;Larzelere, p 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major cutter operations===

====1965====
[[File:VTN Mortar Color Firing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gun crew aboard USCGC ''Point Comfort'' firing 81mm mortar during bombardment of suspected Viet Cong staging area one mile behind An Thoi. The machine gun has been removed from the Mk 2 mount. (August 1965).]]
Soon after patrol operations started in Division 12's area of responsibility (AOR), {{USCGC|Point Orient|WPB-82319|2}} encountered machine gun and mortar fire from the shore south of the Cua Viet River while attempting to board a [[junk (ship)|junk]] in the early morning hours of 24 July 1965. The ''Point Orient'' returned fire, and in doing so it became the first Coast Guard unit in Vietnam to engage the enemy.&lt;ref name=Larzelere31&gt;Larzelere, p 31&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the incident, it became obvious to the [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] of the ''Point Orient'' that the paint scheme used by the Coast Guard in the U.S. was too visible at night and shortly thereafter the white paint was replaced by deck gray on all WPBs in Squadron One.&lt;ref name=Cutler85 /&gt;  On assuming control, the TF115 commander changed the way patrols were conducted in the DMZ. Future patrols were concentrated along the DMZ for most of the WPBs and PCFs with only a few assets placed in the Da Nang area. Assets were concentrated where vessel traffic was encountered; most traffic near the Da Nang area was interdicted further out to sea by the DERs and WHECs and fewer shallow draft assets were needed there.&lt;ref name=Larzelere31 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutler84&gt;Cutler, p 84&lt;/ref&gt;

19 September was a busy day for Division 11 in the Gulf of Thailand with {{USCGC|Point Glover|WPB-82307|2}} encountering a junk that fired on her and when unable to escape tried to ram the cutter. The Viet Cong crew jumped overboard and ''Point Glover'' disabled the junk's engine with machine gun fire. A boarding party from ''Point Glover'' boarded the sinking junk and did a quick search of the vessel, finding arms and ammunition. Unable to stop the junk from sinking, she was beached in shallow water while {{USCGC|Point Garnet|WPB-82310|2}},{{USCGC| Point Clear|WPB-82315|2}} and {{USCGC|Point Marone|WPB-82331|2}} went searching for the missing junk crew; however, only one crew member was captured.&lt;ref name=Larzelere45&gt;Larzelere, p 45&lt;/ref&gt; Later that night ''Point Marone'' attempted to stop an unlit junk near the coastal town of [[Ha Tien]]&lt;ref name=Kelley5-208&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 208&lt;/ref&gt; but the junk ignored a [[warning shot]] across her bow and attempted to evade boarding while firing at the cutter and throwing hand grenades. ''Point Glover'' was nearby and assisted ''Point Marone'' in engaging the junk with machine gun fire. The junk caught fire and started sinking. Unable to keep the junk afloat the cutter crews marked it with a buoy and let it sink in shallow water. Salvage operations conducted later found rifles, ammunition, hand grenades, documents and money.&lt;ref name=Cutler112&gt;Cutler, p 112&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven Viet Cong were killed in the action and one badly wounded crewman was captured ashore.&lt;ref name=Larzelere45 /&gt;

====1966====
After Division 13's arrival at Cat Lo on 22 February 1966, operations started at nearby [[Rung Sat Special Zone]];&lt;ref name=Kelley5-450&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 450&lt;/ref&gt; an area of tidal [[mangrove]] swamp southeast of [[Saigon]] that straddled the [[Long Tau River]], the main shipping channel to the Port of Saigon. {{USCGC|Point White|WPB-82308|2}} was patrolling on the night of 9 March and intercepted a small junk attempting to smuggle supplies across the [[Soai Rạp]] River. After hailing the junk and receiving automatic weapons fire in reply, the cutter returned fire and killed several Viet Cong. They continued to fire on ''Point White'' so the skipper ordered the [[helmsman]] to ram the junk [[amidships]] at full speed. All but four of the crew of the junk were killed.  One of the survivors turned out to be a key leader in the Viet Cong Rung Sat infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Larzelere109&gt;Larzelere, p 109&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March {{USCGC|Point Partridge|WPB-82305|2}} engaged and damaged another junk, but shallow water allowed the junk to escape.&lt;ref name=USNOVH0366 /&gt; On 22 March {{USCGC|Point Hudson|WPB-82322|2}} drew fire from another junk on the river. In the battle that followed, an estimated ten Viet Cong were killed.&lt;ref name=USNOVH0366 /&gt; In conjunction with a joint U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps operation designated [[Operation Jackstay]], several Division 13 cutters were ordered to patrol the lower portion of the Soi Rap River in an effort to deny food, water, and ammunition to the Viet Cong operating in the Rung Sat Special Zone.&lt;ref name=Larzelere83&gt;Larzelere, p 83&lt;/ref&gt; From the start of patrols on 10 March until the ships of the amphibious ready group put the Marines ashore on the [[Long Thành District|Long Thành]] peninsula&lt;ref name=Kelley5-303&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 303&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 March, Division 13 cutters had taken fire from the shore almost every night during patrol operations. Some of the most intense combat operations that Squadron One encountered occurred during the month of March 1966 in support of Operation Jackstay.&lt;ref name=Larzelere83 /&gt; The joint operation ended 6 April with the withdrawal of the Marine Amphibious Force but the skipper of ''Point Partridge'' decided to continue the patrols after the operation ended. On the night patrols from 1 to 6 May ''Point Partridge'' engaged Viet Cong junks or received fire from the shore every night.&lt;ref name=Larzelere83 /&gt;

While patrolling off the coast of the [[Ca Mau Peninsula]] in the late evening hours of 9 May 1966 {{USCGC|Point Grey|WPB-82324|2}} reported sighting two large bonfires on the shore near the mouth of the [[Rach Gia River]]. Since this was an unusual activity the skipper decided to monitor the area for the remainder of the night. Shortly after midnight, a steel-hulled [[Naval trawler|trawler]] was spotted and challenged but ''Point Grey'' received no answer. The trawler continued on a course headed for the beach area near the bonfires and ran [[aground]] {{convert|400|yd|m}} from the shore.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0566&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

After daybreak ''Point Grey'' attempted to board the trawler but encountered heavy fire from the shore. After requesting assistance from the CSC, ''Point Grey'' stood off from the trawler until destroyer escort {{USS|Brister|DER-327|6}} arrived on scene. With ''Brister'' standing in deeper water and [[South Vietnamese Air Force]] [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|A-1E Skyraider]] aircraft bombing the beach nearby, ''Point Grey'' attempted a boarding but she received very heavy small arms fire from Viet Cong positions beyond the beach which heavily damaged the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]] and wounded three of her crew manning the mortar on the bow.&lt;ref name=Larzelere64&gt;Larzelere, p 64&lt;/ref&gt; With evening approaching it was decided by CSC to destroy the trawler and ''Point Grey'' assisted by {{USCGC|Point Cypress|WPB-82326|2}} began mortaring the trawler. During the shelling an explosion on board the trawler broke it in two pieces and caused it to sink in the shallow waters. Salvage operations began the next morning and included the recovery of six crew served weapons and {{convert|15|ST|kg|}} of ammunition of Chinese manufacture.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0566 /&gt; The destruction of the trawler marked the first instance of the capture of a trawler by Market Time assets.&lt;ref name=Larzelere61&gt;Larzelere, p 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti205&gt;Scotti, p 205&lt;/ref&gt;

While on patrol near the mouth of the [[Co Chien River]] in the early hours of 20 June, the skipper of ''Point League'' noted a large radar contact which, upon further investigation, was found to be running without [[navigation light]]s. After informing the CSC of the situation the cutter went to [[general quarters]] and spotlighted the incoming trawler. The trawler ignored a hail from ''Point League'' and two bursts of machine gun fire across its bow.&lt;ref name=Larzelere68&gt;Larzelere, p 68&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler returned with heavy machine gun fire hitting the cutter's bridge and wounding the executive officer and a crewman manning the mortar on the [[forecastle]]. The trawler dropped the line on a towed junk and picked up speed in an effort to beach along the shore. When the commanding officer of ''Point League'' noticed that the trawler was headed for [[shoal|shoal water]] near the mouth of the river, he let the trawler run aground {{convert|75|yd|m|0}} from shore and moved to a position {{convert|1000|yd|m|}} away while keeping the target illuminated with mortar rounds. ''Point League'' then came under fire from Viet Cong elements operating from just behind the shoreline. With assistance from ''Point Slocum'' the two cutters poured machine gun fire into the grounded trawler. Just after dawn the trawler was sunk by what was probably a [[scuttling charge]] resulting in a large fire. At 07:15 destroyer escort {{USS|Haverfield|DER-393|6}} arrived on scene and assumed control of the operation. With the assistance of two U.S. Air Force [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100 Super Sabre]] aircraft providing close air support, resistance from the shoreline was finally controlled. It was decided by the commanding officer of the ''Haverfield'' that salvage of the trawler would be attempted in order to learn more about the trawler, its origins and the cargo on board.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0666&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

The {{convert|99|foot|m|adj=on}} trawler yielded valuable information about the capabilities of that particular class of trawler. It was carrying about {{convert|100|ST|kg|}} of small arms and ammunition of recent manufacture in China and North Korea. The surviving log and navigation charts helped determine the trawler's origin and two possible destinations.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0666 /&gt;

=====''Point Welcome'' incident=====
 {{Main|USCGC Point Welcome (WPB-82329)}}
''Point Welcome'' was patrolling Area 1A1 immediately south of the DMZ in the early morning hours of 11 August 1966. At 03:40 the cutter was illuminated by an U.S. Air Force [[forward air controller]] (FAC) who mistook her for an enemy vessel. The FAC called in one [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57 Canberra tactical bomber]] and two [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber]] aircraft which proceeded to strafe the cutter for about one hour, each making from seven to nine passes. ''Point Welcome'' turned on all of her running and docking lights when first illuminated by the FAC aircraft and contacted the CSC by radio telling them that they were being illuminated by aircraft. During the first pass all of the crew on the bridge were wounded and the commanding officer, Lieutenant Junior Grade David Brostrom, was killed along with the helmsman, Engineman Second Class Jerry Phillips.&lt;ref name=USCG02&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Coast Guardsmen Killed in Action during the Vietnam Conflict|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/VietnamKIA.asp|work=Coast Guard History Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All signaling equipment, electronics and radios were knocked out on the first pass. ''Point Welcome'' began evasive maneuvers at the direction of Chief Boatswains Mate Richard Patterson, who had assumed command after the executive officer was seriously injured. Patterson attempted to avoid the illumination lights of the attacking aircraft and move out of the way of the strafing aircraft. At 04:15 Patterson decided that the best course of action was to beach the cutter and move the wounded ashore, however when this was attempted, the crew came under fire from unknown sources from the shoreline. At 04:25 ''Point Orient'' and {{USCGC|Point Caution|WPB-82301|2}} arrived on the scene and started rescue proceedings. In addition to the commanding officer, one other crewman was killed, nine other crewmen were injured along with a RVN liaison officer and civilian [[Freelancer|freelance journalist]] [[Tim Page (photographer)|Tim Page]]. The bridge of the cutter was severely damaged and despite nine 5 to 9 inch (13 to 23&amp;nbsp;cm) wide holes in the main deck, the hull was undamaged. ''Point Welcome'' was escorted back to Da Nang under her own power and required three months to repair the damage.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0866&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

After eight days of testimony the findings of a board of investigation conducted by MACV were forwarded to the Commandant of the Coast Guard: 
{{cquote|It is evident from the record that there was a lack of communication between different forces operating in the same area, and that existing orders and instructions pertaining to identification and recognition of friendly forces were not observed.
:—extract from 9 November 1966 letter from MACV to Commandant, USCG&lt;ref name=Scotti110&gt;Scotti, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a result of the investigation, lines of communication were set up between the Navy and the Air Force. The Air Force knew nothing of Operation Market Time and did not routinely communicate with Naval Forces, Vietnam. To avoid a repetition of the incident, aircraft patrolling near the DMZ were instructed not to attack vessels without first contacting CSC Da Nang for clearance.&lt;ref name=Scotti110 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson337&gt;Johnson, p 337&lt;/ref&gt;

====1967====
In the late evening hours of 1 January 1967 {{USCGC|Point Gammon|WPB-82328|2}} along with two U.S. Navy vessels, ''PCF-68'' and ''PCF-71'', intercepted a trawler attempting to land supplies on the Cau Mau Peninsula. After running the trawler aground the PCFs managed to hit it with several mortar rounds while ''Point Gammon'' kept the trawler illuminated. Several secondary explosions occurred and the trawler disappeared. Investigations later concluded that the trawler could have successfully escaped to a nearby river although heavily damaged.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0167&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary. January 1967|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/archives/digitized-collections/commander-naval-forces-vietnam/monthly-summaries-1967/january.html|publisher=Naval Historical Center, U.S. Navy|accessdate=3 October 2015|author=Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam|pages=29–30|date=January 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more successful action was fought in the early morning hours of 14 March 1967 when a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft spotted a trawler near [[Cu-Lao Re Group|Cu-Lao Re]], an island {{convert|65|mi|km}} southeast of Da Nang.&lt;ref name=Kelley5-125&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 125&lt;/ref&gt; USS ''Brister'' and two PCFs along with {{USCGC|Point Ellis|WPB-82330|2}} closed on the trawler and forced it aground near the village of Phouc Thien on [[Batangan Peninsula|Cape Batangan]].&lt;ref name=Kelley5-44&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 44&lt;/ref&gt; The patrol elements continued to exchange heavy gunfire with the trawler and land-based Viet Cong units until dawn when the trawler was scuttled with a massive explosion. Investigators later discovered a heavy machine gun, a recoilless rifle, sub-machine guns, rifles and carbines along with thousands of rounds of ammunition. Also in the wreckage was a complete surgical kit for a field hospital and medical supplies.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0367&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

A similar conclusion was the result of the capture of a steel hull trawler 15 July 1967 after three days of tracking by patrol aircraft and the radar picket, {{USS|Wilhoite|DER-397|6}}.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0767&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

At 02:00 on 15 July, the trawler was boxed in and ablaze, and ran aground 200 yards (180 m) from shore. [[South Korea]]n marines directed artillery fire from the shore and at 06:00 with the trawler apparently abandoned, a U.S. Navy demolitions expert from ''Walker'' boarded the trawler and defused 2,000 pounds of [[TNT]] charges that were designed to scuttle the craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNFVMHS0767&quot; /&gt; Found on board were several thousand rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition, mortar and rocket rounds, anti-personnel mines, grenades, and several thousand pounds of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] plastic explosive and TNT. Weapons found included several hundred machine guns, [[AK-47]] rifles, [[AK-56]] rifles, and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|B-40 rocket launchers]].&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0767 /&gt;

On many occasions during the months of October, November and December 1967, the cutters ''Point Hudson'', {{USCGC|Point Jefferson|WPB-82306|2}}, {{USCGC|Point Grace|WPB-82323|2}} and ''Point Gammon'' were called on to assist in [[naval gunfire support]] missions in the Long Toan and Thanh Phu Secret Zones near [[Soc Trang]].&lt;ref name=Kelley5-304&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelley5-502&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 502&lt;/ref&gt;   These missions resulted in the destruction of several [[sampan]]s and structures as well as bunkers used by the Viet Cong.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS1067&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

====1968====
During the morning hours of 31 January 1968, combined forces of North Vietnamese Army/Viet Cong personnel initiated coordinated attacks on military installations throughout South Vietnam in what would be later be referred to as the [[Tet Offensive]]. Because of [[monsoon]] weather in the northern provinces of South Vietnam and a general [[curfew]] imposed by South Vietnam on most sampan traffic, routine boardings by Squadron One vessels during February were far below normal.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0268&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

The cutters ''Point Gammon'', {{USCGC|Point Arden|WPB-82309|2}}, ''Point Grey'', ''Point Cypress'', ''Point League'', and {{USCGC|Point Slocum|WPB-82313|2}} were involved in multiple naval gunfire support missions throughout the month of February.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0268 /&gt; The use of Squadron One cutters as a blocking force against exfiltration by NVA/VC forces operating along the coastline also increased at this time.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0268 /&gt;

During an [[Action of 1 March 1968|action on 1 March 1968]], in the early morning several Squadron One cutters were involved in the interdiction and destruction of four North Vietnamese trawlers attempting to smuggle arms and ammunition into South Vietnam at different locations. This co-ordinated attempt by the North Vietnamese was met by various elements of TF115; including U.S. Navy aircraft and vessels, RVN junks, U.S. Air Force aircraft, and U.S. Army helicopters. In addition, there were several [[Owasco-class cutter]] cutters from Coast Guard Squadron Three&amp;nbsp;– {{Ship|USCGC|Androscoggin|WHEC-68|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Winona|WHEC-65|2}}, and {{Ship|USCGC|Minnetonka|WHEC-67|2}}&amp;nbsp;– as well as ''Point Grey'', ''Point Hudson'', and ''Point Welcome'' from Squadron One.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0268 /&gt; As a result of this action, three North Vietnamese trawlers were destroyed and a fourth was turned back before it could reach the coast. After this action the incidence of smuggling by trawler was decreased and Communist forces had to resort to shipments along the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] or through the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref name=SummersJr.100 /&gt;

Operations conducted by [[South Vietnamese Regional Force]] troops on Phu Quoc Island in September were assisted by Market Time assets. ''Point Partridge'' and ''Point Banks'' assisted with naval gunfire support on 9 September which destroyed three bunkers, killing four and wounding several others. Ten Viet Cong were captured.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0968&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

Heavy weather in the form of monsoons in the northern half of South Vietnam reduced indigenous coastal traffic during October 1968 and the U.S. Navy's PCF support of Market Time was limited by heavy seas; however, Market Time units including Squadron One cutters fired a record number of naval gunfire missions for the sixth month in a row.

====1969====
In February 1969, Squadron One personnel began training RVN engineers in the maintenance and repair of the ''Point class'' cutters that would eventually be turned over to the South Vietnamese government under the &quot;[[Vietnamization]]&quot; program.&lt;ref name=Cutler373&gt;Cutler, p 373&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March during routine operations involving the inspection of fishing craft for contraband arms and supplies, the chief engineer, Chief Engineman Morris S. Beeson of the ''Point Orient'' was killed by ambush fire from three shore positions while attempting to board a sampan near [[Qui Nhon]].&lt;ref name=USCG02 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelley5-430&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 430&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0369&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

On 27 March, ''Point Dume'' was notified by a unit of the U.S. Army's [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]] that a Viet Cong unit was located at a village {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of Qui Nhon and ''Point Dume'' was requested to perform a blocking patrol while the brigade's troops conducted a sweep. ''Point Dume'' assisted with naval gunfire support. Additionally, in the aftermath, a landing party helped to destroy 41 sampans that had been used to transport Viet Cong supplies.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0369 /&gt;

The first turnover of Squadron One cutters occurred on 16 May with the transfer of ''Point League'' and ''Point Garnet'' to the South Vietnamese Navy under the Vietnamization plan. An elaborate ceremony was held at the RVN Base in Saigon with dignitaries from many area naval activities witnessing the turnover of the two cutters.&lt;ref name=Scotti187&gt;Scotti, p 187&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June, Division 11 was disestablished and its cutters were transferred to Division 13.&lt;ref name=Larzelere234&gt;Larzelere, p 234&lt;/ref&gt; The need for Squadron One cutters had been supplanted by the shallower draft PCFs and PBRs that were being concentrated in the Delta region for use in Operation Sealords. With better foul weather stationkeeping abilities than the U.S. Navy craft, the Point-class cutters of the Squadron were shifted for use during the northeast [[monsoon]] season in the northern half of the country.&lt;ref name=Larzelere35 /&gt;

On 9 August while conducting a harassment and interdiction mission aboard ''Point Arden'', a misfire occurred with the mortar killing Lieutenant Junior Grade Michael W. Kirkpatrick, the cutter's executive officer, and Engineman First Class Michael H. Painter.&lt;ref name=USCGcron3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=USCG02 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti164&gt;Scotti, p 164&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970&amp;nbsp;– Vietnamization and disestablishment==
With the growing dissatisfaction of the American electorate about Vietnam in 1969, high officials in the [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon Administration]] sought a way to disengage the United States from the war.&lt;ref name=Larzelere229&gt;Larzelere, p 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann642&gt;Mann, p 642&lt;/ref&gt;
Part of the strategy to placate public opinion was termed &quot;Vietnamization&quot; and it included plans to remove most U.S. combat troops from Vietnam and the turnover of supplies and equipment to the South Vietnamese military.&lt;ref name=Karnow593&gt;Karnow, p 593&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann644&gt;Mann, p 644&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorley166&gt;Sorley, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of the plan, referred to as Accelerated Turnover to Vietnamese (ACTOV), included the training of Vietnamese in the use of equipment that was to be turned over to them and a gradual phase-in of responsibilities for the conduct of the war by the South Vietnamese government.&lt;ref name=Larzelere229 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Karnow595&gt;Karnow, p 595&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann652&gt;Mann, p 652&lt;/ref&gt; The first assets turned over to the Vietnamese under ACTOV occurred on 1 February 1969 when 25 mostly smaller U.S. Navy vessels were transferred to the RVN to be used in supporting Operation Sealords in the Mekong Delta.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0269&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

===ACTOV===
The naval assets portion of the ACTOV plan consisted of two parts: SCATTOR (Small Craft Assets, Training, and Turnover of Resources) and VECTOR (Vietnamese Engineering Capability, Training of [[Naval rating|Rating]]s). While SCATTOR trained Vietnamese replacement crews for the patrol boats of Squadron One, VECTOR trained and prepared Vietnamese repair personnel to maintain them.&lt;ref name=Larzelere230&gt;Larzelere, p 230&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background====
Since the patrol boats of Squadron One were an essential part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam, it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively. On 2 November 1968, Zumwalt, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam, presented a plan to General [[Creighton Abrams|Creighton W. Abrams]], Commander, MACV to turn over all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard resources to the RVN by 30 June 1970.&lt;ref name=Larzelere229 /&gt; Abrams approved the Navy's plan with the caveat that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first-class condition and that they would have to be properly trained in its use.&lt;ref name=Larzelere230 /&gt; The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained. In a recommendation made 14 January 1969, the Commander, Coast Guard Activities Vietnam, Captain Ralph W. Niesz, suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and be given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard. Neisz cited cultural imperatives that required seniors to be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that it would be very difficult for officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face. Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately.&lt;ref name=Larzelere230 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti185&gt;Scotti, p 185&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 1969 the first RVN officers reported aboard ''Point Garnet'' and ''Point League'' for an 18-week pilot training program. Each cutter's executive officer was relieved and assigned staff duties ashore with the commanding officer assuming his duties.  The two spare bunks on each cutter were utilized by the new Vietnamese personnel reporting on board. As experience was gained by the Vietnamese crew members, new junior personnel reported in pairs replacing Coast Guardsmen that were then assigned ashore to assist with the VECTOR phase of training.&lt;ref name=Larzelere229 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti185 /&gt; The first transfer of Squadron One cutters occurred at the RVN Base in Saigon during joint decommissioning and commissioning ceremonies held 16 May 1969 by the Coast Guard and the RVN. ''Point Garnet'' and ''Point League'' were the first cutters transferred under the ACTOV plan.&lt;ref name=Scotti187 /&gt;

====Problems====
SCATTOR training was not easy for either the trainers or the trainees. Cultural differences and language barriers had to be breached by both. English–Vietnamese dictionaries were used extensively and Vietnamese sailors who spoke even broken English were often pressed into service to help translate the training syllabus for each job on the cutter. Coast Guardsmen that had maintained their cutters with pride could not understand the Vietnamese sailors seeming lack of care about housekeeping chores.&lt;ref name=Scotti186&gt;Scotti, p 186&lt;/ref&gt; Orders dictated that any cutter entering the ACTOV Program had to be ready for turnover within four months.&lt;ref name=Scotti185 /&gt; Often after a return from patrol duties the Vietnamese sailors would just leave the cutter as soon as it reached homeport, leaving maintenance, cleanup, and re-provisioning to the Coast Guardsmen.&lt;ref name=Larzelere236&gt;Larzelere, p 236&lt;/ref&gt;  [[AWOL]] rates for Vietnamese sailors often interfered with training schedules as well as patrol operations. Morale of the Coast Guardsmen charged with the training of the replacement Vietnamese crew was often very low and this caused friction between the two parts of the crew.&lt;ref name=Larzelere236 /&gt; Because of political pressures in the United States to end involvement in the war as soon as possible, the SCATTOR program of training was accelerated to a 15-week program and eventually an 11-week program. This caused overcrowding on the cutters and further problems with the mixed crews.&lt;ref name=Scotti186 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere236 /&gt;

All of the Squadron One cutters eventually completed training of the Vietnamese crews and as cutters were transferred to the RVN each division shrunk in size until they were consolidated with other divisions. Division 11 was disestablished on 5 June 1969 with the remaining cutters in the division moving to Cat Lo. Division 12 was consolidated with Division 13 at Cat Lo 16 March 1970.&lt;ref name=Scotti187 /&gt; [[File:VTN 82 Turnover.jpg|right|thumb|250px|South Vietnamese navy crewmen board a former Squadron One cutter during re-commissioning ceremonies at Cat Lo Navy Base, 15 August 1970.]]

====Last patrols====
After ''Point Grey'' and ''Point Orient'' were turned over to the RVN on 14 July only ''Point Cypress'' and ''Point Marone'' were left in Division 13. On that day the remaining two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone.&lt;ref name=Scotti187 /&gt; On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. [[Kit Carson Scouts]] were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats.&lt;ref name=Scotti187 /&gt; The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents.&lt;ref name=Scotti188&gt;Scotti, p 188&lt;/ref&gt; A week later both cutters with [[Australian Army]] [[explosive ordnance disposal]] soldiers aboard cruised the [[My Thanh River]] and destroyed fortifications.&lt;ref name=Scotti188 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelley5-475&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 475&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 1970, coincidentally [[Coast Guard Day]], the pair of cutters set out on what would prove to be their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts embarked for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, ''Point Marone'' was the target of a command detonated mine. The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts.&lt;ref name=Scotti188 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere227&gt;Larzelere, p 227&lt;/ref&gt; After the mine explosion, ''Point Marone'' listed to starboard but managed to get underway while ''Point Cypress'' laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. ''Point Marone'' suffered three shrapnel holes at the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the [[mess deck]] and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud.&lt;ref name=Larzelere229 /&gt; After patching and painting, ''Point Marone'' was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both ''Point Marone'' and ''Point Cypress''.&lt;ref name=Scotti188 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere238&gt;Larzelere, p 238&lt;/ref&gt;

====Last turnover====
With the turnover of ''Point Cypress'' and ''Point Marone'' to South Vietnamese navy on 15 August 1970, Squadron One and its remaining division, Division 13, were decommissioned. Over 3,000 Coast Guardsmen had served with Squadron One in Vietnam since May 1965. Administrative and liaison functions that had been carried out by the Squadron One staff were turned over to the Office of the Senior Coast Guard Officer, Vietnam (SCGOV).&lt;ref name=Scotti187 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0870&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

Each group was composed of an officer and eight to eleven [[Marine engineering|engineers]] reporting to SCGOV. The groups were located at Da Nang where there were six cutters assigned; Cam Ranh Bay, six cutters; Vung Tau, eight cutters; and An Thoi, six cutters. As tours of duty for each Coast Guardsman ended, U.S. Navy personnel gradually took over the training duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNFVMHS0870&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere240 /&gt;

==Civic action==
[[File:Coast Guard Squadron One Civic Actions.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chief Boatswain's Mate C. C. Gardner of the Coast Guard Cutter ''Point Mast'' gives a package of pencils, paper, candy, and plastic toys to a young Vietnamese girl during the cutter's civic action visit to Hon Nam Du Island.]]
U.S. Coast Guard personnel stationed in Vietnam were encouraged by their commands to donate off duty time to assist in various civic action programs supporting the Vietnamese people. Squadron One personnel participated as time permitted in an island adoption program that was designed to provide educational materials and medical treatment to inhabitants of the many coastal islands in their area of operation. This program was offered to counter Viet Cong [[propaganda]] and promote a better understanding of the South Vietnamese government and [[USAID]] rural development programs.&lt;ref name=Tulich19&gt;Tulich, p 19&lt;/ref&gt; Since medical personnel were normally not a part of the make-up of the Squadron One patrol boat crews, medical [[Hospital corpsman|corpsmen]] were borrowed from Squadron Three cutters or nearby U.S. Navy units. Division 11 crews constructed a fresh water well and distribution system in addition to constructing voting booths on Hon Thom Island.&lt;ref name=Kelley5-248&gt;Kelley, sec 5, p 248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti153&gt;Scotti, p 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tulich20&gt;Tulich, p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Division 12 cutters helped evacuate refugees from the vicinity of Cape Batangan when military operations intensified during 1967.&lt;ref name=Tulich19 /&gt; Division 13 personnel spent many hours of off duty time at the children's ward of the U.S. Army 36th Medevac Hospital and gave games, toys, clothing and candy to injured Vietnamese children.&lt;ref name=Tulich21&gt;Tulich, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christmas holidays, at local orphanages all squadron personnel distributed gifts of candy and toys as well as clothing, soap and toothpaste that had been donated by Coast Guard families in the United States and brought to Vietnam on the Commandant's airplane.&lt;ref name=Tulich20 /&gt; Squadron One crews arranged for transportation of a small girl by an U.S. Air Force helicopter to {{USS|Sanctuary|AH-17|6}} for eye surgery while the squadron commander personally delivered a [[cornea]] for transplant.&lt;ref name=Tulich19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti160&gt;Scotti, p 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and impact==
The cutters of Squadron One made a significant contribution to the success of Operation Market Time by forcing the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces to rely on the difficult Ho Chi Minh trail for most of their supplies and reinforcements.&lt;ref name=KelleyF-32&gt;Kelley, sec F, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson336&gt;Johnson, p 336&lt;/ref&gt; During the period between 27 May 1965 and 15 August 1970 the squadron cruised {{convert|4,215,116|mi}} and boarded 236,396 vessels while detaining 10,286 persons. During 4,461 naval gunfire missions they damaged or destroyed 1,811 enemy vessels and killed or wounded 1,232 enemy personnel.&lt;ref name=Scotti219&gt;Scotti, p 219&lt;/ref&gt;
