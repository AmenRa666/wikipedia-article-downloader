== Added image... ==

Just added BEP engraved portrait of Harrison as President. If this is problematic, please let me know. Thanks-[[User:Godot13|Godot13]] ([[User talk:Godot13|talk]]) 23:08, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

== Presidency 1889–1893: &quot;His speech was brief – half as long as that of his grandfather, William Henry Harrison, whose speech holds the record for the longest inaugural address of a U.S. president.&quot; ==

This sentence by itself, without more information, is logically incorrect.  Just because a speech is half as long as the longest speech ever, doesn't make it brief.  What if the longest speech was 4x longer than every other speech?  Should include either the total time or something.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/208.59.137.239|208.59.137.239]] ([[User talk:208.59.137.239|talk]]) 06:47, 10 May 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Declined reputation ==

The article does not really state why Harrison's reputation has declined. He really did not have any scandals. He was relatively honest. Why is Harrison downgraded so much ? [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 05:35, 9 June 2016 (UTC)
:I don't know off the top of my head, but consulting the biographies about him might explain it. If I had to guess: it's not that he became unpopular, just that the weak presidency of the 19th century gives 21st-century scholars little to get excited about. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 13:24, 10 June 2016 (UTC)
::Thanks for the response Coemgenus. The reader does not really know why historians give Harrison low marks. If what you are saying is true then that gives this article the impression of ''prensentism'', or simply downgrading Harrison because he was president in the 19th Century. As far as I have read there is no explanation in the article why Harrison is downgraded. Something needs to be mentioned. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 16:24, 10 June 2016 (UTC)
::: If historians have downgraded him, it's not for us to question their reasons, only to summarize their scholarship. If you could get the biographies, they might tell you more.  --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 01:48, 11 June 2016 (UTC)
::::I am not questioning their reasons. I am saying there are ''no reasons'' in the article for the reader. There is no critically negative scholarship to be  summarized. To say Benjamin Harrison was a terrible president but then not to give any reasons or explanation is not historical analysis, but more hearsay or slander. Also it appears the article on ''[[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|Historical rankings of Presidents]]'' is being used a source. Wikipedia articles can't be used as a source in an article. Was he a terrible administrator ? Was there out of control scandals ? Presentism is not a reason to degrade a president, is POV, and lacking neutrality. [[User:Cmguy777|Cmguy777]] ([[User talk:Cmguy777|talk]]) 02:12, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
:::::So read the sources and find the answers, if they exist. --[[User:Coemgenus|Coemgenus]] ([[User talk:Coemgenus|talk]]) 12:36, 12 June 2016 (UTC)</text>
