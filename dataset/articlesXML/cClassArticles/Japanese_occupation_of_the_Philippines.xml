{{History of the Philippines}}
The '''Japanese occupation of the Philippines''' occurred between 1942 and 1945, when the [[Empire of Japan]] occupied the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] during [[World War II]].

The [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|invasion of the Philippines]] started on 8 December 1941, ten hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. As at Pearl Harbor, American aircraft were severely damaged in the initial Japanese attack. Lacking air cover, the American [[Asiatic Fleet]] in the Philippines withdrew to [[Java]] on 12 December 1941. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|was ordered out, leaving his men]] at [[Corregidor]] on the night of 11 March 1942 for Australia, 4,000&amp;nbsp;km away. The 76,000 starving and sick American and Filipino defenders on [[Bataan]] surrendered on 9 April 1942, and were forced to endure the infamous [[Bataan Death March]] on which 7,000–10,000 died or were murdered. The 13,000 survivors on Corregidor surrendered on 6 May.

Japan occupied the Philippines for over three years, until the [[surrender of Japan]]. A highly effective guerilla campaign by Philippine resistance forces controlled sixty percent of the islands, mostly jungle and mountain areas. MacArthur supplied them by submarine, and sent reinforcements and officers. Filipinos remained loyal to the United States, partly because of the American guarantee of independence, and also because the Japanese had pressed large numbers of Filipinos into work details and even put young Filipino women into brothels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/philip44.htm The Philippines Campaign October 20, 1944 – August 15, 1945 – World War II Multimedia Database&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

General MacArthur kept his promise to return to the Philippines on 20 October 1944. The [[Battle of Leyte|landings on the island of Leyte]] were accompanied by a force of 700 vessels and 174,000 men. Through December 1944, the islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]] were cleared of Japanese soldiers.  During the campaign, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted a suicidal defense of the islands.  Cities such as [[Manila]] (the second most destroyed Allied city in WWII) were reduced to rubble.  Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Filipinos died during the occupation.

The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines. Although the Japanese had promised independence for the islands after occupation, they initially organized a [[Council of State]] through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |series=Historical Dictionaries of Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East Series |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Japanese%20occupation%20Philippines%20Council%20of%20State&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20occupation%20Philippines%20Council%20of%20State&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 March 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7246-2 |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Philippine elite, with a few notable exceptions, served under the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel B. |editor1-last=Schirmer |editor2-first=Stephen Rosskamm  |editor2-last=Shalom |title=The Philippines Reader: A History of Colonialism, Neocolonialism, Dictatorship, and Resistance |series=International Studies |chapter=War Collaboration and Resistance  |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXE73VWcsEEC&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Japanese%20collaboration%20Philippines%201941&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20collaboration%20Philippines%201941&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 March 2013 |year=1897 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=978-0-89608-275-5 |page=69 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Keat Gin |editor1-last=Ooi |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;ots=3WuVFda8TY&amp;dq=Japanese%20collaboration%20Philippines%201941&amp;pg=PA368#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20collaboration%20Philippines%201941&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 March 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-770-2 |pages=368–369 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |last=Riedinger |first=Jeffrey M. |title=Agrarian Reform in the Philippines: Democratic Transitions and Redistributive Reform |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlasRfravpEC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;ots=Cw32RsfAHX&amp;dq=Japanese%20collaboration%20Philippines%20elites&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20collaboration%20Philippines%20elites&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 March 2013 |year=1995 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-2530-9 |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The puppet republic was headed by President [[José P.

===Resistance===
{{Main article|Philippine resistance against Japan}}

Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by active and successful underground and guerrilla activity that increased over the years and that eventually covered a large portion of the country. Opposing these guerrillas were a Japanese-formed [[Philippine Constabulary#Bureau of Constabulary|Bureau of Constabulary]] (later taking the name of the old Constabulary during the ''[[Second Philippine Republic|Second Republic]]''),&lt;ref name=&quot;McAAE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/bataan_guerrilla.html |title=The Guerrilla War |author= |work=[[American Experience]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maranao.com/bangsamoro/0506-japan_invasion.htm |title=The Japanese Invasion |first=Salah |last=Jubair |work= |publisher=Maranao.Com |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kempeitai]],&lt;ref name=&quot;McAAE&quot; /&gt; and the [[Makapili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Have a bolo will travel |author= |url=http://asianjournalusa.com/have-a-bolo-will-travel-p7008-80.htm |newspaper=Asian Journal |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postwar investigations showed that about 260,000 people were in guerrilla organizations and that members of the anti-Japanese underground were even more numerous.

The Philippine guerrilla movement continued to grow, in spite of Japanese campaigns against them.  Throughout Luzon and the southern islands, Filipinos joined various groups and vowed to fight the Japanese. The commanders of these groups made contact with one another, argued about who was in charge of what territory, and began to formulate plans to assist the return of American forces to the islands.  They gathered important intelligence information and smuggled it out to the U.S. Army, a process that sometimes took months. General MacArthur formed a clandestine operation to support the guerrillas. He had Lieutenant Commander [[Chick Parsons|Charles &quot;Chick&quot; Parsons]] smuggle guns, radios and supplies to them by submarine. The guerrilla forces, in turn, built up their stashes of arms and explosives and made plans to assist MacArthur's invasion by sabotaging Japanese communications lines and attacking Japanese forces from the rear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.bataandiary.com/Introducing.htm War in the Pacific&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various guerrilla forces formed throughout the archipelago, ranging from groups of [[U.S. Army Forces Far East]] (USAFFE) forces who refused to surrender to local militia initially organized to combat banditry brought about by disorder caused by the invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChX&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/macarthur%20reports/macarthur%20v1/ch10.htm | title = Guerrilla Activities in the Philippines | work = Reports of General MacArthur | chapter = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several islands in the [[Visayas]] region had guerrilla forces led by Filipino officers, such as Colonel [[Macario Peralta]] in [[Panay]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ChX&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uprotc.org/alumni/general-macario-peralta-jr.html |title=General Macario Peralta, Jr. |author= |work= |publisher=University of the Philippines – Reserve Officers' Training Corps |accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[Ismael Ingeniero]] in [[Bohol]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ChX&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Vicente Rama reader: an introduction for modern readers |last=Villanueva |first=Rudy |authorlink= |author2=Renato E.

The island of [[Mindanao]], being farthest from the center of Japanese occupation, had 38,000 guerrillas who were eventually consolidated under the command of American civil engineer Colonel [[Wendell Fertig]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChX&quot; /&gt; Fertig's guerrillas included many American and Filipino troops who had been part of the force on Mindanao under Major General [[William F. Sharp]]. When Wainwright had ordered Sharp's forces to surrender, Sharp considered compelled to obey this order. Many of the American and Filipino officers refused to surrender, since they reasoned that Wainwright, now a prisoner who could be considered under duress, had no authority to issue orders to Sharp. For several reasons it was unknown how many did not surrender, although probably around 100 to 200 Americans ended up with Fertig's guerrillas. The names of new Filipino recruits were purposefully left off the lists of men to be surrendered. In other cases, documents were fabricated to report fewer men than were actually under Sharp. Other troops died for various reasons after getting away and others left Mindanao entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Major Larry S.

One resistance group in the Central Luzon area was known as the [[Hukbalahap]] (Hukbo ng&amp;nbsp;Bayan Laban sa&amp;nbsp;Hapon), or the People's Anti-Japanese Army, organized in early 1942 under the leadership of [[Luis Taruc]], a communist party member since 1939. The Huks armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over portions of [[Luzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=	 Dolan|first=Ronald E|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/92039812|title=Philippines : a country study|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|isbn=	 0-8444-0748-8|edition=4th|chapter=World War II, 1941–45|chapterurl=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ph0033)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, guerrilla activities on Luzon were hampered due to the heavy Japanese presence and infighting between the various groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bataan Diary |last=Schaefer |first=Chris |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Riverview Publishing |location= |isbn=0-9761084-0-2 |page=434 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including Hukbalahap troops attacking American-led guerrilla units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bataandiary.com/reviewscouts.htm | title =Book Review | first= J.

Lack of equipment, difficult terrain and undeveloped infrastructure made coordination of these groups nearly impossible, and for several months in 1942, all contact was lost with Philippine resistance forces. Communications were restored in November 1942 when the reformed Philippine [[61st Division (Philippines)|61st Division]] on [[Panay]] island, led by Colonel Macario Peralta, was able to establish radio contact with the USAFFE command in Australia. This enabled the forwarding of intelligence regarding Japanese forces in the Philippines to [[South West Pacific Area (command)|SWPA]] command, as well as consolidating the once sporadic guerrilla activities and allowing the guerrillas to help in the war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChX&quot; /&gt;

Increasing amounts of supplies and radios were delivered by submarine to aid the guerrilla effort. By the time of the Leyte invasion, four submarines were dedicated exclusively to the delivery of supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChX&quot; /&gt;

Other guerrilla units were attached to the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|SWPA]], and were active throughout the archipelago. Some of these units were organized or directly connected to pre-surrender units ordered to mount guerrilla actions.  An example of this was Troop&amp;nbsp;C, [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/macarthur%20reports/macarthur%20v1/Images/p_084.jpg Map of known insurgent activity]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Intrepid Guerrillas of North Luzon |last=Norling |first=Bernard |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location= |isbn= 9780813191348 |page=284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xL-JoQYiwykC |accessdate=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Intrepid Guerrillas of North Luzon | url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2002/june/guerrillas.htm | work=Defense Journal | year=2002 | accessdate=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other guerrilla units were made up of former [[Philippine Army#History|Philippine Army]] and [[Philippine Scouts]] soldiers who had been released from POW camps by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last of cavalrymen a true hero |url=http://www.oldgoldandblack.com/o_article/last_of_cavalrymen_a_true_hero/ |work=Old Gold &amp; Black |publisher=Wake Forest University |date=6 March 2003 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916174000/http://www.oldgoldandblack.com/o_article/last_of_cavalrymen_a_true_hero/ |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-japandialogueonpows.org/Calugas.htm My Father by Jose Calugas Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt; Others were combined units of Americans, military and civilian, who had never surrendered or had escaped after surrendering, and Filipinos, Christians and [[Moro people|Moros]], who had initially formed their own small units.

{{Main article|Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)}}

When General MacArthur returned to the Philippines with his army in late 1944, he was well supplied with information; it is said that by the time MacArthur returned, he knew what every Japanese lieutenant ate for breakfast and where he had his hair cut. But the return was not easy. The [[Imperial General Headquarters|Japanese Imperial General Staff]] decided to make the Philippines their final line of defense, and to stop the American advance toward Japan. They sent every available soldier, airplane, and naval vessel to the defense of the Philippines. The [[Kamikaze]] corps was created specifically to defend the Philippines. The [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] ended in disaster for the Japanese and was the biggest naval battle of World War II. The campaign to re-take the Philippines was the bloodiest campaign of the Pacific War. Intelligence information gathered by the guerrillas averted a disaster—they revealed the plans of Japanese General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita|Yamashita]] to trap MacArthur's army, and they led the liberating soldiers to the Japanese fortifications.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

MacArthur's Allied forces landed on the island of [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]] on 20 October 1944, accompanied by [[Sergio Osmeña|Osmeña]], who had succeeded to the commonwealth presidency upon the death of Quezon on 1 August 1944. Landings then followed on the island of [[Battle of Mindanao|Mindoro]] and around [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|Lingayen Gulf]] on the west side of [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], and the push toward [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Manila]] was initiated. The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was restored. Fighting was fierce, particularly in the mountains of northern [[Luzon]], where Japanese troops had retreated, and in Manila, where they put up a last-ditch resistance. The Philippine Commonwealth troops and the recognized guerrilla fighter units rose up everywhere for the final offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford companion to American military history |last=Chambers |first=John Whiteclay |authorlink= |author2=Fred Anderson |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-19-507198-6 |page=547 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Rzy_yNMKbcC&amp;lpg=PA547&amp;dq=guerrilla%20Philippine%20liberation%20fighting%20Japanese&amp;pg=PA547#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipino guerrillas also played a large role during the liberation. One guerrilla unit came to substitute for a regularly constituted American division, and other guerrilla forces of [[battalion]] and [[regimental]] size supplemented the efforts of the [[U.S. Army]] units. Moreover, the cooperative Filipino population eased the problems of supply, construction and civil administration and furthermore eased the task of Allied forces in recapturing the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.army.mil/books/amh/AMH-23.htm ''World War II: The war against Japan by Robert W.

Fighting continued until Japan's formal surrender on 2 September 1945. The Philippines had suffered great loss of life and tremendous physical destruction by the time the war was over. An estimated one million Filipinos had been killed from all causes; of these 131,028 were listed as killed in seventy-two [[war crime]] events.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRottman2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=World War 2 Pacific island guide |last=Rottman |first=Gordon L. |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |isbn=978-0-313-31395-0 |page=318 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyilRml0hcC&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=Killed%20philippines%20world%20war%20II&amp;pg=PA318#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. casualties were 10,380 dead and 36,550 wounded; Japanese dead were 255,795.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRottman2002&quot;/&gt;
