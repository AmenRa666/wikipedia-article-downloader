'''No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight''' was a temporary [[Royal Australian Air Force]] unit formed to participate in the [[1953 London to Christchurch air race|1953 London-to-Christchurch air race]] (also known as the Christchurch Centenary air race). The flight was established in February 1953 and was equipped with three  [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, specially modified between June and August. Following extensive training, two Canberras departed for the UK in mid-September. The race began on 9 October, and one of the flight's aircraft placed second, with a total flying time of 22&amp;nbsp;hours and 29&amp;nbsp;minutes. The other aircraft was forced out of the race when one of its tyres burst while landing at [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Island]] to refuel, but completed its flight to Christchurch after being repaired. After a brief period in New Zealand both aircraft returned to Australia to be modified back to a standard configuration, and the flight was disbanded in November.

==History==

===Training===
No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight was formed at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Base Laverton]] on 16&amp;nbsp;February 1953 to begin preparations for the RAAF's participation in the London-to-Christchurch air race. Squadron Leader [[Peter Raw]] became the unit's initial commanding officer 23&amp;nbsp;February, and held this position until May when the more senior Wing Commander [[Derek Cuming|Derek R. Cuming]] assumed command.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_148&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Cuming had been the first man to fly a jet aircraft in Australia (a [[Gloster Meteor]] in 1946), and had previously commanded the RAAF's [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|Aircraft Research and Development Unit]] (ARDU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P03702.001|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/P03702.001|work=Collection|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Services|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/fam/0967.html|work=Federation and Meteorology|publisher=Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In announcing his appointment to command No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight, Minister for Air [[William McMahon]] described Cuming as the &quot;RAAF's outstanding test pilot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55795917 |title=Air Face Flight Gets C.O.|newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=8 April 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight received its first aircraft, the Canberra bomber A84-307, on 15&amp;nbsp;June 1953.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; This aircraft had been built in Britain as the RAAF's first Canberra, and was flown to Australia by Wing Commander Cuming in July 1951. The journey had been completed in 21&amp;nbsp;hours and 41&amp;nbsp;minutes, setting an unofficial record for the route.&lt;ref name=adf-serials&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Martin|title=RAAF Canberra A84 GAF Canberra Mk.20 &amp; Mk.21, EE Canberra B.2, T.4 &amp; U.10.|url=http://www.adf-serials.com/2a84.shtml|publisher=adf-serials.com|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight's second aircraft, A84-201, arrived on 1&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; This was the first Australian-built Canberra and was assigned to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight shortly after being completed. The second Australian-built Canberra, A84-202, was also assigned to the flight in August.&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt; All three aircraft were modified for their specialised role by [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]]. These modifications included fitting distance-measuring equipment in each of the aircraft and three fuel tanks in their [[bomb bay]]s.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt; Wing Commander Cuming told journalists in August that the Australian-made Canberras were preferred to the British models on the grounds of national prestige and because the aircraft were fitted with superior navigation equipment.&lt;ref name=Rivalry /&gt;  A84-307 was retained by the flight, however, as the reserve aircraft to be used if modifications to A84-202 were not completed in time for the race.&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight undertook intensive training in the lead-up to the race. This involved making regular long range return flights between Laverton and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Singapore]] and Christchurch via various air bases in Australia. These exercises were used to establish fuel consumption rates and practice the refuelling and navigation practices that would be used in the race.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; As part of this training the flight broke many Australian and New Zealand air speed records, setting the fastest time for crossing the [[Tasman Sea]] during a flight between [[RAAF Base Amberley]] and Christchurch on 16&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57265125 |title=New Trans-Tasman Air Record. |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=17 August 1953 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aeronautical engineer was attached to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight from the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]] to calculate the optimum route for the Canberras to take.&lt;ref name=Rivalry /&gt; On 2&amp;nbsp;September Cuming and Raw visited the [[Government Aircraft Factories]] facility at [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Fishermans Bend]] in Melbourne to thank the workers who were building Canberra bombers for the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23319448 |title=Thanks a million far the Canberras. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=3 September 1953 |accessdate=11 June 2011 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and aftermath===
Selected as Australia's entries in the London-to-Christchurch air race, A84-201 and A84-202 departed Laverton bound for the UK on 10&amp;nbsp;September 1953, and arrived at [[RAF Lyneham]] on the 16th of the month. Detachments of No. 1 Long Range Flight ground crew were stationed in the UK, [[Bahrain]], [[Ratmalana Airport]] in Ceylon, [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Island]] in the Indian Ocean and Christchurch.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; The first of these detachments departed Australia for the UK on 9&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rivalry&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27525071 |title=R.A.A.F.-R.A.F.

The RAAF also supported its entrants and the aircraft from other countries by deploying an air traffic control team and specialised radar equipment to Christchurch, as well as stationing [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|P-2 Neptune]] long-range patrol aircraft at Cocos Island, [[Perth]] and [[RAAF Base East Sale]] for search-and-rescue coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;longest&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62498239 |title=World's Longest &amp; Fastest Air Race|newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Qld. |date=15 September 1953 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Australian Navy]] aircraft carrier [[HMS Vengeance (R71)|HMAS ''Vengeance'']] and destroyer {{HMAS|Bataan|I91|6}} were stationed in the Tasman Sea to provide weather reports for the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52936822|title=Two Warships At Fremantle.|newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=27 October 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51067945 |title=Open for 2 days: Can Inspect Vengeance|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=3 October 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1 LRF RAAF Canberra bomber aircrew.jpg|thumb|Squadron Leader Raw (centre) and his crew with A84-201]]

The London-to-Christchurch air race began on 9&amp;nbsp;October. A84-202, which was piloted by Wing Commander Cuming, took off from [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]] at 3:50&amp;nbsp;am. A84-201, piloted by Squadron Leader Raw, followed five minutes later.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_148-149&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the Canberras was also manned by a co-pilot and a navigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46455763 |title=Air race hopes:Ace fliers man local jets. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=30 September 1953 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft flew separately to Bahrain, where they made a brief refuelling stop, then continued to Ratmalana Airport and Cocos Island where they refuelled again. One of A84-202's tyres burst while landing at Cocos Island, putting it out of the race.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148-149 /&gt; At this time A84-202 was two minutes ahead of A84-201 and 15 minutes ahead of any of the entrants from the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Repaired Canberra&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18392868 |title=Repaired Canberra Finishes Course. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 October 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A84-201 continued and next landed at [[RAAF Woomera Airfield]] in South Australia to refuel. Its nose wheel locked up while landing due to ice accretion, but this was able to be repaired and the aircraft took off at 0:19&amp;nbsp;am, local time.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF_HS_149&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The repairs delayed the aircraft by 83 minutes, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50068300 |title=Records Broken in U.K. – N.Z.

On 10&amp;nbsp;October two replacement tyres were flown to Cocos Island to repair A84-202. The aircraft departed on the 12th of the month and flew to Christchurch via Laverton; its total flying time was 22&amp;nbsp;hours and 23.5&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt;&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_149 /&gt; Cuming later told journalists that A84-202's crew had drunk beer and gone for a swim while waiting for their aircraft to be repaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Repaired Canberra&quot; /&gt; Both Canberras later flew demonstration flights over Harewood Airport and [[RNZAF Base Auckland|RNZAF Base Whenuapai]] and returned to Laverton on 19&amp;nbsp;October. The aircraft were transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot on 2&amp;nbsp;November to be returned to standard configuration, and No. 1&amp;nbsp; Long Range Flight's overseas detachments had all returned to Australia by 6&amp;nbsp;November. The flight was disbanded on the 16th of the month.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_149 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New squadron&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52938567 |title=Air Race Crew Will Lead New Squadron. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=5 November 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of the RAAF's entry in the air race was [[Australian pound|£]]50,000, which Minister McMahon claimed was a &quot;bargain rate&quot; given the results of the air force's participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48935861 |title=&quot;Bargain Rate&quot; For Entering Jets. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=12 October 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight was disbanded, Wing Commander Cuming returned to the ARDU.&lt;ref name=&quot;New squadron&quot; /&gt; He was subsequently appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) on 31&amp;nbsp;December 1953 for leading the flight and participating in the London-to-Christchurch air race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal honors&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47581066 |title=Mrs. Menzies, Airmen in Federal Honours List|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=1 January 1954 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squadron Leader Raw was also awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] for his role in the race, the decoration being presented to him by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] at Brisbane on 10&amp;nbsp;March 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal honors&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18414101 |title=Queen's Busy 12-Hour Day|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=11 March 1954 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raw had assumed command of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]] on 18&amp;nbsp;December; this was the first RAAF squadron to be equipped with Canberra bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;New squadron&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51077020 |title=Bomber CO. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=16 December 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight Lieutenant Francis Noel Davies, who had been Raw's co-pilot during the race, and two other airmen were killed on 16&amp;nbsp;June 1954 when A84-202 crashed near Amberley.&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48126176 |title=3 Killed in Canberra Jet Crash|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=17 June 1954 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wing Commander Cuming presided over the four-man court of inquiry which investigated the cause of this accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57322758 |title=Jet Crash Victims' Funerals Today. |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=18 June 1954 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2011, A84-201 was a [[Gate guardian|gate guard]] at RAAF Base Amberley.&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt;
