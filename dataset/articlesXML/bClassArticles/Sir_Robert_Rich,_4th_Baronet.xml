He also served with the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Army]] under the [[John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair|Earl of Stair]] at the [[Battle of Dettingen]]  during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. As a [[Member of Parliament]] he represented three different constituencies but never attained political office.

==Career==
Born the son of [[Sir Robert Rich, 2nd Baronet]] and Mary Rich (née Rich, daughter of [[Rich baronets|Sir Charles Rich, 1st Baronet]]), Rich was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[Grenadier Guards|1st Regiment of Foot Guards]] and [[lieutenant]] in the Army on 10 June 1700.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23496?docPos=5|title=Sir Robert Rich, 4th Baronet|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He fought in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] at the [[Battle of Schellenberg]] in July 1704, where he was wounded, and at the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in August 1704, where he was wounded again.&lt;ref name=heath245&gt;Heathcote, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to lieutenant in the [[South Wales Borderers|Brigadier-General Tatton's Regiment]] and [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the Army, he succeeded his brother as 4th Baronet in October 1706, and was then promoted to captain in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and [[lieutenant-colonel]] in the Army in March 1708.&lt;ref name=heath245/&gt; In June 1708 he fought a [[duel]] with [[Sir Edmund Bacon, 4th Baronet, of Mildenhall|Sir Edmund Bacon, 4th Baronet]] who was wounded but survived.&lt;ref name=heath245/&gt;

When the threat of the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite rising]] of 1715 became apparent Rich was asked to raise a regiment which subsequently became known as the [[17th Lancers|18th Dragoons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=5349|supp=|startpage=1|date=23 July 1715|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That year he was also elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunwich]]. In June 1717 he was stripped of his regiment for voting against [[First Stanhope–Sunderland Ministry|the Government]] on a motion accusing [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Lord Cadogan]] of fraud and embezzlement during the transport of some Dutch troops.&lt;ref name=hop&gt;{{HistoryofParliament|1715|first=Shirley|last=Matthews|title=RICH, Sir Robert, 4th Bt.
