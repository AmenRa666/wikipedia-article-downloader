'''Aaron Cohen''' (born 28 February 1976) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]]-[[United States|American]] [[writer]], [[Film director|director]], [[actor]], [[author]] and former [[Duvdevan Unit|Duvdevan]] [[Special Forces]] operator specializing in [[counter-terrorism]] and best known for his international bestselling memoir ''[[Brotherhood of Warriors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Brotherhood-Warriors-Behind-Commando-Counterterrorism/dp/0061236160/ref=tmm_pap_title_0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and Israeli special-forces==
Cohen was born to a [[Canadian Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=Brotherhood&gt;[https://www.harpercollins.com/web-sampler/9780061859762 ''Brotherhood of Warriors''] By Aaron Cohen and Douglas Century&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was young and the family moved to Miami where his mother believed she could advance her career as a screenwriter and producer.&lt;ref name=Brotherhood /&gt; She remarried to film producer [[Abby Mann]], and moved Aaron and his sister to [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name=Brotherhood /&gt; Although raised in a non-religious household, he pressured his mother to let him get a bar mitzvah and moved to Montreal with his natural father for a year; and then spent the next several years shuttling between California, Canada, and Florida.&lt;ref name=Brotherhood /&gt; He attended [[Robert Land Academy]], a military academy in Canada, for high school.&lt;ref name=Brotherhood /&gt; After high school, Cohen left Los Angeles for Israel, working on a [[kibbutz]] before enlisting in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. After a grueling tryout process known as a “gibush”, Cohen was one of the few non-[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]] volunteers accepted into the elite ranks of the Israeli Special Forces.&lt;ref name=Brotherhood /&gt; In the mid-1990s, he became a member of the secretive undercover Sayaret (commando) unit known as  [[Duvdevan]], ({{lang-he|דובדבן}}; lit. ''cherry'') a counter-terrorist unit that runs missions targeting wanted terrorist suspects in the occupied territories of the West Bank, often while dressed as Palestinian Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-armys-elite-undercover-unit-in-training-for-a-feared-third-palestinian-intifada/&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Cohen also worked for the [[Mossad]] in their [[covert]] [[Black operation|black operations]] during his time serving in the Israeli Special Forces.

== Post military ==

After his service, Cohen returned to [[Los Angeles]] and launched IMS Security Consultants, Inc., a Hollywood VIP protection service that has done security work for Hollywood actors, VIPs, rock stars and dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/06/celebrity.security.costs/&lt;/ref&gt; IMS Security Consultants recently changed their name to [http://www.cherriesapparel.com/pages/counter-terror-school Cherries Counter-Terror School] and is a leading tactical training firm offering [[Israeli]] [[Special Forces]] style counter-terrorist and “active shooter” training to vetted members of local, State and Federal [[law enforcement]] as well as police [[SWAT]] teams and the U.S. military [[Special Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsfa.com/story/5196017/montgomery-police-departments-swat-team-learns-israeli-tactics?clienttype=printable&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen frequently appears as a national security analyst on various major news networks.

After being robbed at gunpoint in her Paris Hotel room,  it was rumored that reality star [[:es:Kim_Kardashian|Kim Kardashian]] had hired Cohen, although it has not been confirmed.

== Film and television ==

Cohen has appeared in numerous films including ''[[End of Watch]]'', ''[[Haywire (film)|Haywire]]'' and ''[[Get the Gringo]]''. In ''Haywire'', he was tapped by director [[Steven Soderbergh]] to serve as the film's technical advisor and tactical weapons trainer prepping actors [[Channing Tatum]], [[Gina Carano]] and [[Michael Fassbender]] for their roles as well as consulting on the script.

In 2013 Cohen wrote, directed, and co-starred in the short action war film ''Overwatch'', a war drama about post traumatic stress disorder and the high emotional price paid by American special operations soldiers who carry out dangerous and complex missions.

He is the stepson of the American filmmaker [[Abby Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/movies/28mann2.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;
