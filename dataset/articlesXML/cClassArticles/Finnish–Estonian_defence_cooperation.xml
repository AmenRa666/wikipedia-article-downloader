'''Finnish–Estonian defence cooperation''' began in 1930 with a secret military pact between [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]] against the threat of the [[Soviet Union]]. Open cooperation ended in 1939, as the Soviets pressured the Estonian government, but it continued secretly with [[intelligence (information gathering)|information]]-sharing during the [[Winter War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Leskinen | first=Jari |editor1-first=Jari |editor1-last=Leskinen |editor2-first=Antti |editor2-last=Juutilainen |title=Talvisodan pikkujättiläinen |edition=1st |publisher=Werner Söderström Osakeyhtiö |year=1999 |pages=127–140 |chapter=Suomen ja Viron salainen sotilaallinen yhteistyö Neuvostoliiton hyökkäyksen varalta 1930-luvulla |language=Finnish |isbn=951-0-23536-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Finnish president Svinhufvud and Estonian Konstantin Päts 1936 in Narva.png|thumb|250px|right|President of Finland [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] (left) and President of Estonia [[Konstantin Päts]] (middle) in the city of [[Narva]] in 1936. [[State visit]]s were scheduled every year. The most important negotiating issue was the military cooperation between countries]]
The origins of defence cooperation lay in the [[Baltic Entente]] of the 1920s. Practical cooperation began with the initiative of the Finnish [[general staff]] in February 1930 in [[Tallinn]], and the first joint [[Military exercise|war games]] were held in 1933. Officially both countries were neutral, but behind the scenes the relationship was more complex. [[Nazi Germany]], for example, unsuccessfully offered Estonia a secret military alliance in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot; /&gt;

Finland started cooperation only for its own defensive reasons, despite both countries speaking the same [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finnic]] languages and being neighbors. There were defense plans involving Finland launching a massive assault against [[Leningrad]] if the Soviet Union started a war against both countries. However, the plan would also have required the participation of [[Latvia]], and according to the Finnish military leader, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], the countries would have needed outside help from the [[League of Nations]]. Finland could not send troops directly to the Baltic countries, but a joint assault would have been possible through the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and/or from [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot; /&gt;

== Gulf of Finland blockade plan ==
Before the 1930s, defence cooperation between Finland, Poland, Estonia, [[Lithuania]], and Latvia was based on the [[Border states (Eastern Europe)|Edge State Policy]]. In the 1930s this cooperation decreased, when Finland and Estonia started practical military dialogue. Due to the Finnish policy of neutrality and the official trend in the [[Nordic countries]], the two nations kept their cooperation pact secret.

The Nordic trend did not officially allow [[Sweden|Swedish]] participation in managing the security of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. However, behind the scenes, the general staffs of Sweden and Finland had secretly negotiated a plan in 1929 for blockading the Gulf. Sweden agreed that it would first suggest the blockade plan to Estonia in 1930. Officially, Sweden would not participate in the cooperation, but it would supply [[materiel]] and [[auxiliary troops]] if the Soviet Union attacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot; /&gt;

== Coastal artillery ==
Practical measures by Finland and Estonia were based upon [[Peter the Great's Naval Fortress]] system, allowing surface ships and coastal artillery fire to prevent possible movements of the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot; /&gt; After the Imperial Russian Baltic fleet was mostly destroyed in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905, Russia sought to replace the loss of fleet vessels from 1912 onwards by reinforcing the coastal artillery on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. The aim was to build a barrage against the [[Kriegsmarine|German fleet]]'s potential intrusion along the Gulf to [[Saint Petersburg]], then capital of Russia. Coastal arrays of 12-inch naval guns were installed on both sides of the Gulf.

The defence cooperation aimed to prevent access by Soviet vessels through the Gulf to [[Helsinki]] and Tallinn using [[naval mine|mine]]s, [[coastal artillery]] fire and [[submarine]]s. As a result, Finland redeveloped its heavy coastal artillery and fortresses, adapting 305&amp;nbsp;mm shells to give them greater range, thus providing complete artillery coverage between [[Mäkiluoto]] in Finland and [[Naissaar]] in Estonia. The first joint military exercise was held in 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot; /&gt;

== Submarines ==
[[File:Kalev class submarine Estonia.png|thumb|300px|The Estonian submarines [[EML Kalev|Kalev]] and [[EML Lembit|Lembit]] were both manufactured in the [[United Kingdom]] and began their service in spring 1937.]]
The joint deployment of submarines was a part of the Gulf blockade plan. The Estonian submarine programme was expensive; the [[Estonian Navy]] even had to sell two [[destroyer]]s in 1933 to be able to finance the two new submarines it launched in 1937. Estonian submarines installed the same kind of torpedoes and mines as their Finnish counterparts, and Estonian naval officers were trained in Finnish submarines.&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot; /&gt;

== Radio intelligence and the Winter War ==
During the Winter War, Estonia was formally neutral, even though it had to allow the Soviet Union to [[Occupation of the Baltic states|establish military bases and station troops]] on its soil. From those military bases, the Soviet Union carried out bombing raids on Finland. As part of the coastal artillery cooperation, the countries had a common fire management system linked by an undersea radio cable. The Estonians had earlier managed to decipher the Soviet secret radio code, and they had access to [[Military communications|military radio communication]]s. During the Winter War, Estonian military staff gave the Finns top secret information on Soviet troop movements.

== Aftermath ==
The Finnish–Estonian defence cooperation pact remained secret for decades, and only came to light when the Estonian and Russian archives were opened in the 1990s. Finnish archives relating to the matter had been either transported outside the country or destroyed after the [[Continuation War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;talvisodanpikkujattilainen-leskinen&quot; /&gt;
